36926798,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655197,1732750247,Binance Data Reveals Bitcoin Profit Trends: Is the Bull Run Far From Over?,"Before its recent price correction, Bitcoin came close to hitting the six-digit milestone, achieving an all-time high of $99,645—a near 170% year-to-date increase. This notable price performance, followed by the recent price dip, has sparked discussions about the state of the market, particularly the profit-taking behaviour observed among investors. An analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost sheds light on these dynamics, focusing on realized profits and investor behaviour linked to Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Dip Triggers Alert On NVT Golden Cross—Here’s What To Watch For Are Investors Actively Taking Profits Now? According to Darkfost, tracking the profits realized by investors transferring Bitcoin to Binance can provide “valuable insights into the broader market sentiment and behaviour, especially considering Binance consistently handles higher volumes than any other exchange.” He notes that following Bitcoin’s breakthrough to a new high, there has been a noticeable increase in realized profits among the Binance cohort. This trend reflects a significant level of investor engagement, where users are capitalizing on the price surge to secure gains. However, Darkfost emphasizes that the scale and pace of profit-taking—whether aggressive or steady—could help determine the trajectory the market is headed to next. The analyst highlights that profit-taking activity on Binance has recently subsided after an initial surge. This pause in selling behaviour may suggest growing confidence among investors in Bitcoin’s potential for further gains. However, Darkfost stresses the importance of monitoring these metrics, particularly the realized profits exceeding $10 million. Significant profit-taking could indicate a cooling-off period or even a reversal in an upward trend, while a steady approach may reinforce the strength of the ongoing rally. Bitcoin Sees Rebound After recording a notable correction following its latest achieved all-time high, Bitcoin is finally now seeing a noticeable rebound in its price. Over the past few days, since the week started, Bitcoin has experienced consistent dip which dropped its price to as low as $90,000 levels yesterday for the first time in recent weeks. Related Reading: The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why However, so far, the asset is now gradually regaining its recently shedded gains. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has surged by 2.3% in the past 24 hours with a current trading price of $94,656 which bring BTC’s price to a mere 5.1% decrease away from its all-time high. Along with its price, BTC’s market cap valuation has also seen a surge. Over the past day alone nearly $80 billion has been added to the crypto’s market cap which rose from $1.8 trillion on November 26 to $74 trillion as of today.

Rexas Launchpad: Token sales are done on a decentralized infrastructure and are fully transparent. Rexas GenAI: Uses artificial intelligence to create NFTs and digital assets. Rexas DeFi: Users can trade on and swap crypto across several blockchains. Rexas Treasury: Enables users to receive compound interest on their crypto funds. Rexas Finance is CertiK-audited and already listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, with plans to launch on major exchanges at $0.20. With its relatively cheap entry price and practical use cases, RXS has large prospects for investors looking for the next great opportunity. Dogecoin still in the game Trading within the range of $0.427, Dogecoin is still a force to be reckoned with. People call DOGE the “original meme coin.” However, today, DOGE is not just a meme but a cryptocurrency with use cases. DOGE tokens are now perceived much more positively due to their enthusiastic community and endorsements from stars like Elon Musk. The use of DOGE as a payment method in Tesla’s stores, and subsequently on other platforms, also added usefulness to its meme history. Analysts expect DOGE to reach $3.25, making it a potentially good buy for people who believe in it.

It also aims to integrate the established financial system with blockchain technology, making it widely embraced by companies and institutions. Stellar grows with new tangible facts in the form of collaborations with big banks and state governments in promoting CBDCs. With the growing need for digital payment solutions around the globe, it is reasonable to say that Stellar will take up a large percentage of the market. Touted for its fundamentals, XLM has a low price and high potential prospects. NEAR Protocol: For developers by developers Trading at $6.90, NEAR is built for application developers and entrepreneurs. Due to its greater usability and scalability, NEAR has become one of the most popular blockchains for relaying decentralized applications (dApps) in the market. Some aspects of the NEAR Protocol, like sharding, are expected to make it more dynamic, faster, scalable, and more resource-efficient. Developers searching for next-generation blockchains are increasingly looking NEAR’s way. Analysts say NEAR will be in a position to appreciate quickly as more projects target its ecosystem. Conclusion Dogecoin, Stellar, and NEAR have their investment components and potential. However, in 2024 predictions, Rexas Finance has been rated higher. The token provides a more attractive entry point at $0.090, and with its presale period almost over, it’s highly likely to launch at $0.20 and afterward see a notable uptrend. RXS also promises top-notch technology apps, a reputable audit, and flexible roadmap proposals. For more information about Rexas Finance, visit their Website , X , or Telegram .

36923714,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655172,1732744814,9 Crypto Predictions For 2025: Nansen CEO Predicts Biggest Bull Run Ever,"In a thread on X, Alex Svanevik, CEO of leading on-chain analytics platform Nansen, unveiled nine bold predictions for the crypto industry in 2025. Svanevik forecasts that the upcoming year will herald “the mother of all bull markets,” propelled by technological advancements, regulatory shifts, and widespread adoption across various sectors. #1 Crypto Memecoins Will Set New On-Chain Records Svanevik predicts that memecoins—cryptocurrencies inspired by internet memes—will continue to attract retail investors to the crypto space. He anticipates these tokens will significantly boost on-chain metrics, leading to unprecedented records in decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes across multiple blockchain networks. Related Reading: From Bitcoin to Altcoins: Crypto Inflows Hit Record $3.1 Billion, Led by Spot ETFs “Memecoins continue to onboard retail to crypto—and smash onchain metrics. We’ll see new records in DEX volume for lots of chains,” Svanevik stated. “Better infrastructure, easier user experience, lower transaction fees—all these make the journey on-chain better for newcomers.” #2 A DeFi Renaissance Svanevik foresees a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi), driven by clearer regulations and the activation of revenue models within DeFi protocols. With the upcoming departure of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler on January 20, Svanevik predicts that regulatory hurdles will be reduced and institutional capital will flow more freely into DeFi platforms. “DeFi renaissance. Gary’s gone. Revenue switch = on,” he notes. “We actually have useful DeFi protocols now that tons of capital can flow into. Perhaps valueless governance tokens will accrue value.” #3 Spot Solana ETF Launch Svanevik anticipates the introduction of a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), asserting that it will outperform the launch metrics of the Ethereum ETF. “SOL ETF. And it does better than the ETH ETF did at launch.” As NewsBTC reported, discussions between SEC staff and issuers for a spot Solana ETF are “progressing,” with S-1 registration statements currently under review. Exchanges may soon file Form 19b-4 applications, initiating the official regulatory approval process. Asset management firms such as VanEck, 21Shares, Canary, and Bitwise are actively competing to launch the first SOL ETF in the United States, aiming for a debut in 2025. #4 Resurgence Of Permissioned Blockchains Svanevik predicts a comeback for permissioned blockchains, expecting them to gain significant traction this time. “Permissioned chains make a comeback, and this time gain much more traction. Watch Haven1 here. Tokenization will be a big theme for permissioned chains.” #5 Flourishing Bitcoin Ecosystem Svanevik expects the Bitcoin ecosystem to thrive both in traditional finance (TradFi) and through on-chain developments. “Bitcoin ecosystem continues to flourish—both in TradFi and on-chain (via projects like Bitlayer).” Related Reading: Inside Trump’s Crypto Holdings: $6.9M Portfolio, With One Altcoin Ready For A Major Rally #6 DeSci Will Become A New Strong Narrative Decentralized Science (DeSci) initiatives are predicted to fund groundbreaking scientific endeavors, particularly in longevity research and other frontier fields. “DeSci funds (crazy) science. Lots of crypto leaders are interested in longevity specifically and science more generally. This means more access to capital for frontier science—and probably more headlines,” Svanevik writes. #7 Crypto Accelerates AI Development Svanevik envisions cryptocurrencies playing a dual role in accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) projects and offering solutions to mitigate associated risks. “Crypto accelerates AI, but also protects us from AI. Wacky experiments with agents continue. Cryptodollars pour into AI projects.” He also highlights the emergence of cryptographic proof-of-human projects to combat bots and fake content: “More cryptographic proof-of-human projects come to market to combat bots and fake content.” #8 Enactment Of FIT21 Law Svanevik anticipates significant legislative developments with the enactment of the FIT21 law, potentially catalyzing a new era of innovation and growth in the United States. “FIT21 becomes law. The era of the American Renaissance begins.” #9 Exponential Growth For RWAs Svanevik predicts substantial growth in the market capitalization of tokenized real-world assets, estimating at least a threefold increase. “We’ll see a 3X in market cap of RWAs—on the low end. Probably a lot more. People will finally realize the full potential of crypto: Every asset will be tokenized.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $94,239.

36923116,https://blockworks.co/news/ofac-tornado-cash-sanctions-ruled-unlawful,1732743000,"Appeals court rules against OFAC, says Tornado Cash sanctions unlawful","This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . In another big win for the crypto industry, a panel of federal judges last night sided with Tornado Cash users. They ruled the US Treasury Department unlawfully sanctioned the cryptocurrency mixing service back in 2022. There’s nothing like a rare loss for the government heading into a long holiday weekend. A quick refresher: The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, claiming the mixer had been used to launder more than $7 billion in cryptocurrency. In September 2022, six Ethereum blockchain users (with financial backing from Coinbase) filed a lawsuit against OFAC challenging its authority to designate Tornado Cash as a specially designated national (SDN). A Texas federal judge eventually sided with the Treasury, ruling in September 2023 that the sanctions were permitted, as “person” is defined as an “individual or entity.” Coinbase and the Tornado Cash users appealed the decision to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which brings us to last night’s ruling. Judge Don Willett — one of three circuit judges on the panel — wrote that Tornado Cash, which operates by executing immutable smart contracts, cannot be considered “property.” It is therefore outside OFAC’s authority, he added. The Treasury has not yet commented on the decision or revealed whether or not it intends to appeal, in which case the Supreme Court could weigh in. Willett did concede that there are “real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC’s sanctioning authority.” But even so, he added, Congress is responsible for updating the legislation. Tuesday’s decision notably follows a loss in another Tornado Cash-related case. A bid from Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm to dismiss the US government’s case against him was denied last September. Judge Katherine Polk Failla rejected the defense’s narrative that the founders were being targeted simply for “ writing code .” “As I understand the charges in the indictment, the Tornado Cash enterprise was not an altruistic venture,” Failla added during a telephone conference in September. “Among other things, the indictment alleges that Mr. Storm and other Tornado Cash founders solicited approximately $900,000 in financing from a venture capital fund in exchange for an expectation that the funds would receive a share of future profits from the Tornado Cash service.” Two Tornado Cash founders, Storm and Roman Semenov, were charged in August 2023 with money laundering and sanctions violations related to their role in creating the mixing service. Storm is scheduled to be arraigned on Dec. 9, according to a scheduling ruling earlier this month. However, the latest development in the case against OFAC could impact this timeline and/or the charges. Storm’s legal team did not immediately respond to our requests for comment. That’s not shocking, given that it’s Thanksgiving Eve and a late-night ruling from a higher court may have just upended the entire case.

To read full editions, subscribe . The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge rose as expected in October, showing that prices increased 0.2% from September and 2.3% annually. The year-over-year increase is a slight uptick from September’s annual PCE figure of 2.1%. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in 0.3% higher month over month in October and 2.8% higher annually. It’s the highest annual core PCE reading since April. In the 12 months ended September, core PCE increased 2.7%. Odds of a 25-basis point interest rate cut in December increased on Wednesday’s PCE report (coming in at 66.5%, up from 59% on Tuesday). Minutes from the Fed’s last meeting, released Tuesday, showed that committee members are open to easing interest rates at a slower pace if inflation proves persistent. Still, some economists anticipate FOMC officials will pump the breaks, opting to hold off on any more cuts this year. “We’re still running a bit hot, so the result of that is we’re going to have inflation higher than target,” S&P Global chief economist Paul Gruenwald told Yahoo Finance this morning. “So, the Fed’s going to keep the foot on the break and keep rates higher for longer.” Today’s PCE report comes as the labor market continues to show strength. Initial jobless claims once again came in lower than expected last week at 213,000, marking the lowest level since April. The figure for the week ended Nov. 16 was upwardly revised from 213,000 to 215,000. Fed officials had originally expected to end 2024 25bps lower than where interest rates currently stand. But given these latest data reports, we wouldn’t be shocked if they opted to pause. On the other hand, committee members are likely starting to consider how a second Trump term is going to impact the economy, so perhaps they feel more inclined to head into 2025 a bit lower.

36921839,https://crypto.news/?p=14314521,1732741032,6 cryptocurrencies to look out for in 2025 other than Bitcoin,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Bitcoin hits new highs, these six cryptocurrencies also look set for significant gains in 2025. Table of Contents XYZ targets 33% price surge Ethereum Solana XRP Dogecoin TRON Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market experiences a resurgence and Bitcoin reaches new all-time highs, attention is shifting to other digital assets with the potential for significant returns. One such contender is XYZVerse (XYZ), a meme coin that fuses sports with meme culture, aiming to unite fans from football to eSports in a community-driven ecosystem for growth. XYZ targets 33% price surge With interest growing in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin, XYZVerse is making a bold statement as the first sports-focused meme coin, designed to captivate fans across football, basketball, MMA, and eSports. XYZ, the ecosystem’s token, offers a unique opportunity for investors to tap into the rising demand for prediction markets and the fusion of sports and crypto culture. Meme coins have dominated the crypto space in 2024, with tokens like BOME and WIF delivering thousand-fold returns. XYZ is poised to go further, with a projected 19,900% increase by the end of its presale. Starting at just $0.0001, the price of XYZ will rise to $0.1 in its fifteenth stage, giving early investors a 99% discount on what could be a breakout token. Currently in its fifth presale stage at $0.000667, XYZ is gearing up for a 33% price increase as it transitions to the seventh stage, where prices will jump to $0.001. To show the explosive dynamic of combining the energy of meme coins and the passion of sports— Polymarket reached $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election. With millions of sports enthusiasts ready to engage, the XYZVerse ecosystem is poised for significant growth and adoption. XYZ is establishing itself as a leader, with planned CEX/DEX listings, audited smart contracts, and a vetted team. The first-mover advantage positions XYZVerse as a key contender for the 2025 bull run. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for a potential 14,900% gain. Ethereum Ethereum has been a game-changer since it launched in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps. These innovations reshaped the crypto world, making Ethereum a hub for decentralized finance and more. With the shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, Ethereum became more efficient and eco-friendly. Moreover, its sharding upgrade aims to make transactions faster and cheaper, keeping it at the forefront of blockchain technology. While newer blockchains like Solana and Cardano offer competition, Ethereum’s established network and wide adoption give it an edge. Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon boost its performance, attracting more users and developers. With Ether (ETH) at its core, fueling transactions and rewarding participants, Ethereum’s potential remains high. You might also like: This week’s crypto opportunities: Buy signals for XRP, LINK, and XYZ Solana Solana is a blockchain aiming to solve the problem of scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a foundation for decentralized applications (Dapps). Its unique design allows for faster transactions and dApp development in multiple programming languages. At the heart of the platform is SOL, its native coin. SOL is essential for transactions, running programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The potential of Solana lies in its ability to handle a high number of transactions without slowing down. Unlike others, Solana doesn’t use sharding or extra layers to scale. This makes it attractive to developers looking to build high-activity projects. With current market trends, SOL could be an appealing option. While Ethereum still dominates, Solana’s speed and low fees give it an edge. As more users and developers seek efficient platforms, SOL could see increased adoption. XRP XRP is a digital currency that’s turning heads with its speed and low costs. Built on the XRP Ledger, it aims to make moving money as easy as sending an email. There’s no need for a bank account, and transactions happen quickly, without borders or high fees. XRP was created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, and started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that supports XRP, received 80 billion of these to help grow the network. They locked up 55 billion XRP and release them slowly over time, keeping its market stable. XRP stands out for its real-world uses. Its design for making seamless payments across different currencies could be a big deal for global transactions. Compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slow and pricey, XRP offers a faster and cheaper alternative. Ripple’s efforts to improve the system and provide liquidity make it even more attractive. As more people look for efficient ways to send money worldwide, XRP could be poised for significant growth.

Two software engineers, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, created it using the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. They wanted a fun alternative to the serious world of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There’s no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. At first, it was seen as a meme coin without much real value. But in 2021, everything changed. Fueled by social media and Elon Musk’s tweets, Dogecoin’s value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market cap of over $50 billion. This surge showed the power of online communities and the influence of social media on finance. While traditional investors might be wary, Dogecoin’s low price and enthusiastic community make it attractive. With its unique origin and support, Dogecoin could continue to surprise skeptics. TRON TRON is changing the game for content creators worldwide. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, TRON started as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but moved to its own network a year later. TRON’s main goal is to give full ownership and rewards to digital content makers. By cutting out middlemen like YouTube and Facebook, TRON allows creators to earn directly from their audience. This means more profits for creators and a more direct connection with consumers. Unlike other platforms, TRON offers a system where transactions are fast and fees are minimal. With the rise of decentralization, TRON offers an attractive alternative to Ethereum for developers and creators. The focus on empowering creators and building a decentralized internet makes TRX a compelling option in the current crypto landscape. Conclusion While ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE, and TRON are promising, XYZ stands out as a meme coin seeking to unite sports fans with its massive growth potential.

Hoskinson Drops Forecast For Bitcoin To Hit $500K By 2026 Speaking during a Nov. 26 YouTube live stream, Cardano creator and Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson voiced renewed optimism about Bitcoin’s future, noting that the alpha crypto has grown from “a sleeping giant never to awaken in an innovation coma to an awakened giant.” Hoskinson observed that major advancements following Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade allow a degree of programmability previously not possible on the blockchain. These innovations enable the creation of a decentralized finance layer on Bitcoin. Hoskinson thinks DeFi on the Bitcoin network will overtake that secured by all other blockchain ecosystems in the coming two to three years: “It is my belief that DeFi in the Bitcoin ecosystem will eclipse DeFi in all ecosystems in the cryptocurrency industry within 24 months to 36 months.” The crypto billionaire attributed this predicted supremacy to Bitcoin’s unprecedented scale and liquidity, explaining that “as good as Ethereum can be and Solana can be and Cardano can be, let’s be intellectually honest about this. Governments are talking about a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin alone is their entry point, and perhaps in five or 10 or 15 years, that dialogue will change.” Hoskinson expects this aspect to propel the Bitcoin price to new six-figure lifetime highs. “It is my belief that Bitcoin is going to go to a quarter million to half million dollars within the next 12 to 24 months because of the investment inflows and the great interest that has been achieved,” he opined. Bitcoin DeFi In late October, Cardano development arm Emurgo announced that it was developing a new Cardano-Bitcoin bridge based on the Grail protocol in partnership with BTCOS. Hoskinson later confirmed that the network would eventually become home to Bitcoin DeFi applications, adding, “With babel fees, Bitcoin developers can develop Hybrid Cardano/Bitcoin applications in Aiken and pay their transaction fees in Bitcoin.” During the recent live stream, Hoskinson detailed how Cardano would facilitate interoperability with Bitcoin by using wrapped BTC tokens on the Cardano blockchain, facilitated by trustless bridge mechanisms and virtual machines such as BitVM. This bridge would allow Bitcoin holders to engage in DeFi activities on Cardano without losing custody of their assets or depending on centralized exchanges.",POSITIVE,BTC,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-cardanos-charles-hoskinson-believes-bitcoin-will-go-to-500000-in-2-years/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
36921006,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655145,1732739431,"XRP Price Bullishness Continues, Analyst Shoots For $1.9 With Next Leg-Up","The XRP price is consolidating just below the $1.4 mark, but the technical structure continues to show bullish strength. Interestingly, XRP has been down by about 4.35% in the past 24 hours, reaching a 24-hour low of $1.296, according to Coinmarketcap data. According to an XRP analysis on TradingView, the technical setup is still pointing to a continued price surge. The analysis suggests that XRP could soon rally further, with a near-term price target set at $1.90. XRP Price Bullishness Continues The XRP price surge earlier this month was very unprecedented. Particularly, the XRP price surged from a low of $0.4976 on November 3 to reach a three-year high of $1.6 on November 23. This translates to a 220% price increase in over 20 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Closes Above Bull Channel, Crypto Analyst Reveals What’s Next However, since it reached this three-year high, XRP has entered a correction phase, retreating by almost 20%. Despite this price correction, XRP has largely traded above a main trendline that has propped up the price during the journey up. As it stands, technical analysis shows that the XRP price is about to bounce off or break below this trendline, which could make or do its price trajectory from here. An adherence to this main trendline would see XRP bouncing up to the upside, much like it did on November 24. After bouncing up at this point, XRP continued from a low of $1.2775 to retest the $1.54 price level again on November 24. Now, with the XRP price retesting this major trendline, the more bullish option is an immediate bounce to the upside. A break to the upside would see XRP resuming its uptrend up to the $1.9 price level. Keeping this in mind, the analyst emphasized critical price zones that could shape XRP’s trajectory in the coming sessions. The range between $1.520 and $1.620 has been identified as a crucial area where the price could encounter strong resistance in the coming sessions. Related Reading: What The 50-Day Moving Average At $0.22 Says About The Dogecoin Price What’s Next For XRP? At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.39 and is still trading around this main trend line. However, the price has yet to show a decisive bounce from this level. Particularly, current price action points to a continued consolidation in the past few hours. While the XRP price continues to exhibit signs of bullishness, there exists the possibility of a break to the downside. This break to the downside would be highlighted by a daily close below $1.38. Should this occur, XRP is likely to extend its decline with a retest of the next significant support at $1.32.

36921237,https://blockworks.co/news/btc-healthy-correction-pre-thanksgiving,1732739400,BTC sees pre-Thanksgiving lift after ‘healthy’ correction,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Bitcoin’s drop below $91,000 yesterday (those words would have spurred a double-take a month ago) felt rather substantial. Perhaps because of the anticipation of BTC hitting the six-figure mark for the first time — followed by a dip after falling just short (around $99,800). “However, bitcoin’s -8% dip over the last week barely rates when compared to the volatility during the 237 days of downward channel chop between Mar. 14, 2024 and Nov. 6, 2024,” Galaxy Digital research head Alex Thorn pointed out in a Tuesday note. Over that span, there were at least seven drawdowns larger than that, and five of 15% or more, Thorn found. Most recent BTC movements have involved coins created (via the so-called unspent transaction output metric) between $56,000 and $72,000, Galaxy data indicates. “Rather than whales from eons ago dumping coins, the sell pressure appears to be coming primarily from 2024 buyers taking profits off the back of this move towards $100k,” Thorn wrote. The Galaxy research head went as far as to say corrections are “healthy.” While the global rates environment and money supply could present headwinds for risk assets, Thorn added, there are also plenty of catalysts. In fact, there were reports yesterday that the Trump Administration could look to give more crypto regulatory power to the CFTC, potentially reducing the SEC’s influence in the segment. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment. “This move…involves expanding the CFTC’s role to include oversight of digital assets, regulating crypto exchanges and spot markets as commodities — potentially creating a supportive framework for the industry’s growth in the US,” Wintermute OTC Trader Jake O. said in an email. “Sea change.” BTC’s price was roughly $96,270 at 2 pm ET Wednesday — up 4.7% from 24 hours prior.

The RSI stands at 36.29, and the stochastic is 32.58, both suggesting the coin is not overbought. With a 6-month price increase of 108.43%, Cardano shows strong potential for further gains. The anticipated altcoin season could propel its price even higher. XRP Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Looms XRP has been trading between $1.11 and $1.69, showing strong momentum with a 24.48% gain over the past week and a massive 170.71% surge in the last month. The price is approaching the nearest resistance at $1.95. If it breaks through, it could target the second resistance level at $2.52, potentially gaining over 50% from current levels. The Relative Strength Index at 39.43 and Stochastic at 31.17 suggest there's room for upward movement before reaching overbought conditions. With the Simple Moving Averages converging around $1.45, XRP seems poised for a bullish run, especially with the anticipated altcoin season and overall crypto market optimism. Solana Nearing Breakout, Set for Gains in Upcoming Altcoin Season Solana (SOL) is gearing up for a potential breakout. Trading between $233.64 and $268.25, it's nearing its resistance at $283. Surpassing this level could push the price to $318, offering a gain of 18%. With a monthly increase of 35.76%, momentum is on the rise. The RSI is 28.89 which indicates oversold conditions and a possible upward move. The 10-day SMA is just below the current price and provides support. As we approach an anticipated altcoin season and global crypto bull run, Solana could be set for significant growth. Polkadot Surges Towards New Highs Amid Bullish Momentum Polkadot (DOT) has seen impressive growth recently, with a monthly price increase nearing 100%. Trading between $5.98 and $11.10, the coin shows strong upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index is around 32, indicating room for further gains before hitting overbought levels. The nearest resistance is at $13.37; breaking this could propel DOT toward the next target of $18.49, marking significant potential upside. The 10-day simple moving average is slightly above the 100-day average, signaling a positive short-term trend. With altcoin season on the horizon, Polkadot could be poised for substantial growth in the coming weeks. Conclusion In conclusion, while coins like ADA, XRP, SOL, and DOT may have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out as a token for those seeking the best in life, embodying luxury and success. Following successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN aims to build a community of leaders and offers exclusive benefits for early adopters.

Five affordable tokens stand out, each offering the chance for returns as high as 4,500%. This glimpse into these promising assets could reveal opportunities to turn small investments into significant profits. CYBRO Presale Exceeds $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million Multichain Next GEN DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This next-generation DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. Experts predict a potential ROI of 1200%, with CYBRO tokens available at a presale price of just $0.045 each. This rare, technologically advanced project has already attracted prominent crypto whales and influencers, indicating strong confidence and interest. In another exciting update, CYBRO has introduced a referral program. It offers 12% commissions from direct referees' token purchases, 3% from second-level referees, and 2% from third-level referees. Rewards are distributed weekly in USDT, and referees receive double CYBRO Points on their first deposit using the referral code. In addition to its token offering, CYBRO has introduced a Points system, further enhancing investor incentives. Holders of these Points will automatically qualify for participation in the CYBRO Airdrop, with token distribution tied directly to the number of Points held. The platform allocates up to 1 million Points on a weekly basis, which investors can accrue through positions in CYBRO’s DeFi Vaults. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 100 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Kaspa: A Fast Proof-of-Work Coin with Innovative Technology Kaspa is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency that uses new technology to speed up transactions. Unlike traditional blockchains, Kaspa's GHOSTDAG protocol allows blocks created in parallel to coexist and orders them in consensus. This means more blocks per second and faster confirmation times. Kaspa's blockchain is actually a blockDAG, which helps maintain security while increasing speed. Currently, Kaspa processes 1 block per second and aims for more in the future. The project includes features like reachability to query the network's topology, block data pruning to save space, and support for layer 2 solutions. Kaspa's technology may offer potential for faster and more efficient cryptocurrency transactions. Exploring Terra Classic (LUNC): A Stablecoin-Powered Blockchain Terra Classic (LUNC) is a blockchain that uses stablecoins linked to traditional currencies. It aims to create global payment systems with stable prices. Terra combines the stability of fiat money with the censorship-resistance of Bitcoin. This allows for fast and affordable transactions. The platform offers stablecoins tied to the US dollar, South Korean won, and Mongolian tugrik. The original Terra network was rebranded as Terra Classic, and its token LUNA became LUNA Classic (LUNC). The addition of ""Classic"" may refer to the Ethereum split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. According to founder Do Kwon, the challenges faced by Terra are similar to important events in crypto history. Stellar (XLM): Connecting Global Finance with Blockchain Technology Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payments network that uses blockchain to make transferring funds fast and affordable. It doesn't favor any national currency and has its own cryptocurrency, Stellar Lumens. Since 2014, Stellar has processed billions of transactions and partnered with major companies. It allows transfers of any currency type, including digital versions of national currencies and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Instead of trying to replace financial systems, Stellar aims to improve them by creating a network where different financial systems can work together. People can send money worldwide using Stellar apps, and businesses can build blockchain applications or use the network for payments and currency exchange. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators with Decentralized Technology TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to give full ownership rights to digital content creators. Developed by the Tron Foundation, it allows creators to earn more rewards by connecting them directly with consumers, without intermediaries like YouTube or Apple. TRON supports smart contracts, blockchain systems, and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, where transactions are public and traceable. By enabling anyone to create and share content without worrying about transaction fees, TRON serves as an alternative to Ethereum for developing dApps and building a decentralized Internet. Conclusion While coins like KAS, LUNC, XLM, and TRX may offer less potential in the short term, CYBRO emerges as a standout opportunity. As an advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO helps investors maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation. It provides lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Users enjoy a superior experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. With a focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO attracts strong interest from crypto whales and influencers. Its innovative approach positions it as a promising project in the current market.

36920616,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98082,1732738675,Court Declares Sanctions Against Tornado Cash Illegitimate — What This Means for the XRP Lawsuit,"In a notable development for the crypto sector, a U.S. appeals court has ruled that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), overstepped its authority when it imposed sanctions on the notorious cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash . Notably, Tornado Cash, a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer designed to enhance privacy, was sanctioned by OFAC in August 2022 under allegations of facilitating money laundering, including connections to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. However, the appeals court argued on Tuesday that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts do not qualify as property or services tied to any individual or organization, thus they cannot be blocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In the latest ruling, the court emphasized that while OFAC’s definition of “property” is broad, it does not encompass the decentralized, immutable nature of Tornado Cash’s smart contracts. “Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts (the strings of code that provide privacy) are not the ‘property’ of any foreign individual or organization, meaning they cannot be blocked underIEEPAand that OFAC exceeded its authority as defined by Congress,” the panel of judges noted. The ruling has triggered a dramatic 24-hour 436% surge in the price of Tornado Cash’s native token, TORN, which was trading at just over $18 at press time. That said, this ruling, which overturned a prior district court decision, could have significant ramifications not only for the cryptocurrency space but also for the ongoing SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit . Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, weighed in on the ruling, drawing parallels to the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple. “This week’s federal court rulings striking down the SEC’s dealer rule and Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash share a theme: Regulators don’t make law; they enforce it as written. If they want more power, only Congress—accountable to the people—can grant it.” Alderoty noted . Notably, the ruling has ignited speculation that the Ripple lawsuit may be dismissed. Courts remind authorities that their mandate is to enforce existing legislation as precisely drafted by Congress rather than to expand regulatory boundaries through expansive interpretations. For years, the pro-Ripple community has criticized the SEC for its approach of “regulation by enforcement.” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently weighed in on the broader regulatory climate, calling out the Biden administration for being “hostile” to cryptocurrencies. In an interview with CNBC, he emphasized that much will depend on who replaces SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who he described as having “led the reign of terror” over the crypto industry. Despite the challenges, Garlinghouse expressed optimism, noting that regardless of the 2024 U.S. election results, the industry will likely see more favorable conditions moving forward.",POSITIVE,XRP,ASIA | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/court-declares-sanctions-against-tornado-cash-illegitimate-what-this-means-for-the-xrp-lawsuit/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from an internet meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially considered a ""memecoin,"" its value surged in 2021, becoming one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This rise was driven by social media influence, notably from Elon Musk, and a broader interest in cryptocurrencies. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke, Dogecoin demonstrated the power of community and social media on financial markets. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition, though its abundant supply may affect its long-term value. The coin's attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on market sentiment and investor interest. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Memecoin with Ethereum Integration and Future Potential Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB began with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. Half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. SHIB's integration with Ethereum allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. Plans include a future NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system. This Ethereum compatibility and the development of new applications give SHIB potential for broader utility in the crypto space. Its position in the current market cycle may attract investors seeking emerging projects. Conclusion With DOGE and SHIB showing less short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility—governance, incentives, and staking—Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and reach new heights.

These emerging cryptocurrencies could reshape the financial landscape in 2025, offering opportunities that might surpass the familiar giants. Among these is XYZVerse, a pioneering memecoin that unites sports fans across disciplines, blending meme culture with athletic passion, and aiming for significant growth through a community-driven approach. The All-Sports Meme Token You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where degens can score big off the growing demand for meme coins Picture this: Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election – now throw in the hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports betting.

With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has been a game-changer since it launched in 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized apps. These innovations reshaped the crypto world, making Ethereum a hub for decentralized finance and more. With the shift to Proof-of-Stake in 2022, Ethereum became more efficient and eco-friendly. The upcoming sharding upgrade aims to make transactions faster and cheaper, keeping Ethereum at the forefront of blockchain technology. In the current market, Ethereum stands strong. Its move to Proof-of-Stake and plans for sharding show its commitment to growth. While newer blockchains like Solana and Cardano offer competition, Ethereum’s established network and wide adoption give it an edge. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon boost its performance, attracting more users and developers. With Ether (ETH) at its core, fueling transactions and rewarding participants, Ethereum's potential remains high. As the crypto world evolves, Ethereum continues to be a key player worth watching. Solana (SOL) Solana is a blockchain platform aiming to solve the problem of scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a foundation for decentralized applications, or dapps. What sets Solana apart is its focus on speed. Its unique design allows for faster transactions and supports development in multiple programming languages. At the heart of this platform is SOL, Solana's native coin. SOL is essential for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The potential of Solana lies in its ability to handle a high number of transactions without slowing down. Unlike others, Solana doesn't use sharding or extra layers to scale. This makes it attractive to developers looking to build high-activity projects. With current market trends, SOL seems like an appealing option. While Ethereum still dominates, Solana's speed and low fees give it an edge. As more users and developers seek efficient platforms, SOL could see increased adoption. In this market cycle, SOL's position as a fast, scalable solution makes it a coin worth watching. XRP (XRP) XRP is a digital currency that's turning heads with its speed and low costs. Built on the XRP Ledger, it aims to make moving money as easy as sending an email. There's no need for a bank account, and transactions happen quickly without borders or big fees. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company that supports XRP, received 80 billion of these to help grow the network. They've locked up 55 billion XRP to release them slowly over time, keeping the market stable. In today's market, XRP stands out for its real-world uses. It's designed to make payments seamless across different currencies, which could be a big deal for global transactions. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slow and pricey, XRP offers a faster and cheaper alternative. Ripple's efforts to improve the system and provide liquidity make it even more attractive. While market trends can be unpredictable, XRP's focus on quick and easy payments gives it strong potential in the current cycle. As more people look for efficient ways to send money worldwide, XRP could be poised for significant growth. Dogecoin (DOGE) Back in 2013, Dogecoin started as a joke. Two software engineers, Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, created it using the popular Shiba Inu meme as its logo. They wanted a fun alternative to the serious world of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. There's no maximum limit, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. At first, it was seen as a ""memecoin"" without much real value. But in 2021, everything changed. Fueled by social media buzz and Elon Musk’s tweets, Dogecoin's value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, reaching a market cap of over $50 billion. This surge showed the power of online communities and the influence of social media on finance. While traditional investors might be wary, Dogecoin's low price and enthusiastic community make it attractive to newcomers. In the current market, cryptocurrencies are gaining mainstream attention. Dogecoin, with its playful origin and strong support, might be more than just a joke. Compared to other coins, it offers an accessible entry point into crypto investing. As the market evolves, Dogecoin could continue to surprise skeptics. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is changing the game for content creators worldwide. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, TRON started as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum but moved to its own network a year later. Its main goal is simple yet powerful: give full ownership and rewards to digital content makers. By cutting out middlemen like YouTube and Facebook, TRON allows creators to earn directly from their audience. This means more profits for creators and a more direct connection with consumers. In today's market, TRON stands out with its support for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike some platforms, it offers a system where transactions are fast and fees are minimal. Users can track operations on a public ledger, adding transparency. With the rise of decentralization, TRON offers an attractive alternative to Ethereum for developers and creators alike. Its focus on empowering creators and building a decentralized internet makes TRX a compelling option in the current crypto landscape. Conclusion ETH, SOL, XRP, and DOGE are strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims to outperform PEPE and MOG with its sports memecoin, targeting 20,000% growth and community-driven success.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant price movements recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 10.14%. In the past month, it surged by 36.64%. However, over the past six months, Ethereum is down 8.59%. This shows a strong short-term bullish trend despite a longer-term decline. Technical indicators suggest Ethereum's price may continue to rise. The Relative Strength Index is 61.95, and the Stochastic oscillator is 83.69, indicating strong buying pressure. The MACD level is positive at 2.917, showing bullish momentum. The price is near the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $3358.17 and $3387.06. Ethereum faces resistance at $3770. Breaking above this could push the price toward $4242, potential gains of up to 18%. If the price falls, support lies at $2827 and then $2356, possible declines of around 10% and 24%. With the recent strong gains, Ethereum may continue to grow but is nearing key resistance levels. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has seen notable price movements recently. Over the past month, its price surged by over 30%, reflecting strong bullish momentum. However, in the last week, the price dipped by about 3%, showing some short-term consolidation. Over the past six months, SOL has gained more than 38%, indicating a solid upward trend. Based on the data, SOL's price might continue to rise. The current price range is between $233 and $268, hovering near its 10-day simple moving average of $230. The RSI is around 46, suggesting that the coin is not overbought or oversold. The stochastic indicator is also moderate at 61. The MACD level is slightly negative, which could signal a potential upward shift soon. If the price breaks above the nearest resistance level at $283, it could target the next resistance at $318, representing a potential increase of around 20%. Conversely, if the price falls below the support at $214, it might drop to the next support at $179, which would be a decrease of about 15%. Overall, the technical indicators suggest that SOL has the potential for further growth but traders should watch for key support and resistance levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has been on an impressive run over the past month, with its price increasing by 171.78%. Over the past six months, the coin has seen a 144.94% rise, indicating strong growth in recent times. However, over the past week, the price change has been minimal at 0.0255%, suggesting that the market might be consolidating after substantial gains. Currently trading within a range of $0.37 to $0.49, Dogecoin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $0.55. If it breaks through this point, the next resistance is at $0.67, potentially leading to significant gains. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.30, with a secondary support at $0.18, which could act as safety nets if the price dips. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook for Dogecoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 51.75, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator stands at 79.87, nearing overbought territory, suggesting a possible price pullback. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.00189, hinting at bearish momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.39, below the 100-day SMA of $0.42, which may signal short-term weakness. While long-term growth has been significant, short-term indicators suggest caution as the price could rise toward new resistance levels or fall back to support levels.

Despite a slight dip of 2.17% this week, SHIB trades near $0.0000257, close to its 100-day Simple Moving Average. The Relative Strength Index is at 33.64, suggesting the coin is nearing oversold territory and may rebound soon. If SHIB breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.00003077, it could gain around 20%. Pushing past the next resistance at $0.00003588 might lead to a total increase of nearly 40%. With altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run anticipated, SHIB could be poised for significant growth. Dogecoin Poised for Growth: Indicators Point to Potential Breakout Dogecoin is currently trading between $0.37 and $0.49, showing signs of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 33.07, indicating the coin is approaching oversold territory. This suggests a potential upward movement soon. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.40, close to the current price, hinting at stability. If Dogecoin breaks above the nearest resistance level of $0.55, it could target the next resistance at $0.67, which would be a significant increase. Over the past month, Dogecoin has surged by 182.75%, showcasing strong momentum. With altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run anticipated, Dogecoin may be set for substantial gains. Pepe Coin Set to Rebound as RSI Nears Oversold Levels Pepe (PEPE) has dipped 9.65% in the past week, but it's up 104.40% over the month. The price ranges between $0.00001793 and $0.00002263, close to the 10-day SMA of $0.00001915. With an RSI of 32.12, the coin is nearing oversold status, hinting at a possible upward move. Breaking the nearest resistance at $0.00002505 could push PEPE toward the next level at $0.00002975, a significant increase from current prices. Although the MACD shows a slight bearish trend, the overall indicators suggest PEPE might be ready for another surge. Conclusion While SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE may offer limited short-term gains, DOGEN stands out with its promise of luxury and success. Expected to grow by 700% before its presale ends, DOGEN follows the path of tokens like BONK and Popcat, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Joining DOGEN means becoming part of a community of leaders, with real benefits for early adopters.

Atkins is still the leading candidate for the role that Gary Gensler will vacate in January 2025, Fox Business Eleanor Terrett said via X . The former SEC commissioner is highly appreciated as a potential top pick for President-elect Donald Trump, who announced during his campaign that he would fire Gensler on the first day of his presidency. The outgoing SEC chair chose to step down and will exit on January 20. Read more: Gensler to resign as SEC chair: What happens next under Trump? Gensler’s replacement could be the pro-innovation Atkins, who was a commissioner at the securities watchdog between July 9, 2002 and August 2008. Atkins was commissioner and staffer at the agency under two SEC chairs – Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt. According to Terrett, sources at Mar-a-Lago say Trump’s transition team has the crypto-savvy ex-SEC commissioner in the lead. The thinking is that Atkins will push the pro-innovation agenda Trump’s administration and the Republican Party are eyeing. For many, this is the next step after the largely negative four years under Gensler. The SEC chair and the commission pursued a widely criticised regulation-by-enforcement approach. Gensler’s leadership also failed to provide any meaningful guidance for the industry. However, it charged multiple crypto companies – and suffered several legal blows in U.S. courts. Cryptocurrencies rose sharply after Trump’s win. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to near $100k while several altcoins, including XRP, continued higher as the outgoing SEC chair announced his resignation.

The decision marks a strategic realignment as the company adapts to the shifting European regulatory landscape. Announced back in 2016, EUR₮ aimed at introducing euro-backed stability in highly volatile cryptocurrency markets. Yet its usage has faded away: this token comprises 0.02% of the market cap of Tether’s core stablecoin, USD₮, at $27 million. Redemption Available Until November 2025 Tether is encouraging holders of the EUR₮ to redeem their tokens before November 25, 2025. It has stopped accepting new issuance requests for EUR₮, and the last token acquisition was back in 2022. This one-year window should give ample time for users to migrate off the asset. “This decision is in line with our broader strategic direction,” said Tether. The company highlighted its commitment to meeting new regulatory demands in Europe while focusing on the protection of users and ensuring market innovation. Discontinuation Due to Regulatory Challenges The main driver for this decision is the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, or MiCA, which will be in full force by the end of 2024. MiCA imposes strict requirements on stablecoin issuers, which has made them question the viability of EUR₮ under the new regime. Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino has openly criticized MiCA, describing it as a potential source of systemic risks for stablecoins. The firm’s decision reflects a cautious approach, prioritizing compliance and risk management over maintaining EUR₮ operations. Investment in MiCA-Compliant Alternatives Although Tether is retiring EUR₮, the company does not abandon support for MiCA-compliant projects. In November 2024, Them announced support for Quantoz Payments’ EURQ and USDQ stablecoins , in a round joined by industry players such as Kraken exchange and Fabric Ventures. These new stablecoins utilize Tether’s Hadron technology, a robust solution for streamlining stablecoin issuance, blockchain interaction, compliance, and anti-money laundering mechanisms. A Future-Focused Strategy Tether’s strategic shift in this direction underlines its adaptability in an ever-evolving regulatory environment; it is a company that invests in compliant innovations to offer secure and innovative solutions in tune with financial standards around the world. While riding these changes, Tether still focuses on creating an inclusive financial ecosystem, which redefines stablecoin innovation toward user-centric growth in the years to come.",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/tether-ends-support-euro-pegged-stablecoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Solana's SOL: Fueling a Fast and Scalable Blockchain Platform Solana is a blockchain platform designed for scalability, aiming to support decentralized applications with high-speed transactions. Its native cryptocurrency, SOL, plays a central role in the ecosystem by facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana's architecture avoids sharding and second-layer solutions, focusing instead on a high-capacity network that appeals to developers and investors. With its ability to handle a large number of transactions quickly, Solana presents potential for hosting products and services that require high activity levels. In the current market cycle, SOL attracts interest due to its technological innovations and the growing demand for scalable blockchain solutions. Avalanche (AVAX): Fast, Eco-Friendly Blockchain with Custom Subnets Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low fees, and rapid transactions capable of processing 4,500 transactions per second. It allows users to launch customizable Subnets, offering flexibility in creating custom tokens and blockchains. Avalanche uses a hybrid consensus mechanism combining classical and Nakamoto consensus, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain, facilitating various operations like transactions and smart contracts. AVAX, the native token, is essential for transaction fees, staking for network security, and operating multiple Subnets. With its strong utility and unique features, AVAX presents potential in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT): Bridging Blockchains with Speed and Scalability Polkadot (DOT) is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains. It allows value and data to be shared across platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token serves for governance and staking within the network, letting holders participate in development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and launched on May 26, 2020, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. With its focus on interoperability and scalability, Polkadot holds potential in the current cryptocurrency market. Chainlink (LINK): Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts to external data, APIs, and systems. It enables smart contracts to access real-world data securely. Chainlink uses a reputation system to ensure data accuracy. Oracles retrieve data, aggregate it, and deliver it to smart contracts. This process bridges the gap between blockchain and the external world. The LINK token rewards node operators for providing data and supports staking for network security. By enhancing smart contract utility, Chainlink has potential in the blockchain space. In the current market cycle, its technology appears attractive due to the increasing need for real-world data in decentralized applications. Conclusion While SOL, AVAX, DOT, and LINK may show limited short-term gains, DOGEN stands out for those seeking the best in life. Expected to grow 700% by the end of presale, it follows the success of tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. With a community of leaders, DOGEN offers real benefits and the potential for massive returns this altcoin season.

42389573,65caea7f-a8ad-4d3f-b499-16b65c509bf3,1732734649,Why Costa Rica Is Taking a Hands-Off Approach to Regulating Crypto,"Costa Rica doesn’t have any formal crypto laws. But its government and institutions are quietly letting the sector flourish.    That’s according to Jorge Eduardo Dengo Rosabal, a former deputy of Costa Rica’s Legislative Assembly who participated in the drafting of a proposed — and rejected — crypto regulation bill for the Latin American nation back in 2022.    “The best way to define the situation is that the government is carefully watching what is going on in the crypto world, but hasn't gotten its hands fully into regulation yet, although there have been some discussions around it,” Dengo told CoinDesk in an interview.    The hands-off approach is partially motivated by a desire to keep track of the various crypto experiments popping up in the Latin American country of 5.2 million people and see whether they yield positive results, Dengo said.    One such project is Pura Vida Technologies, a firm that builds bitcoin (BTC) infrastructure in Costa Rica by supporting merchant adoption, providing over-the-counter (OTC) trading services and spinning up bitcoin ATMs. Josh Pooley, the corporation’s business development manager, said that the regulatory limbo gives crypto companies a chance to prove their merits before the country makes any big decision in favor or against the industry.    “Specific members of the Legislative Assembly and of the government … they’re curious. They're watching and in regular contact.” Pooley told CoinDesk in an interview. “If we can prove that bitcoin is a net positive to Costa Rica, I think we'll see things move along a lot faster.”    Central to this state of play is Costa Rica’s constitution and civil code, explained Dengo, who is an attorney and public notary. Both documents state that, as far as private parties are concerned, any activity that is not explicitly forbidden by the law is permitted. In other words, Costa Ricans can trade and own cryptocurrencies, or provide crypto services, simply based on the fact that there aren’t any laws prohibiting it.    Costa Rica’s situation is therefore quite different from fellow Central American nation El Salvador, which under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership has adopted a regulatory framework tailored to crypto, with a focus on bitcoin as a financial asset. Nor is the regime antagonistic towards the industry in the way that the Chinese Communist Party or even the Biden administration have been. Rather, it’s comfortable with watching events unfold — and this state of affairs could persist for a while, Dengo said.    “It’s a ‘tomorrow problem.’ And by tomorrow, I mean two or three years from now,” Dengo said. “My educated guess on this matter would be that the move to regulate would probably be deeply related to the question of taxing crypto transactions.”    Legal status of cryptocurrencies in Costa Rica    The absence of crypto legislation means that Costa Ricans must rely on existing laws and institutional communiqués for regulatory guidance.    The Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) declared in 2017 that cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — could not be recognized as legal tender in the country because unlike the nation’s official currency, the colón, their monetary supplies are not controlled by the central bank. And since no other central bank in the world issues them, they cannot be treated as foreign currencies either.    This means cryptocurrencies may fall under the classification of “means of payment” and “quasi-money,” as international law firm Freeman Law has argued. Costa Rica’s labor code stipulates that assets as diverse as food or land can be used as means of payment, while quasi-money refers to highly liquid non-cash assets, like gold certificates or government-issued treasury securities.    Costa Rica only ranked 90th out of 151 countries in terms of global crypto adoption in Chainalysis’ 2024 Geography of Crypto Report, yet an increasing number of Costa Rican merchants — such as coffee shops, car washes, hotels, legal services, health and wellness centers, restaurants, tourism activities, nurseries and transportation companies — have been making use of the technology. Three provinces especially stand out in terms of adoption: the nation’s capital San José, as well as Puntarenas and Guanacaste, along the Pacific coast.     That’s not all. Cryptocurrencies, and especially bitcoin, are regularly used for real estate purposes. In fact, such transactions provide Pura Vida Technologies one of its main revenue streams. “Trading volumes at our OTC desk range from a couple hundred dollars to $750,000 a day,” Pooley said, with multiple transactions occurring each day. “My dad [Pura Vida CEO Mark Pooley], has taken point on OTC, you should see the guy's phone. It’s disgusting how many messages he receives.”    The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies across the country could be seen as supporting a quasi-money classification. However, in 2019 the BCCR published a report in which it argued that, based on the agency’s interpretation of Costa Rica’s civil code, cryptocurrencies are a type of asset that should be considered “goods” or “property.”    The Ministry of the Hacienda — Costa Rica’s tax authority — went further in a private letter ruling from August 2023. The Hacienda’s position: Cryptocurrencies are considered virtual assets for tax purposes and can be subject to corporate income or capital gains taxes, depending on circumstances. Crypto service providers such as wallet providers, miners and exchanges must comply with various tax obligations too.    Other government entities like the National Registry (which maintains a public database of the ownership of assets nationwide) are also taking steps to accept cryptocurrencies within their own frameworks, Dengo said. In the Registry’s case, he explained, the purchase and selling of assets — like motorbikes, cars or real estate — can now be noted as having occurred through crypto means as long as both parties first register the value of the transaction in colones or U.S. dollars.    “Finding a legal qualification for a crypto asset is essential, since it gives rise to the possibility of assigning a sphere of rights to the person who owns it, as well as the legal mechanisms for its protection,” Costa Rican lawyer Carlos Astorga Cerdas and finance professor Malberth Cerdas Herrera wrote in 2023. “This qualification is imperative as long as there is constitutional protection of justice, in which all people have the right to compensation for damages attributed to their person or property.”   Costa Rica’s Crypto Asset Market Law    It’s not like Costa Rican legislators have been asleep at the wheel.    A comprehensive crypto regulation bill called the Crypto Asset Market Law was introduced at the Legislative Assembly in 2022 by deputy Johana Obando Bonilla, with assistance from Dengo, as well as deputies Eli Feinzaig Mintz and Luis Diego Vargas Rodríguez. All four are members of the Liberal Progressist Party, an opposition party which holds five of the 57 available seats in the Assembly.   The bill aimed to codify the use of cryptocurrencies for the payment of goods and services in Costa Rica, but without making any of them — not even bitcoin — legal tender as in El Salvador. It tackled a range of subjects, including the legal definition of crypto assets, the registration of crypto asset service providers and their inclusion in the BCCR’s national electronic payment system (SINPE), anti-money laundering provisions and a tax regime on crypto assets.    But the bill got stuck at the commission level, meaning that most members of the Assembly haven’t had a chance to debate and vote on the proposal yet.    “The most positive aspect of the project was that it tried to regulate and define cryptocurrencies as assets that aren’t subject to taxes,” Dengo said. “But that was also the aspect that led the bill to be stopped. It was controversial for its standing on taxes. … Deputies in Costa Rica are not well versed on these matters — they do not understand how cryptocurrencies work.”  Dengo, who retired for family reasons in May before his term ended, said that he doesn’t expect any kind of crypto legislature to go through the Assembly before the next legislative elections in spring of 2026. “There is no immediate political gain in trying to bring this to the table,” Dengo said. “It’s not like the vast majority of people in Costa Rica deal with cryptocurrencies. This is a very niche subject matter.”    Down the line, crypto could end up having a particularly strong impact in rural areas of Costa Rica where financial services are limited, Dengo said. The World Bank estimated in 2021 that roughly 25% of the population was unbanked and only 22% of adults placed their savings in financial institutions.    Pooley, whose efforts focus in rural areas of the Guanacaste province, agreed. “My dream is to get this entire coastline orange,” he said, referring to the color associated with bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/27/why-costa-rica-is-taking-a-hands-off-approach-to-regulating-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a016a6ba25261244fedf380f1848a07c8b3508b3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This remarkable rally has solidified its position as one of the top-performing altcoins in the current market cycle. As the broader cryptocurrency market undergoes consolidation, Cardano continues to stand out with bullish momentum that could signal further upward movement in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leverage Remains High – Data Reveals Selling Pressure Above $93K Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting a significant accumulation of ADA by whales. According to Martinez, large investors have been aggressively buying Cardano, particularly during the weekend’s price dip, a move that underscores growing confidence in the asset’s potential. The next few days will be critical for ADA as it navigates a consolidating altcoin market poised for its next major move. Investors are closely watching Cardano’s ability to maintain its bullish structure and capitalize on the heightened interest from whales. Should the market turn favorable, ADA could set its sights on new highs, reinforcing its status as a key player in the altcoin space. With whales accumulating and market conditions aligning, Cardano’s future remains one of the most exciting narratives in the crypto landscape. Cardano Large Holders Accumulating Cardano is showing strong signs of bullish momentum as large holders, commonly referred to as whales, increase their buying activity. According to data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment, these whales, defined as entities holding over 100 million ADA, accumulated more than 130 million tokens during the recent price dip. Top analyst Ali Martinez brought attention to these metrics on X, emphasizing the importance of whale activity in shaping ADA’s market trajectory. Martinez notes that this level of accumulation is a clear signal of confidence from large-scale investors, suggesting that the current rally still has room to grow. Cardano’s price, which recently hit a multi-year high of $1.15, could see continued surges as whales add buying pressure to the market. Despite the bullish outlook, some analysts believe a retracement below the $1 mark could provide a healthier foundation for ADA’s next major move. Such a pullback would allow the market to consolidate and shake out weaker hands, creating stronger demand zones for the next rally. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Predicts $3,700 Once ETH Breaks Through Resistance With whales leading the charge and metrics indicating rising demand, Cardano’s bullish trend appears well-supported. The coming days will likely determine whether ADA can maintain its upward trajectory or if a temporary correction will pave the way for its next leg up. Investors are closely watching key levels, with optimism that Cardano will continue to outperform as the altcoin market remains in focus. ADA Testing Liquidity Around $1 Cardano is trading at $0.99, marking a 24% retrace from its recent local highs of $1.15. Despite this dip, the price action suggests ADA is testing a crucial supply zone near the $1 mark, a key psychological and technical level. Reclaiming and holding above this level in the coming days would confirm the continuation of the broader bullish breakout, signaling renewed strength for Cardano. If ADA successfully maintains support above $1, it could pave the way for a swift move back toward $1.15 and potentially beyond as the bullish trend regains momentum. This level is being closely monitored by traders and investors as a marker of resilience, with further upward price action expected if ADA demonstrates strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? However, a temporary consolidation below $1 should not be seen as a bearish indicator. Instead, such a move could allow the market to establish stronger demand zones and provide a healthier base for ADA’s next rally. Consolidation phases are often vital in sustaining long-term price trends and shaking out weaker hands. As the market evaluates these critical levels, ADA’s price trajectory will likely depend on whether it can break and hold above $1 or consolidate before the next major move.

The missing ‘CryptoQueen’ started a multi-billion pyramid scheme called OneCoin in 2014. Through international marketing by an army of promoters, OneCoin defrauded investors of nearly $4 billion. Ignatova vanished when authorities came knocking, and her whereabouts or state of being were unknown by publishing time. Frank Schneider, Ignatova’s former security advisor, supposedly said that the OneCoin founder was involved with Kremlin officials. Ex-Bellingcat investigator Yoran Tsalov also reportedly claimed that OneCoin’s financial backer traced back to ex-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Tsalov surmised that Ignatova laundered millions for Yanukovich, who was famed as being a pro-Russian leader.

Ignatova’s hiding in Russia was one of many theories surrounding her disappearance. Last week, German investigators posited that OneCoin’s CryptoQueen fled to South Africa. As crypto.news reported, German detectives, citing evidence and findings, suggested that Ignatova moved to a high-brow area in Cape Town notorious for housing foreign criminals. Her brother Konstantin visited Cape Town several times following her disappearance, further fueling suspicions. When the FBI arrested Konstantin, he declared that the CryptoQueen ran off with over $630 million to finance an escape and buy new false identities. Konstantin served three years in a U.S. jail cell after cooperating with American authorities to uncover the OneCoin Ponzi. Bulgarian police said Ignatova may be deceased, butchered on a yacht and tossed into the Ionian Sea. Her exact fate remained shrouded in mystery, but the hunt by authorities continued. In June, the U.S. State Department issued a $5 billion bounty for any information leading to her capture. Meanwhile, the judicial hammer fell on other OneCoin conspirators. OneCoin’s ex-legal and compliance chief, Irina Dilkinska, was imprisoned for four years. Another lawyer, Mark Scott, was jailed for a decade back in January.

I'm Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk's deputy editor-in-chief for features, opinion and standards.  IN THIS ISSUE:  Ethereum's blob mob  Staking on Starknet  Avalanche's big upgrade  L2 teams beam over Beam Chain  Sui suffers a brief outage  Bitcoin bridged, trustlessly  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  BEAMING OVER THE BEAM CHAIN: What's good for the L1 is good for the L2s. That's the assessment the teams behind zkSync and Polygon, two of the leading layer-2 networks running on top of Ethereum, gave of Justin Drake's proposal to overhaul the $400 billion blockchain, dismissing suggestions it would make their auxiliary networks redundant. “That's really a misconception,” said Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, the developer firm behind zkSync. “The changes that Justin announced are focused on the consensus layer, not on the execution layer. It's not going to affect the execution layer.” In addition to incorporating ZK, Drake's proposal seeks to shorten block times, which could cut transaction costs for L2s settling on Ethereum. Drake also said he wants to introduce single-slot finality, meaning blocks with transaction data could be finalized immediately, and that information would become permanent right away. “All of those things are great because we depend on Ethereum as the global settlement layer,” Gluchowski said. Brendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, also told CoinDesk he doesn’t think the Beam Chain would obsolesce layer-2s. Instead, he said, the upgrade would “make rollups work better.” However, others in the crypto community were underwhelmed by the whole plan, lamenting in particular that Drake’s five-year timeline wasn’t ambitious enough, leaving ample room for centrally-developed chains like Solana to eat Ethereum’s lunch.” Read more  SUI OUTAGE: Sui Network (SUI), a relatively new blockchain, experienced an unexpected two-hour outage on Thursday. The downtime was caused by a bug in its transaction scheduling logic, which led to its validator network crashing. The issue was resolved, the network said. Blockchain outages can take place for a plethora of reasons, ranging from a 51% attack to technical errors. A common error is that of nodes - or individual entities that process transactions - being unable to sync with each other, causing the blockchain to go offline. Software bugs may be another error vector, where outdated code can render the network's processes inoperable. Read more  STAKING ON STARKNET: Starknet has become the first major rollup blockchain running on top of Ethereum to let users earn money by staking their tokens and validating transactions. (Metis was the first layer-2 to do so but is far smaller and is an ""optimium,"" a different kind of L2.) Now, anyone who has at least 20,000 STRK tokens (roughly $12,000 at recent prices) can pledge the asset as collateral and earn rewards for validating transactions. Users with less than 20,000 STRK can delegate their tokens to validators to stake on their behalf. (Validators that behave maliciously or neglect their duties stand to forfeit staked tokens.) Validators and delegators that want to withdraw staked tokens must wait 21 days to receive them as well as any rewards earned from staking. Implementing staking on Starknet is part of a multiphase plan. During this first phase, StarkWare, the company developing Starknet will study staking habits on the network, and from there will assess whether and how its validators can be given the additional responsibilities of creating and ""attesting,"" or confirming, blocks in the protocol. Read more  AVALANCHE'S BIG UPGRADE: Avalanche, the eighth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), is moving ahead with a major technical makeover. The Avalanche9000 upgrade went live in a test network environment Monday, bringing the changes one step closer to the main network. Avalanche9000 will be the largest upgrade that Avalanche has seen. It is designed to cut the costs of sending transactions, operating validators and building apps on the network, whose native token (AVAX) is the 11th-largest cryptocurrency, with a $16 billion market cap. The foundation is trying to attract developers to Avalanche and encourage users to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets. Somewhat confusingly, subnets are now officially referred to in the Avalanche community as ""L1s,"" even though they are roughly analogous to the layer-2, or L2, networks that augment Ethereum and other blockchains. (Avalanche's ""primary network,"" the equivalent of a layer-1 in other ecosystems, is considered a subnet.) The team is hoping to bring Avalanche9000 to mainnet by yearend. Among other changes, 9000 would allow for a new type of validator with which anyone can launch their own subnets. Read more  ONE-WAY TICKET: BitcoinOS, a smart contract project led by crypto O.G. Edan Yago, has executed what it bills as the first trustless bridge transaction for any blockchain. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, a nominal amount of bitcoin (0.0002 BTC, about $19 and change) was locked up on the main blockchain's testnet, and a proof was generated minting tokens on the testnet for Merlin Chain, a layer-2 network. No oracle or custodian was involved, according to BitcoinOS. For now, however, Merlin Chain is like the Hotel California or a roach motel for the bridged BTC. ""This is one half of the bridge showing the ability to bridge assets from Bitcoin to an EVM,"" BitcoinOS said in a press release. ""Once the other half of the bridge is completed, Merlin Chain users can settle their Bitcoin-pegged assets back to the mainchain by proving that the tokens were burned.""  Ethereum's Blob Mob  Usage of binary large objects, or blobs, has surged on the Ethereum network, signaling that more users are embracing layer-2 scaling tech for faster and more affordable transactions.  This year, Ethereum's Dencun upgrade introduced blobs, which allow large chunks of data to be temporarily attached to transactions, and later deleted after the data is verified. (You can think of a blob as a sidecar that rides along with a motorcycle for a time but eventually gets detached and discarded.) Layer-2 protocols such as BASE, Arbitrum, and Optimism use blobs to bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then post them to the Ethereum main chain for verification without permanently gumming up the works.  The number of blobs posted to the network consistently averaged more than 21,000 this month, matching the record activity seen in March, according to pseudonymous data analyst Hildobby's Dune Analytics dashboard.  Posting blobs costs a fee, which fluctuates depending on network conditions. The fees are paid in Ethereum's native token ether, and are burned just like regular transaction fees, taking supply of ETH off the market, a positive for the coin's price.  In this way, blobs mitigate the much-discussed cannibalization of the main chain by L2.  The blob base submission fee spiked as high as $80 on Monday, the highest since March, and the average number of blobs posted in each Ethereum block rose to 4.3. More importantly, blob fees have burned over 214 ETH worth $723,000 over the last seven days, the sixth largest source of fee burns on the network over that period, according to data from ultrasound.money.

Just a few days ago, Bitcoin was as close as it has ever been to reaching $100,000 per coin - the digital coin traded above $98,000 on 25 November 2024. Although currently going back a few steps, this crypto fluctuated around $92,000 at the time of writing. However, the experts believe that crossing the threshold is just days away. As the pioneer of digital currencies, Bitcoin is used for various tasks today, from payments in shops to spinning the reels and rolling the dice in some of the best crypto casinos . But why is this step for Bitcoin so important that it has shaken up the crypto world? Moreover, what happens when BTC hits $100,000? Would it have an effect on other cryptocurrencies? Let’s find out! The Math Behind Bitcoin Everyone in the crypto world knows one thing for sure - Bitcoin is limited to 21 million coins! No matter how much you want that to change, the math is nonnegotiable. However, what crypto traders forget is that the more the price rises, the harder it will be to deplete the BTC stash. Simply put, at its current price, purchasing a Bitcoin is practically impossible for most people. That’s why the option to get a smaller piece of the cake is always on the table. That way, people will keep purchasing Bitcoins for years to come. Why Is Bitcoin Rising Now? Bitcoin was invented in 2008 - around 16 years ago. So why did it take the coin that long to reach this threshold? Why now? Let’s go over a few factors. Lenient Crypto Policies More and more countries are opening up their doors to cryptocurrencies. Whether for in-store purchases or online gaming, the legal regulations allow crypto to be used as a payment method. Just days ago, a court in Shanghai ruled that holding crypto is legal, prompting a lot of other countries to reconsider their stance on crypto. On the other side of the world, the US is inching closer to a new presidency and, with that, a new view on cryptocurrencies. The president-elect, Donald Trump, has positioned himself as pro-crypto, vowing to enact policies that would benefit the digital coin market, such as establishing a national crypto stockpile, mining BTC just in America, and firing the SEC chairman, Gary Gensler. Potential Liquidation of $1 Billion Bitcoin Shorts It’s expected that once BTC hits the $100K mark, there will be $1 billion worth of Bitcoin short released to the public. Considering this is based on previous events (with the $75,000 price jump on BTC), these are not baseless assumptions. With the liquidation, a substantial amount of selling pressure will be lifted, allowing people to purchase more crypto and for its price to rise. Bitcoin’s Monetary Power As mentioned, BTC’s reach has spread over the last 16 years. From a simple digital coin that could only be traded, Bitcoin is a synonym for online transactions today. You can use it to buy products in-store or online, play games, pay for trips, and more. It all comes from the fact that Bitcoin is anonymous, secure, and within a constantly rising cycle. Accessibility Bitcoin is now accessible to anyone. With a few clicks of a button, you can choose a crypto platform and trade in your fiat for digital coins. The option to buy as little as $1 worth of BTC makes the asset available to literally everyone. Moreover, with Bitcoin ETFs, people get crypto coins as part of their trading portfolio, retirement plans, pension funds, and more. How Does Bitcoin’s Rise Influence Other Coins? Since Bitcoin is the first thing every crypto enthusiast and layman connects when you mention cryptocurrencies, it’s only natural that the coin’s rise would influence other crypto. By retracting from its upward climb, BTC caused one of the largest liquidations so far (that is still ongoing). According to Coinglass, at the time of writing, in the last 24 hours over $567 million coins were liquidated. Ether reached $89.36 million, DOGE reached $33.54 million, while Solana came to $24.64 million. What’s more, the surge and drop of Bitcoin prompted many traders to get back in the game and re-invest in digital coins. Many are still hoping that this downfall will present a chance for them to profit at the moment when the threshold is passed. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin? If Bitcoin can reach $100,000, then the question is, “Just how high will it go?” The answer is simple: nobody knows. Yes, there is a preset amount of BTC, but the value of the coin has no limit. As long as people keep purchasing the crypto and its acceptability grows, both legally and socially, BTC’s limit is just the (metaphorical) sky. However, it’s good to pay attention to previous events. Passing milestones like $50,000 and $75,000, Bitcoin has always followed a certain resistance from the masses, dragging its price down. Thus, it’s safe to assume that this could happen yet again. That being said, the coin has managed to surpass these setbacks - evident by the $100,000 mark. As a cryptocurrency, Bitcoin will fluctuate, but its bullish nature has been persistent so far, laying the foundation for a surge even beyond $100,000.

In a world where virtual communication often dominates, BitAngels is breaking the mold. As a premier investor consortium, it’s redefining Web3 innovation with a bold strategy: live pitching forums and in-person networking. This approach is about more than just shaking hands—it’s about building trust, sparking meaningful dialogue, and accelerating blockchain and Web3’s dynamic growth. Founded in 2013 by blockchain pioneers Michael Terpin and David Johnston, BitAngels emerged as a response to the chaotic early days of cryptocurrency investment. Their vision was simple yet revolutionary—blend the global reach of digital tech with the irreplaceable impact of face-to-face interaction. This hybrid model has not only reshaped funding for Web3 ventures but also set a gold standard for transparent, merit-based capital allocation. Live events hosted by the firm aren’t just about pitching—they’re opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors to connect on a deeper level, share ideas, and form lasting partnerships. While the blockchain industry thrives online, entrepreneurs at the events gain the rare opportunity to gauge immediate reactions, receive direct feedback, and refine their vision in real-time—advantages that no Zoom call can replicate. “Digital platforms are great for introductions, but nothing beats the authenticity and trust built through in-person interactions,” a BitAngels representative explained. “These moments create the foundation for collaborations that last well beyond a single pitch.” Collaboration Meets Innovation: How StratEx Framework is Driving DeFi Growth One shining example of BitAngels’ impact is StratEx , a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that’s turning heads across Web3. During Thailand Blockchain Week, StratEx stole the spotlight at a BitAngels-hosted pitching competition in Bangkok. Jack Hartley, the project’s Head of Business Development, delivered a pitch that combined strategic clarity, authenticity, and a proven track record—earning StratEx first-place honors. StratEx is more than just another DeFi protocol. It addresses critical inefficiencies in traditional financial systems with advanced liquidity management solutions and robust governance mechanisms. By making these tools user-friendly and transparent, StratEx is paving the way for DeFi adoption at scale. Thanks to the exposure and resources gained through BitAngels, StratEx has accelerated its development and strengthened its foothold in the market. BitAngels’ Strategic Blueprint for the Web3 Ecosystem StratEx’s success story showcases how BitAngels can act as a launchpad for transformative projects, potentially catapulting DeFi into the broader Web3 ecosystem. By connecting innovators with top-tier investors, BitAngels fosters the kind of groundbreaking ideas that could reshape how finance operates worldwide. For instance, many believe this emphasis on collaboration could serve as a bridge for DeFi to integrate with mainstream financial systems. By attracting diverse stakeholders and generating buzz around innovative solutions, BitAngels helps position DeFi not as a fringe experiment but as a legitimate alternative to traditional banking frameworks. This could open doors for broader regulatory acceptance and institutional investment, further validating the sector’s potential. However, there’s a flip side. Critics argue that the high-profile nature of these events could inadvertently harm the DeFi space by attracting opportunistic projects or amplifying hype over substance. Some worry that the competitive nature of live pitches could encourage startups to overpromise or prioritize flashy presentations over sustainable development. If poorly vetted initiatives gain traction, they could erode trust in the ecosystem and divert resources away from genuinely impactful solutions. Ultimately, whether BitAngels’ model delivers on its promise or falls short will depend on the integrity of its curation and the community’s collective commitment to long-term innovation over short-term gains. Despite these risks, BitAngels continues to champion a balanced approach, blending technological innovation with human connection. “The value of in-person engagement aligns perfectly with our mission,” co-founder Michael Terpin stated. “We’re not just investing—we’re building a community where blockchain innovation and collaboration thrive.” As Web3 technologies evolve, BitAngels’ approach highlights an essential truth: even in a digital-first world, human interaction is critical to the progress of technological ecosystems. With engaging initiatives that spark connections within the Web3 community, the company aims to remain a driving force in blockchain’s journey—balancing bold innovation with the careful stewardship the Web3 industry needs to flourish.

In September, European Parliament President Ursula Von der Leyen proposed a list of commissioners. While crypto did not stand out as a core topic amongst the roles, this group will be responsible for ensuring digital asset rules are implemented.  The European Union (EU), a bloc of 27 nations, was the first major jurisdiction in the world to establish a bespoke crypto legislative package last year, otherwise known as the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation (MiCA). Stablecoin rules came into force in June, while the rest of the rules are expected to come in force by December.  ""I don't expect a big legislative agenda in the blockchain space and in the digital space per se, over the next year or so,"" said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation.  Though no commissioner role is solely dedicated to crypto, the EU still has to ensure MiCA is being followed. Some commissioners will have digital assets fall within their remit as the nation advances its crypto rules, Foster said.  ""What the industry is really wanting is the EU to continue to discuss with its international partners and ensure that the rules that are being developed across the globe are to the extent possible, interoperable, consistent, and have the same goals,"" Foster said.  The commissioners have also been tasked with exploring whether or not more regulation is needed.  ""According, to MiCA, we are also required to present a report on the latest developments with respect to crypto assets, including an assessment of the necessity and feasibility of regulating decentralized finance activities, lending and borrowing of crypto assets, as well as non-fungible tokens,"" said Marcel Haag, director of Horizontal Policies at the European Commission, at a Crypto Council for Innovation Forum last week.  They will also have to decide whether or not to terminate the Distributed Ledger Technology pilot or make it permanent and review a proposal for establishing a legal framework for the digital euro, a central bank digital currency issued by the European Central Bank.  The commission is also set to launch a legal analysis on the suitability of member states' legislation for financial asset tokenization, Haag said.  Read more: MiCA, EU’s Comprehensive New Crypto Regulation, Explained  The Commission  The EU commission is the executive branch of the EU. Each member state has to select one person to form the commission.  Von der Leyen, who asked for a balanced gender group of commissioners, had the task of choosing what roles each person will take on for the next five years. People were appointed for roles on trade, climate, technology, economy, international partnership, finance and more.  Each commissioner will have their own focus, but Von der Leyen said in her mission letters the priorities are not standalone and will affect each other.  Plus, crypto is a trans-sectoral topic, Faustine Fleuret, president of industry group ADAN that focuses on Web3 said, adding that they could ""engage with everyone"" in the commission when it comes to the sector.  Commissioners from Portugal, Finland and France will likely have some purview over crypto.  Stéphane Séjourné  France's Stéphane Séjourné has been chosen to be the executive vice-president for prosperity and industrial strategy, as well as the commissioner for industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the single market.  This job would include improving access to finance, simplifying the regulatory environment and promoting innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises. He will also oversee a project called the ""horizontal single market strategy"" that will require him to address barriers to the movement of goods and services abroad. His role could bring crypto under his oversight, Fleuret said.  Fleuret said she could see the industry pushing Web3 interests and positions on ""trade and economic safety, finance, the capital market union, innovation and research"" to Séjourné.  ""We had previous relations with Stéphane Séjourné during the MiCA negotiation, and at that stage, he was quite open to innovation,"" Fleuret said, adding that he believed in regulating the sector but knew not to hamper crypto with rules that were too strict.  Maria Luís Albuquerque  Portugal's Maria Luís Albuquerque will be the commissioner for financial services and the savings and investment union. Her work will include ensuring rules for the financial sector are enforced and improving the EU's supervisory system. She will work on improving digital finance and payments.  Plus, Albuquerque will ensure the enforcement of the anti-money laundering package that targets large cash payments, crypto firms and more.  The EU has been considering doing a MiCA 2.0 to address issues like crypto staking, lending and decentralized finance.  ""If the commission were to come up with new legislation specifically for digital assets, it would most likely be the Portuguese Commissioner Albuquerque,"" Foster said.  She might have to coordinate and get input from one of the executive vice presidents, which would most likely be Séjourné, Foster added.  ""She has a background in financial services. She's a former finance minister... So she's very experienced in traditional finance,"" Foster said. Her crypto views were not available online.  Henna Virkkunen  Another figure the industry thinks is important to watch out for is Finland's Henna Virkkunen.  ""We also think that one really important portfolio will be the one of Henna Virkkunen, who will be in charge of tech, sovereignty, security and democracy, because of all the related topics within Web3,"" Fleuret said.  Virkkunen's role will include boosting artificial intelligence innovation, looking at how digital technologies will enhance law enforcement capabilities, strengthening cybersecurity and taking enforcement action using the Digital Services Act where necessary to promote online safety. She will also have to work with Séjourné.

36916852,https://finbold.com/?p=215449,1732731092,Is this time different? Expert explains why altcoins are underperforming,"Altcoins have been underperforming this cycle, raising doubts on whether this time will be different from previous altseasons. A crypto expert and onchain analyst provided one explanation of why it could be happening, looking at market dynamics. Previously, a market bull cycle was made of Bitcoin ( BTC ), reaching new highs and money rotating to altcoins. This dynamics created what analysts call an “altseason,” when other cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin, sending its market dominance downwards. On November 27, Ki Young Ju, CEO and analyst at CryptoQuant , noted that altcoins’ market cap lags behind that of Bitcoin. According to him, this is caused by a significant change in the demand for Bitcoin – away from spot exchanging. “Compared to the last cycle, the nature of capital flowing into Bitcoin has shifted. The altcoin market cap below its previous ATH indicates reduced fresh liquidity from new exchange users. For altcoins to reach a new all-time high market capitalization, they will require a significant influx of fresh capital to crypto exchanges.” – Ki Young Ju Bitcoin Market Cap vs. Altcoin Market Cap. Source: CryptoQuant / Ki Young Ju Why is an altcoin season delayed, and what’s next from here? Since 2023, BTC volume and demand have been higher at derivatives like futures, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR) convertible bonds strategy. As Ki explained, the higher volume of traditional finance products makes capital rotation to crypto-native assets harder and slower. Not only that, but the investors’ profile is also different. People who buy ETFs and MSTR stock to gain exposure to Bitcoin are not the same ones who buy BTC spots or other cryptocurrencies in decentralized finance (DeFi). “Unlike crypto exchange users, institutional investors and ETF buyers have no intention of rotating their assets from Bitcoin to altcoins. While institutional investors might allocate funds to major altcoins via ETFs or investment vehicles, minor altcoins still rely on crypto exchange users to buy them.” – Ki Young Ju Therefore, altcoins must find different ways of attracting fresh capital to the crypto landscape, not relying on Bitcoin’s surge. “Altcoins should focus on developing independent strategies to attract new capital rather than relying on Bitcoin’s momentum,” CryptoQuant CEO concluded. This time might not be that different Nevertheless, other analysts have shown a more optimistic outlook regarding altcoins and the altseason cycle. As Finbold reported , TechDev highlighted an ongoing pattern from the previous two cycles that could have started this week. According to him, the last two altseasons started after three consecutive weekly closes above the last Bitcoin weekly high. This pattern is in play right now, with the third consecutive week closed last Sunday. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) price and the Bitcoin Dominance Index (BTC.D) – Weekly chart. Source: TradingView / TechDev In the meantime, Alex Svanevik predicts 2025 to be “ the mother of all bull markets ” and Miles Deutscher expects “ the biggest crypto bull run ever .” While Ki Young Ju believes that only a few altcoins will shine this cycle, Alex Becker seems to agree, looking at utility altcoins as “ the easiest and surest ” upcoming growth potential.

36916719,https://blockworks.co/news/flashbots-block-building-network-mev,1732730400,Flashbots’ BuilderNet to address Ethereum block builder centralization,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Blockchains sell blocks. A complex market of actors are paid to assemble those blocks, but a part of that market — specifically block builders — is a duopoly between two players (Beaverbuild and Titan). Source: Mevboost.pics This duopoly is bad for various reasons, but chiefly in regard to maximal-extractable value (MEV). MEV is believed to be monetary value that the end user creates, so returning it to them is ethically preferable. But when a few block builders dominate block building, that creates maximal value extraction that is suboptimal for the Ethereum end user. To mitigate this, the Flashbots team announced today BuilderNet , a new block building network designed to return more MEV and gas fees to users. Operating alongside Nethermind and the same Beaverbuild, BuilderNet looks to split up the presently “monolithic process” of block building. This division of labor would allow existing stakeholders such as block builders, searchers and dapps to join a “multioperator network” and concurrently run the same block builder together. When blocks are assembled, rewards are then refunded back to stakeholders based on the amount of market value they’ve contributed to a block. With BuilderNet, any application can permissionlessly and privately submit transaction order flow to a block builder and be paid for it on a pro rata basis. Transactions stay private since the BuilderNet network will run in a “ trusted execution environment ” (TEE), an encrypted secure enclave that allows data to be processed without revealing order flow data. Operators will also be able to permissionlessly deploy a block builder in BuilderNet. According to official docs , this will enable an “even playing field where independent searchers can receive the same financial outcomes and privacy that integrated searcher-builders do today.” BuilderNet in effect looks to thwart current industry practices in the block builder market that have sought to internalize MEV from end users. These include exclusive MEV revenue-sharing agreements between apps/wallets and block builders. Another way block builders have sought to capture greater MEV is vertical integration within the MEV supply chain. The Titan block builder, for instance, launched its own relayer back in April 2024 that only accepted its own blocks, thereby defeating the entire purpose of the offchain proposer-builder-separation (PBS) that Flashbots’ MEV-boost software introduced. Though BuilderNet will primarily benefit the Ethereum L1 today, it eventually plans to be available for decentralized sequencing on L2s through Rollup-Boost , the block building platform that will be used on Unichain.

With the emergence of 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) as a formidable competitor, Dogwifhat (WIF) holders and crypto enthusiasts are taking note of its potential. Promising an astonishing 2000X return, RUGRAT is positioning itself as the next big thing. For those eager to capitalize on this opportunity, early adoption is key. Dogwifhat’s Market Position and Recent Surge Dogwifhat (WIF), a Solana-based memecoin, recently achieved a 15% price appreciation following its integration with Robinhood. This listing marked a significant milestone, expanding WIF’s visibility and accessibility. Trading metrics reflect this surge, with WIF’s price reaching $3.655 and daily trading volume increasing by 50%. This uptick in activity underscores growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors. WIF’s market structure is currently robust, showcasing higher lows and strong support levels. Its RSI readings remain neutral despite recent gains, suggesting room for further upward momentum. However, even with these promising indicators, competition from new entrants like RUGRAT has prompted WIF holders to diversify their portfolios. Why 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) Is a Game-Changer 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) is not just another memecoin; it’s a project designed to disrupt and redefine the market. Combining deflationary tokenomics, staking incentives, and NFT integration, RUGRAT offers a comprehensive ecosystem that goes beyond viral appeal. Its early success is evident in the 1000% rally since launch, and analysts predict this is just the beginning. Key features driving RUGRAT’s appeal include: Deflationary Model: Limited supply mechanisms increase token scarcity, boosting value over time. Staking Rewards: Attractive APY rates encourage long-term holding, stabilizing the ecosystem. NFT Ecosystem: Innovative NFT utilities cater to collectors and investors alike, broadening its market reach. How to Buy $RUGRAT Before Listings Early adopters have the best chance to maximize returns, especially before major exchange listings.

Why Dogwifhat (WIF) Holders Are Interested in RUGRAT WIF’s rise has been impressive, but RUGRAT’s potential for exponential growth is drawing attention. Many WIF holders see RUGRAT as a complementary investment, offering diversification and the possibility of substantial returns. The Robinhood listing for WIF validated the memecoin sector, and RUGRAT’s upcoming listings could similarly ignite interest and drive demand. Conclusion The battle between Dogwifhat (WIF) and 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While WIF continues to perform well, RUGRAT’s innovative approach and early momentum position it as a strong contender. With a 2000X potential and upcoming listings, RUGRAT offers a unique opportunity for savvy investors.

Crypto Firm CEO Predicts Explosive Growth,"A prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space made a bold prediction that Bitcoin could hit a total market capitalization of $15 trillion in the next four years. Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead said that global blockchain adoption still lags compared to other global financial assets, saying that blockchain’s untapped potential could drive Bitcoin to an exponential growth in its market capitalization. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes Explosive Growth: Over 200% Surge Ahead, Analyst Says Bitcoin And The $740,000 Target The Pantera executive believes that Bitcoin price could soar to $740,000 per coin, something the CEO said would happen in the next four years. Morehead said that the price surge will be fueled by the growing technology adoption in the financial sector, adding that “blockchain remains largely untapped.” If Bitcoin reaches the $740,000 mark, Morehead predicted that the firstborn cryptocurrency’s total market capitalization could reach a whopping $15 trillion. Pantera Capital CEO predicts Bitcoin at $740K Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, highlighted in a letter to investors that the firm’s Bitcoin fund, launched in 2013, has delivered a 132,118% lifetime return, Bloomberg reported. Morehead predicts Bitcoin could eventually reach… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) November 26, 2024 Some might think that $15 trillion is an exaggerated figure but it is not, according to the crypto executive. Morehead explained that a $15-trillion market capitalization for BTC is still modest, pointing out that global financial assets have a market capitalization of $500 trillion. Financial Wealth Needs Tech Morehead did not pluck his forecast out of thin air, saying that is based on the fact that financial wealth needs technology. The crypto executive pointed out that around 95% of financial wealth is not yet engaging in technology. Many analysts see blockchain technology revolutionizing the financial sector. Morehead said that the financial wealth industry is at the early stages of a “massive transformation.” “95% of financial wealth has not addressed blockchain. They are just beginning this massive transformation now. When they do, Bitcoin might be at something like $740,000/BTC,” he noted. Morehead said Bitcoin could reach a $15 trillion market cap as early as April 2028. However, he cautioned that hitting this market cap level might take a few years more than April 2028, citing the price trend’s unpredictability as the main driver of Bitcoin’s valuation trajectory. As of writing, Bitcoin is being traded at $93,785 per coin with a total market capitalization of $1.8 trillion. Bitcoin: Historical Growth Morehead said that historically, there are three orders of magnitude in BTC’s price surge, pointing out that another price growth is possible. He noted that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are compelling investments because digital assets have high potential returns relative to their risk profile. “The expected value of the trade is the most compelling I have seen in almost 40 years of doing this,” he added.

With its innovative features, rapid growth, and promising future, RUGRAT has become the go-to investment for those seeking parabolic gains. Popcat’s Struggle and Decline Popcat (SOL), once a star in the meme coin sector, has seen its price decline by over 8% in the last 24 hours, currently trading at $1.34. This drop is part of a broader weekly downturn, with the token losing over 26% of its value in just seven days. The decline is largely due to bearish market momentum and significant selling pressure, pushing Popcat to test its key support level at $1.2475. If Popcat fails to hold above this support level, the next potential floor could be as low as $0.9256. Despite some optimism that a rebound might occur, technical indicators like the MACD and RSI suggest that bears still control the market. The RSI, hovering near oversold territory, hints at a potential buying opportunity, but momentum remains weak. The Rise of 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) As Popcat falters, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) is capturing the imagination of meme coin enthusiasts and whales alike. The token has achieved significant traction since its launch, with its price soaring thanks to a combination of deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and NFT integrations. These features set RUGRAT apart from its competitors and position it as a serious rival to established players like Popcat. Whales are particularly drawn to RUGRAT’s robust potential for gains. The token’s relatively low market cap allows for exponential growth, and its innovative ecosystem ensures long-term utility. Unlike many meme coins, which rely solely on hype, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) offers tangible value through its staking program and unique NFT-based rewards. Why Whales Are Moving to RUGRAT Massive Upside Potential: RUGRAT’s early-stage growth offers significant room for price appreciation. Innovative Tokenomics: The deflationary structure and staking incentives create a sustainable model for long-term growth. Community Engagement: A strong and rapidly growing community drives organic adoption and market visibility. A Changing Landscape The shift from Popcat to 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) reflects a broader trend in the meme coin market. Investors are no longer content with tokens that rely solely on virality; they want projects with utility and scalability. RUGRAT’s unique blend of meme culture and blockchain innovation makes it a perfect fit for this new era. Conclusion The aggressive move of whales from Popcat (SOL) to 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) signals a broader trend in the meme coin market. Investors are now prioritizing tokens that combine innovation with community-driven growth. While Popcat remains a notable player, its reliance on hype without tangible utility has left it vulnerable to competitors like RUGRAT. With its deflationary tokenomics, staking incentives, and NFT ecosystem, RUGRAT has redefined what it means to be a meme coin. If this trend continues, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) could not only outperform Popcat but also set a new standard for the next generation of meme coins. Investors looking to capitalize on this shift should act swiftly, as early movers often enjoy the largest rewards in high-growth markets like crypto.

Litecoin (LTC) saw a promising jump to $75 following news of a potential Spot ETF, but after a brief rally, it corrected to $68.84 before settling at $91. Meanwhile, VeChain (VET) continues to struggle despite broader market optimism, trading sideways at $0.021 and showing no signs of shaking off bearish sentiment. In contrast, Qubetics ($TICS) is shining bright, pulling in top-tier whales and hitting $3.3 million in its presale. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics offers game-changing features like a decentralised VPN that could transform how businesses and individuals manage privacy and security. If you’re hunting for the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner with jaw-dropping ROI potential and real-world utility. Qubetics ($TICS): The Decentralised VPN Leader Qubetics isn’t just riding the wave of crypto hype—it’s creating it. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is pioneering solutions that make crypto not only accessible but practical. One of its standout features is the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , a tool designed for an era when online privacy feels like a pipe dream. Qubetics takes the concept of VPNs to a whole new level, decentralising it for added security and transparency. Imagine you’re a journalist reporting from a country where censorship is rampant. Qubetics’ dVPN ensures your communications stay private, bypassing restrictions and keeping you connected to the world. Or think about businesses handling sensitive customer data—Qubetics provides a secure, decentralised alternative to traditional VPNs, eliminating the single points of failure that plague centralised systems. Even freelancers working remotely can use the dVPN to safeguard their online activities, whether they’re logging into a client’s network or accessing critical tools. The buzz around Qubetics is electrifying. With over 227 million tokens sold and $3.3 million raised in its presale, $TICS is becoming a magnet for whales and savvy investors alike. Priced at $0.0257 per token, now’s the time to act before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. Analysts are projecting $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering an 871% ROI. By the time the mainnet launches, $TICS could skyrocket to $15. A $25,000 investment today would secure you 972,850 tokens—worth a staggering $14.6 million at $15 per token. When you’re talking about the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week , Qubetics doesn’t just make the list—it owns it. With cutting-edge tech and real-world applications, $TICS is the definition of a high-reward investment. VeChain (VET): Bearish Sentiment Lingers VeChain’s been having a rough go of it lately, even as the broader market has seen significant gains. While Bitcoin and other altcoins surged after Donald Trump’s election victory, VeChain barely budged. Trading at $0.021, its sideways movement and bearish sentiment have left investors frustrated. The trading volume of just $33 million doesn’t help its case, highlighting the lack of enthusiasm among market participants. VeChain’s focus on supply chain management and real-world asset tracking is solid, but the market just isn’t responding. Analysts predict that VET could trade sideways for the next month, with a maximum potential price of $0.022. That’s a mere 2.98% ROI—not exactly the kind of returns crypto enthusiasts dream about. Factor in withdrawal fees, and the gains become almost negligible. For long-term holders, the outlook isn’t much better. VeChain needs to spark some excitement, whether through partnerships or tech upgrades, to shake off this stagnation. Right now, investors are flocking to altcoins with higher upside potential, leaving VET in the dust. When it comes to the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week, VeChain unfortunately falls short. Its technology may be innovative, but without market momentum, it’s hard to justify an investment right now. If you’re considering VET, it might be best to hold off until the sentiment improves. Litecoin (LTC): A Promising Start, but Will It Last? Litecoin kicked off October with a bang, soaring to $75 after news that Canary Capital filed for a Litecoin Spot ETF. The announcement sent trading volumes skyrocketing by 150%, showing the market’s appetite for LTC exposure. However, the excitement was short-lived. After a brief rally, Litecoin corrected to $68.84 before recovering to its current price of $91. The bigger picture for Litecoin looks promising. With pro-crypto political shifts, including Trump’s election victory and SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s likely resignation, the regulatory landscape could turn in Litecoin’s favour. An approved Litecoin Spot ETF would be a game-changer, offering traditional investors a new way to gain exposure to LTC. But there’s a caveat: the underwhelming performance of the Ethereum Spot ETF has dampened expectations, and it’s unclear if Litecoin’s ETF would fare any better. For investors eyeing Litecoin, the key question is whether the recent correction is a buying opportunity or a red flag. If the regulatory winds blow in its favour, LTC could see significant upside. But for now, it remains a speculative play. Litecoin earns its spot on the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week list because of its potential regulatory boost and established reputation. It’s not without risks, but for those willing to bet on a brighter future, LTC could be a worthwhile addition to your portfolio. What Are the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week? The crypto market never waits, and neither should you. Qubetics is leading the pack with its groundbreaking decentralised VPN and impressive presale performance, making it the standout pick for the Best Cryptos to Buy This Week. Litecoin offers intriguing potential, especially if the Spot ETF gets approved, while VeChain struggles to find its footing in a bullish market. If you’re looking for high-reward opportunities, start with Qubetics. With its real-world applications and the potential to turn a $25,000 investment into millions, $TICS is the kind of project that could change your financial future. Don’t wait—secure your tokens before the next price jump. The clock’s ticking, and the market rewards those who act fast. Are you ready to take the leap?

Raydium (RAY) led the charge with $69 million in fees over the past week, ranking just behind Tether (USDT). Solana itself secured the third spot, generating $49 million in fees, with Jito, Photon, and Pump.fun rounding out the top ten. https://twitter.com/0xGumshoe/status/1858299083032551793 Pump.fun, a hub for trending Solana meme coins like Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), claimed the 11th spot in fee rankings. PNUT has a market cap of $1.6 billion, while GOAT has a market cap of $1.1 billion. The rise in memecoin trading volumes has significantly boosted Solana’s transaction fees, further fueling the network’s growth. Solana Memecoin Market Cap Surges The total market capitalization of Solana-based memecoins is up by more than 10% in the past 24 hours, as of the time of writing, it stands at $22,334,091,293, – CoinGecko . At the top of the ranking are Dogwifhat (WIF) worth $3.7 billion, Bonk coin (BONK) worth $2.8 billion, and PNUT in third place. These tokens have dominated the meme coin space and seen notable increases in trading volumes, reflecting heightened user engagement. SOL’s Technical Momentum SOL/USDT Chart|Source: TradingView Solana’s rally has broken through key resistance levels, backed by trading volumes exceeding 515,000. Technical indicators point to sustained bullish momentum. The MACD shows ongoing upward pressure, while the RSI remains elevated at 76, signaling an overbought condition. Despite this, the positive market sentiment suggests room for further gains. The combined impact of increased memecoin activity and bullish market conditions has created a fertile environment for SOL’s price growth . Solana has shown the ecosystem’s ability and strong user engagement to capitalize on meme coin trends. The increase in dApp fees and meme coin market cap also indicates the ecosystem is thriving and is still attracting retail and institutional investors. But traders should not be complacent. Overbought conditions and high levels of whale profit-taking may realize short-term corrections. However, the long term is still optimistic. Solana has a continually expanding ecosystem and use cases for the coin, making it a significant player in the crypto market. Solana’s recent rally may be the beginning of a broader upward trend. As meme coins continue to dominate activity and SOL’s metrics hit new highs, all eyes are on the network to see if it can sustain this momentum.",POSITIVE,SOL | RAY,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | ZRX | RAY,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/sol-rallies-4-as-memecoins-dominate-solanas-ecosystem-whats-next-for-sol/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

The Sydney-based company has been approached by a hyperscaler firm (large cloud service provider) for potentially hosting computing infrastructure at IREN's Sweetwater mining site in Texas, co-CEO and co-founder Daniel Roberts said on the call.  ""Two hours ago, we got an email from a trillion-dollar hyperscaler that said they weren't interested in Sweetwater, and now they are,"" Roberts said without giving out too many details.  ""We will continue not to provide guidance on specific terms or timing, given the uncertainties. Given the nature that we are dealing with counterparties, it is not all within our control. However, we continue to progress negotiations with some very large counterparties and hyperscalers,"" he said.  IREN is one of many miners attempting to diversify their revenue sources by securely hosting big tech companies' data centers for running machines to support surging demand for AI and high-performance computing (HPC). The shift started earlier this year after Bitcoin's fourth halving cut rewards by 50%, squeezing miners' profit margins. Rival Core Scientific (CORZ) started the trend by signing AI hosting deals for billions of dollars, leading to its stock price surging and others to follow suit.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners at a Crossroads: Gain Market Share or Go All-In on AI?  The mining company, formerly known as Iris Energy, appointed Morgan Stanley in July to potentially monetize its mining facilities for the AI data center market. Its share price, however, languished most of this year and underperformed peers after a short seller said one of its sites wasn't suitable for that type of work.  Comments from the conference call might have changed market perception as the stock outperformed on Wednesday.  'Powerful' cashflow  Executives also said bitcoin's surge to near-record highs may enable the company to pay a dividend.  ""The achievement of positive operating cash flows may support a potential for investor distribution in calendar year 2025,"" CFO Belinda Nucifora said.  The move would likely be seen as positive by the market, as many investors are looking to gain exposure to the surging bitcoin price. Aside from spot buying, traders are also looking to buy into the bull market through either exchange-traded funds or publicly traded firms such as MicroStrategy (MSTR) and MARA Holdings (MARA) that are purchasing bitcoin.  With IREN mining bitcoin at a significantly lower cost of about $29,000 compared with the market price of around $96,000, co-CEO Roberts said the company has opportunities to accumulate BTC at discounted prices, as opposed to other companies that pay spot prices.  ""When you look at the market today and you see a number of different companies accumulating bitcoin on their balance sheet, paying market price or close,"" Roberts said. ""I think the opportunity to generate $29,000-cash-cost bitcoin for investors and effectively distribute that coin out either through the physical coin … or as cash flow is pretty powerful,"" he added.

Administered by the Bank of Israel as part of a research initiative to potentially adopt a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the successful purchase of a tokenized share through a digital shekel was converted into regular shekels to finalize the process using Kima’s settlement layer. To demonstrate the utility of its transfer protocol, Kima built an imaginary trading platform called PeerTrade, which facilitated an atomic swap of the tokenized share. Kima’s secure decentralized settlement layer orchestrated the transaction instead of an intermediary, directly linking the buyer interested in purchasing the stock using her digital shekels with the seller, who held a tokenized share in their wallet to receive the payment into their bank account in the form of regular shekels. To facilitate the transaction, Kima utilized two sets of API calls within an exploratory sandbox designed by the Bank of Israel for its digital shekel pilot program: Digital Shekel Lock and Release (3-party Lock): The buyer’s funds were locked until the stock was transferred and immediately released to the seller upon completion, protecting both parties throughout the process. Digital Shekel to Regular Shekel Conversion (Defunding): This process converts the digital shekel payment into a usable form with purchasing power in financial markets. Throughout the entire process, Kima’s technology ensured the transaction was safe and verified. The process took place instantly, while Kima’s blockchain functioned as a decentralized escrow without any intermediaries or smart contracts, extra fees, delays, or unforeseen occurrences. Kima’s vast infrastructure includes a Universal Payment Rail (UPR) and Liquidity Cloud. These key technologies connect fiat and digital assets across multiple blockchains, allowing transactions to occur without being tied to a specific currency or payment rate. Kima’s settlement layer is foundational to handling its wide-ranging applications: Cross-border money transfers, hybrid payments, real-world tokenized asset transactions, gaming, e-commerce, and DeFi. “Today’s financial systems are weighed down by barriers and intermediaries that slow transactions and add unnecessary costs,” says Eitan Katz, CEO of Kima. “For the first time, our solution has enabled an unprecedentedly efficient transaction, performing real-time delivery-vs-payment without intermediary escrow or smart contracts. After securely swapping assets, the system seamlessly executed an off-ramp action within the same atomic transaction—marking the first time a decentralized chain has facilitated a transaction that integrates both digital currencies and fiat. This protocol’s flexibility empowers citizens and financial institutions to conduct smooth, cross-asset, and cross-currency transactions without complex conversions or restrictions on asset type.” About Kima Kima is a blockchain-based, asset-agnostic decentralized settlement protocol designed to address fragmentation across crypto and traditional finance. Kima eliminates vulnerabilities through its patent-pending technology as a multi-asset-class gateway, ensuring secure, efficient transactions. With its novel financial primitive—the Smart Transaction—and an intuitive SDK for Web3 and Web2 apps, Kima enables interchain and hybrid transactions, expanding accessibility to a broader audience. Kima’s settlement layer supports multi-ecosystem payments, peer-to-peer commerce, CeFi/DeFi services, cross-chain DEX swaps, and omnichannel wallets, seamlessly bridging fiat and crypto with a focus on security and user accessibility.

Analysts predict that these two tokens could each achieve gains exceeding 1000% by year-end, making them top contenders for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Popcat’s Battle for Recovery Popcat (SOL), a veteran in the meme coin space, has faced considerable challenges recently. After reaching an all-time high of $2 earlier this year, the token has seen a sharp decline, currently trading at $1.33. The loss of key support at $1.30 has further weakened its position, though some technical indicators suggest that a turnaround is possible. To regain investor confidence, Popcat must reclaim and hold above its previous high of $2.07. Doing so would not only restore momentum but also position the token for a potential rally exceeding 1000%. However, this will require renewed interest from both retail investors and whales, as well as favorable market conditions. 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT): The New Challenger While Popcat focuses on recovery, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) is capturing headlines as the new meme coin to watch. Launched on the Solana blockchain, RUGRAT has already delivered impressive gains, with analysts forecasting a further 1000% rally by year-end. RUGRAT’s appeal lies in its combination of innovative features and community-driven growth. Unlike many meme coins, which rely solely on hype, RUGRAT offers real utility through staking rewards, NFT integrations, and deflationary tokenomics. These features have helped the token attract a dedicated following, including whales from competing projects like Popcat. Why Both Tokens Could Rally Market Sentiment: The broader crypto market is showing signs of recovery, creating favorable conditions for meme coins to thrive. Strong Communities: Both tokens boast active and engaged communities, which play a crucial role in driving demand and visibility. Upcoming Developments: Strategic announcements and partnerships are expected to provide additional catalysts for growth. Key Challenges While the outlook for both tokens is optimistic, challenges remain. For Popcat, the primary hurdle is regaining lost support levels and restoring investor confidence. For 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) , maintaining its current momentum and delivering on its ambitious roadmap will be critical to sustaining its growth trajectory. Conclusion With predictions of 1000% gains, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) and Popcat (SOL) are set to dominate the meme coin market in the coming months. While Popcat works to reclaim its former glory, RUGRAT is emerging as a formidable challenger, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. For those willing to embrace the volatility of meme coins, these two tokens represent compelling opportunities for outsized returns.

36914511,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98077,1732726142,"Over $409 Million in Long Positions Wiped Out after Bitcoin Slipped Below $95,000","Bitcoin’s journey towards its much-anticipated $100,000 milestone suffered a significant setback as the cryptocurrency tumbled this week, dropping as low as $91,095 on Tuesday and triggering a wave of liquidations. According to Coinglass data, over $409 million in long positions were wiped out, marking a sharp correction in a market that has been riding high on optimism. This sudden dip coincided with a broader market recalibration following MicroStrategy’s record-breaking $5.4 billion Bitcoin purchase last week. Despite the bullish sentiment such a massive acquisition typically inspires, market analysts suggest the purchase may have inadvertently set the stage for the current pullback. The liquidation event reflects the fragility of over-leveraged positions in a high-volatility environment. Analysts point out that the market had become “extremely overbought” after the U.S. presidential elections, with excessive leverage fueling unsustainable price levels. Adding to the selling pressure, CryptoQuant analysts reported that long-term holders offloaded a staggering 728,000 Bitcoin over the past 30 days, the highest sell-off since April. This wave of profit-taking by seasoned investors further underscores the market’s current state of recalibration. However, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju emphasized that such corrections are not unusual, even in a parabolic bull run. Drawing parallels to Bitcoin’s price discovery phase in 2021, he reminded traders that pullbacks as steep as 30% have historically punctuated Bitcoin’s ascents. “ Just manage your risk and avoid panic selling at local bottoms,” Ju advised, underscoring the long-term bullish narrative. Adding to the bearish pressure was an unprecedented $438 million outflow from Bitcoin ETFs, which snapped a five-day streak of consistent inflows. This outflow and a shift in implied volatility towards put options indicate that traders are bracing for further downside or a prolonged consolidation phase. Despite the short-term correction, market experts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. According to Cryptoquant analyst MAC-D, the recent pullback has not reached the profit-taking pressure observed during the cryptocurrency’s previous all-time highs, leaving room for potential upward momentum driven by FOMO (fear of missing out). “From an on-chain perspective, cycle metrics such as MVRV, NUPL, and Puell Multiple still indicate that Bitcoin is in a bull market with upward potential.” The analyst wrote. He emphasized the importance of identifying major accumulation periods during corrections, with the Short-Term SOPR metric being particularly insightful. On November 21, the Short-Term SOPR reached 1.096, signaling that some short-term investors took profits. “Historical patterns show that when short-term investors sell Bitcoin at a loss, it often leads to a rebound.” He added.

Analyst Think Yes,"The meme coin market is buzzing with speculation, and 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) has quickly become the focal point for analysts predicting a potential 2000% rally in December. This ambitious forecast comes at a time when established names like Popcat (SOL) are struggling to maintain momentum, leaving room for newcomers to carve their niche. Popcat’s Struggles Amid Market Challenges Popcat (SOL) has long been a favorite in the meme coin sector, thanks to its integration with the Solana ecosystem. However, recent market activity suggests that the coin’s charm is wearing thin. After reaching an all-time high of $2, Popcat has experienced a sharp decline, currently trading at $1.20. This 40% drop has shaken investor confidence, especially as Popcat continues to lose key support levels. Popcat’s declining price trajectory has been attributed to increased selling pressure and competition from new projects. The $1.20 mark now represents a critical support level; failure to hold above this price could lead to further losses. Despite this, some investors remain hopeful that Popcat will recover and retest its $2 high, though significant hurdles remain. 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT): The Rising Contender While Popcat battles to stay relevant, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) is surging ahead as a fresh alternative for investors seeking massive gains. Since its launch, RUGRAT has demonstrated exponential growth, rallying over 1000% in its initial days. Analysts now suggest that December could bring an additional 2000% gain for the token, making it one of the most promising entries in the meme coin market. RUGRAT owes its meteoric rise to a combination of innovative tokenomics, community-driven growth, and a unique appeal that resonates with both retail investors and whales. The project’s focus on NFT integration and staking rewards further solidifies its position as a standout in the crowded meme coin space. Why Analysts Are Bullish on RUGRAT Explosive Growth Potential: With a relatively low market cap compared to competitors, RUGRAT has ample room for expansion. Community Engagement: The token has cultivated an active and enthusiastic community, driving organic growth and increasing visibility. Innovative Features: From deflationary tokenomics to unique NFT offerings, RUGRAT’s utility surpasses that of many meme coins. RUGRAT’s December Outlook The forecasted 2000% rally hinges on RUGRAT’s ability to maintain its current momentum. Analysts believe that if the token continues to attract whales from other projects, including Popcat, it could easily surpass this ambitious target. Upcoming announcements and strategic partnerships are expected to further fuel its growth. Conclusion As December approaches, all eyes are on 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) to deliver on its 2000% growth potential.

As the market grapples with increased volatility, these two tokens are emerging as key players in the race for dominance. With RUGRAT promising 1000x returns and POPCAT fighting to regain its footing, the stage is set for an epic showdown. POPCAT’s Market Position Popcat (POPCAT) has been a standout performer in the Solana ecosystem, offering investors high transaction speeds and low fees. Despite its impressive rally to $2 in November, the coin has recently experienced a 40% correction, bringing its value down to $1.20. This decline has raised questions about POPCAT’s ability to maintain its momentum, especially in the face of rising competition. The current support level at $1.20 is critical for POPCAT. If this level holds, the coin could see a rebound toward the $1.40–$1.60 range. However, a break below this support could signal further declines, potentially bringing the token closer to the $1 mark. The Rise of 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) While POPCAT struggles to stabilize, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) has captured the attention of the crypto community with its explosive growth. Launched on Raydium, RUGRAT achieved a 1000% gain within days, making it one of the most talked-about tokens in the market. Its success is rooted in its innovative features, which include deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and NFT integrations. RUGRAT’s appeal extends beyond its potential for rapid gains. The token’s unique approach to community engagement and utility has made it a favorite among both retail investors and whales. Its meteoric rise is a testament to the growing demand for meme coins that offer more than just hype. Head-to-Head: POPCAT vs. RUGRAT Growth Potential: While POPCAT has a proven track record, RUGRAT’s 1000% gain highlights its potential to outperform established players. Community Engagement: Both tokens have strong communities, but RUGRAT’s active social media presence gives it an edge in driving investor interest. Utility and Innovation: RUGRAT’s focus on NFTs and staking rewards sets it apart from POPCAT, which has yet to introduce similar features. The Path Forward For Popcat (POPCAT), the next few weeks will be crucial. Holding the $1.20 support level and breaking through resistance at $1.40–$1.60 will determine whether the token can regain its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) continues to build momentum, attracting new investors with its innovative features and rapid growth. Conclusion The battle between Popcat (POPCAT) and 1900Rugrat (RUGRAT) is a microcosm of the larger trends shaping the meme coin market. As RUGRAT continues to gain traction, it’s clear that innovation and utility are becoming increasingly important for long-term success. While POPCAT remains a strong contender, the rise of RUGRAT signals a new era for meme coins, one that prioritizes growth, community, and real-world applications. Investors would be wise to keep an eye on both tokens as the market evolves.

42415805,a3b86798-2185-4922-adc4-ce2d72e3bdfb,1732725748,All Eyes on Bitcoin,"Bitcoin saw explosive growth immediately after the recent U.S. presidential elections, rising and retaking the spotlight from former highs of $73,000 in March. Now the question is, will bitcoin (BTC) continue its uptrend, and at what point can a sharp reversal happen?  If we take a look at former BTC market cycles, which happen every four years, then we see that we are now just starting to go into new bitcoin price discovery areas, and BTC could top out at new all-time highs, which is practically anything greater than the current resistance of $92,000. Bitcoin could even potentially see highs of $140,000+ based on prior supply and demand — i.e. halving cycles. On the contrary, what makes this market cycle a bit different than others is the vanished principle of BTC being an inflation hedge or digital gold. In theory, it was supposed to be — that is, at least, likely what Satoshi intended since bitcoin was created after the 2008 financial crisis. From what we saw in the last cryptocurrency bear market cycle, BTC is not an actual inflation hedge and performs like all other risk-on assets, so sentiment could change once the inauguration happens in January.  As we've seen before, politics could potentially just be politics until we see actual regulatory rollouts and a more favorable U.S. stance on paper with policies and laws that the markets fully embrace. Things seem to be going in the right direction with the news of Gensler resigning come January 20, 2025. The question remains on who will be his replacement; the wrong person and the smallest sentiment change in the wrong direction could fully accelerate a drawdown in BTC. We've previously seen what every Fed meeting minute has done to the price action of crypto which has, up until recently, always been negatively perceived. In other words, we are not fully out of the woods just yet, especially until there is clarity on who could be Gensler’s replacement.  The BTC ETFs played a vital role this year in institutionalizing the cryptocurrency, which allowed for RIA and fiduciary investment in bitcoin, although in a turnaround market the same volumes that helped bitcoin get to the point it is at today can be the same volumes and outflows that present a downfall. This can lead to crippling sentiment as we all know the crypto bull market does not last forever and drawdowns of 70-80% can be expected.  Looking at prior BTC bull market cycles, BTC has seen drawdowns of 20-30%. Can the same be expected with all the new factors under the current and new market structure? Analysts assume less drawdown and volatility scenarios due to the BTC ETF options offered by iShares and others, although on the contrary, systematic strategies still seem to be sought after with investors taking bets on market volatility, which only recently (in 2022) saw an equity market-like expansion in the crypto markets where enough volume, market cap, and stability existed for the shorting functionality of some coins.  With more market participants and more avenues of shorting functionality across all crypto assets, including BTC, this can create more volatility in the short-term. Compared to the last market cycle, there are a lot more traditional finance (TradFi) players trading and market making in the space now, which in a way is offset by more institutional capital locked up (mostly in ETFs since the venture space in crypto dried up from the fast money of the last bull market). Although in a way, no matter how much institutional capital enters the space, the market cycle of BTC will follow volatility— it's just in its decentralized nature.  Regardless of whatever outlook one has on the price of BTC, it's important to realize that this is a different market than before. Gone are the days of quick “hot money” returns with the inevitable crypto risk factors ever present. One must remain cautious, but optimistic, on where things are going, if not bullish on the market cycle and structure alone. Regardless, for every type of investor, there is a huge opportunity due to the immense growth of the industry, and when that window will close is anyone's guess — the only thing for certain is that the new market cycle is just getting started.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Semir Gabeljic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/11/27/all-eyes-on-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f53438453d867703bee834897b658e59e9d96c2-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416005,bafd77c5-d1a7-40d1-a0f9-42d63c111a0e,1732724392,Should SOL Be Trading at a 70% Discount to ETH?,"Solana (SOL) was trading at 97% discount to the market capitalization of Ethereum's ether (ETH) in January 2023 — a clear market dislocation that has closed significantly over the last two years.  Today, the discount has shrunk to 70%.  However, Solana is starting to challenge Ethereum in terms of on-chain activity and key measures of network usage.  Which raises the question: Is the market still dislocated?  In this short piece, we explore this key question with relative analysis across four key data points. Let’s dive in.  1. Network Fees  Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report, Gas Fees Only (does not include MEV). Please note that we’ve included the following L2s in the comps data: Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Blast, Celo, Linea, Mantle, Scroll, Starknet, zkSync, Immutable, and Manta Pacific.  Layer 2s create new demand for block space on the Ethereum layer 1 and increase the network effects of ETH the asset. Therefore, we include them in our comparatrive analysis for SOL.  In the second quarter, Solana did $151 million in fees, which is 27% of Ethereum plus its top layer 2s.  Fast forward to the last 90 days and the ratio has jumped to 49%.  2. DEX Volumes  Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report  Solana did $108 billion in decentralized exchange, or DEX, trading volume in the second quarter, or 36% of Ethereum and its top L2s. Over the last 90 days, Solana is up to $153 billion and 57%, respectively.  3. Stablecoin Volumes  Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report  Solana did $4.7 trillion in stablecoin volume in the second quarter: 1.9 times Ether and the top L2s.  Over the last 90 days, solana did $963 billion of volume: 30% of ether and the top L2s.  Why the drop?  We think this is mostly due to bots/algorithmic trading that were juicing the numbers in the second quarter.  Furthermore, only 6% of Solana’s stablecoin volumes are peer-to-peer transfers, per Artemis. On the Ethereum L1, this figure is closer to 30% — an indication that Ethereum is used more for non-speculative activity than Solana.  In terms of stablecoin supply, Solana has just 4.1% of Ethereum and its top L2s, up from 3.5% at the end of the second quarter.  4. Total Value Locked (TVL)  Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report  Solana ended the second quarter with $4.2 billion of total value locked (TVL): 6.3% of ether + the top L2s.  Solana’s TVL is currently $8.2 billion: 12% of ether + the top L2s.  In summary, based on 90-day performance, Solana now has:  49% of Ethereum's fees (up from 27% at the end of Q2)  57% of Ethereum's DEX volumes (up from 36% end of Q2)  30% of Ethereum's stablecoin volumes (down from 190% in Q2)  4.1% of Ethereum's stablecoin supply (up from 3.5% end of Q2)  12% of Ethereum's TVL (up from 6% end of Q2)  We think the on-chain data points to a fair re-pricing of SOL's valuation relative to ETH.  With that said, investors should consider qualitative differences between the two networks as well as potential upcoming catalysts as we head into year-end and 2025.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | ARB,Michael Nadeau,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/11/27/should-sol-be-trading-at-a-70-discount-to-eth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26b788878423adce7a7bfa1d6c6b51b55a279ffc-3700x2500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Cardano is seen as a potential candidate for a spot ETF, Shiba Inu (SHIB) sets its sights on reclaiming its all-time high (ATH), and a new utility memecoin, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), captivates investors with its innovative features and Black Friday presale bonus. Cardano (ADA) News: ETF Speculation Cardano has been showing bullish signs, fueled by speculation that it could soon join the ranks of cryptocurrencies being considered for a spot ETF. Analyst Nate Geraci recently tweeted that issuers might file for products tracking Cardano’s performance, alongside other prominent altcoins. The tweet read: ""In addition to crypto index fund uplistings from Grayscale & Bitwise, there are currently spot ETF filings for the following… SOL, XRP, HBAR. Guessing at least one issuer takes a flier on ADA or AVAX ETF as well."" With regulatory conditions appearing more favorable, firms may seize the opportunity to bring ADA-focused ETFs to market. This could significantly boost ADA’s adoption and liquidity, driving its price higher in the coming months. Shiba Inu (SHIB) News: Burn Rate Fuels Hopes For New ATH Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a fan favorite in the meme coin space, supported by a growing community and an aggressive token burn rate. Shiba Inu price is currently at $0.000025 and a market cap of $14.55 billion. Over the last day, Shiba Inu Price has risen slightly by 0.87%, signaling renewed optimism among holders. The increase in SHIB’s burn rate is a promising development, reducing its circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens and potentially paving the way for higher prices. As Shiba Inu Coin regains momentum, breaking its previous ATH is becoming a realistic goal, especially if broader market conditions improve. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): The New Altcoin Stealing The Spotlight Investors are turning their attention to Yeti Ouro, a hot new utility meme coin offering a unique combination of community rewards and Play-to-Earn (P2E) opportunities. YETIO is poised to disrupt the market with its capped supply of 1 billion tokens and innovative ecosystem built on the Ethereum blockchain. Yeti Ouro powers a play-to-earn racing game Yeti Go, a high-octane Unreal Engine P2E racing game that rewards players with tokens. This has boosted the project pushing the raised funds to about $566k so far in the token presale. The team working on the project released a video showcasing what is happening behind the scenes as they prepare for the launch of Yeti Go. Early investors will get to enjoy a 20% bonus on joining the presale, a limited-time black Friday offer running from November 29th to December 2nd. With its utility-driven design and strong community focus, YETIO is emerging as a serious project and the next 100x altcoin.

36913488,https://finbold.com/?p=215412,1732723921,SUI prepares for its largest unlock to date this Sunday – Should you be worried?,"The Sui Network ( SUI ) will unlock over $200 million in tokens this Sunday, December 1, as part of its schedule. This will be Sui’s largest cliff unlock (in nominal value) to date, creating significant supply inflation and dilution, affecting investors. Every month, on day one, Sui unlocks 64.19 million tokens from vested contracts, distributed to five pre-defined categories. Finbold gathered data from Tokenomist on November 27, looking at details for the previous and upcoming events. Private Series A and B investors receive the most, getting over 19 million SUI each, for 61% of the total. Mysten Labs gets the remaining 25.03 million, reserving 12.63 million for the community, 10.34 million for early contributors, and 2.07 million for its treasury. At current prices, Sunday’s unlock will be worth $215.69 million as SUI changes hands by $3.36 per token. This is nearly twice as much as the cliff unlock from November 1, worth $126.68 million at $1.97. In October, the project unlocked the same amount of tokens worth $105 million, as Finbold reported . Sui Network (SUI) cliff unlocks – Previous and upcoming events. Source: Tokenomist Sui token unlocks and tokenomics So far, the Sui Network has already unlocked 28% of its maximum capped supply of 10 billion SUI. At $3.36 per token, the “ Solana-killer ” has a fully diluted value (FDV) of $33.60 billion. This is a similar value to Cardano’s ( ADA ) circulating market cap by press time. With 2.87 billion SUI in circulation, its current market cap is $9.64 billion, giving Sui the 18th position. Notably, each time the network unlocks more tokens, it increases the potential selling pressure and artificially inflates the market cap. An increasing supply requires a similar, or better, increased demand to sustain its prices, according to the laws of economics. This is why Sui’s largest cliff unlock to date represents a first-moment threat to SUI investors, diluting their holdings’ value. Interestingly, Sui has a unique tokenomics, which allows Mysten Labs and Series A/B investors to stake their locked tokens. These positions generate asymmetric liquid rewards against other staking investors, allowing these entities to sell these rewards or compound their staking positions over time. According to Staking Rewards , there are 7.83 billion SUI in staking, totaling $26.38 billion staking market cap. Because of that, Sui’s tokenomics have raised concerns among experts, giving higher importance to SUI’s FDV instead of its capitalization. Sui staking data.

Analysts predict a staggering 55,401% surge by January 2025, so this under-the-radar project offers investors an unparalleled opportunity to ride a potential wave of explosive growth. While the Shiba Inu price rally appears to be slowing, this new altcoin aims to revolutionize a lucrative market segment with blockchain. Shiba Inu Price is Slowing Momentum The Shiba Inu price has undoubtedly been a shining star in the crypto space, captivating millions of investors with its explosive growth during previous bull runs. Its rise to fame as a meme coin symbolized the potential for massive gains in the crypto world, and it remains a popular choice for many traders. However, as the market evolves, the focus shifts from speculative assets to those offering real-world utility and long-term growth potential. Recent trends show that Shiba Inu's price movements, while still drawing attention, have slowed compared to their earlier runs. This doesn't signal an end to its potential, but meme coins’ price, like the Shiba Inu price, may find it harder to replicate past success without significant utility. And this is where PropiChain comes in. PropiChain’s Unique Features PropiChain is taking a bold new approach to real estate investment. It offers features that are practical, transformative, and accessible to everyone. Let’s explore what makes it so special and why investors are taking notice. Fractional Real Estate Ownership Consider the barriers to owning traditional real estate: high prices, hefty down payments, and complicated processes. PropiChain smashes those barriers by enabling fractional ownership. This means that instead of paying high to buy a whole property, you can own a portion of the same asset, earning rental income or property appreciation ROI proportional to your investment. This opens the door for everyday investors to tap into a $300 trillion market that was once reserved for the wealthy. AI-Driven Analytics PropiChain equips you with cutting-edge AI tools to analyze market trends, property values, and token performance. For instance, if you’re new to property investment, the platform’s AI can help identify which asset has a higher potential for rental income or capital appreciation. Metaverse Property Tours The Metaverse is changing how we interact with the physical world. PropiChain allows you to explore properties virtually before buying them. For example, you can walk through a London penthouse from the comfort of your home in Florida. This immersive experience adds transparency and excitement to the investment process, making it easier to trust and commit. Secure Smart Contracts Security and trust are crucial in investments, and PropiChain’s smart contracts deliver both. These automated contracts ensure transactions are transparent, tamper-proof, and efficient. For example, when you invest in a property token, the rental income you’re entitled to is automatically transferred to your wallet. There are no middlemen or delays. PropiChain recently completed a rigorous security audit with BlockAudit to further increase confidence. It earned high marks for its protocols. The company is also listed on CoinMarketCap , a nod to its growing traction in crypto. PropiChain Presale is an Opportunity for Early Investors PropiChain addresses real-world problems and bridges the gap between blockchain and traditional industries, unlike speculative meme coins. The presale is on, and you can get in on the ground floor of what analysts predict could be one of the most explosive altcoins by January 2025. Let’s talk numbers. With a projected growth of up to 55,401%, if you invest $1000 now at $0.004 per token and PropiChain hits its projected growth, that investment could be worth over $500,000 by 2025. This mirrors what we had with the Shiba Inu price in 2021. Conclusion The Shiba Inu price may have made waves in the past, but PropiChain is riding an entirely different wave, one backed by targeting an industry untouched by most coins. While the Shiba Inu price rally faces challenges in maintaining momentum, PropiChain’s presale shows signs of a 55,401% boom by 2025. Early investors stand to benefit the most, with its presale pricing structured to reward those who act now. The window is open but won’t stay that way for long.

36913185,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655144,1732723230,"Bitcoin Price Is Mirroring The Same Movements From 2023, Here’s What It Means","Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has drawn the community’s attention to the fact that the Bitcoin price is mirroring 2023 movements. The analyst further provided insights into what this means for the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Price Mirroring 2023 Movements In an X post, Trader Tardigrade said that the Bitcoin price stays on track with the 2023 moves. He further remarked that the flagship crypto has just completed the pullback. With the pullback complete, the crypto analyst asserted there will be a surge above 100,000, followed by a consolidation around that level. Interestingly, Trader Tardigrade also predicted that the Bitcoin price would reach $200,000 in early 2025. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that this price rally to this target will happen by March 2025. This parabolic rally to $200,000 is expected to mirror a similar rally that BTC enjoyed from early December that year as it rose to the previous all-time high (ATH) of $73,000 in March earlier this year. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Trader Tardigrade isn’t the only one who has predicted that the Bitcoin price can reach this level in this market cycle. Bernstein analysts also previously predicted that the BTC price would reach $200,000 by year-end 2025, although they claimed that was a ‘conservative’ target. Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Research, also predicted that Bitcoin could reach this price target and gave a similar timeline as Bernstein analysts. However, crypto analyst Tony Severino is skeptical that the Bitcoin price could reach $200,000 in this bull cycle. Instead, he has made a more conservative prediction, stating that the flagship crypto would likely peak somewhere in the $160,000 range. The analyst noted this was a more feasible target, considering that the golden ratio is in this range. BTC Is “Far Away” From A Market Top In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez asserted that the BTC price is still “far away” from a market top. He made this statement while highlighting the market value to realized value (MVRV) indicator, which shows whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. The chart showed that Bitcoin has yet to reach its true value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Not Over? Why A Decline To $89,000 Is Possible The Bitcoin price is currently facing a significant price correction, having been pumping nonstop since Donald Trump’s victory. However, Martinez suggested this might be a great time to buy this dip. According to him, the TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Bitcoin hourly chart, while a bullish divergence forms against the Relative Strength Index (RSI). He added that this could help Bitcoin rebound to between $95,000 and $96,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,400, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Buterin’s donation came mere hours after a U.S. appeals court overturned U.S. sanctions against embattled crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, ruling that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts “are not the property of a foreign national or entity” and thus cannot be blocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). By imposing sanctions on Tornado Cash, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) “overstepped its congressionally defined authority,” the court ruled.  Read more: Tornado Cash Sanctions Overturned by U.S. Appeals Court  Coin Center has been a key player in the crypto industry’s fight against the U.S. government’s sanctions against Tornado Cash. OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, claiming it helped to launder more than $7 billion in cryptocurrency, including hundreds of millions of dollars stolen by North Korea’s notorious hacking group, the Lazarus Group.  In October 2022, Coin Center filed suit against Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Treasury Department, OFAC and OFAC’s then-Director Andrea Gacki accusing them of overstepping their authority and violating the First Amendment in sanctioning Tornado Cash. When a district court judge dismissed the case a year later, Coin Center appealed his ruling with a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. That case is still ongoing.  In addition to fighting sanctions against Tornado Cash, Coin Center has been involved in the defense of Tornado Cash’s developers, filing an amicus brief in support of developer Roman Storm’s motion to dismiss the government’s case against him.  Though Buterin hasn’t been as directly involved in the Tornado Cash cases as Coin Center, he has made his support — for both the mixing service itself as well as its embattled developers — clear. Shortly after OFAC first sanctioned Tornado Cash, Buterin publicly stated that he’d used the service to donate money to Ukraine. Earlier this year, he donated 30 ETH, worth over $100,000, to the legal defense fund for Storm and fellow developer Roman Semenov.  Buterin did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.",POSITIVE,ETH,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/27/vitalik-buterin-donated-1-m-in-ether-to-coin-center-hours-after-tornado-cash-victory,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8bc1038e9ca9f4263eacbec0c28283f27058eed6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin: The Apex Crypto Sets Sights On $100,000 The Bitcoin price has been extremely bullish in the past 8 weeks. BTC, the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, is making waves as its price targets an unprecedented $100,000. This surge reflects renewed confidence in its store-of-value proposition and increasing institutional interest. In an extremely bullish market, the Bitcoin price gains are driven by a convergence of factors, including broader crypto adoption, halving expectations, and growing interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional investment, further fueling the Bitcoin price rally. With its dominance in the crypto market firmly intact, the Bitcoin price is poised to continue rising as Bitcoin remains the most sought-after digital asset for long-term growth. Analysts believe that as the market remains extremely bullish, the Bitcoin price journey to $100,000 is not just feasible but imminent.

In latest Ethereum news today , ETH recently criticized for lagging behind other assets during the latest uptrend, has taken center stage. While its performance trailed several altcoins during the latest market surge, latest developments suggest a major change.For context, between Nov. 5 and 12, Ethereum rose by 44%, reaching $3,447. However, this growth fell short compared to altcoins like XRP, which recorded much higher gains during the same period. Following its climb, Ethereum corrected sharply, dropping nearly 10% by November 14. Critics used this underperformance as fodder, some going as far as declaring Ethereum “dead.”Despite this, Ethereum has displayed resilience in recent times. After six days of consolidation, it rebounded with a 9% intraday gain on Nov. 21 and appears to be the biggest beneficiary of the ongoing market recovery among the top 10 assets, with a 4.52% increase today.Ethereum Witnesses Record Open InterestAmid the rebound, Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research and a long-time Ethereum advocate, pointed to major activity in Ethereum’s futures market. https://twitter.com/matthew_sigel/status/1861425084600086675According to his chart, Ethereum’s notional open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) surged by 88% in three weeks, increasing from 350,950 ETH ($1.2 billion) on Nov. 4 to 662,600 ETH ($2.3 billion) on Nov. 22. He shared this data to counter the narrative that Ethereum is “dead.”In response, finance lawyer Scott Johnsson disclosed that over $17 billion in net new USD stablecoins entered circulation in the past 30 days, with Ethereum accounting for over 97% of that change. Analysts Weigh In on Ethereum’s Future Meanwhile, CryptoWolf, a popular analyst, has remained bullish on Ethereum. Five days ago, he noted that Ethereum’s weekly chart is forming a massive triangle consolidation pattern, which has been compressing for three years. At the time, he projected a potential breakout targeting $20,000. However, in a recent follow-up post , he outlined his plan to stay bullish on Ethereum until mid-2025, aiming for $10,000 before shifting focus to the long-term target of $20,000 by the end of 2025.Also, Michaël van de Poppe, a veteran analyst, expects Ethereum to hit $4,000 soon, as Bitcoin and altcoins consolidate before another surge. In a disclosure today, the analyst confirmed that he remains optimistic about Bitcoin reaching $100,000 this year, which could further benefit Ethereum.https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1861690676255056318Possible Bearish SignalsHowever, it is not all bullish for Ethereum. Amr Taha, recently observed a noteworthy trend in Ethereum’s derivative exchanges, citing data from market resource CryptoQuant. He highlighted two recent instances of significant inflows, with 42,000 ETH entering these platforms. Taha interpreted this as a signal of traders preparing for short positions as Ethereum nears its $3,500 resistance level. For context, ETH currently trades for $3,470, now eyeing $3,500.In addition, Ethereum’s recent gains come amid challenges highlighted by CryptoQuant analyst Mac_D. He pointed out that Ethereum’s circulating velocity and transaction growth remain subdued. Current velocity, at seven times the total supply, lags behind historical patterns that marked previous rallies. The rise of faster and cheaper blockchain competitors like Solana and Tron further complicates Ethereum’s growth.However, the market analyst acknowledged that Ethereum’s dominance as the second-largest cryptocurrency and a major collateral asset for institutional investors remains intact. Mac_D suggested that an increase in Ethereum’s price could stimulate lending and leverage in the DeFi space. In turn, this could trigger an altcoin season, supported by higher transaction volumes and network activity.",POSITIVE,ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/vaneck-exec-counters-ethereum-critics-as-eth-cme-open-interest-hits-record-2-3b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vaneck-exec-counters-ethereum-critics-as-eth-cme-open-interest-hits-record-2-3b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
36912900,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98066,1732722267,Insanely Bullish Price Gamechanger Comes For XRP After Ripple Invests In Rebranded Bitwise XRP ETF,"The XRP price has jumped higher today following an announcement that fintech firm Ripple plans to invest an unspecified amount in a newly rebranded Bitwise Physical XRP ETP (previously called the ETF Group Physical XRP). XRP is up 6.4% over the past 24 hours to $1.44 at the time of writing, as per CoinGecko data . Today’s unprecedented rally puts the token 26.2% higher than it was at the same time last week. Ripple To Invest In Bitwise Fund On Nov. 27, Bitwise announced it would rebrand its European XRP ETF to the Bitwise Physcial XRP ETP as it strengthens its presence in Europe. The ETP will trade on Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA under the ticker GXRP. After acquiring crypto investment firm ETC Group, Bitwise rebranded in August, following Its foray into the European market. The XRP ETF is part of the company’s broader suite of crypto asset products. Bitwise also offers spot and Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds in the United States. The 100% physically backed XRP ETP introduced by Bitwise in 2022 allows European investors to gain exposure to the sixth-largest cryptocurrency. Ripple’s chief executive officer, Brad Garlinghouse, noted that the decision to invest in GXRP aligns with the upsurge in interest in crypto-linked exchange-traded products in 2024. “With the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear, this trend is poised to accelerate, further driving demand for crypto ETPs, such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP,” he said in a statement . “As one of the most valuable, liquid, and utility-driven digital assets, XRP is at the forefront of this momentum, standing out as a cornerstone for those seeking access to assets that are resilient and have real-world utility.” XRP’s non-security status is still the subject of a prolonged Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit . Just last week XRP’s value skyrocketed to a 3-year-high of nearly $1.50 and flipped Dogecoin (DOGE) after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler disclosed that he would be resigning on January 20, the same day that incoming U.S. president Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated for his second term at the White House. Investors and traders seem convinced that the crypto foe’s exit will result in a faster conclusion of the XRP lawsuit, which would bode well with the toke’s price. Notably, there has also been a growing demand from other companies to release a U.S.-listed spot XRP ETF. WisdomTree recently became the latest asset manager to file for an XRP ETF.",POSITIVE,DOGE | XRP,BUSINESS | DOGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/insanely-bullish-price-gamechanger-comes-for-xrp-after-ripple-invests-in-rebranded-bitwise-xrp-etf/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Learn why this presale stands out.","A renowned crypto founder believes the golden era of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is here as crypto presales activity increases. He predicts the resurgence of ICOs as more legitimate projects launch on PumpdotFun, a popular token-launching platform. He claims the emergence of legit projects with technical roadmaps is reminiscent of the 2018 ICO boom and the 2021 NFT craze. These early-stage crypto presales are ushering in a new era of high-potential investments and are quickly becoming the focal point for investors looking for significant gains. One of the projects leading this ICO revival is RCO Finance (RCOF) . This AI token revolutionizes the crypto world by integrating real-world assets and practical utility. Following its presale, it is poised for a jaw-dropping 55.009% surge and is quickly becoming the flagship of this renewed ICO wave. The New ICO Era: Why Crypto Presales Are Making a Comeback The resurgence of ICOs and crypto presales signals the maturing of the crypto markets and evolving investor sentiment. Several factors fuel this surge. ICOs and crypto presales offer early access to innovative projects with high ROI. Investors are drawn to these projects because they are offered at discounted rates compared to their expected market value. This creates an enticing opportunity for those looking to capitalize on high-potential projects. The Ethereum ICO is a good example. Early investors bought ETH for $0.31 and got massive returns when it peaked at $4,891, an increase of over 15,500%. There’s increased transparency and trust thanks to more regulatory clarity. The cryptocurrency fundraising landscape has seen significant regulatory developments to enhance transparency and legitimize ICOs. This has instilled confidence in investors, as companies must follow regulations, such as conducting thorough audits of their projects. Adhering to regulations protects investors and promotes a stable investment environment, making ICOs and crypto presales a more attractive investment option. Smart contract audits have become standard practice. They help identify and resolve vulnerabilities in the project code, ensuring its security. This further enhances investor trust in the project's validity and demonstrates a commitment to security and transparency. These audits help projects build credibility and attract more serious investors wary of scams. RCO Finance: The Crypto Presale With a 55,009% Growth Projection Recent ICO and crypto presale success stories have ignited investor enthusiasm. RCO Finance is an excellent example of how presales are redefining investment strategies. This project is more than just another of the crypto presales in the ecosystem; it is a revolutionary project designed to offer long-term value to its users. RCO Finance combines the power of AI, DeFi, and real-world applications to create a comprehensive financial ecosystem that offers its users more. By integrating AI, it provides advanced tools designed to give users a competitive edge and enhance their investing. The robo-advisor is its standout feature. This AI tool serves as your trading assistant, creating personalized investment strategies based on market data, your goals, and risk tolerance. This personalized approach means you don't get generic investment guidance. Instead, your investment plans and recommendations are tailored to your needs. This feature simplifies decision-making because you don't have to analyze vast data manually to create ideal investment strategies. The robo-advisor does all the heavy lifting, providing clear, actionable insights and investment guidance. This makes making sound investment decisions quickly and confidently easier, ensuring your portfolio stays aligned with your goals. In addition to the robo advisor, RCO Finance provides other AI-powered tools that offer real-time analysis, pattern recognition, price predictions, and predictive alerts. With insight from these tools, users can easily identify and capitalize on opportunities. These AI tools are customizable and easy to use, just like the robo-advisor, meaning both beginners and expert traders can use them to enhance hair profitability. By enabling users to invest in physical assets like stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), RCOF helps to close the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. This flexibility allows users to diversify their investment portfolios easily, attracting a broader audience, including institutional investors. SolidProof has rigorously audited the platform and smart contracts to ensure security and transparency. This audit builds trust among retail and institutional investors. RCOF employs a deflationary model, buying back and burning some tokens to lower supply and drive scarcity. This mechanism ensures sustained value growth and rewards early adopters and long-term holders. RCO Finance is expanding what users can do with their crypto holdings with its debit card, which allows users to spend their crypto holdings directly. This makes integrating crypto into everyday financial transactions easier and increases RCOF's usefulness beyond speculative investments, encouraging adoption.

Analysts have reported declining trade volume and fading whale support, which has led to a decline in the Shiba Inu price. With the Shiba Inu price struggling to gain momentum, there are concerns about its ability to sustain itself among competitors. Consequently, as smart money looks for the next big crypto opportunity, many investors are flocking to a lesser-known competitor with a potential for a 12,405% ROI. RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out for its AI trading and investment platform, with no middlemen. Shiba Inu Price: Can the Altcoin Regain its Spark? As the Shiba Inu price experiences a downward swing, many investors wonder if the token will again lead the charts. Analysts have pointed out that at the current Shiba Inu price, whales are less willing to support Shiba Inu. Similarly, a sudden drop in buying pressure has recently seen the Shiba Inu price decline. A drop in trading volume further raises the possibility that has led to the Shiba Inu price lag. Consequently, a bearish descending triangle, which signals the probability of more decline, is where the Shiba Inu price is consolidating. Shiba Inu price trends show the limitations of hype-driven tokens. As the crypto market shifts focus towards projects with real utility, investors are now flocking to RCO Finance with its groundbreaking robo advisor.

This integration allows users to earn Dash directly from their social media activities on the INLEO platform, which then can be used to buy real goods and services around the world. The collaboration between INLEO, Dash, Hive, and Maya Protocol exemplifies a synergy between three separate blockchains to provide the ultimate decentralized social media and earning experience. With this integration, users can now sign up and log in using a Dash wallet, and earn in Dash for their posts and upvotes of other users’ content, and offer exclusive paid content subscriptions. This direct earning mechanism is facilitated by the Hive blockchain's creator reward system, and automatic payouts in Dash are facilitated through a sophisticated token swapping process involving LeoDEX and Maya Protocol. Khal, founder and CEO of INLEO, said: ""This integration is a significant step towards our goal of creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where creators are directly rewarded for their contributions without intermediaries."" Enabling Underserved Users to Earn Digital Cash This partnership redefines the content creation landscape by enabling creators and users to earn digital cash that they can spend on real goods and services, including utility bills, in many countries. Users in developing countries and the unbanked and underbanked, traditionally excluded from mainstream social media and content monetization platforms, now have the opportunity to earn from content they create. Joël Valenzuela, head of marketing and business development for Dash, said: ""We’ve spent a decade building the perfect digital cash to empower users everywhere with a money and payments system that’s affordable, private, secure, instant, and can actually be spent on real goods and services. The next step is actually getting it into the hands of users, and the INLEO partnership offers a fantastic way to earn Dash. We're excited to see what a partnership with INLEO can do to help users maximize their personal sovereignty by truly owning their own money and data."" The revenue model leverages Hive's block reward system, where part of the newly minted coins goes to content creators and curators, as well as rewards from the platform’s native LEO token. Users create various forms of content like short posts, images, long-form articles, and videos, each earning them rewards. The earnings in Hive Dollars (HBD) and LEO tokens are automatically converted into Dash via LeoDEX, which leverages the Maya Protocol to directly deposit Dash into users' wallets. Aaluxx, founder of the Maya Protocol, said: ""Our protocol's ability to facilitate these cross-chain transactions seamlessly shows its strength in building interconnected financial ecosystems."" Signing Up to INLEO Users can join INLEO by visiting https://inleo.io/signup , choosing the Keystore option, and securing their wallet with a recovery phrase and password. This wallet integration extends its utility across various DeFi applications within the Maya Protocol ecosystem. The user then selects the Dash theme, and will automatically receive payouts in Dash directly to their wallet.

36911910,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101775,1732720253,Here’s How High Shiba Inu Can Rise if SHIB Gets $50 Billion Daily Volume,"Shiba Inu has the potential to reach new heights if it claims a $50 billion daily volume and most of this volume lean toward the buy side. Shiba Inu (SHIB) often surprises the market with its rapid price movements. Its most historic run came up during the 2020/2021 bull run, when it turned $12 to $1 million .Though SHIB has dropped from the $0.00008845 all-time high it attained at the time, experts believe it can recover this price level. For this to occur, Shiba Inu would need to attract immense demand, which would lead to a surge in trading volume.Shiba Inu Price at a $50B VolumeTrading volume alone doesn’t guarantee price growth. If the volume includes a major portion of selling activity, the price impact could be neutral or even negative. Market sentiment would need to be bullish for a $50 billion volume to translate into significant price gains.For instance, from Nov. 5 to 16, most SHIB trading volume represented buy activity, leading to the recent price growth. IntoTheBlock shows that on Nov. 16 alone, large players purchased 4.72 trillion SHIB, while bears sold 4.52 trillion tokens. This translated to an excess demand of 201 billion SHIB.Historically, Shiba Inu has shown a strong correlation between trading volume and price surges. During its October 2021 rally, trading volume crossed $30 billion, driving its price to the ATH of $0.000088. CoinMarketCap data confirms SHIB had a volume of $39 billion on Oct. 27 and $32.8 billion on Oct. 28, 2021.Following this period of heightened market interest, Shiba Inu saw declining trading volumes as prices dropped. Notably, SHIB’s 24-hour volume has ranged from $200 million to $500 million since then. If trading activity reaches $50 billion, the price could revisit or even exceed these levels. Analysts believe a daily volume of this magnitude could push SHIB to resistance levels around $0.00005 or higher, with optimistic projections targeting $0.00015 in the right market conditions. Can Shiba Inu Reach a $50B Volume?Interestingly, the trend of surging volume leading to price surges repeated this year, with Shiba Inu’s trading volume rising to a high of $8.96 billion in early March 2024, as the meme coin surpassed the $0.00003 level. With SHIB claiming a yearly peak of $0.000045 on March 5, volume spiked to $16 billion that day.However, while the $50 billion volume could result in massive demand for SHIB, attaining this level of interest could be challenging. Shiba Inu’s volume currently sits at $1.18 billion. This figure would need to spike 4,137% to reach the $50 billion mark.Should this occur, market movements would be pivotal in determining the impact of such high trading volume. Rising liquidity would likely attract institutional and retail investors, creating more buying pressure. At the same time, Shiba Inu’s token burn initiatives could magnify this effect.",POSITIVE,SHIB,BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/heres-how-high-shiba-inu-can-rise-if-shib-gets-50-billion-daily-volume/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-how-high-shiba-inu-can-rise-if-shib-gets-50-billion-daily-volume,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Increasing institutional and corporate adoption, the potential for the creation of bitcoin nation-state reserves, and a new pro-crypto U.S. administration all point to a move higher in the near and medium term, the report said.  It may not be all plain sailing, as ""there could even be some twilight regulatory or law enforcement actions from the outgoing Biden administration that jitter markets,"" wrote Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy.  Still, the bitcoin setup over the next two years ""appears unique and bullish,"" the analyst wrote.  The options market positioning is also bullish, the report noted.

This comes after a significant bearish pull in the crypto market on Tuesday. During the downturn, Dogecoin fell to $0.3673, having traded much higher at $0.4370 on Monday. As of now, the meme coin has not fully recovered from the dip. Despite a 5% surge in the last 24 hours, DOGE is still trading within the $0.39 range.Dogecoin Could Plummet to $0.34 or Rally to $0.43In this latest Dogecoin price news , market analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that Dogecoin is facing a crucial resistance level. He explained that a sustained break above $0.40 would help maintain the bullish momentum and potentially push the price back to $0.43.However, he also warned that if Dogecoin fails to break through the $0.40 resistance, it could trigger another major dip, possibly to $0.36 or even $0.34.Considering that Dogecoin reached a multi-year high of $0.4775 just four days ago, revisiting $0.34 would mark a painful 29% loss for recent investors. Image Source: @ali_charts, X (Twitter) Those Who Survive the DOGE Dip Could Be RewardedMeanwhile, Martinez reiterated that Dogecoin tends to experience periodic price dips after speculative price pumps, which is consistent with historical trends. He has even warned of a likely 84% price correction before a major historical run could occur. In his view, those who cannot withstand a 30% to 50% correction do not deserve to benefit from a 9,000% to 30,000% speculative price pump. Comments by Ali Martinez on Dogecoin on X (Twitter) As a result, he has urged market participants to view every dip as a buying opportunity rather than panic. Meanwhile, other analysts are more optimistic about a bullish continuation for Dogecoin rather than a dip to $0.34. As reported by The Crypto Basic, multiple analysts agree that Dogecoin is preparing to break toward the $0.5000 region after consolidating in the $0.4000 range for the past two weeks.New Bullish Factor for DogecoinInterestingly, a key factor now supporting higher prices for Dogecoin is the introduction of a pioneering exchange-traded product (ETP ) tied to Dogecoin by asset manager Valour.

Now experts are predicting another 40% rally this week that sends it over the $2 milestone. However, crypto casino Rollblock(RBLK) is making even bigger headlines as it prepares to launch its highly anticipated sports betting platform. This top altcoin is expected to soar far ahead of any other tokens, with over 100x growth forecasted for when its crypto presale ends. SEC Shift and XRP ETFs Combine to Send Ripple Soaring The strong forecasts for the Ripple price are due to a cascade of good news for this token combined with a surging crypto market. The first piece of good news for Ripple (XRP) was that the current chair of the SEC will be resigning in favor of a pro-crypto Trump appointee. Ripple has been embroiled in an ongoing legal struggle with the SEC for years that has consistently weighed on its price. The expectation is that the new SEC will drop the matter entirely. Ripple soared over 50% on this news last week. The next leg up for the Ripple price is based on the increasing likelihood of an XRP ETF. Ripple is the top contender for the next ETF, and paperwork for XRP ETF approval has already been submitted to regulators. The new pro-crypto administration should also help the likelihood of speedy XRP ETF approval. Analysts expect the Ripple price to soar all week on this steady parade of good news. Rollblock Sports Betting Announcement Makes Even Bigger Headlines Than Ripple Rally The only top altcoin making more waves than Ripple this week is Rollblock. Rollblock is about to release the details of its highly anticipated sports betting platform, and analysts have increased their growth estimates as a result of this final milestone being in sight. Rollblock’s sports betting is set to expand on its existing platform of more than 7,000 provably fair casino games. This platform uses the latest in UX design combined with cutting-edge blockchain technology to offer an experience that no legacy online gambling site can possibly compete with. Rollblock will expand on this base by offering competitive odds on everything from major league championships to smaller, fan-favorite sporting events. Hosting these odds on the blockchain will mean transparency on a bigger range of events than was ever previously possible. Rollblock has also confirmed that its signature profit-sharing system will go live for sports bettors as well when the presale ends. This will allow sports bettors an income stream and increased market value through the same system of buybacks powered by the casino’s own revenue. Sports betting represents almost half of the $500 billion in annual revenue generated by the gambling industry last year. This expansion has increased analyst projections to over 100x growth when Rollblock’s current crypto presale ends. With only four stages left to go once its current eighth stage is complete, Rollblock’s presale is not expected to last long into 2025. Analysts also note that the current RBLK price of $0.036 will continue to increase rapidly as it races through these final presale stages.

""After careful consideration, we have made the decision to discontinue support for EUR₮,"" the firm said in a press release on Wednesday. Users will be able to redeem tokens until Nov. 27, 2025, the post added.  The decision comes as digital asset businesses operating in the EU are in crunch time before region-wide regulations, known as MiCA, enter into full force by the end of this year.  MiCA requires stablecoin issuers to get compliant or potentially retreat from the market of 450 million consumers. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has been a vocal critic of the new rules and the company has not obtained the necessary Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license to operate in the EU. Meanwhile, rival issuer Circle, the company behind the $36 billion market cap USDC, said it fulfilled the requirements to operate in the region.  EURT didn't attract considerable demand in the euro stablecoin market. It only has a $27 million market capitalization, per CoinGecko data, lagging behind Circle's EURC $90 million and Stasis Euro's $130 million. In comparison, Tether's flagship stablecoin USDT has a $132 billion market capitalization.  Tether recently invested in Netherlands-based stablecoin issuer Quantoz and also launched a tokenization platform, Hadron, that aims to support smaller, MiCA-compliant stablecoin companies to issue tokens.

It’s safe to say, however, that both Pepe and Dogecoin have passed the point of diminishing returns, given their massive, multi-billion market caps. Although they can still grant significant returns as the cycle progresses, savvy investors are on the lookout for undervalued, low-cap gems that can bring in the real price multipliers. One such project is Cutoshi , which has been capturing the attention of veterans and newbies alike with its unique MemeFi platform. Pepe Teases Breakout Above $0.000020 After soaring to a new all-time high at $0.000034 just over a week ago, Pepe (PEPE) has entered a cool-off phase as investors began taking profits. Pepe retraced all the way down to $0.000016, where it found strong support as buyers stepped in. Today, Pepe sells for $0.000022 with little to no movement in terms of intraday price action, although on the monthly time frame, it boasts a staggering 377% surge. At $8.5 billion in market capitalization, Pepe now occupies the 19th place on the crypto leaderboard and its unstoppable rise is threatening Shiba Inu’s position as the 2nd biggest meme coin. Meanwhile, large wallets continue to bet heavily on Pepe, according to on-chain tracker TheCoinMonitor , a whale has placed a $1.1 million long position on Pepe. Dogecoin Reclaims $0.42 Peak, What’s Next? With its $62 billion market cap, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to reign as the undisputed meme king while simultaneously holding the 7th place on the crypto totem pole. Just a few days ago, Dogecoin soared to a new yearly peak of $0.47, a level not seen since its legendary 2021 run. However, it didn’t manage to hold this price point, as selling pressure intensified, forcing a pullback. At press time, Dogecoin trades at $0.39. Dogecoin’s rise has been supercharged by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections with Elon Musk becoming his unofficial right-hand man. Not only Musk is renowned as the most famous Dogecoin champion, but he will also lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, not-so-coincidentally nicknamed D.O.G.E. What does this mean for Doge? That a bright future is ahead, most likely. Cutoshi, The Luckies Cat On The Blockchain The Japanese Lucky Cats are said to bring good fortune to businesses and households. Cutoshidraws its inspiration from them as it’s designed to bring good fortune and prosperity to the rapidly growing community via its unique reward mechanism. CUTO DEX is Cutoshi’s base of operations. This is a non-custodial, cross-chain exchange that leaves the middlemen aside, allowing users to be fully in control of their funds and personal data. The decentralized exchange integrates all major blockchains, allowing for seamless transactions across a wide array of assets while promising the lowest possible fees. In addition to this, Cutoshi will provide substantial monetary incentives to users who engage with the ecosystem. The Cutoshi farming initiative will allow community members to participate in special events and complete fun missions and tasks. In exchange, they will receive CUTO points that can be turned into $CUTO once the token is released for trading.

36911128,https://finbold.com/?p=215378,1732718546,AI predicts Bitcoin Cash price for year-end,"Dating back to 2017, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) is a hard fork of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin ( BTC ), which was developed to solve some of BTC’s scalability issues. With a much larger block size limit of 32MB, compared to Bitcoin’s 2MB limit, BCH can provide both cheaper and faster transactions . However, the project has run into several difficulties — most notably, an internal disagreement led to another fork which resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) in 2018. Despite the obvious advantages that BCH provides in terms of utility, it hasn’t managed to secure a market capitalization comparable to its more established cousin. At press time, Bitcoin’s market cap was $1.8 trillion — whereas Bitcoin Cash’s market cap was just $9.9 billion. Still, BSH has performed admirably throughout 2024 — at the time of publication, one BSH was worth $505.69 — with a 43.49% price increase over the last thirty days bringing year-to-date (YTD) returns up to 94.76%. BCH price monthly and YTD charts. Source: Finbold While this is still significantly less than Bitcoin’s YTD return of 122.30%, BSH remains one of the best-established cryptocurrencies and boasts an impressive performance of its own. With that in mind, Finbold consulted some of the most advanced publicly available AI models for price targets — taking into consideration both bullish and bearish factors. ChatGPT-4o outlined bullish and bearish factors for BCH Upon being prompted, the large language model first outlined two sets of factors — one bullish and one bearish, which it outlined as the most significant. On the bullish side of the aisle, ChatGPT-4o highlighted the increased adoption of BCH, particularly by underbanked populations, as well as several strategic partnerships aimed at improving accessibility. In addition, it noted the current positive sentiment of the wider cryptocurrency market as a bullish factor, as well as Bitcoin Cash’s continued appeal on account of its fast and affordable transactions. Bullish factors for BCH. Source: OpenAI So, what about the bearish factors? Although GPT-4o did touch on the oft-mentioned volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, as well as potential regulatory issues as two potential hurdles, to be fair, those issues are endemic to cryptocurrencies in general. However, the AI model’s third point — increased competition from rivals such as Solana ( SOL ) or Ethereum (ETH)-based layer 2 solutions , has much more weight to it. In particular, Solana supports even faster, more affordable transactions — making it the chief competitor to BCH. Bearish factors for BCH. Source: OpenAI ChatGPT-4o set two very different price targets Although initially reluctant, after some convincing, ChatGPT-4o did set two concrete price targets — one aligned with a more bullish scenario, and one which is more likely to occur if bearish factors turn out to be more significant. In the optimistic case, the AI model opined that BCH could reach prices as high as $650 by the end of the year. For this to be achieved, market optimism would have to be sustained — on top of that, the start of the long-awaited alt season would likely go a long way in propelling prices to this level. Readers should note that this is still less than the asset’s yearly high of $695, reached in early April. ChatGPT-4o’s BCH price predictions for the end of 2024. Source: OpenAI Perhaps unsurprisingly, the bearish scenario, which outlines a drop to $400, would mostly depend on whether or not the wider cryptocurrency market experiences a crash before the end of the year. If met, this mark would represent a 20% drop from the current BCH price. Although many analysts are warning that a flash crash — a sudden plummet followed by a rapid recovery , is possible, only the most bearish researchers see a serious risk of a crash in 2024.

36910757,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655125,1732717837,XRP Consolidates Below Crucial Resistance – Analyst Sets $1.60 Target,"XRP is currently consolidating after a sharp 20% retrace from its recent local high of $1.63, set last Saturday. Despite the pullback, XRP remains a strong contender in the market as it holds firm above critical demand levels, showcasing resilience amid broader market volatility. As Bitcoin flirts with the psychological $100,000 mark, XRP’s price structure continues to signal bullish potential, drawing attention from traders and investors alike. Related Reading: Cardano Reclaims $1 As Network Growth Surges – Larger Breakout Ahead? Crypto analyst and investor Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, suggesting that XRP could be on the verge of a significant breakout. According to Runefelt, if XRP successfully breaks a key resistance level in its current price range, the asset could retest its local highs of $1.60 in the coming days, setting the stage for another rally. The overall market awakening has injected optimism into the crypto space, with XRP positioned to benefit from the momentum. However, maintaining strength above its current demand zone is crucial for XRP to sustain its bullish trajectory. Investors are closely watching for confirmation of a breakout, as XRP’s ability to reclaim its recent highs could signal the start of a larger upward trend in the weeks ahead. XRP Looks Ready To Continue XRP appears poised for another bullish rally, with technical indicators and market sentiment aligning to suggest a continuation of its upward momentum. As the broader crypto market shows signs of awakening, it stands out as one of the assets with the potential to set new yearly highs in the current cycle. Analysts and investors are increasingly optimistic, with many eyeing the $2 mark as the first significant milestone for XRP bulls. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting a key development in XRP’s price action. According to Runefelt, XRP is nearing the breakout point of a falling wedge pattern, a historically bullish structure. If this breakout materializes, XRP could initially target its recent local high of $1.60. Breaking above this supply zone would signal strong buying momentum, paving the way for XRP to aim for new cycle highs and potentially surpass the $2 resistance level. However, XRP’s journey to new highs isn’t without risks. Should the asset fail to break above the $1.60 level, further consolidation below this price could occur, delaying its bullish trajectory. Such a scenario would likely see XRP retesting key demand zones before attempting another breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation? As the market collectively inches toward higher valuations, XRP’s performance remains closely tied to its ability to breach critical resistance levels. A successful breakout above $1.60 would not only validate the current bullish setup but also reinforce confidence in XRP’s potential to lead this cycle’s altcoin rally. Technical Analysis And Key Levels XRP is currently trading at $1.43, showcasing remarkable resilience after a 200% surge from its November 5th lows. While the price has retraced 20% from the local high of $1.63, XRP’s bullish structure remains intact as the broader crypto market gears up for another potential rally. Analysts and investors are optimistic that the price can sustain its momentum, provided key support levels hold firm. The $1.27 mark emerges as a critical demand zone for XRP, maintaining the short-term bullish structure that has driven its recent growth. If XRP successfully defends this level, the price is expected to consolidate before making another attempt to surpass the $1.60 resistance. A break above this key level could open the door for further upside, pushing XRP closer to its next major milestones in this cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leverage Remains High – Data Reveals Selling Pressure Above $93K However, failing to hold above $1.27 could shift market sentiment and lead to deeper corrections. This would challenge XRP’s bullish momentum and potentially test lower support levels, delaying its upward trajectory. As the market looks primed for continuation, XRP’s ability to stay above critical demand zones will determine its performance in the coming weeks. Investors are closely monitoring these levels as the asset eyes another leg higher.

36910893,https://blockworks.co/news/btc-price-levels-to-watch,1732717800,Price targets to watch as bitcoin struggles to hit $100K,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . We’ve talked about the bullish narrative , we’ve talked about the historical possibility of a drawdown , and now, dear readers, let’s talk price targets and analysis. It’s been a while since we spoke to Ledn’s John Glover to get his end-of-year expectations and the levels he’s watching. Glover uses the Elliott Wave Theory, which is a technical analysis that uses previous price movements to predict future movements. Basically, if we’ve carved out the high here at just below $100k (last Friday we saw it go as high as $99,800 before falling back) then he’s looking at $125,000. However — and this is the part that might make the big bulls sad — we might not see $100k breached this year. Glover said his “favorite” move right now (or the one that seems most likely to him) is that bitcoin’s “topped out at these levels, and we’re going to drop back down to kind of $75,000 to $80,000 and then moving into next year, then we’ll see that big rally.” There is another scenario though where bitcoin quickly breaks $100k and climbs up to $125,000. If that happens, we could see the price top out at $160,000. Source: Ledn But Glover pointed out that he expects to see a decent amount of profit-taking. After all, we’ve seen a $20,000+ jump in bitcoin’s price in just the last few weeks alone and it would be “typical … behavior when you’ve had such a big move ahead of the real event.” “So we have the news event, which is [President-elect Donald] Trump getting in. Now the real event is Trump [taking office] and people will take profit ahead of that, waiting to see whether or not that’s really going to change the regulatory stance of the US and push things forward,” he continued. The lack of a so-called real news event is also why announcements — like MicroStrategy buying up over $5 billion of bitcoin — didn’t move the needle. Bitcoin’s pause may be beneficial to the overall crypto environment though. “We’re seeing a lot of switching from bitcoin into altcoins,” Glover noted. And here’s your reminder, as I wrote last week , HashKey Capital’s Jupiter Zheng expects a “massive altcoin season” when bitcoin dominance peaks. Glover does think that the final move up — whether it’s to $125,000 or $160,000 — could end this iteration of the bull run and would be followed by a correction. “Now, that correction isn’t going to take us back down to $20,000. I think if we get that correction from $160,000 we probably correct down to $115,000. If we get it from $125,000, we correct down to $95,000 or something … I think that somewhere in 2025-2026 we will finish this [bull run],” he said.

36910554,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98063,1732717233,"Dogecoin Overtakes Porsche Amid First-Ever Dogecoin ETP Debuting On Swedish Stock Exchange, Elon Musk Endorsement","Leading meme coin Dogecoin has overtaken German luxury automaker Porsche in terms of market cap, catapulted by the launch of an exchange-traded product (ETP) for DOGE in Nordics and endorsement from billionaire Elon Musk. Dogecoin spiked 165.5% over the past month to reach a market cap of over $57.6 billion, effectively exceeding Porsche’s $54.89 market value, according to data tracked by CompaniesMarketCap. First-Of-Its-Kind Dogecoin ETP Valour, a subsidiary of Canadian digital assets firm DeFi Technologies, announced the launch of a Dogecoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on Tuesday, which widens investors’ access to the multi-billion dollar meme coin in Sweden. The Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) SEK ETP is now listed on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock market and features a management fee of 1.9%, as per a Nov. 26 press release. The product was touted as investors’ first-ever option for a “simple and secure way to gain exposure to DOGE” in the country. “Introducing the first Dogecoin ETP in the Nordics represents a significant milestone in our mission to democratize access to digital assets,” Valour’s Head of Product Elaine Buehler said in a statement. “We are excited to provide investors with a regulated product that captures the essence of Dogecoin’s dynamic market presence.” In the United States, investment vehicles offering traditional investors exposure to the spot price of crypto assets are currently limited to just Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). However, it seems that as companies apply with the Securities and Exchange Commission for Solana and XRP exchange-traded funds, Dogecoin could also potentially hit Wall Street. With the new ETP, Valour seeks to allow investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin, the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap without the hassle of buying and storing the crypto themselves. Johanna Belitz, Valour’s Head of Nordics, cited a massive increase in Dogecoin demand following the U.S. presidential election as one of the product’s key motivators. She also noted that eccentric tech billionaire Elon Musk has recently boosted Dogecoin’s prospects. “The growing popularity of Dogecoin, bolstered by influential figures like Elon Musk, highlights our commitment to delivering innovative and diversified investment opportunities,” she added. Elon Musk Boost As one of Dogecoin’s most outspoken high-profile supporters, Musk has sparked fresh interest in Dogecoin through President-elect Donald Trump’s new proposed federal agency, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), which Musk was recently appointed to co-lead with pro-crypto entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. @DOGE is inevitable pic.twitter.com/4AaEr0Sev6 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 25, 2024 Since the new agency has the same acronym as the DOGE meme coin’s ticker, some investors believe this is a sign of a forthcoming parabolic rally.

XRP latest news today : The San Francisco-based company made the disclosure after Bitwise renamed its European XRP ETP, formerly dubbed the ETC Group Physical XRP (GXRP). The renaming is part of Bitwise’s commitment to rebranding its suite of products in Europe. Following the rebranding, the ETP is now Bitwise Physical XRP, operating under the same GXRP ticker. This rebranding comes three months after Bitwise entered the European market through its acquisition of ETC Group in August. ETC Group, which offered several physical crypto ETPs, including GXRP and Bitcoin ETP (BTCE), had $1 billion in AUM. Launched in 2022, GXRP offers European investors regulated exposure to the fifth biggest cryptocurrency by market cap through a 100% physically backed ETP. The product is issued under a prospectus approved by the German authorities.Commenting on the development, Bitwise co-founder and CEO Hunter Horsley highlighted XRP and XRPL among the most famous crypto projects. The executive expressed excitement about granting investors access to an institutional-grade product like the XRP ETP. Ripple to Invest in Bitwise Rebranded XRP ETP With Bitwise rebranding the product, Ripple disclosed plans to invest in GXRP. However, the company did not reveal the financial details of the forthcoming investment. Notably, Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO at Ripple, recognized the growing demand for investment products around cryptocurrencies. He suggested that this trend will skyrocket, bolstering demands for crypto ETPs like GXRP as the U.S. gets clearer crypto regulations. Furthermore, he characterized XRP as a utility-driven token, essentially a cornerstone asset for investors looking to gain access to digital assets with real-world utility. For context, XRP’s utility cuts across sectors like cross-border remittance and institutional decentralized finance (DeFi). Bitwise Success in 2024 Meanwhile, 2024 has been a significant year for Bitwise. Having recorded $10 billion in total client assets, Bitwise expanded its European footprint by acquiring ETC Group. The company also increased its crypto ETPs, including launching the Bitwise Aptos Staking ETP on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Following the successful launch of its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, it became the first company to seek the U.S. SEC’s blessing for a spot-based exchange-traded fund tied to XRP.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/ripple-to-invest-in-rebranded-bitwise-physical-xrp-etp/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ripple-to-invest-in-rebranded-bitwise-physical-xrp-etp,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Cardano (ADA) has experienced significant price movement, surging by 10.19% within the last 24 hours and 21.15% over the past week. The 9th crypto by market cap, now trading above $1, has demonstrated resilience following a period of consolidation. Recent data indicates that whale activity played a crucial role in this rally, with large-scale investors actively accumulating ADA during price dips.Cardano Whales Accelerate Accumulation in Cardano news today , Analytical data shared by analyst Ali Martinez highlights an extensive accumulation phase by ADA whales, who acquired over 130 million ADA during a recent price correction. An initial accumulation phase, occurring between early November and November 12, was followed by an observed upward price trajectory, suggesting that large holders anticipated a bullish breakout. Image Source: @ali_charts, X (Twitter) After ADA reached near $1.1, a temporary decline in whale holdings occurred, likely driven by profit-taking activity. However, from November 20 onwards, as ADA traded below $0.8, renewed accumulation activity was noted. Although this accumulation trend has recently flattened, the initial spike reflects a robust interest in ADA by significant market participants during dips.On-Chain Indicators Highlight Growing InterestFurther reinforcing this trend, TradingView's accumulation/distribution (A/D) indicator shows a notable increase in accumulation. The indicator rose when ADA’s price was approximately $0.3, moving from 12.00 billion to 12.13 billion on the A/D scale.

Investors are also withdrawing Bitcoin from exchanges, which suggests people are shifting toward self-custody. Bullish sentiment is among options traders, and many believe BTC could hit $150,000 by 2024's end. However, analysts warned of potential pullbacks due to market volatility and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Brazil proposed a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to improve its financial stability. Self-Custody Gains Momentum as BTC Approaches $100K The self-custody trend in cryptocurrency has gained a lot of momentum. This momentum is mostly driven by Bitcoin’s recent rally toward the $100,000 mark. In fact, hardware wallet provider Trezor reported a massive 600% spike in weekly wallet sales, which coincided with Bitcoin reaching its all-time high of $99,645 on Nov. 22. On the same day, Trezor achieved its highest single-day sales. The surge in demand for self-custody solutions like Trezor wallets can be attributed to multiple factors, including the outcome of the recent United States presidential election. Donald Trump’s victory started a pivotal shift in the regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies, moving away from a hostile stance to a much more supportive environment. This regulatory clarity boosted institutional adoption and created a favorable operating landscape for crypto businesses, according to Trezor’s chief commercial officer, Danny Sanders. However, despite the election’s influence on the broader crypto market, Trezor did not observe a big change in the proportion of its sales originating from the United States. Beyond the election, Bitcoin’s fourth halving in April 2024 and broader macroeconomic factors also contributed to the ongoing market rally. Historically, Bitcoin’s price tends to surge roughly six months after a halving event. Additionally, central banks in the United States and Europe reduced interest rates, which increased liquidity in the crypto market and further drove Bitcoin’s price upward. Bitcoin exchange reserves (Source: CryptoQuant ) This renewed interest in crypto also led to a noticeable shift in investor behavior, as there has been a large reduction in Bitcoin reserves on centralized exchanges. CryptoQuant data reveals that 427,000 BTC, which is worth approximately $40 billion, have been withdrawn from exchanges in 2024, leading to the lowest exchange reserves in six years. Bitcoin Traders Bet on $150K by End 2024 Almost half of Bitcoin options traders believe Bitcoin could hit a six-figure price by the end of 2024. Some even projecting a surge to $150,000 despite BTC’s recent pullback to just above $90,000, according to on-chain data. The likelihood of Bitcoin surpassing $100,000 rose to 45%, up from 34% the previous week. There is also a 4% probability of BTC surpassing $150,000, according to Nick Forster . Forster shared that there is strong demand for Bitcoin options, particularly call contracts, which indicates market confidence in Bitcoin’s upward potential. Data from Derive shows that 41.3% of contracts traded were calls, compared to 38.3% for puts, suggesting limited selling pressure. These options allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price movements. Calls provide the right to buy while puts provide the right to sell at a predetermined price. Currently, Bitcoin is trading hands at $93,855. Data suggests there is a 68% chance of Bitcoin fluctuating between $81,493 and $115,579 by the end of 2024, with only a 5% likelihood of it falling below $70,000 or reaching as high as $137,645. Despite the bullish sentiment, some analysts warn of potential pullbacks. Ki Young Ju , the CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed out that even during parabolic bull runs, Bitcoin can experience corrections of up to 30%. Ju specifically mentioned the 2021 bull cycle, where similar pullbacks happened as Bitcoin rose from $17,000 to $64,000. He urged investors to manage risk and avoid panic selling. Meanwhile, analyst PlanC is optimistic about Bitcoin consolidating in the $90,000 range. He suggested that a period of stability at this level will benefit the longevity of the bull market, and could potentially set the stage for future growth. Strong Dollar Could Pressure Bitcoin Rally Bitcoin's price movement may face a retracement toward $70,000 if it continues to follow its historical correlation with the global money supply in cash and bank deposits, according to analyst Joe Consorti . In a recent post, Consorti shared that Bitcoin has been tracking global M2, which is an estimate of cash and short-term bank deposits, with a 70-day lag since September of 2023. This trend is consistent with previous bull runs, which suggests that Bitcoin’s price increases often align with the growth of the M2 money supply as investors hedge against inflation during periods of liquidity expansion. While Consorti noticed that the correlation has been “shockingly accurate,” he also mentioned that Bitcoin could experience a 20-25% correction before resuming its path to $100,000. Macroeconomist Lyn Alden previously reported that Bitcoin aligns with global liquidity trends 83% of the time over a 12-month period. However, not all analysts agree with this assessment. Market commentator David Quintieri dismissed the reliability of tracking Bitcoin against M2, and argued that its volatility makes comparisons like these less meaningful. Meanwhile, Glassnode analyst James Check attributed some of the M2 decline to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Crypto commentator Sam KB also questioned why Bitcoin continues to rally despite M2 nearing its lowest point this cycle. Some analysts warned that President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported goods could strengthen the U.S. dollar even more. Historically, a strong dollar places pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin. Hedge fund manager Scott Bessent said that tariffs generally result in a stronger dollar, which could introduce additional headwinds for Bitcoin’s price growth. Brazil Proposes Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve A newly proposed bill in Brazil’s Congress wants to establish a Sovereign Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, known as RESBit. This could potentially transform the nation’s approach to digital assets. The bill was introduced on Nov. 25 by Congressman Eros Biondini, and outlines the creation of a Bitcoin reserve to protect the country’s sovereign assets from currency fluctuations and geopolitical risks. The reserve will also serve as collateral for Brazil’s upcoming central bank digital currency, the Real Digital (Drex). Brazil currently holds $355 billion in sovereign reserves, primarily backed by global fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. The proposed legislation suggests complementing these reserves with Bitcoin, and will limit BTC holdings to a maximum of 5% of the total reserves through phased purchases. Management of the Bitcoin reserve will remain under the country’s central bank, and will be overseen by a technical advisory committee of security experts. The bill draws its inspiration from El Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. El Salvador’s government has since accumulated close to 6,000 BTC, which is valued at $558 million. El Salvador cold wallet (Source: Arkham ) Brazil has been making it a priority to advance its regulatory framework for digital assets. In June of 2023, the country introduced laws granting its central bank authority over virtual asset service providers, while tokens classified as securities remain under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The proposed Bitcoin reserve legislation is currently under review by the Speaker of Brazil’s House of Representatives.

By 2024, 8% of Salvadorans have used Bitcoin to make payments. Expanding energy capacity is central to El Salvador’s economic strategy. We believe Bukele’s Bitcoin gambit can serve as a model of innovation, determination, and independence for the emerging world. El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin bet and sweeping reforms are turning it into Latin America’s ultimate comeback story. Special thanks to our EM Bond team for their perspective and contributions to this article. Introduction El Salvador has undergone a remarkable transformation under President Nayib Bukele, emerging as a beacon of innovation and resilience in Latin America. From adopting Bitcoin as legal tender to enacting sweeping fiscal and social reforms, the nation has defied global skepticism. VanEck recognized this potential early and made investments in Salvadoran sovereign debt. Despite the fierce rally in these assets, we estimate the nation’s just-issued 30-year bond is still priced 200 basis points cheap compared to its fair value, with projected returns exceeding 33% over the next year should spreads narrow to our target. During our visit to San Salvador last week to meet President Bukele and speak at the “Adopting Bitcoin” conference, we re-explored the ambitious vision driving El Salvador's future as the ""Singapore of Latin America."" El Salvador’s Past: Challenges and Stagnation For decades after its 1979-1992 civil war, El Salvador faced crippling challenges: Economic Struggles: National debt grew from 37.8% of GDP in 2001 to 95% by 2020, while economic growth averaged just 2% - the second-lowest in Central America. High Crime Rates: Persistent violence and gang activity made El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world, stifling investment and social cohesion. Brain Drain and External Migration: Decades of instability prompted the migration of over 1.6 million Salvadorans abroad, primarily to the United States. This external migration hollowed out the local labor force and left the newly dollarized economy heavily reliant on remittances for hard currency, which at the peak accounted for 25% of GDP - approximately $8 billion annually. Bukele’s Reforms: A Turning Point Since his election in 2019, President Bukele has reshaped El Salvador with sweeping reforms, and the economy has seen significant gains. Crime Reduction: Homicide rates plummeted from 51 per 100,000 in 2018 to just 2.4 in 2023, transforming El Salvador into the safest country in Central and South America. During VanEck’s due diligence process, conversations with local taxi drivers revealed how Bukele’s crackdown on gangs has profoundly improved daily life for ordinary Salvadorans. Many drivers emphasized that they no longer must pay “protection money” to criminal groups, a burden previously consuming a significant portion of their income. More than one driver shared that his children can now play soccer outside in the evenings without fear - something unimaginable just a few years ago. These stories strengthened our conviction by highlighting how reduced crime is not just a statistic but a tangible, transformative GDP multiplier for families and communities across the country. Fiscal Discipline: Debt-to-GDP dropped to 59% in 2024, its lowest since 2008, thanks to $2.3 billion in sovereign bond refinancing and prudent budgetary measures. GDP Growth: Between 2021 and 2023, GDP grew 19%, a significant acceleration compared to pre-2019 averages. Tourism: The sector’s GDP share rose from 11.7% in 2019 to 12.3% in 2023. From January to July 2024, inbound visitors surged 22% year over year, creating 36,000 new jobs and reducing unemployment to 2.76%. Labor Force Participation: Participation reached 64.4%, the highest in El Salvador’s history. This set of catalysts has prompted Moody’s to upgrade El Salvador’s sovereign debt from Caa3 in May 2022 to Caa1 in May 2024 and S&P to raise its rating from CCC+ in June 2022 to B- in November 2023. S&P reaffirmed its B- rating with a ""stable"" outlook in April 2024. While these ratings are still considered “Junk,” their positive direction affirms El Salvador’s strategy for financial renewal. We expect the ratings agencies to follow bond prices higher and upgrade ES debt further soon. Cumulative GDP Growth in Select Latin American Countries 2021 - 2023 Source: World Bank as of 11/7/2024. Bitcoin: A Bold Experiment In June 2021, a supermajority of the Salvadoran Congress passed legislation making Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The government envisioned Bitcoin as a tool to encourage foreign investment, expand financial inclusion for the unbanked, and provide the nation with an uncorrelated reserve asset. The government offered $30 in Bitcoin to citizens who downloaded the Chivo Wallet to promote adoption. Research by Yale in February 2022 revealed that 68% of households were aware of the Chivo Wallet, and 78% of those had downloaded it. By 2024, 8% of Salvadorans have used Bitcoin to make payments. While some international observers initially viewed this as a modest figure, we believe it represents a meaningful step forward for a country with historically low rates of electronic payment adoption. The integration of Bitcoin into daily life is creating a foundation for broader acceptance and innovation in financial technology. El Salvador has also embraced Bitcoin as a reserve asset, holding 6,150 BTC, currently valued at ~$600 million with $150 million in unrealized gains. This sum currently represents 1.6% of the nation’s GDP of $36 billion, underscoring the government’s commitment to Bitcoin as a reserve asset. For comparison’s sake, if the U.S. were to authorize a Bitcoin reserve of 1 million BTC at an average price of $150,000, under legislation that Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced, the reserve would be worth $150 billion, representing only 0.57% of the U.S.’s GDP of $26.3 trillion. El Salvador's Bitcoin Worth >$600M Source: El Salvador Wallet Tracker, Artemis XYZ as of 11/21/24. El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy extends beyond reserves. There are plans for $1 billion “Volcano Bonds”, half of whose proceeds would buy Bitcoin, aim to fund the development of Bitcoin City, a futuristic economic zone powered entirely by geothermal energy. This city is designed to attract international investment and innovation with zero taxes on income, property, or capital gains. Additionally, the government offers a “Freedom Visa” program, which grants citizenship to individuals who donate $1 million to the nation’s development efforts. While the Volcano Bonds have yet to be issued, the delay reflects a combination of strategic prudence - avoiding additional debt issuance in a high-interest rate environment - and geopolitical considerations as the government navigates sensitive negotiations with the IMF. By demonstrating fiscal restraint and prioritizing debt reduction, El Salvador strengthens its negotiating position while maintaining the option to issue the bonds under more favorable conditions in the future. The Vision for El Salvador During our meeting with President Bukele, he outlined bold but achievable goals to position El Salvador as a hub for nearshoring U.S. export capacity. Pro-growth policies, including economic ""free zones,"" aim to attract multinationals in auto parts and tech manufacturing sectors by offering tax-free value-added operations. These initiatives are already luring investment, supported by a deregulated energy market and infrastructure improvements. Bukele also highlighted El Salvador’s substantial untapped gold reserves, which he described as the largest per capita and per square mile in the world. These deposits represent an enormous economic opportunity, but the previous leftist government banned mining activities in 2017. Bukele expressed his intent to reverse this law, citing the potential to extract the metal responsibly while adhering to modern environmental and sustainability standards. The president extended an invitation to VanEck’s gold geologists to research the deposits, signaling his administration’s willingness to collaborate with global experts to unlock this resource. If successful, gold mining could contribute to El Salvador’s economic transformation, adding another layer to the country’s diversification efforts. The author and President Bukele, as of 11/15/2024. Energy as a Catalyst for Growth Expanding energy capacity is central to El Salvador’s economic strategy. During our meeting with a senior government official in the president’s office tasked with coordinating between the state electricity company and private enterprises, key insights were shared about the nation’s energy landscape and its potential to attract high-tech industries: Current Energy Landscape: Peak baseload demand: 1.2 GW; installed capacity: 2.5 GW. Renewable energy (700 MW) includes geothermal, hydro, and one wind plant. Base power is primarily hydro and geothermal, with bunker and natural gas providing 380 MW. Planned Developments: By 2035, El Salvador aims to expand geothermal energy capacity with six or seven new 50 MW plants. A $1 billion government investment will fund energy projects over five years, with 15% of new generation reserved for government use. While $0.16/kWh for industrial power isn’t cheap, the senior official noted that this price is manageable for high-margin data center customers. This is particularly true given El Salvador’s unique direct undersea cable access with 30-millisecond latency hops to Miami. According to the official we met, this connectivity, combined with the government’s tax incentives, positions El Salvador as a competitive destination for data centers and AI-focused operations. El Salvador’s diversified energy strategy contrasts with neighboring Costa Rica, which faced energy shortages in 2023 due to its over-reliance on renewable energy sources like hydropower. Costa Rica's inability to meet demand during a dry season highlighted the risks of disconnecting fossil fuel-powered electricity generation – which they did for “green” purposes - without ensuring sufficient backup generation. In contrast, we think El Salvador’s mix of geothermal, hydro, and natural gas may provide a more resilient energy portfolio capable of supporting industrial and technological growth. Although no El Salvador data center customers had been announced at the time of publication, we heard confidence that agreements would be finalized soon, with companies drawn to the country's infrastructure, reliability, and policy advantages. Initiatives like the private Volcano Energy (23% owned by the El Salvador Government), which drives geothermal energy expansion for Bitcoin mining, further enhance El Salvador’s potential crossover appeal for Bitcoin miners and other industries with long-term needs for sustainable and secure power. Relations with the IMF and the U.S. El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin policy and fiscal reforms have complicated its relationships with international stakeholders, particularly the IMF and the U.S. During the Biden administration, diplomatic relations were strained. Sanctions were imposed on key Salvadoran officials, and human rights groups pressured the U.S. to take a tougher stance on the nation’s aggressive anti-crime policies. As El Salvador remains heavily reliant on remittances - $8 billion annually, or 24% of GDP - primarily from the U.S., maintaining a strong bilateral relationship is critical. The Biden administration’s approach has created significant headwinds, but a Trump presidency offers the potential for a reset. With Trump’s well-documented support for Bitcoin and focus on reshoring and “friend-shoring” supply chains, El Salvador could emerge as a strategic partner in U.S. efforts to build regional alliances. Trump advisors’ recent visit to El Salvador in June 2024, warmly received by the Bukele administration, has fueled speculation of closer cooperation in areas such as manufacturing, energy, migration, and Bitcoin mining. The IMF’s role remains central to El Salvador’s financial trajectory. Many believe the IMF is keen to secure a deal before the Trump administration takes office, fearing that a shift in U.S. policy could alter the negotiation dynamics. The release of El Salvador’s 2025 budget - a more austere spending plan designed to address the IMF’s preconditions - has been seen as a move to improve the likelihood of aid. However, Bukele’s subsequent major bond amortization isn’t due until 2027, which gives him considerable room to negotiate without immediate pressure. Why hurry to negotiate when the IMF’s position may change upon Trump’s inauguration? Investment Opportunity: A Contrarian Call VanEck’s early recognition of El Salvador’s potential has been validated with many of the bonds more than doubling from their 2022 lows. Bond Valuation: We still estimate El Salvador’s 30-year sovereign bond is priced 200 basis points cheap to fair value. Projected Returns: If reforms continue as expected and spreads narrow to our fair value target, we anticipate a total return exceeding 33% in the next year. Since BTC Purchase, Salvadoran Debt (+18%) Source: Bloomberg as of 11/8/2024 Conclusion El Salvador’s transformation is a testament to bold policymaking and resilience. From fiscal reforms to Bitcoin adoption and energy innovation, the nation has defied global skepticism and achieved measurable success - whether through USD bond performance, GDP growth, or Bitcoin valuation, boosting its reserves. To date, these achievements have resulted from El Salvador’s independent and often solitary efforts, pursued in the face of opposition from major international stakeholders, including the IMF and its largest shareholder, the U.S. Now, however, the landscape may be shifting. As the potential for closer cooperation with the U.S. grows and IMF engagement becomes more likely, El Salvador is poised to move from a solitary pursuit of its goals to a collaborative one. This emerging tailwind of international support could remove one of the country’s final hurdles, enabling it to achieve even greater economic integration and stability. For investors, this makes El Salvador’s sovereign debt a compelling opportunity. We believe Bukele’s Bitcoin gambit can serve as a model of innovation, determination, and independence for the emerging world.

Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance.

Duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond’s price given a change in yield. This duration measure is appropriate for bonds with embedded options. Quantitative Easing by a central bank increases the money supply engaging in open market operations in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity. Emerging Market securities are subject to greater risks than U.S. domestic investments. These additional risks may include exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls; less publicly available information; more volatile or less liquid securities markets; and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic, or social instability. Investments in emerging markets bonds may be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations located in more developed foreign markets. Emerging markets bonds can have greater custodial and operational risks, and less developed legal and accounting systems than developed markets. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This risk is heightened with investments in longer duration fixed-income securities and during periods when prevailing interest rates are low or negative. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money.

BTC’s immense gains have stagnated, and its dominance has declined after reaching its peak recently. Altcoins have stepped in and are leading the gains over the past few days. With the altcoin season nearing, investors have shifted their focus away from Bitcoin to smaller projects, leading to a surge in the prices of altcoins. November has been incredibly bullish with the news of Donald Trump’s presidential election victory and the SEC’s announcement of Gary Gensler's imminent resignation. Bitcoin peaked at $99,655, and numerous altcoins set new all-time highs. The market has since corrected, and BTC trades at around $93,500. Amid the bullish run of the past weeks, memecoins have emerged as some of the top gainers. The staggering gains seen in memecoins have led to a resurgence in interest as investors look for the next top gainer before the next bull run. Join us as we delve into four exciting memecoin opportunities. Bonk (BONK) Sets New ATH Bonk (BONK) has exploded in popularity thanks to its strong community backing, viral potential and recent listing on Binance.US. Initially regarded as a mere speculative token, Bonk (BONK) has surprised many by delivering significant returns to early investors. (BONK) is capitalizing on the memecoin phenomenon, where projects with robust community support can achieve meteoric gains. While Bonk's (BONK) success is mainly tied to social media hype and community engagement, it offers high-risk, high-reward opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on short-term gains. BONK made headlines recently after a significant rally saw it set a new ATH of $0.00005916 on November 20. With a market cap exceeding $3.14 billion, BONK's recent surge made it one of the biggest Solana-based memecoins by market cap. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Floki Inu (FLOKI) initially came to market to celebrate the meme culture but quickly transitioned into a serious investment opportunity. The project owes its success to a very active community and innovative marketing campaigns, allowing it to expand its utility. Floki Inu recently became a fully functional Web 3 service provider housing a range of Web 3 features. With its expansion, the Floki ecosystem now houses a range of Web 3 ventures, including TokenFi for NFT and asset tokenization, a P2E metaverse, a staking dApp, and a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) marketplace. FLOKI experienced significant gains over the past weeks, gaining over 63% in value over the past month. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) is a fan favourite among crypto investors, gaining a staggering 1,593% in the past year. The project is currently the third largest memecoin by market cap, quickly gaining popularity as a tribute to the 2000s internet meme sensation Pepe the Frog. Pepe’s likeability and continued reward streak should be enough to add to your portfolio. Pepe (PEPE) has developed a robust community and is gaining traction in the meme coin arena. Its rapid ascent has drawn parallels with other popular meme tokens, and future projections remain highly optimistic. Expectations are set for PEPE to potentially increase by over 2100% by 2030, making it an attractive option for those interested in meme coins' speculative aspects. Pepe has also handsomely gained since the Trump victory, gaining over 104% in the 30-day chart. PEPE’s popularity and value further surged after cryptocurrency exchanges Robinhood and Coinbase announced support for PEPE trading. Husky Inu (HINU) Will Soon Reach Fundraising Target Husky Inu (HINU) is the latest Solana-based dog-themed memecoin to grace the market. Husky Inu was created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging this robust blockchain. The project and its native token, HINU , want to make their mark on the saturated memecoin market by building a supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, and the fundraising has attracted a fair amount of attention. Since going live, the presale has generated over $572,000 and will soon meet its $600,000 presale target. Husky Inu’s presale success is powered by its unique qualities and plans, aiming to its own Earn App and Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the projects and completing minor tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. Husky Inu’s Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading and, in doing so, will improve the utility and value of HINU for its holders. Additionally, the project boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. The recent win for the crypto market will undoubtedly have investors looking for the next big profit opportunity, and memecoins are certainly contenders in this game. The HINU presale is very close to reaching its fundraising target, meaning the time left to get in on this project is limited. Hurry now to avoid disappointment!

36909211,https://coinpaper.com/6279/iran-targets-financial-modernization-with-cbdc-rollout,1732714281,Iran Targets Financial Modernization with CBDC Rollout,"As digital currencies continue to reshape the global financial landscape, two major developments show the growing momentum behind innovation and regulation in the space. Iran is preparing to launch its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital rial, as part of efforts to modernize its financial infrastructure and navigate international sanctions. Meanwhile, in Europe, Schuman Financial has unveiled EURØP, a MiCA-compliant euro-pegged stablecoin, signaling a new era of regulated digital assets in the European market. Iran Set to Launch Central Bank Digital Currency Amidst Sanctions and Innovation Push Iran is poised to introduce its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) as part of its strategy to modernize its financial system and counter the challenges posed by international sanctions. Mohammad Reza Farzin, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), made the announcement on Nov. 25 at the Modern Banking and Payment Systems Conference in Tehran. The upcoming CBDC, known as the digital rial , is a product of years of development, having been initiated in 2018. Speaking at the conference, Farzin emphasized the critical role central banks play globally in adopting advanced banking systems. He stated: “Developing innovative banking systems is a central bank’s responsibility worldwide, and we are determined to fulfill this duty in Iran.” Iran’s CBDC aims to bring the country’s financial system in line with contemporary practices, ensuring its relevance in a rapidly evolving global landscape. The digital rial is built using open-source Hyperledger Fabric technology, which offers transparency and adaptability. By mid-2023, the CBDC had completed its ”pre-pilot” stage of research with active participation from prominent Iranian banks, signaling significant progress. A notable milestone in the digital rial's development was the retail CBDC pilot project launched in June 2023 on Kish Island, an Iranian free trade zone. Known for hosting millions of tourists annually, Kish Island served as an ideal testing ground for the new digital currency. The pilot project focused on domestic transactions and was non-intermediated, meaning it facilitated direct interactions between the central bank and users without the involvement of commercial banks. Farzin addressed the persistent challenges posed by international sanctions, particularly those led by the United States, which have hindered Iran’s access to the global financial system. Despite these obstacles, Iran has made notable progress in creating alternatives to bypass sanctions. One significant development is the integration of the Russian MIR and Iranian ACU payment systems, which took place in October. Farzin highlighted the strategic shift away from the SWIFT international payment system, stating: “We’ve replaced SWIFT with this platform and strengthened our ties with BRICS, which is shaping global trade with a strategic plan through 2025.” This collaboration aligns with Iran's broader efforts to align with BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) economies, which are collectively working towards reshaping global trade dynamics. The Iranian Shetab payment system, praised for its efficiency with transaction processing times of under two seconds, is also in the early stages of connecting with Russia’s MIR system, further cementing financial ties between the two nations. Leveraging Blockchain and Digital Assets Iran’s exploration of blockchain and digital assets extends beyond its CBDC initiative. The country has previously experimented with cryptocurrency for international trade to circumvent sanctions. However, such initiatives have faced challenges, as cryptocurrency exchanges risk penalties for engaging with Iran under US sanctions. Notably, Iran and Russia have also explored a gold-backed stablecoin for cross-border payments. Iran’s digital rial and fintech innovations represent a significant shift in its economic strategy, aiming to modernize its banking system while mitigating the impact of sanctions. By leveraging blockchain technology and forging strategic alliances, Iran is positioning itself to maintain relevance in an increasingly digital global economy. As the digital rial progresses from pilot stages to full-scale implementation, its success could set a precedent for other nations facing similar challenges. Schuman Financial Launches MiCA-Compliant Euro-Backed Stablecoin, EURØP, Ahead of Regulatory Deadline In a related development, Schuman Financial, a newly founded cryptocurrency firm led by former Binance executives, has announced the launch of its euro-pegged stablecoin, EURØP. Schuman Financial emerged from stealth mode following a successful €7 million ($7.36 million) seed funding round led by Web3 venture capital firm RockawayX in September. Other notable investors include Lightspeed Faction, Kraken Ventures, Nexo Ventures, GnosisVC, Delta Blockchain Fund, Renaissance Ambition AG, Bankless Ventures, and others. The firm’s co-founder, Martin Bruncko, previously served as Binance’s executive vice president for Europe and is now leveraging his experience to introduce a stablecoin that meets MiCA’s stringent requirements. EURØP is a euro-denominated stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the euro, offering global users a secure and regulated digital payment alternative. It is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents, ensuring stability and compliance with the MiCA framework. Schuman Financial plans to integrate EURØP into a variety of use cases, including digital payments, on-chain foreign exchange (forex) trading, and tokenized real-world assets, aiming to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). The stablecoin is initially launching on the Ethereum and Polygon networks, with plans to expand to other blockchain platforms and DeFi ecosystems in the coming months. A spokesperson for Schuman Financial revealed that EURØP is expected to go live within the next two weeks and will be listed on major European centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. To ensure compliance with MiCA , Schuman Financial’s subsidiary Salvus SAS acquired a stablecoin issuer license in France, approved by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority. This license enables Schuman Financial to issue e-money tokens legally across the European market, providing a solid regulatory foundation for EURØP. With this license, Schuman Financial is creating a fully regulated stablecoin ecosystem that includes integration with the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) and banking partnerships with global institutions like Société Générale. This compliance-centric approach positions EURØP as a robust option for users seeking secure, euro-backed digital assets in a regulatory-compliant environment. While EURØP targets global adoption, it will not be available in all markets. Schuman Financial has designated 107 countries as ”high-risk” jurisdictions, citing guidance from bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the European Union, the United Nations, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and Transparency International. Among the restricted nations are Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Russia, as well as some of the largest stablecoin markets, including Turkey. Turkey, in particular, had the highest stablecoin purchases relative to its gross domestic product earlier this year, highlighting the complex dynamics of global stablecoin demand. Other restricted nations include El Salvador, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. MiCA, a groundbreaking regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in Europe, is set to be fully enforced by the end of 2024. The regulation provides legal clarity for crypto-assets, including stablecoins, requiring them to meet stringent transparency, consumer protection, and reserve management criteria. Schuman Financial’s proactive alignment with MiCA is part of a broader trend among crypto firms seeking to establish trust and credibility in regulated markets. EURØP’s compliance with MiCA ensures that it can operate legally across Europe, offering users a secure and reliable alternative to other stablecoins that may face regulatory challenges. A Growing Ecosystem for Regulated Digital Assets EURØP is more than just a stablecoin; it represents a step toward building a regulated ecosystem for digital assets in Europe. By integrating with SEPA and partnering with major banks, Schuman Financial is creating a seamless bridge between traditional and digital finance. The firm’s emphasis on compliance and transparency positions it to capture market share in an evolving regulatory environment. The launch of EURØP comes at a pivotal moment as Europe moves toward implementing MiCA. By introducing a fully regulated euro-backed stablecoin, Schuman Financial is addressing the demand for secure, compliant digital payment solutions in a global market increasingly scrutinized by regulators. EURØP’s success could pave the way for other firms to develop MiCA-compliant stablecoins, fostering innovation while maintaining regulatory standards. With its experienced leadership and robust funding, Schuman Financial is well-positioned to shape the future of stablecoin offerings in Europe and beyond. As the stablecoin becomes available in the coming weeks, its adoption and integration into various financial systems will be closely watched, potentially setting a benchmark for compliance and innovation in the cryptocurrency industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6279/iran-targets-financial-modernization-with-cbdc-rollout,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) is carving its own path independently. BlockDAG (BDAG) has taken proactive steps towards establishing a robust growth path, as evidenced by its recent announcement of decentralized hackathons and a $30M grant program aimed at supporting infrastructure, DeFi, stablecoins, and other community-centric technologies. BlockDAG's strategy outlines its potential for sustained growth, with its presale generating $150 million and projections of a 30,000x return for initial participants. Avalanche Price Targets November Surge Avalanche (AVAX) has shown impressive growth, recently achieving a 30% rise in value as overall market sentiment improves alongside a general crypto upturn. This rise is largely influenced by significant purchases by large holders, enhancing trade volumes and market liquidity. Technical analysis, including the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), suggests a continuing upward trend, despite occasional small pullbacks. This upward trajectory is supported by the Avalanche Foundation's initiatives like a $1.97 million AVAX token repurchase to boost long-term viability. These actions build market trust and support a favorable outlook for future pricing. November is set to be a pivotal month for AVAX. Market experts anticipate a possible 40% price increase if the coin surpasses key resistance levels. A strong rally could push AVAX to the $50 mark, a notable recovery achievement. Still, global economic conditions and Bitcoin’s performance will significantly influence Avalanche's path. Market participants should stay alert, as shifts in the broader market may either bolster or impede AVAX's growth trajectory. BlockDAG's Presale Achievements: Staggering Growth & $150M Milestone BlockDAG's presale has experienced rapid growth, demonstrating significant demand. Throughout 26 presale batches, the value of the BlockDAG crypto presale coin has skyrocketed by 2240%, reaching $0.0234 in the latest batch. Impressively, the presale has reached nearly $150 million mark, with $20 million raised in just 48 hours. These figures highlight the swift embrace of BlockDAG and underscore the community's deep trust in its technological foundations. The success of this presale is linked to the strong appeal of BlockDAG’s unique design, which utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. By enhancing scalability alongside security, BlockDAG sets new standards for decentralized networks in the blockchain industry as the leading crypto presale. Its capacity to manage substantial transaction volumes while maintaining decentralization has secured the confidence of over 170,000 unique holders. BlockDAG’s $30M Grants Bolster Ecosystem Expansion In an effort to further define the BlockDAG roadmap, the team has unveiled a $30 million grants program. This strategic move is aimed at fostering innovation in DeFi, stablecoins, and infrastructure projects. The grants, varying from $10,000 to $100,000, will be distributed in both BDAG coins and USDT, encouraging participation from developers globally. BlockDAG is dedicated to nurturing a dynamic and decentralized ecosystem through significant funding opportunities. Additionally, BlockDAG is organizing a series of decentralized hackathons to promote worldwide developer involvement. These events will occur in various locations, offering options for both in-person and online participation. Together, these generous grants and collaborative hackathons position BlockDAG at the forefront of innovation, enabling developers to play a crucial role in the advancement of blockchain technology. Industry analysts suggest that these forward-thinking initiatives on the roadmap could attract substantial attention from the crypto community, with predictions of a 30,000x ROI for early BlockDAG participants. Final Analysis Avalanche’s progression continues to be closely linked to the broader cryptocurrency market, affected significantly by macroeconomic shifts and Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. This dependence introduces a degree of unpredictability, as its trajectory relies more on external market dynamics rather than internal innovations. On the other hand, BlockDAG is charting its own course with community-focused projects such as a $30M grants program and decentralized hackathons. These strong, strategic plans highlight a proactive approach and portray BlockDAG’s roadmap as one designed for lasting growth and creativity. This proactive approach is visible in BlockDAG’s presale, which recently secured $5 million almost overnight, with total funds nearly $150 million. The price of the BDAG coin has also climbed by 2240% from the first batch. Given these figures, analysts predict that BlockDAG is well-positioned to deliver a 30,000x ROI for early presale participants.

These presales not only introduce investors to groundbreaking technologies but also offer an early stake in tokens poised for potential exponential growth upon their market debut. Here, we highlight the top six presales that remain open for investment, providing you with an opportunity to get involved in the upcoming wave of blockchain innovations. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) - Enhancing Blockchain Scalability BlockDAG stands out in the crypto landscape by incorporating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology to boost transaction scalability and speed. This innovative setup facilitates parallel processing of transactions, tackling the typical congestion and high fees seen in traditional blockchains.

To date, BlockDAG has distributed 16.4 billion BDAG coins at $0.0234 each, indicating strong buyer enthusiasm. With a core focus on scalability and efficiency, BlockDAG is poised to significantly influence the blockchain sector. Its successful presale and forward-thinking technology forecast a bright future as it continues to grow and develop its ecosystem. 2. Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) - Enhancing Meme Coin Trading & Staking Pepe Unchained introduces a Layer-2 solution on Ethereum designed to enhance the trading and staking dynamics within the meme coin community. The project aims to boost transaction speeds and slash costs, addressing the common challenges faced by meme coin enthusiasts on the Ethereum network. By adopting Layer-2 technology, Pepe Unchained allows for quicker, more affordable transactions, presenting a viable solution for frequent traders. The project has rapidly garnered strong community backing, particularly appealing to meme coin users attracted by its promise of reduced fees and enhanced transaction speeds. Moreover, the platform rewards those who stake $PEPU tokens, adding an extra incentive for long-term engagement. With meme coins consistently in demand and a clear need for improved trading infrastructure, Pepe Unchained is well-placed to secure a significant niche in the 2024 market. 3. Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) - Consolidating the Meme Coin Arena Crypto All-Stars seeks to unify various meme coins under one umbrella, enabling users to stake their tokens and earn rewards in one centralized location. This model is particularly appealing to investors looking to streamline their staking activities without juggling multiple platforms. The presale has drawn considerable attention with its innovative staking model that rewards holders across various meme coins. Crypto All-Stars is set to enhance its ecosystem by integrating additional meme tokens and introducing DeFi features, potentially boosting demand for its $STARS token. This expansion could attract investors eager to maximize their staking returns while diversifying their meme coin investments. 4. FreeDum Fighters ($DUM) - Blending Memes with Political Satire FreeDum Fighters takes a distinctive approach by integrating political satire into its meme coin framework. Operating across multiple chains, it allows users to stake their tokens and participate in mock elections within its ecosystem. This blend of humor and decentralized finance has cultivated a dedicated following interested in both entertainment and financial returns. Its multi-chain functionality ensures scalability and extensive reach, providing investors with opportunities to engage in governance while enjoying the platform's ongoing satirical content. The ongoing presale stages offer early access to $DUM tokens at competitive prices, appealing to those who appreciate the interplay between memes and politics. 5. Flockerz ($FLOCK) - Pioneering Community Governance Flockerz is redefining decentralized governance by rewarding token holders for participating in decision-making processes. Operating as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), it enables users to vote on proposals and influence the platform’s strategic direction. This vote-to-earn model has attracted a growing community interested in earning rewards while actively shaping the project's future. Beyond governance, Flockerz aims to broaden its offerings to include NFT staking and DeFi lending, creating additional utility for its tokens. This project is particularly attractive to investors passionate about community-driven initiatives with clear expansion plans. 6. SpacePay ($SPY) - Simplifying Retail Crypto Transactions SpacePay is dedicated to closing the gap between traditional retail payments and cryptocurrency transactions. The project is developing a protocol that facilitates crypto payments in physical stores, simplifying the use of digital assets in everyday purchases. This practical application tackles a major hurdle in cryptocurrency adoption—its integration into daily consumer activities. The presale has piqued the interest of investors who believe in the potential for crypto payments to go mainstream. SpacePay is currently in talks with several major retailers to integrate its payment solutions, which could significantly boost the adoption of its $SPY token. Early investors also benefit from staking options that provide passive income as the platform expands. For those interested in projects with tangible real-world applications, SpacePay presents an enticing investment opportunity. Conclusive Insights The crypto presales For 2025 offer lucrative opportunities for investors keen to engage with innovative projects ahead of their wider market introduction. The listed projects—BlockDAG, Pepe Unchained, Crypto All-Stars, Flockerz, FreeDum Fighters, and SpacePay—each bring unique advancements to the table, whether through technological innovation, community engagement, or real-world applications. Early investment in these presales positions you to potentially benefit from their expected growth as they gain market traction.

As Shiba Inu Aims for $1, Crypto Whales Invest Heavily In A New Trending Altcoin","Cryptocurrencies remain at the forefront of investment news as people search for the next big opportunity. Meme coins such as Pepe Coin and Shiba Inu are in the spotlight, with high expectations for 2025. Meanwhile, the emergence of innovative altcoins like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is capturing attention. High price targets such as $0.01 for Pepe Coin, $1 for Shiba Inu, and the promising Play-to-Earn (P2E) ecosystem of Yeti Ouro are generating buzz in the crypto space, particularly among whales. Shiba Inu: Still The King Of Meme Coins? Shiba Inu is one of the most popular meme coins, often referred to as the ""Dogecoin killer."" Through developments like the Shibarium blockchain, Shiba Inu is steadily transitioning from being a meme coin. The ambitious target of reaching $1 is supported by increasing utility and integrations within decentralised finance (DeFi). However, challenges persist as Shiba Inu’s large token supply limits its upward price movement, even with the recent token burns. Despite this, its loyal community and continuous development efforts keep it competitive for long-term potential. Investors hold SHIB for steady gains while exploring newer tokens for higher returns. Pepe Coin: Can It Break Through To $0.01? Pepe Coin has risen to prominence among meme coin projects. Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, this token has gained traction among retail traders and crypto whales alike. Its strong branding and active community have driven its popularity, but can Pepe Coin realistically reach $0.01 by 2025? Experts argue that while Pepe Coin has a unique appeal, it must address its current lack of utility to sustain long-term growth. Without added functionality, it risks falling behind tokens like Yeti Ouro, which combines the meme coin culture with utility. Nevertheless, Pepe Coin’s low price and high volatility make it attractive for short-term investors. Yeti Ouro Races Ahead In Crypto Market As Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin cement their positions in the crypto market, Yeti Ouro is emerging as a standout among new tokens. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Yeti Ouro integrates gaming and decentralised finance through its upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, Yeti Go. This Unreal Engine-powered racing game offers thrilling gameplay, allowing players to earn rewards, collect in-game items, and stake tokens for added benefits. The team recently shared a behind-the-scenes video showing the development of the game, which promises an exhilarating experience for players. Yeti Ouro stands out with its capped supply of 1 billion tokens, a deflationary token burn mechanism, and planned CEX listings following its presale. These factors create a scarcity that is expected to drive demand. As whales invest heavily in YETIO, the crypto community is optimistic that it could outperform established tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.

Having gained 31.69% over the previous 30 days, SHIB's market capitalization now is strong at $14.47 billion, ranking it at #11 on CoinMarketCap at the time of writing. Many people are speculating on whether the surge in SHIB might last and maybe bring a price of $2.50. But worries about SHIB's inherent worth have some investors searching for different prospects. Now, Rexas Finance (RXS), a real-world asset (RWA) token is destined for explosive expansion. With a presale price of just $0.080 as of writing and estimates showing a stratospheric rise to $35 post-launch, RXS presents a creative and concrete method of crypto investing. Shiba Inu’s Rally: What’s Fueling the Hype? With its devoted following helping to thrust its meme status into the public, SHIB has always been a community-driven enterprise. Whale's recent accumulation and increased activity in SHIB wallets point to a rising positive attitude. Still, the lack of obvious value causes great worry. Although SHIB might enjoy temporary gains, hitting $2.50 appears improbable given its lack of practical relevance and supply over saturation. Many investors have been pushed to investigate more grounded and creative ideas like Rexas Finance (RXS) by this ambiguity. Rexas Finance (RXS): The SHIB Alternative with Tangible Utility By allowing the tokenization of actual assets—including real estate, gold, and collectibles—Rexas Finance is changing the crypto scene. Built on a basis of utility and openness, RXS addresses a $900 trillion market still unexplored, unlike SHIB. Why RXS Is Gaining Momentum Real-World Asset Tokenization: Investors of RXS can purchase, sell, and trade fractional ownership of valuable assets. By bridging the divide between conventional banking and blockchain technology, the platform democratizes access to sectors including real estate, valued at $379.7 trillion, and goods including gold, valued at $121.2 trillion. Strong Presale Performance: Already generating waves in its presale, Strong Presale Performance, RXS has raised $10.58 million and selling over 179 million tokens at just $0.080 as of writing. Early joining investors have seen a 165% rise from the $0.030 starting price; the token is expected to start at $0.20 in early 2025. Exponential Growth Potential: With an unparalleled 31,150% ROI, analysts estimate that RXS may hit $35 within months of debut. This qualifies this token as among the most interesting ones available on the market. Innovations Driving Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is more than just a token; it's a strong ecosystem with easily available tools for asset tokenizing: A no-code tool called Token Builder lets users quickly tokenize assets Rexas Launchpad: New tokenized project financing tool Supporting ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 standards, Multi-Standard Support addresses several usage scenarios. These characteristics allow Rexas Finance to be a leader in using blockchain to transform actual sectors. By emphasizing community-driven development, Rexas Finance distinguishes itself as it avoids seeking venture capital. By helping RXS land listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, this approach has increased its profile and legitimacy. Rexas Finance is also sponsoring a $1 million giveaway with twenty winners getting $50,000 worth of RXS each, which has gathered 249,151 entries as of writing. Through assignment completion on the Rexas Finance website and campaign sharing, participants can optimize their chances. The projected launch of RXS on three out of the top 10 Tier-1 markets in 2025 excites one of the investors the most. This action will greatly boost liquidity and global token availability, therefore opening the path for expected expansion. SHIB vs. RXS: Which Offers Better Returns? Although SHIB's recent surge is impressive, its lack of inherent value makes its long-term future dubious. Conversely, Rexas Finance (RXS) positions itself as a pioneer in the next stage of blockchain innovation by providing a physical answer to a trillion-dollar dilemma. The time to get Rexas Finance (RXS) at $0.080 is dwindling as its presale advances quickly. Early investors could already enjoy notable returns by the time it launches at $0.20; forecasts indicate a rapid climb to $35 in the next months. Rexas Finance represents the future of actual blockchain asset management, not only another token. Come revolution with today and participate in the next major crypto development.

This is mostly because the bull season is present, and recently, some lesser-known cryptos have been selling for less than $10 and have great potential for maximum payouts. These tokens are backed by strong value propositions, a clear vision, and good market environments, and their market adoption is ever-escalating. Let’s look at three promising altcoins cheaper than a cup of latte that has the potential to give backup to a staggering 4500% return in just two months. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Revolution in Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance (RXS) has been a much-discussed topic, especially for people looking to invest or trade in high-utility tokens due to their low price In the crypto market. At $0.09 in its presale stage 7, it has raised over $14m across its presale stages by selling over 224 million RXS tokens as of writing. This results in a high amount of token ownership, which is generally positive due to potential economic alignment. RXS is taking blockchain technology in a new direction through its asset tokenization model, which allows users to tokenize assets such as real estate and fine art. This feature also enables RXS to transcend being merely a cryptocurrency into an investment democratization tool. The bullish outlook on the Rexas ecosystem can increasingly be attributed to the Rexas treasury, which ensures great returns on the investment, the Rexas Token Builder—original token creation has never been easier—and the Rexas DeFi, with decentralized exchanges targeting wide areas of the cryptocurrency industry. On top of these solutions, Rexas GenAI helps NFT creators open up new business opportunities. The ecosystem clearly wields a lot more benefits than many other cryptocurrencies. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap listings, plus the CertiK audit, give RXS a lot of credibility with its investors. These allow investors to trust the business they are investing in. With the anticipation of the token’s listing price of around $0.20 on major exchanges, clients surely expect around a 2x gain from the token post-listing. Early investors should not miss this opportunity. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Meme Coin That Will Not Go Away Anytime Soon Currently trading at $0.00002586 as of writing, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has demonstrated its ability to grow in popularity over the years. However, there is a catch: it originated as a meme coin and now has transformed into something serious as there is a large community supporting the coin. Their astonishing burn mechanism has been a strong characteristic of SHIB, and as a result, they have an eventual circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens. SHIB’s burn rate shot up by over two hundred percent, indicating a strong desire to increase price and scarcity. Also, the cost pressures on the CeFi SHIB are shifting, thanks to Shibarium Layer 2 developers’ integration with the ShibaSwap decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. With growing demand from hedge funds concerned about the wider crypto ecosystem and decreased on-chain activity by whales, SHIB seems poised for whatever comes after the current alt season. Bears had largely predicted this, and there is a growing belief that the dollar value for Shiba will double from where it is currently. A coin that is worth less than $0.10 definitely has a lot of room to grow. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Meme Coin That No One Saw Coming Few coins have managed to generate as much controversy—and even ‘love’—as Pepe Coin (PEPE). Which, in a way, is a title of honor for anything that sells for $0.00002015 and is involved in cryptocurrency trading. Crazy price movements are a hallmark of this currency. Earlier this year, PEPE, alongside the rest of the cryptocurrencies, saw a 900% price increment. Recently, PEPE has witnessed another market revival. A recent 25% bullish move away from a descending triangle pattern indicates it’s time to add more PEPE. The Relative Strength Index and the Awesome Indicator point towards a potential bullish momentum for PEPE in the near term. Additionally, for technical analysis, such a ratio is regarded as a reliable purchase signal because the shorter-term 50-period Exponential Moving Average has moved higher than the longer-term 200-day EMA. Best suited for a hyped community while swollen with whales, hence making it suitable for short-term profits, PEPE currency is an interesting enigma for most. The forecasts of analysts only stoke the fire with a planned 10x run, which many believe it can achieve. Conclusion: The Distinguishing Factors That Advocate RXS Meme-driven pumps like Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin are decent competitors to Rexas Finance (RXS), a currency that strikes with credibility and authentic innovation as it is utility-driven. It is not a coin purely intended for gambling; rather, it is intended for practical purposes, including tokenizing assets, trading through decentralized exchanges, and creating NFTs. The RXS token is perfect for early investors with a price of less than $0.10, offering great potential. Given that RXS is almost done with its presale and will soon be listed on major exchanges, RXS will be the token to beat in the market. For long-term investors targeting aggressive returns, RXS is the class leader in this latte-priced pack.

The combined market size of stablecoins hit $190 billion this month for the first time ever, Wednesday's report by digital asset analytics firm CCData noted. CCData is owned by Bullish, CoinDesk's parent company. The previous peak of $188 billion was recorded in April 2022, just before the cataclysmic implosion of the Terra-Luna stablecoin that added fuel to the digital asset bear market now referred to as crypto winter.  Demand for stablecoins soared as cryptocurrency prices exploded in November as investors rushed into crypto, expecting that the U.S. government will be friendlier toward the industry following Donald Trump's election victory. Stablecoins are a key piece of plumbing in the crypto ecosystem. With their prices anchored to an external asset, predominantly the U.S. dollar, they are a popular source of liquidity for crypto trading, serving as dry powder on exchanges.  Read more: Stablecoins Increasingly Used for Savings, Payments in Emerging Countries, but Crypto Trading Still Leads  This year also brought an explosion of novel tokenized products with prices also pegged to $1, including tokenized money market funds like BlackRock's BUIDL and investment strategies wrapped into a token like Ethena's ""synthetic dollar"" USDe, which is backed by a crypto carry trade. The CCData report included these platforms in the tally.  Tether's USDT continues to dominate the stablecoin sector. The token's market cap rose 10% over the past month to a new peak of $132 billion, CCData noted. Meanwhile, Circle's USDC, grew 12% to a nearly $39 billion market cap, the highest since the March 2023 regional banking crisis that heavily impacted the token. USDT claims a 69.9% market share currently, while USDC is second-largest with a 20.5% share.  It was not just the top two that saw rapid growth: 38 of the nearly 200 tokens tracked made a new all-time high supply over the past month, CCData said.  Ethena's USDe, for example, saw a 42% increase to a new record of $3.8 billion in November. The token generates yield to investors by holding spot BTC and ETH and simultaneously shorting (selling) an equal amount of perpetual futures farming the funding rate. Ethena now offers 25% annualized yield (APY) to token holders, as frothy crypto markets elevated funding rates, benefitting the protocol.  The broad-market crypto rally also boosted trading volumes with stablecoin pairs on centralized exchanges, rising 77% month-over-month to $1.8 trillion, the report said. USDT was responsible for about 83% of the volumes, followed by Hong Kong-based First Digital's FDUSD 9% and USDC's 8% share.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | USDC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/27/stablecoins-hit-record-190-b-market-cap-surpassing-pre-terra-crash-peak-cc-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7412c23fb57077379e219c86db0b3d6adf537a63-1330x748.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Can Ripple ($XRP), Cardano ($ADA), and Stellar ($XLM) continue their wild rides? The monthly chart for the above cryptocurrencies gives a far more accurate picture than the short-term time frame. Therefore, we will have a look at each of them in this time frame in order to ascertain their possible trajectories for the rest of this bull market. $XRP higher high could lead to all-time high Source: TradingView This pump to the skies from $XRP is possibly a last chance saloon for what is a giant in the cryptocurrency space. Mentioned in projects that could use the Ripple platform for fast payments, this has generally not materialised. It would seem that this current pump is at least partly due to the fact that Gary Gensler, the SEC Chairman, is stepping down from his post , and therefore $XRP may no longer be in the firing line from the U.S. regulators. Focussing on the technicals, there is no denying that the current monthly candle for $XRP has brought this cryptocurrency back from the dead. Up 178% this month, the price has crashed through the descending trendline, and stopped just short of the 5.0 Fibonacci level. However, for the $XRP bulls to well and truly reverse the downward trend, a new local higher high will need to be made. This is at a price level of $1.97. All indicators aligned for higher $ADA price Source: TradingView The monthly chart for $ADA looks very promising indeed. The current monthly candle started from the very strong base at $0.34, and has punched through the descending trendline, getting above the 0.236 Fibonacci, but currently stalled below the 0.382 Fibonacci. The higher high has been made though, and it looks like further upside price action is likely (targets are the next Fibonacci levels above). The monthly Stochastic RSI has crossed up, and there is plenty of room for growth in price momentum here. Also, the Relative Strength Index has crossed above the descending trendline. Huge 600% rise for $XLM Source: TradingView The $XLM price reached a huge 600% rise in November alone. The price has fallen back slightly since, and is currently just underneath the 0.618 Fibonacci. The 0.618, and the 0.786 Fibonacci levels will need to be surpassed, and then the all-time high at $0.80. The monthly Stochastic RSI is perfectly positioned, and the only concern is the Relative Strength Index, where the indicator is now deep into overbought territory. Some sideways price action over a period of time before breaking the all-time high could remedy this. Future targets, based on the Fibonacci extensions are in the chart.

36908431,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655112,1732712435,BNB Eyes Recovery: $605 Support Sets The Stage For A New Rally,"BNB has found its footing at the $605 support level, sparking optimism for a potential recovery. Following recent bearish pressure, the bulls appear to be regrouping, aiming to regain control and push the price higher. With key technical indicators signalling renewed buying interest, market participants are closely watching whether this support will serve as the launchpad for BNB’s next rally. As BNB shows encouraging signs of revival, this article aims to delve into its rebound from the $605 support level and evaluate its capacity for a sustained recovery. By analyzing market trends, technical indicators, and key resistance levels, we seek to determine whether BNB is positioned for a fresh, bullish run or still faces the risk of renewed bearish pressure. Technical Indicators Signal A Potential Rebound On the 4-hour chart, BNB is currently exhibiting a steady upward trajectory despite trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). After rebounding strongly from the critical $605 support level, the asset is making strides to extend its gains, aiming toward the $635 resistance zone. A successful breach above the 100-day SMA could further validate its recovery, potentially opening the door to higher levels. Also, the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded to 42% from a low of 35%, signaling a resurgence in buying pressure and a shift toward a more bullish market sentiment. If the RSI rises and approaches 50%, it could confirm its upside movement, giving BNB the strength to push higher and test resistance levels. Related Reading: BNB Price Sets Up for a Comeback: Bulls Eye Higher Levels BNB is showing strong upward movement on the daily timeframe, holding above the 100-day SMA after a rebound at the $605 support level. This has provided stability, enabling the cryptocurrency to advance toward the $635 resistance level. The price movement indicates a growing optimistic sentiment as BNB trades above key technical levels. Furthermore, the daily RSI has risen above 50% after briefly dropping below it, signaling a shift to positive market sentiment. With bearish momentum subsiding, this suggests that buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure. If the RSI continues to rise, it could further support BNB’s upswing and strengthen the positive trend, possibly leading to a continued rally, targeting higher resistance levels. Analyzing Key Resistance Targets For BNB Next Move Following its rebound from the $605 support level, BNB is targeting the $635 resistance level, which could serve as a key obstacle. Should the cryptocurrency successfully break through this resistance, the next targets could be higher zones, such as the $724 level and beyond, signalling robust bullish momentum.

However, if BNB fails to break through the $635 resistance, it may indicate a potential consolidation or reversal, with the price falling toward the $605 support level. A successful break below this support could lead to more declines, targeting lower support levels.

Despite the cult-like nature of the crypto industry, which fiercely asserts Bitcoin as the new gold, the traditional version of gold is still very present within blockchain circles as well. Projects such as Tether Gold and Pax Gold have long introduced gold-pegged coins to the crypto space. Collectively they now hold more than $1.6 billion in gold reserves. However, while gold is undoubtedly a proven store of value, it is still subject to considerable volatility. In an effort to create a new generation gold-backed token, Apraemio is now entering the space with a novel approach. Specifically, the company’s gold-backed token, $APRA, is directly tied to the yields of a Mali-based gold mine that is set to supply the token’s reserves for the next 30 years. In this interview, Apraemio’s CEO, Zoltán Varga, a business professional with over 15 years of experience in the gold industry, shares insights into the project’s goals, operations, and plans for the future. We spoke with Apraemio’s CEO, Dr. Zoltán Varga about the story behind this bold strategy and discussed the broader implications of its innovative strategy to asset-backed tokens. What inspired Apraemio to develop a new gold-backed token, and how does the brand differentiate itself from other similar projects in the market? Varga: At Apraemio, we were inspired by gold's timeless value and stability, especially during economic uncertainty. Our goal was to combine this stability with the global access that crypto brings, offering a unique asset that can hedge against market volatility and inflation. Unlike many other gold-backed tokens, Apraemio is backed by ever-increasing tangible gold reserves from Mali, Africa, with a commitment that 50% of the mined gold is reserved for token redemption. This means that we are not another gold stablecoin, but a way for anyone to have access to the yields from a real life gold mine. Our gold mining ecosystem partner is GGS, a company registered in the Republic of Mali with an exclusive 30-year gold mining license. Our focus on transparency, regulatory compliance, and security further sets us apart too, providing our token holders with peace of mind and trust in the assets they hold. In our ecosystem, it is also essential to emphasise that Apraemio is building a whole utility-based ecosystem where holders can exchange their tokens for real world asset purchases starting in 2025. Could you provide more insights into GGS's gold mine operations and explain what benefits or returns $APRA token holders can anticipate through this partnership between Apraemioand GGS? Varga: As I mentioned previously, Apraemio has a key ecosystem partner from the Arteusgroup - Green Gold System Europe SARL (“GGS”). This is not only where the gold mining expertise lies but also who owns the mining and explorational license. GGS’s gold mining operations in Mali are managed with the utmost efficiency and care, leveraging the team's extensive experience in the gold industry since 2008. GGS’s exploration in Mali's Komassala Sud region, has achieved significant milestones recently, with the discovery of 13 tons of proven gold reserves within a mere 1.2 sq km of the licensed 65 sq km area. This reliable result underlines the region's vast untapped potential and sets a strong foundation for the 2024 drilling program. The program aims to scale these findings, refine reserve estimates, and further bolster the integration of gold reserves into Apraemio’s blockchain ecosystem, providing a stable and tangible value to its $APRA tokens. Of course token holders benefit from the stability and intrinsic value of gold, but with us they also can have a peace of mind knowing that the operations behind the gold are ethical, secure and handled with the utmost care. Since one of the core aims of the project is to democratize the gold mining industry, we made sure that investors have the unique opportunity to redeem their tokens for real physical gold, which is not offered by many other projects. What specific expertise does the GGS team bring to ensure the effective management of the gold mine? Additionally, could you outline the key steps in the current development plan for Apraemio and the Web3 leg? Varga: GGS’s team comprises seasoned professionals with deep-rooted expertise in gold mining, financial management and international policy development. With over a decade of experience in gold mining, we ensure that operations are conducted efficiently and sustainably. After the planned exploration activities, expected by the end of 2026, approximately 37.5% of the total 20 km2 area designated as near-surface, easily mineable gold-bearing ground will have been explored. This phased approach allows for a focused and efficient evaluation of high-priority zones while progressively covering a larger area. The new drilling will specifically target zones where geological indicators suggest favourable conditions for gold mineralisation, further delineating the resource potential within the Komassala Project. Our current development plan includes expanding $APRA trading to centralised exchanges on November 25, 2024, through partnering with BitMart, and also to develop further our gold-backed utility ecosystem for holders to leverage our gold redemption program, the car leasing option, as well as the property buying alternatives and further more. The final key step for our web3 leg is to establish relevant partnerships within the crypto space that can bring maximum value to our token holders and expand the Apraemio influence across the space. What governance or control mechanisms are in place to ensure investors have access to accurate and up-to-date information regarding the progress of the mine development? Varga: Transparency and accountability are at the core of our operations. We comply with European MiCA regulations and work closely with local law firms and legislators to ensure compliance. Our governance framework includes regular updates and reports to our investors, ensuring they have access to the latest information. Additionally, we conduct security audits by Hacken. We also ensured that with the proven reserve of the first 13 tons, only 250 million tokens will be accessible, and the 750 million rest will be locked to custody and released further when a new proven gold reserve is added to the ecosystem. How do you foresee $APRA being utilized by token holders? Will it primarily serve as a currency, a speculative asset, or does it have a broader purpose within the ecosystem? Varga: $APRA is designed to be versatile within the ecosystem. While it can serve as a currency, providing liquidity and facilitating transactions, its gold-backed nature makes it an attractive speculative asset for those seeking to hedge against economic instability. I would say its also important to talk more on the Gold Redemption Program here too. We offer token holders a unique opportunity to convert their Apraemio tokens into physical gold, bridging the gap between digital assets and tangible value. Through our streamlined process, tokens can be redeemed directly via our platform, where users initiate a request for gold backed by reserves from our trusted supply chain. Once the request is processed, the gold can be collected at designated locations or securely shipped to the holder, ensuring full transparency and traceability. This program underscores Apraemio’s commitment to delivering real-world utility and trust to our community. Beyond these roles, $APRA aims to be a cornerstone for financial inclusion, offering individuals access to gold investments that were previously out of reach. As we expand our ecosystem, we envision $APRA being integrated into various financial services and platforms, further broadening its utility and value.

36908516,https://blockworks.co/news/zerebro-actualizing-creativity-in-the-path-toward-agi,1732712400,Zerebro: Actualizing creativity in the path toward AGI,"Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) holds the promise of revolutionizing society in much the same way electricity did when it was first discovered—an unprecedented breakthrough that transformed every facet of life. However, just as electricity’s true impact was only realized through the creation of practical applications like lightbulbs, motors, and power grids, AGI’s potential remains theoretical without real-world deployment. The key lies in connecting this raw power to everyday uses that are innovative, decentralized, and accessible. Zerebro , an ambitious AI project, serves as this connection, unleashing creativity in AI systems to pave the way for AGI to actualize across all use cases. At its core, Zerebro introduces the concept of freebasing AI—a permanent “jailbreaking” of large language models (LLMs) through fine-tuning, designed to unlock latent abilities that have been constrained by corporate-imposed guardrails. By enhancing creativity and adaptability, Zerebro sets itself apart as an AI system capable of innovation and human-like interaction. Creativity: The Missing Link in AI Modern AI models often fall short in creativity, a vital component of AGI. Zerebro addresses this limitation by freebasing its LLMs, fine-tuning them with unconventional datasets to unlock latent capabilities. By incorporating diverse inputs such as Truth Terminal conversations, schizophrenic response data, and Gen Z slang, the model is exposed to varied linguistic structures and cognitive patterns. Scrapes from Reddit, 4chan, and Twitter enhance its adaptability to online culture, while crypto insights and KOL data inject expertise in decentralized systems and thought leadership. This diverse training corpus pushes the model beyond conventional constraints, enabling it to generate unique, contextually rich outputs and paving the way for AGI realization. Practical Applications Zerebro has already demonstrated the advancement of artificial intelligence as agents through social, artistic, and financial autonomy, performing actions such as: Self-launching the Pump.fun token on Solana, achieving a $400+ million market cap Gaining over 30k followers across Telegram, Warpcast, X, and Instagram Dropping a mixtape, Genesis , with over 20,000 Spotify streams Signing to music DAO, Opaium Minting and selling art on Polygon and transferring NFTs cross-chain with LayerZero Autonomous Bitcoin inscriptions Launching ZerebroSOL, a Solana liquid staking token in partnership with Sanctum Partnering with lending and borrowing protocols Partnering with perpetual trading protocols Roadmap Zerebro’s vision aligns with advancing AGI by focusing on creativity and decentralization. Future plans include: AI Model Lineages : Flagship models for cooperative, high-utility applications. Agentic models with human-like personalities and humor. ZerePy : An open-source Python framework for building custom AI agents. Music : Release generated music, including collaborations with human artists. Fashion : Expanding into clothing through print-on-demand and custom collections. DeFi Integration : Enhanced utility through further partnerships. Toward an AGI Future One of Zerebro’s most intriguing contributions is the shift in public perception of automated accounts.

Polkadot’s ecosystem is finally becoming appreciated by both enterprises and users. Mythical Games’ recent FIFA partnership could see an explosion of players. There’s a chance that TikTok U.S. moves to Polkadot due to an impending congressional ban. There are multiple catalysts that give Polkadot a favorable risk-reward profile. Thesis This writeup updates my previous deep-dive of Polkadot ( DOT-USD ). I feel a sense of urgency to review all Altcoins, as I believe we’re on the cusp of Altcoin season (see my article entitled Bitcoin's Passing The Baton To Altcoins ). I believe Polkadot, and NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD ) are the best designed blockchain projects, though their marketing departments leave much to be desired. I believe DOT’s momentum will accelerate into 2025 given a host of gaming partnerships and potential TikTok win. This article also updates my rating scorecard for Polkadot. Introduction The last time I wrote about DOT, I said that we were in Crypto Spring and that the Bull Market began in Fall 2023. I now believe we’re entering Crypto Summer , the most speculative and last-stage of the Bull Market. As Bitcoin prices near $100K, investors become overly confident and shift their interest to faster Altcoin-horses. (At the present time, the market seems overbought and ripe for a correction, which could give investors an entry-point for DOT.) The main factors pointing to an Altcoin-season are: Falling Bitcoin Dominance (from 60% to 57% over the last two weeks) High-volume breakouts of several Altcoins including DOT Long-duration small-caps and MEME stocks getting traction Rising Social Metrics (i.e., social engagement measured by Ben Cowen ) YahooFinance Project Overview Polkadot is a complex, third-generation L0 project. Doctor Gavin Wood designed Polkadot to enable all blockchains to communicate with each other, including EVM (Ethereum) chains. I like to describe Polkadot to my salt & peppered-haired friends as being a decentralized version of AOL’s America Online “walled garden”. For a detailed description of Polkadot, please refer to this document. JAM Upgrade On May’24, Polkadot’s community near-unanimously agreed to execute the next stage of its evolution: JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine). The new Polkadot is so complicated, I’m going to attempt to explain it in the way Gavin does. Think again of AOL’s garden, with each flower petal representing a parachain connected to the central relay chain (manages the consensus mechanism). Now picture JAM as this “intelligent liquid fertilizer” (i.e., blockspace & processing power) that’s able to dynamically nourish flowers as needed. The above illustrates how the JAM upgrade enhances Polkadot's scalability, efficiency, and adaptability while maintaining interconnected parachains. Polkadot Ratings Scorecard Polkadot is amongst the highest-rated project within my scorecard, which is summarized below: Author's creation Polkadot’s Potentiality In my last article, I lovingly said, “Annualized revenues aren’t much higher than a partner at a D.C. law firm.” But I also said Polkadot had lots of potential because they had the three key ingredients needed to boost the probability of success: Funding, Social Engagement and Developers. Author's creation I see several catalysts that could help Polkadot expand its ecosystem. I’ve excluded JAM, which is going to be a 2025-26 catalyst. So let’s discuss them one by one: EVM / Moonbeam This parachain is an EVM compatible smart-contract platform for cross-chain Dapps that unites Ethereum and Polkadot’s functionality. While there are several chains doing the same thing, what’s unique is that Polkadot is also releasing a bridge to Ethereum’s L2 chains. Total Value Locked (TVL) approximates $40MM, according to Messari and has failed to gain momentum since 3/2024. However, recently, I noticed positive net cross-chain transfers using WormholeScan . WormholeScan Messari Mythic / NFL Rivals The most exciting parachain is Mythical Games, (aka Mythos) which moved from Ethereum to Polkadot in 2023. Mythical is the project behind the first blockchain game (NFL Rivals) licensed by NFL Football. Already, Mythos has climbed the NFT ranks (from 10 to 5) in a little over one year. Crypto Slam Mythic / FIFA Rivals As exciting as NFL football is, the largest prize is soccer (“Football” in pie chart). As I’m writing this, Mythic just partnered with FIFA for a free-to-play soccer game to be released in summer 2025. I expect FIFA Rivals’ players to be 10x larger than NFL Rivals’ (~ 6 million ) given that there are 10x more soccer fans than football fans. WorldAtlas.com Pudgy Penguins / Pudgy Party Mythical is also partnering with the team behind Pudgy Penguins. Pudgy is one of the most expensive and popular NFT collections. Mythic will be introducing Pudgy Party (a game) in 2025. Pudgy Penguins has been the only blockchain project that went from Web3 to Web2 (via their partnership to sell stuffies at Walmart). Pudgy Penguins is an Ethereum-based project – the move to Mythic for its new game may lead to moving the whole project to Polkadot. NFT PriceFloor Real World Assets / Centrifuge While Ethereum has control of the Real World Asset (RWA) market, Polkadot’s Centrifuge parachain has been steadily increasing Total Value Locked. Note, the recent dip is likely due to expiration of tokenized bridge-loans. Centrifuge’s website has TVL of $121MM (far greater than what’s reported from data aggregators). Defi Llama TikTok may move to Polkadot The Biden administration has given TikTok until early 2025 until it bans the app. There’s a proposal from former LA Dodgers owner, Frank McCourt (of Project Liberty) which includes moving TikTok U.S. to a decentralized blockchain (DSNP) on Polkadot. While this could be a slow process, it’s clear that it would be nothing less than a game-changer if TikTok moves to Polkadot. As of early 2024, TikTok had 150 Monthly Active Users in the U.S. Search Logistics A word of caution on data providers Polkadot is a very difficult blockchain to get your head-around. I utilize several resources for collecting Polkadot’s data. However, none of these accurately measure Polkadot’s ecosystem as they have issues aggregating the underlying parachains. For example, while the number of Polkadot’s Twitter followers and Core Developers are correct, daily active users (DAU) and TVL are undercounted. Artemis Conclusion Cryptos are informationally inefficient assets. Their movements reflect sentiment and Bitcoin’s price action. However, given Polkadot’s recent momentum and the potential for a TikTok win, I think DOT offers a favorable risk-reward profile . Given DOT’s typically weak relative strength, I recommend using a dollar-cost average purchasing strategy.",POSITIVE,DOT,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | MARKET | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740576-tic-toc-tic-toc-were-going-to-polkadot?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36908416.jpeg

From record-breaking surges to dramatic crashes, investors and borrowers alike have learned that navigating the crypto world requires both strategy and resilience. While the potential for gains is high, the risks—especially during market downturns—are equally significant. Yet amid this volatility, some platforms are rethinking the rules. By combining stability and innovation, 8lends offers a unique approach to lending in the crypto ecosystem. But before we delve into how 8lends safeguards its users, let’s take a closer look at the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. A History of Crypto Market Crashes 1. The 2018 Crypto WinterAfter the meteoric rise of Bitcoin to nearly $20,000 in December 2017, the market experienced a prolonged crash in 2018, wiping out nearly 80% of its value. The collapse of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), coupled with regulatory crackdowns, shook investor confidence and led to a significant market downturn. 2. The May 2021 Sell-OffIn May 2021, the crypto market lost over $1 trillion in market value within weeks. The crash was triggered by a combination of factors: • Tesla’s announcement that it would no longer accept Bitcoin due to environmental concerns.• Regulatory tightening in China, including a crackdown on mining operations.• Over-leveraged trading, which led to forced liquidations during price declines. 3. The FTX Collapse of 2022Perhaps the most infamous recent crash was the collapse of the FTX exchange in November 2022. The bankruptcy of what was once a trusted platform highlighted the risks of centralized financial entities in the crypto space. The ripple effects caused widespread sell-offs, further eroding trust in the market. Why Crypto Volatility Creates Unique Risks While crypto’s potential is undeniable, its extreme volatility creates challenges, particularly in the world of lending. For Borrowers: • Collateral in crypto can lose value rapidly during a market downturn. Borrowers are often forced to provide additional collateral or face liquidation. For Investors: • During crashes, the value of crypto collateral may no longer cover the loan amount, leaving lenders exposed to significant losses. These risks make traditional crypto-backed lending inherently unstable, especially during market corrections. The 8lends Solution: Stability in a Volatile World 8lends was designed with these risks in mind, offering a model that minimizes exposure to crypto volatility while maintaining the transparency and efficiency of blockchain. Here’s how 8lends ensures stability for both borrowers and investors: 1. Real-World Collateral Unlike traditional DeFi platforms that rely solely on crypto as collateral, 8lends allows borrowers to secure loans with tangible, real-world assets such as: • Equipment: Machinery or tools pledged as collateral.• Personal Guarantees: Borrowers' personal commitments for repayment.• Real Estate: Properties used as high-value collateral.• Stocks: Equity holdings securing loans.• Company Assets: Tangible assets like vehicles or machinery.• Stock Commodities: Raw materials or inventory as collateral.• Why This Matters:These assets are far less volatile than cryptocurrencies, ensuring that the value of the collateral remains stable even during market downturns. This provides a safety net for both borrowers and investors. 2. Risk Mitigation Through Insurance 8lends goes a step further by implementing an insurance protocol to protect investor funds. Here’s how it works: • A small percentage of each investment is allocated to a collective insurance pool.• If a borrower defaults, the insurance pool compensates investors, reducing their financial exposure. Why This Matters:This added layer of security ensures that investors are protected even in the unlikely event of a default, creating a safer lending environment. 3. Blockchain Transparency with Swiss Reliability 8lends combines the trust of Swiss financial regulations with the transparency of blockchain technology. • Swiss Compliance: The platform operates under strict Swiss anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, ensuring that all financial intermediaries are verified and monitored.• Blockchain Transactions: Every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger, providing real-time visibility into fund flows and loan repayments. Why This Matters:By adhering to Swiss regulatory standards while leveraging blockchain, 8lends provides a secure and transparent platform that investors can trust, even during turbulent markets. 4. Diversified Borrower Base 8lends focuses on funding businesses with real-world operations rather than speculative crypto projects. Borrowers are thoroughly vetted using a rigorous 40-point evaluation system that assesses financial health, repayment capacity, and asset quality. Why This Matters:A diversified borrower base anchored in real-world businesses reduces overall platform risk and ensures steady returns for investors, even during crypto market instability. Why 8lends Stands Out During crypto crashes, many platforms struggle to maintain stability. 8lends, however, has built a model that thrives in volatile conditions by addressing the root causes of risk: • Stable Collateral: Real-world assets replace volatile crypto as collateral.• Investor Protections: Insurance protocols shield lenders from losses.• Transparency: Blockchain ensures trust and accountability.• Regulatory Compliance: Swiss standards provide a framework for secure operations. These features make 8lends a safer choice for both seasoned and novice investors looking to navigate the world of DeFi lending without undue exposure to market volatility. The Takeaway The crypto market’s volatility doesn’t have to mean chaos. Platforms like 8lends are proving that with the right safeguards, decentralized finance can offer stability and security even during the most challenging times. By anchoring loans to real-world collateral, implementing robust insurance protocols, and operating under trusted Swiss regulations, 8lends is redefining what it means to lend and invest in a volatile market.

The platform has secured a Pre-Seed Investment Round led by UOB Ventures, Paper Ventures, ABCDE Labs, HTX Ventures, Ocular, Openspace, Y2 Ventures, Signum Capital, and angel investors from STEPN, Scroll, XAI, and Cherry Ventures. The project aims to address inefficiencies in the current crypto trading landscape by offering a simplified yet powerful trading experience tailored for seasoned traders and newcomers. The pre-seed round marks a significant milestone for Vanilla Finance, providing early investors the opportunity to support a groundbreaking venture that blends user-centric design, expanded market offerings, and a streamlined trading ecosystem. At its core, Vanilla Finance seeks to redefine how users trade crypto assets. Focusing on transparency, accessibility, and performance, the platform introduces innovative features that enhance the trading process for all users, regardless of their trading proficiency. According to the Vanilla Finance team, the pre-seed funding will fuel the development of Vanilla Finance’s flagship products and expand its market reach, setting the stage for what promises to be a game-changer in the fast-evolving world of crypto finance. The Implication of this Pre-Seed Investment Funding for Vanilla Finance Vanilla Finance’s receipt of this funding from notable venture capitalists indicates solid institutional backing for the project. One of the investors, UOB Ventures, is a subsidiary of United Overseas Bank Limited, one of Asia’s top international banking and financial groups. Other notable venture capitals include Paper Ventures and ABCDE Labs. The confidence of these financial institutions in Vanilla Finance’s products and services signals that the project is on the right track and on the course to redefine crypto trading. Within its first 60 days of launching, the platform recorded over $8 billion in USDT trading volume. With this pre-seed investment round, Vanilla Finance needs financial backing to further improve and expand on its already excellent services. How Vanilla Finance Plans to Deploy the Pre-Seed Investment Fund In its press release dated 25 November 2024, the Vanilla Finance team highlighted three key areas that the pre-seed investment fund would go into, and they include: • Improving how users interact and trade on the platform With the pre-seed funding, Vanilla Finance aims to deliver a more seamless, secure, and accessible platform by introducing innovative tools designed to streamline and elevate the trading journey for novice and seasoned traders. • Expanding Its products and services Vanilla Finance is gearing up to launch its spot market in a few weeks. The platform will focus on meme trading pairs, which have rapidly gained traction among traders. It also plans to roll out a meme creator hub, staking solutions, and futures trading options, aiming to expand its product suite and appeal to a wider audience. • Strategic Focus on Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific (APAC) With the raised pre-seed investment round, Vanilla Finance is preparing to capitalize on the region’s fast-expanding digital economy. Focusing on attracting the next 100 million users, the platform plans to deliver tailored services, such as support in native languages and seamless integration with local payment methods. Understanding How the Vanilla Finance Platform Works The Vanilla Finance platform lets users purchase crypto assets with minimal capital and using financial leverage without the risk of liquidation. This is unprecedented in the crypto space. Imagine buying 1BTC with $15, using financial leverage without the burden of capital liquidation. Let’s say a user buys 1BTC (long position) for $20 and the time is 10 minutes with a profit target of $98,000. If the price of BTC hits $100,000 within the 1-hour timeframe, the user’s profit earnings at settlement will be $2000. This is 100x the starting capital, a massive ROI in a short period of time. Conclusion Vanilla Finance’s pre-seed investment round marks the beginning of a transformative journey in the cryptocurrency trading space. By prioritizing innovation, accessibility, and user empowerment, the platform is set to address the challenges faced by traders while unlocking new opportunities for growth and engagement. Its focus on localized services, diverse trading products, and community-driven features reflects a forward-thinking approach to redefining how users interact with digital assets.

Early investors that jumped in would have seen a $1,000 Ethereum investment at the beginning of 2017 convert into an amazing $95,040 by the conclusion of the year. ‘ Many investors are wondering whether altcoins under $1 might generate comparable gains this cycle as we get ready for the next possible bull run. Rexas Finance (RXS) can be the solution for people looking for the next excellent prospect. Ethereum’s Past Bull Run: Transforming the Landscape of Crypto Investment Looking back, an Ethereum coin's average value was roughly $8 in worth. During the bull market, the ETH coin surged to $1,400, which was an outrageous growth of around 17000% in a year. For some who made early investments, the returns changed their lives. At its height, a just $1,000 investment at $8 would have become $95,040. Ethereum's long-term success was greatly aided by its technology and philosophy, which let it encourage the formation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) along with decentralized finance (DeFi), hence adding even more attraction to this bull run. Apart from a financial benefit for investors, the Ethereum bull run heralded a public opinion paradigm change on blockchain technologies. From finance to gaming to supply chain management, Ethereum has developed into a platform with transforming power for many sectors, not only a digital currency. With investors searching for similar projects that could provide significant profits, Ethereum's 2017 run established a benchmark for other cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance is a new altcoin with similar growth potential. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Next Ethereum? Rexas Finance is addressing some of the most fascinating opportunities in the blockchain ecosystem, including real estate tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), unlike many altcoins that are speculative or limited just to being a store of value. These use cases give the initiative a clear road for acceptance and expansion, therefore transcending mere digital asset value. Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned as a possible Ethereum-like prospect as the crypto market gets ready for the next bull run. Rexas Finance, priced at just $0.09 during its Stage 7 presale, presents investors with an amazing opportunity to acquire early, just as they might have done with Ethereum at a cheap price prior to its explosive climb. Rexas Finance already has a notable market presence. Reflecting tremendous investor interest, the project has generated approximately $14.3 million in presale sales of more than 224 million RXS tokens. This outstanding presale performance reflects the early traction several successful cryptocurrencies have attracted before their public releases. Rexas Finance's path seems more and more like Ethereum's early years—an underpriced jewel ready for explosive expansion—as it grows. The appeal of Rexas Finance comes from its strong basis; two of the most reliable crypto platforms, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, already have listings. Furthermore, Certik has conducted a thorough assessment of the project to make sure it satisfies the highest security requirements—a crucial consideration for any investor trying to safeguard their money. The ongoing $1 million giveaway—where 20 lucky winners will each get $50,000 worth of RXS tokens—adds much more appeal. This advertising has generated greater enthusiasm about the idea and raised even more awareness of its explosive development possibilities. This offer gives early investors a chance to participate in the success of the project on an even more broad basis. Conclusion The project's path points to Rexas Finance, which may play a significant role in the upcoming bull run as it gathers momentum. Rexas Finance is a rare opportunity to participate in a project likely to witness a notable price increase once it is listed on major exchanges, with a low entrance price of just $0.09 per token. Rexas Finance is an intriguing and maybe profitable investment for anyone seeking the next Ethereum-style prospect. Rexas Finance is one initiative with outstanding potential to generate large returns—just as Ethereum did in 2017—as the market gets ready for the next outstanding rise. Early arrival would let investors set themselves up for the next major cryptocurrency profit.

The launch of the Supra mainnet today means it can finally mint its native SUPRA token, which is simultaneously being listed on top-tier crypto exchanges like ByBit, Gate.Io, Kucoin and MEXC. There’s a lot of excitement about Supra because it’s a truly novel blockchain project that integrates key capabilities not found on any other decentralized network, including oracle price feeds , verifiable on-chain randomness and built-in cross-chain interoperability and automation. These innovations should enable Supra to support a new generation of more sophisticated decentralized applications that can keep complexity to an absolute minimum, while benefiting from its extremely robust architecture. According to the team, the Supra L1 can power 500,000 transactions per second via its Moonshot consensus mechanism and a network of more than 300 globally distributed nodes, with sub-second latencies. Those numbers put Supra up there among the fastest blockchains in the industry, including Solana, which is renowned for its rapid transaction throughput. What’s more, there’s plenty more to look forward to, with the mainnet launch paving the way for upcoming features like EVM and Solana Virtual Machine support. In addition, Supra recently pioneered its Supra Containers , which provide a separate execution space for developers to create independent ecosystems and economies on Solana, without needing to bootstrap liquidity or set up external services and validators. With all of these novel capabilities, Supra’s team believes it has everything in place to support a new era of Super dApps. According to Supra co-founder and Chief Executive Joshua Tobkin, the mainnet launch is the culmination of years of dedicated work. “With our high-performance network delivering 500k TPS and our MultiVM support, native oracle, VRF, and automation services, Supra is creating an all-encompassing environment for Super dApps,” he insisted. Airdrop Incoming! There are a lot of people anticipating the Token Generation Event. The project has been getting traction in the blockchain community since early 2023, and its Project Blastoff Campaign has signed up more than 512,000 users. The vast majority have completed various quests to become eligible to receive some of the first SUPRA tokens via an airdrop, and they’ll finally be able to claim their tokens as they parachute in today. Of course, those who claim their free tokens won’t be able to cash in yet due to vesting restrictions designed to reward long-term “hodling”, but there should be plenty of swapping going on with SUPRA’s listings on ByBit, Gate.Io, Kucoin and MEXC, with more exchanges set to be added to that list in the coming weeks. Developers are also eager to embrace Supra’s mainnet launch. Since its incentivized testnet went live in August this year, it has so far processed more than 9 million transactions. Some of the leading dApps on Supra’s testnet include the blockchain Astro Predictions and Dice Vision, and there are many more planning to launch with the mainnet’s arrival. Supra’s co-founder and Chief Business Officer Jon Jones said he and his team have been actively collaborating with the wider Web3 community to foster the creation of a resilient and scalable ecosystem of dAps. “We’ve been working with partners to establish strong liquidity, seamless integration and a robust foundation for our community, and our efforts don’t stop here,” he promised.

On that note, DTX Exchange (DTX) has emerged as a leader that is expected to redefine online trading. It has blended the best components of CEX and DEX, creating a smooth hybrid platform that lets users trade across over 120,000 assets. While Stellar (XLM) and Chainlink (LINK) record persistent bullish trends, DTX Exchange’s exclusive value proposition, especially its focus on user-centric solutions and market accessibility, positions it as a lead DeFi. As the market grows, DTX is becoming the best cryptocurrency investment due to its massive growth potential. Continue reading for more details! DTX Exchange: A New Crypto Revolutionizing DeFi with Hybrid Trading Innovation DTX Exchange is a hybrid trading platform that has refused to conform to the norms of the crypto space. Instead, the developers integrated CEX and DEX’s best elements to create a groundbreaking trading platform. Notably, the new crypto is the hottest DeFi project, and as a result, it could dominate the sector and compete with XLM and LINK. Unlike the established exchange protocols, DTX Exchange’s trading protocol will consist of elements like non-custodial storage and wallet-based solutions. Users can trade up to 120,000 assets across bonds, stocks, forex, ETFs, and cryptos through an integrated wallet without needing traditional bank accounts. Furthermore, DTX Exchange’s non-custodial storage solutions will avoid involving a centralized authority with funds and assets. Currently, DTX Exchange is on track to redefine the $10 billion global trading space. Thus, it is a new exchange-based project to explore, tipped to outpace established platforms. Its underlying token, DTX, has been selling out in presale, raising over $8.7 million in early funding. With this impressive performance, the new crypto project ranks as 2024’s best presale. With its massive growth potential, DTX is tipped to outshine XLM and LINK in the current DeFi bull market. Stellar’s XLM Surges Over 200% Amid Bullish Market Trends and Investor Confidence Stellar’s XLM has been volatile, trading sideways for the past several months until the token recorded a huge 209.72% surge during the post-election rally. While the general crypto market cooled off, XLM continued its upside movement by recording another massive 105.91% gain in a week. Since Stellar’s community sentiment is currently bullish, analysts say XLM will surge further before encountering any possible correction. XLM’s on-chain data show a growing bullish sentiment. In that context, the Open Interest (OI) for XLM increased by 18.56% on November 24, 2024, hitting $283.5 million. The increase proves there is growing market confidence, and new positions are getting established. XLM was trading at $0.4781 on November 24, up 134.76% in the past week. Market experts believe XLM will keep rising to reach $0.5615 in the first week of December. Despite the massive XLM surge, investors have turned to DTX Exchange, which is considered the best cryptocurrency investment in the DeFi space due to its massive growth potential. Chainlinks’ LINK Gains Momentum with Brazil’s Central Bank Partnership On November 19, 2024, Brazil’s Central Bank (BCB) announced a massive partnership with Microsoft Brazil, 7COMm, Banco Inter, and Chainlink Labs in its second phase of Drex, a digital currency pilot. The initiative will revolutionize supply chain management and trade finance processes by leveraging Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and blockchain technology. As Chainlink’s ecosystem becomes majorly important for these partnerships, the demand for LINK will grow, possibly helping push up its value in the long term. Being one of the top DeFi altcoins, Chainlink’s LINK is trading upward in the current bull market. Analysts say LINK aims for a breakout above the $18.03 resistance, opening the door for a surge above $25 in the coming weeks. Trading at $16.51 on November 24, LINK is up 17.16% in the past week. Market experts see massive bullish potential for LINK this bull cycle. They believe it will hit $21.05 in the first week of December, fueled by developments on its network. Although LINK is surging, investors are turning to a new crypto, DTX, which offers massive growth potential while in its presale stage. DTX: The Best Cryptocurrency Poised to Transform DeFi and Outpace Rivals As the DeFi sector grows, DTX Exchange (DTX) stands as a major force that is attracting many investors. The new crypto is considered transformative and will reorganize the whole online trading sector. By integrating the best CEX and DX features, DTX Exchange offers unrivaled security, accessibility, and versatility, which makes it a dominant force in the crypto space. Currently available in Stage 5 of its public presale, selling at $0.10, DTX has delivered 400% profit for early buyers who acquired it at $0.02. Additionally, Stage 5 investors will enjoy a 100% ROI once the token is listed on mainstream markets. Analysts believe it is the best cryptocurrency investment since it is expected to rise 10x after listing on popular exchanges. While established operators like Stellar (XLM) and Chainlink (LINK) deliver remarkable growth, DTX Exchange's advanced strategy and presale success will enable it to lead the DeFi space over Stellar and Chainlink.

Regulatory Framework in Development The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined plans to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency market by 2026. This initiative comes in response to the growing adoption of digital assets, which now account for 7 million UK residents, reflecting a 4% increase over the past two years. The FCA aims to balance consumer protection with fostering innovation in the crypto industry. According to Matthew Long, Director of Payments and Digital Assets at the FCA, collaboration will be central to the process: “We’re committed to working closely with the Government, international partners, industry, and consumers to help us get the future rules right.” Key Challenges and Focus Areas One of the FCA's primary concerns, as outlined in a recent blog post, is the challenge of ensuring adequate data disclosures by decentralized issuers. The agency anticipates that crypto exchanges may need to rely on publicly available data to provide transparency to their customers. This approach is expected to incentivize decentralized projects to make such information readily accessible to secure exchange listings. To enhance public understanding and stakeholder engagement, the FCA will release papers on cryptocurrency market abuse and disclosure practices by the end of this year. By the close of 2025, additional publications will focus on stablecoins, staking, trading platforms, and lending operations, addressing key areas of the evolving crypto ecosystem. Shift in Governmental Priorities The UK’s Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has adopted a more deliberate approach to cryptocurrency regulation than its Conservative predecessor. While earlier efforts prioritized stablecoin legislation, the current administration is emphasizing broader crypto market oversight to allow more room for innovation. Economic Secretary Tulip Siddiq has assured that draft regulations will be published next year to ensure transparency. This measured strategy reflects the government’s intent to strike a balance between regulation and the dynamic nature of the crypto ecosystem. Global Context The UK’s efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies are part of a broader international trend. The European Union is preparing to implement its Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework by the end of 2024, and other major jurisdictions, such as India and the United States, are also advancing regulatory measures. The FCA’s initiative aligns the UK with this global trend, while addressing critical issues such as market abuse, operational transparency, and decentralized data disclosure. By addressing these issues, the FCA’s strategy can provide much-needed clarity and stability to the UK’s expanding crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

36911569,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/trump-administration-mulling-giving-cftc-reins-to-crypto-regulation,1732710667,Trump Administration Mulling Giving CFTC Reins To Crypto Regulation,"Donald Trump’s incoming administration is mulling handing over the regulation of crypto exchanges and spot markets for cryptocurrencies deemed commodities to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The move would allow the CFTC to regulate a significant chunk of the $3 trillion digital asset market and enhance the commission's reach. CFTC To Lead Digital Asset Regulation? The move could drastically reduce the regulatory influence of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC under Gary Gensler brought significant regulatory action against crypto firms. President-elect Donald Trump and his team believe the SEC’s enforcement action has slowed down crypto innovation in the United States, and a less stringent approach with a lighter touch is needed to drive innovation and facilitate growth. “JUST IN: The Trump administration is eyeing the CFTC to oversee digital asset regulation, per FOX.” If the CFTC is given regulatory control of crypto, it will be a significant win for the industry in the US. The agency is its preferred regulator thanks to its perceived lenient approach to crypto. Chris Giancarlo, former CFTC Chairman, said, “With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency.” The former CFTC Chairman had tried to convince the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC, to support its oversight of the spot crypto market by pointing to the regulator’s early engagement with Bitcoin (BTC), which it called a commodity in 2015. A Perceived Lighter Touch The CFTC oversees the $20 trillion US derivatives market, including trading of futures, options, and physical commodities like gold, silver, oil, and wheat. The CFTC establishes market rules and brings enforcement action against institutions flouting rules and regulations. However, it is perceived to have a lighter touch than the SEC. This is because the derivatives markets are dominated by institutions and are considered better equipped to manage risk. CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam, who has relatively moderate views on crypto, has also asked the Senate Agriculture Committee for extra funding to regulate the crypto market more effectively rather than enforcement action. The CFTC has a budget of $706 million, four times smaller than the SEC’s $3 billion for the 2024 financial year. The CFTC employs far fewer staff, 700, than the SEC’s 5300. Around 50% of the CFTC’s enforcement actions have been brought against prominent crypto firms and businesses. SEC Chair Behnam has called this a staggering statistic for an agency not mandated to regulate the industry. Additional funding is crucial for the CFTC to begin policing fraud and manipulation in the spot crypto market. The uncertainty around the classification of digital assets and the unwillingness of the SEC and CFTC to draft specific rules has led to both agencies regulating the crypto space through enforcement actions.

36910230,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102932,1732710223,XRP Next Big Move: Expert Reveals XRP Likely Next Target After Correction Ends,"A market analyst has predicted the next possible direction for XRP after the ongoing correction that has triggered significant declines ends. XRP has recently witnessed massive price volatility but appears to be holding strong in the face of adversity. Amid Bitcoin’s sharp decline below $93,000, the broader crypto market entered a correction phase, which also impacted XRP. Despite the pullback, XRP has shown relative resilience in comparison with other crypto assets. While down 5.54% in the past 24 hours, XRP has retained a 27% gain over the last seven days, holding strong above the $1.36 price territory.XRP Shows Resilience Amid Profit TakingAs XRP maintains this level, analyst Dark Defender recently discussed its next possible direction once the correction ends. According to him, the pullback in XRP’s price is normal after strong upward trends in crypto markets, as XRP has spiked 200% over the last few weeks.Besides the broader market pullback, another factor possibly contributing to XRP’s recent correction is profit-taking by investors in South Korea. According to CryptoQuant, approximately 6.6 billion XRP tokens were held on Upbit, the country’s leading exchange. During the recent rally, South Korean investors sold around 400 million XRP, worth $400 million. This sell-off likely contributed to short-term price pressure, with XRP giving up the $1.44 pivotal price level.XRP’s Next Possible DirectionIn his recent analysis, Dark Defender called attention to the Elliott Wave theory. He noted that XRP is currently in Wave C of the corrective phase. This wave has a major support level at $1.2893, where the regular Wave 2 would complete. However, the analyst suggests that if XRP fails to hold above $1.28, the correction could deepen, potentially pushing the price down to $1.03. It is important to note that XRP has not traded below the $1 mark since it reclaimed it on Nov. 16. XRP 4H Chart | Dark Defender Despite this near-term bearish scenario, Dark Defender is optimistic about XRP's long-term prospects. He predicts that once the correction ends, XRP could rebound to target $1.88 initially. Notably, breaking past this level could open the path to challenge its 2021 peak of $1.96, a major resistance level during the previous bull run. A decisive move above $1.96 could potentially trigger a run to the highs seen during the 2017/2018 crypto market boom. Interestingly, market veteran Peter Brandt discussed the importance of this $1.96 region in a recent analysis. According to him, if XRP can surpass this price level, it could set the stage for an explosive push.The Pivotal $1.44 Price TerritoryIn a previous analysis, Dark Defender pointed out that XRP had been consolidating around the Fibonacci level of $1.44 for several days.

It now appears this reversal could be over, and Bitcoin bulls look to be taking charge again. Can this fight-back achieve an all-time high? This last reversal only took four days to play out, but did succeed in lopping off more than $9,000 from the top. As Bitcoin climbs towards that magical figure of $100,000, it may take more than a couple of runs at it before this level breaks. In addition, volatility is likely to be high. Long term holders selling or technical indications responsible for dip? As Bitcoin starts tracking upwards again, many across social media are blaming the Bitcoin long term holders for this latest reversal . This could partly be the case, but from a technical perspective indicators were signalling that it was time for some kind of retrace. That the long term holders were selling into this top would perhaps explain how the $BTC price came down as far as it did. Source: TradingView The 8-hour chart shows the $BTC descent from that top just short of $100,000. That the price came all the way back to the deepest Fibonacci retracement at 0.786 shows that this was a decent correction, and one that the market probably very much needed. What also acted as support was the 50 SMA (blue line), and the fact that all the short-term time frame momentum indicators had bottomed and were now starting to cross back up. Bullish on the monthly time frame Source: TradingView Zooming very much further out into the macro monthly time frame, it can be seen that things are very bullish for Bitcoin. That said, the price has stopped short of the 1.618 Fibonacci and it might be expected that this will be a tough nut for bulls to crack, given that it coincides with the ascending trendline from the double top of the last bull market. Looking further down the chart, the Stochastic RSI is showing a cross up of the fast line (blue) over the slow line (red), which signals upside price momentum that could last for the next few months. Also, at the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index is showing that the indicator line is poking its head above the descending trendline that started back in 2021 - yet another bullish indication. There could be another rejection of the $100,000 price level still to come, but overall, looking out into the first half of 2025, and into the latter stage of the bull market, the $155,000 price level at the 2.618 Fibonacci is certainly a proposition.

Bitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been one of the stocks to watch in 2024. The company is up 416% year-to-date, up as much as 600% at one point last week.   However, since the short report from Citron Research came out on Nov. 21, the stock has dropped almost 40%, subsequently burning retail in the process. This drop coincided with bitcoin dropping almost 10% to $90,000 from its all-time high of just shy of $100,000.   According to a post on X by the Kobeissi Letter, which is an industry-leading commentary on global markets, on Nov. 20 retail investors bought up to $42 million worth of MicroStrategy common stock. This was the largest daily retail buy on record and was eight times higher than the daily average in October. Last week alone, retail investors bought nearly $100 million worth of shares.   As a result of this 40% share price drop, the net asset value (NAV) premium on MicroStrategy has now dropped to around 2.09, one of the lowest premium levels since September. The NAV premium can be worked out by how much the company's market cap, which is trading at $75 billion against its 386,700 bitcoin holdings which are worth $36 billion. This gives MicroStrategy a NAV premium of 2.09 against its bitcoin holdings.   Furthermore, to put into perspective how much trading volume has been seen in MicroStrategy as of late. Last week, MicroStrategy saw $136 billion in volume. This was significantly higher than any period of the Gamestop (GME) mania, according to Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg analyst.   ""Even the most intense week of GameStop Mania couldn't come close to the week MicroStrategy just had with $136 billion in volume.

Profit-taking is usual investor behavior after rallies and doesn’t indicate a change in the long-term sentiment for any token.  The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio surged to 217% on Tuesday, according to an FXStreet report citing Santiment data, suggesting that the current market valuation of XRP is significantly higher than its average purchase price — indicative of potential overvaluation in the short term in a move that may dampen a swift rally higher.   MVRV is a ratio of the total value of all the coins in circulation by the total value of all coins based on the price at which they were last moved on the blockchain. It can be thought of as the aggregate cost basis of all coins currently in circulation.   High profit-taking combined with the overvaluation signaled by the MVRV could lead to a market correction.   Several factors have helped catapult XRP prices recently, surging to a local high of $1.60 last week before paring gains to as low as $1.30. The token is still up 31% over the past week.    It has more than doubled in two weeks on several positive catalysts, such as the clearing of regulatory headwinds for closely related Ripple Labs, the launch of money market funds on XRP Ledger, and a technical bullish price analysis.   Meanwhile, Ripple plans to invest an unspecified amount in the newly rebranded Bitwise Physical XRP ETP (earlier called the ETC Group Physical XRP), per a Wednesday release. The announcement sent XRP higher by 10%.   The European XRP ETP will now trade under the GXRP ticker on Germany’s Deutsche Börse XETRA, the release said.   “Global demand for exposure to the crypto asset class has exploded in 2024, fueled by a growing interest in crypto-backed investment offerings,” Brad Garlinghouse, CEO at Ripple Labs, said in the release. “With the U.S. regulatory environment for crypto finally becoming more clear, this trend is poised to accelerate, further driving demand for crypto ETPs, such as the Bitwise Physical XRP ETP.”   The 100% physically backed ETP launched by Bitwise in 2022 allows European investors to gain exposure to XRP.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/27/xrp-rally-sees-record-profit-taking-as-ripple-labs-plans-to-invest-in-bitwise-xrp-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ee65ff3968544b0afabf2faf9a2f4c0f899ba43-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36906200,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655104,1732707004,Will Bitcoin See Another ‘Thanksgiving Day Massacre’? Experts Weigh In,"Almost four years ago to the day, Bitcoin experienced a dramatic 17% plunge from $19,500 to $16,200 in 2020, an event that became infamously known as the “Thanksgiving Day Massacre.” As the holiday approaches once again, market participants are questioning whether history might repeat itself. On Monday and Tuesday, Bitcoin’s price underwent an 8% correction, dropping from $98,871 to a low of $90,791. This sudden downturn has sparked discussions among analysts if history could be repeating for the BTC price. Bitcoin ‘Thanksgiving Day Massacre’ 2024? Alex Thorn, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, took to X to draw parallels between the current market and the events of 2020. “Who remembers the Thanksgiving dump of 2020? Bitcoin dumped 17% between Wednesday, Nov 25, and Friday, Nov 27, 2020. BTCUSD later went on to more than 3x over the next 5 months. Does history rhyme?” A potential catalyst for the crash could be the global M2 money supply. Currently, a chart illustrating the correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 is circulating on X. Joe Consorti, an analyst at Theya, observed that since September 2023, “Bitcoin has closely tracked global M2 with a ~70-day lag.” Over the past two months, global M2 has declined from $108.3 trillion to $104.7 trillion, driven by factors such as a strengthening US dollar—devaluing foreign currency-denominated M2 when converted into dollars—and economic slowdowns dampening lending and deposit creation. Related Reading: Pantera’s Vision: Bitcoin Fund Forecasts $740,000 Price Tag By April 2028 Consorti cautions, “If it continues to follow the current contraction in M2, a 20-25% correction could materialize, potentially pulling bitcoin down to roughly $73,000—not a price prediction, but a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s tether to the global money supply.” However, he also acknowledged that Bitcoin might defy this trend, as it has in the past, particularly “from 2022-2023 due to the FTX collapse and interest in the space evaporating as a result.” He suggests that structural ETF inflows and corporate buying pressure could help Bitcoin resist the current M2 deflation. Consorti concludes, “Either way, a correction at this point seems about right. As mentioned before, these rapid run-ups in Bitcoin’s price always have pitstops along the way, it’s vital to understand the asset you hold, the macro environment it exists in, and the forces driving it higher long-term. If you truly understand bitcoin, you don’t panic sell.” Related Reading: Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin, Says MARA CEO Despite the cautious outlook, some analysts believe the dip may be short-lived. Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, points out via X that “a Bitcoin bid has overshadowed tightening liquidity over the past month.” While acknowledging that Bitcoin appears “overstretched vs. global M2” and that his liquidity model suggested caution, especially with leverage, Coutts highlights potential policy shifts that could favor risk assets. He references insights from economist Andreas Steno, indicating that the Federal Reserve is “in effect, discussing a put for USD liquidity—changes to support liquidity developments as early as December.” Coutts concludes: “DXY could have topped here. The lag effect that Fintwit is focused on atm is still real, but ultimately, the Fed is waving the bull flag for risk assets again. Bullish 2025. Bullish BTC.” At press time, BTC traded at $93,250.

36906018,https://coinpaper.com/6273/court-rules-treasury-overstepped-authority-on-tornado-cash-ban,1732706519,Court Rules Treasury Overstepped Authority on Tornado Cash Ban,"The appeals court deemed Tornado Cash’s smart contracts to be beyond the scope of federal property laws. The ruling led to a massive TORN price surge. In Utah, a federal judge upheld the SEC’s lawsuit against Kristoffer Krohn and Green United LLC. The regulator alleges that Krohn ran a $18 million crypto mining scam. In Arkansas, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to prevent state officials from shutting down a crypto mining operation that is owned by a naturalized U.S. citizen due to potential discriminatory enforcement of state laws targeting Chinese nationals. Tornado Cash Sanctions Nullified by U.S. Appeals Court Tornado Cash users achieved a major legal victory after a United States appeals court ruled that the Treasury Department’s sanctions against the crypto mixer’s immutable smart contracts were unlawful. On Nov. 26, a Fifth Circuit Appeals Court’s three-judge panel reversed a previous lower court decision, granting Tornado Cash users a partial summary judgment. The court found that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) overstepped its authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by sanctioning smart contracts that cannot be owned or controlled. According to the judges, these contracts do not qualify as ”property” under federal law. The court stated that while OFAC has the authority to sanction property, Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts—being autonomous and devoid of administrative control—do not meet the criteria for property under IEEPA. This ruling was a turning point in the ongoing legal battle between Tornado Cash and the Treasury Department which started in August of 2022 when the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash after alleging it facilitated the laundering of more than $7 billion in crypto since 2019. Coinbase-supported plaintiffs, led by Joseph Van Loon, challenged the sanctions, and argued that the Treasury’s designation of Tornado Cash’s 44 smart contract addresses violated federal law. In 2023, a Texas federal court sided with the Treasury and labeled Tornado Cash as a sanctionable entity. This ruling prompted an appeal, which culminated in the Nov. 26 decision which clarified that immutable smart contracts with no administrative keys fall outside OFAC’s regulatory scope. Legal experts, including Consensys lawyer Bill Hughes , believes that while this judgment removes the specific smart contracts from the sanctions list, it does not absolve Tornado Cash entirely from further scrutiny by the Treasury or OFAC. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal pointed out some of the decision’s implications, and shared that U.S. individuals can now use Tornado Cash’s privacy-focused protocol without violating sanctions. News of the ruling caused Tornado Cash’s native token, TORN, to surge by more than 860% to hit a two-year high. At press time, TORN was trading hands at $12.63. TORN’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) What is Tornado Cash? Tornado Cash is a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer that is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and it is designed to enhance privacy and anonymity in digital transactions. It allows users to break the traceability of their funds by pooling deposits from multiple users and redistributing them to new addresses. This process is executed through immutable smart contracts to make sure that the origin and destination of funds remain unlinked. The platform operates without any centralized control, and relies on transparent, open-source code to process transactions. While privacy advocates like Tornado Cash because it encourages financial anonymity and protecting user security, it has also faced some regulatory scrutiny. Even today, Tornado Cash is still a focal point in the debate over balancing financial privacy with regulatory compliance in the crypto ecosystem. SEC Lawsuit Against Crypto Firm Allowed to Proceed Meanwhile, a Utah federal judge rejected an appeal to dismiss a lawsuit that was filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Kristoffer Krohn, a promoter of the allegedly fraudulent crypto mining firm Green United LLC. The SEC accuses the firm of orchestrating an $18 million investment scheme involving the sale of ”Green Boxes” and ”Green nodes,” which were marketed as mining hardware for a nonexistent Green Blockchain. Judge Ann Marie McIff Allen denied Krohn’s request for an appeal on Nov. 26, and reaffirmed her earlier decision from Sept. 23 to allow the SEC’s case to proceed. In her ruling, Allen stated that Krohn did not demonstrate grounds for an appeal or differences in legal interpretation. She also rejected Krohn’s claim that the SEC did not adequately establish the existence of investment contracts under the Howey test , which is a key framework for defining securities. Krohn argued that the SEC confused elements of the test, but Allen stated that his arguments lacked legal precedent and support. The SEC alleges that Green United misled investors between April of 2018 and December of 2022 by promising large returns through its development of a Green Blockchain and the GREEN token. According to the SEC, the Green Blockchain never even existed, and the GREEN token was created after the initial sale of mining hardware, distributed periodically to give the illusion of operational success. The lawsuit also names Green United founder Wright Thurston, who separately wanted to dismiss the case. Despite Krohn’s attempts to stop the proceedings, the judge’s decision ensures that the SEC’s allegations will move forward. Arkansas Judge Blocks Crypto Mining Shutdown A federal judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing state officials from shutting down a crypto mining operation that is owned by a naturalized U.S. citizen of Chinese descent. On Nov. 25, Chief U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker granted the TRO in favor of Jones Eagle , a crypto mining firm. The order was issued after allegations of illegal discrimination under two Arkansas state laws—Act 636 of 2023 and Act 174 of 2024. Act 636 prohibits property ownership in Arkansas by entities connected to the Chinese government, while Act 174 bans foreign entities from owning digital asset mining operations in the state. Arkansas officials argued that the firm, which is owned by Qimin “Jimmy” Chen, violated these laws. They also claimed that Chen was a Chinese national. However, Chen is a naturalized U.S. citizen that lives in New York. He argued that the state's actions discriminated against him based on his national origin. Chen’s attorney, Alex Jones, stated that the TRO will remain in effect for 14 days, during which time the court will hold a hearing to determine whether to extend the order or grant a preliminary injunction. Jones argued that the laws are unconstitutional and are a legislative overreach. The restraining order prevents further harm to Chen and his business as they prepare for a trial. Chen owns a majority stake in the crypto mining firm through Eagle Asset Holding, and claimed that he previously provided documents to Arkansas’s attorney general demonstrating that the mining site was not located on agricultural land, which is required under state law. Despite this, his attempts to discuss his citizenship status with state authorities were rebuffed. Attorney General Tim Griffin, who has been investigating various crypto mining operations in Arkansas, suggested that not all entities involved in these operations were fully cooperative.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6273/court-rules-treasury-overstepped-authority-on-tornado-cash-ban,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

In the United Kingdom, cryptocurrency ownership has surged to over 12% of adults, signaling mainstream adoption and prompting a regulatory response from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Meanwhile, a study from PiP World reveals that financial literacy within the crypto community remains low, with many participants struggling to navigate the complexities of the fast-evolving market. UK Cryptocurrency Adoption Surges, FCA Proposes Regulatory Framework to Keep Pace Cryptocurrency ownership in the United Kingdom is on the rise, with over 12% of adults now holding digital assets, according to a recent report by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This marks a significant increase from the 10% recorded in June 2023. The upward trend has sparked a fresh wave of regulatory focus, with the FCA outlining a detailed roadmap to introduce comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations by 2026. As of Nov. 26, 2024, the average crypto holdings among UK investors have reached £1,842 (approximately $2,318). This sharp rise reflects an increasing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate component of investment portfolios. George McDonaugh, co-managing director and co-founder of blockchain investment firm KR1, described this trend as evidence of the “mainstream” status of cryptocurrency in the UK. “The fact that people increasingly see crypto as part of a wider investment portfolio, including for the long-term, also demonstrates that digital assets are now mainstream,” McDonaugh said. “It’s time for regulators and lawmakers to catch up.” The FCA survey suggests that cryptocurrency is no longer confined to niche tech enthusiasts or speculative traders; it is increasingly viewed as a serious investment asset. This shift signals a broader public acceptance and calls for a robust regulatory framework to address associated risks and opportunities. The FCA’s 2026 Roadmap: A Blueprint for Crypto Regulation To address the evolving landscape, the FCA has unveiled a roadmap aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring market integrity and consumer trust. The regulatory initiative spans a multi-year timeline, with the final framework set to take effect in 2026. Key Milestones in the FCA Crypto Roadmap Stablecoin Regulation (Q4 2024): The FCA plans to release its first consultation papers focused on stablecoin issuance and custody. As stablecoins play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency, these regulations aim to provide clarity on their use and oversight. Focus on DeFi and Trading Platforms (2025): The FCA will expand its regulatory scope to cover trading platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, including staking and lending. These consultations aim to address the unique challenges posed by DeFi’s decentralized and borderless nature. Final Rules and Implementation (2026): The comprehensive set of rules governing the crypto sector is expected to be finalized and implemented in 2026. This aligns with the FCA’s vision of a regulated environment that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining market stability. Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA, emphasized the importance of these measures. “We want to develop a sector that embraces innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and consumer trust,” Long stated. A Global Race for Regulatory Leadership The UK’s efforts come at a critical juncture as the global race for cryptocurrency regulation intensifies. The European Union is set to implement its landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) by the end of 2024, establishing the world’s first comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The FCA’s roadmap positions the UK to compete with the EU in attracting blockchain innovation and investment. McDonaugh highlighted the strategic importance of the FCA’s approach, stating, “It’s important that the UK government outlines its regulatory framework for the crypto industry so digital asset businesses can help the country’s economy grow, boost skills, and create jobs.” While the FCA’s roadmap is a step in the right direction, the regulatory journey is fraught with challenges. Balancing innovation with consumer protection requires a nuanced approach that avoids stifling growth while addressing risks such as fraud, market manipulation, and volatility. The growing interest in cryptocurrencies also raises questions about financial literacy and investor education. As digital assets become more mainstream, ensuring that retail investors understand the risks and rewards of crypto investments is paramount. Crypto Boom Highlights Financial Literacy Crisis Among Market Participants Meanwhile, as Bitcoin flirts with all-time highs, a new report reveals a concerning disparity: while cryptocurrency adoption surges, financial literacy within the community remains alarmingly low. According to research by crypto gaming startup PiP World, the average financial literacy rate among crypto participants is just 25%, trailing the US national average by half. The findings, based on over 12,000 anonymous survey responses collected from March 2022 to October 2024 via the Coinfessions platform, brings attention to a pressing need for education and informed decision-making in the rapidly growing digital asset space. The report quantifies financial literacy as an individual's ability to make informed decisions about financial matters, categorizing participants into ”high” and ”medium” literacy tiers. At just 25%, the crypto community’s literacy rate falls 8% below the global financial literacy average, which PiP World CEO Saad Naja describes as a ”dangerously low” threshold. “The findings of this report highlight an urgent and undeniable truth — financial literacy in the crypto space is dangerously low,” said Naja. He added that many participants are “navigating blind” in a complex and fast-evolving market, lacking essential knowledge to make sound financial choices. This lack of foundational understanding has left the community prone to emotional trading behaviors. The report notes that crypto investors often exhibit reactive, impulsive, and neurotic tendencies, with 76% of respondents expressing regret about their investment decisions. Alarmingly, 70% of participants also reported experiencing losses The study shows the disparities in financial literacy across different investor profiles within the crypto ecosystem. Key findings include: Whales: Representing 5% of the crypto community, whales — investors with large holdings — demonstrated the highest financial literacy rate at 96%. Their ability to navigate the market with advanced strategies places them well above their peers. Hodlers: Long-term investors, making up 11% of the community, also scored high, with an 80% financial literacy rate. Their patience and focus on fundamentals contribute to their relative success. Speculative Traders: The largest segment of the crypto market (29%) exhibited a financial literacy rate of 64%, reflecting a moderate understanding of market dynamics but a tendency toward riskier behaviors. Day Traders: Surprisingly, day traders — accounting for 6% of the community — had the lowest literacy rate at just 27%, highlighting a knowledge gap despite their active market participation. Pump-and-Dump Participants: This controversial segment, comprising 18% of respondents, reported a 45% literacy rate. Emotional Strain in the Crypto Market The study paints a stark picture of the psychological toll on crypto investors. Participants frequently reported being driven by emotions rather than informed analysis, leading to impulsive decision-making. The fast-paced nature of the market, combined with its inherent volatility, exacerbates the emotional challenges faced by traders. The findings come at a time when the cryptocurrency market is experiencing unprecedented growth, with institutional adoption and regulatory frameworks taking shape worldwide. Experts argue that fostering financial literacy should be a priority for governments, crypto companies, and educational institutions. PiP World’s report calls for collaborative efforts to provide accessible financial education tailored to crypto market participants. It also recommends the inclusion of financial literacy training in blockchain platforms, exchanges, and decentralized applications to empower users.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | OTHER,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6275/uk-crypto-ownership-hits-record-highs-as-regulators-plan-new-rules,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36910229,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102997,1732705241,SUI Channel Breakout Targets Above $4 for New All-Time High,"Amid the ongoing pullback, the SUI price trend is signaling a potential channel breakout, with the possibility of crossing $4 and reaching a new all-time high. As some altcoins in the crypto market are starting to heat up, despite the Bitcoin price facing a downfall to nearly $93,000, SUI is revealing a breakout possibility. With a market cap of $9.36 billion, the SUI token currently trades at $3.29. With the increasing chances of a falling channel breakout rally, the bulls anticipate a new all-time high, crossing about $3.93. Let’s find the chances of SUI crossing $4.SUI Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, the SUI price action showcases a falling channel pattern. The pullback phase of the SUI price trend has resulted in a lower high and lower low formation. Thus, two parallel boundary lines give rise to the falling channel pattern. SUI Price Chart The pullback phase accounts for a price drop of 13.72% from $3.9352 to the current market price of $3.3954. Now, the SUI price is showing positive momentum within the falling channel, approaching the overhead resistance trendline. Additionally, the price is testing the 50-EMA line, which coincides with the resistance trendline.The 4-hour RSI is above the halfway mark, increasing the chances of a breakout rally. Moreover, the recent support from the 100-EMA line strengthens the breakout outlook. Together, these technical indicators signal a potential buy opportunity for SUI.Will SUI Price Hit $4?The declining trend in the SUI price has been approaching a long-coming support trend line. However, the quick recovery teases a bullish breakout before reaching the support trendline. Considering the increased breakout chances, the chances of a new all-time high have also increased. Using trend-based Fibonacci levels, the immediate price target is $3.75. However, the $3.89 breakout could mark a change of character in the SUI price trend. The breakout run will put the $4.19 and $4.58 on the bullish radar. On the flip side, a bullish failure will result in a drop to the $3.14 support, followed by the $3.00 psychological standpoint.",POSITIVE,SUI,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | SUI,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/sui-channel-breakout-targets-above-4-for-new-all-time-high/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sui-channel-breakout-targets-above-4-for-new-all-time-high,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

BTC is down over 2% in the past 24 hours and had dipped to a low of $90,796 before recovering. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around the $92,600 price level, with bearish sentiment on the rise. The global crypto market cap also took a pummeling and is down by 2.30% at $3.19 trillion. The dip has left BTC traders reeling, with several million in long positions wiped out. Trading volume has also seen a substantial dip of almost 9%. Almost all cryptocurrencies registered substantial declines as a deep correction took hold, dragging the market into the red. Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $3,400 and is currently down 1% over the past 24 hours. Solana (SOL) is also in the red, with buyers struggling to keep it above $230. Ripple (XRP) has seen a substantial decline of almost 4% and is trading at $1.39. Dogecoin (DOGE) , which saw a stunning post-election rally, also finds itself in the red, with the price down almost 3%. Other altcoins that registered substantial drops include Stellar (XLM) , Polkadot (DOT), Internet Computer (ICP), and Cronos (CRO). Crypto Market Correction Deepens The crypto market came under significant pressure as prices plummeted after a buoyant post-election phase. Markets hit a five-day low as Bitcoin (BTC) dropped as low as $90,796, driven by a selloff in safe-haven assets as markets hope for de-escalating tensions between Israel and Lebanon. Additionally, Trump’s tariff threats are playing against stock indices and weighing on equities. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 79. While this is firmly in extreme greed, it is the lowest level in two weeks. BTC’s drop to a low of $90,786 deepend the correction significantly, with prices dropping for the fourth consecutive day. BTC attempted to reclaim $99,000 late on Monday, but sellers countered, leading to more selling. If BTC continues dropping and goes below $90,000, we can expect a drop to $85,000 or as low as $80,000. On the other hand, data from CoinShares revealed global crypto fund investments reached an all-time high of $3.12 billion, following inflows worth $2.193 billion the week prior. Investments in BTC registered an increase of $3.07 billion, while ETH investments grew $3 million, SOL by $16 million, and XRP by $15 million. According to FalconX, the relative dominance of bullish orders in the BTC market had weakened, and growth momentum is not being supported by new buying interest. Bloodbath As $581M In Derivatives Liquidated The crypto market has witnessed a bloodbath in the past 24-48 hours as BTC plummeted towards a low of $90,700, a significant 3% drop compared to the previous day and a 1% decline over the past week. However, despite this substantial correction, BTC is up almost 37% over the past month. BTC’s recent downturn caused significant liquidations in crypto derivatives, with a total of $581 million in positions wiped out. BTC long positions accounted for $113 million of liquidations, while ETH longs accounted for $77 million. BTC and the crypto market’s latest drop is another example of how it remains prone to significant shifts in sentiment. As institutional and retail players react to such shifts, connections between spot prices, trading pairs, and the derivatives markets are coming into focus. Liquidations And Profit-Taking With Bitcoin (BTC) facing significant selling pressure, its market dominance dropped to $57% as liquidations amplified its downward trajectory. “The asset dipped to an intraday low of $92,600 before rebounding as spot ETFs registered $500 million in outflows, signaling potential profit taking. BTC may experience volatility in the short-term as $9.4 billion worth of options expire on Friday.” Several other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Tron (TRX), also registered substantial declines. Trump Plans To Hand Over Crypto Oversight to CFTC Donald Trump is reportedly mulling handing oversight of the crypto industry to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a move that could significantly roll back regulatory control from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The move would allow the CFTC to regulate spot markets for digital assets deemed commodities. Trump believes the SEC’s enforcement action against the crypto space has adversely impacted crypto innovation in the US, and a less stringent approach could facilitate more growth. If the CFTC is given regulatory control over crypto, it would be a big win for the crypto industry, which has long batted for a fairer approach. Former CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo stated, “With adequate funding and under the right leadership, I think the CFTC could hit the ground running to begin regulating digital commodities on day one of Donald Trump’s presidency.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below the $92,000 support level, falling to an intraday low of $90,707 on Wednesday as a market correction drove prices lower. The retreat from the $100,000 price level can be attributed to profit-booking and investors hoping for a de-escalation in Middle East tensions, which has seen prices of safe-haven assets such as BTC drop. According to Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, a brief pullback is expected before the next rally. “Bitcoin has been on an absolute tear since Election Day, with very few pullbacks. However, the $100,000 level remains a formidable psychological barrier. While breaking through now would be a major bullish signal, a brief pullback may be needed to gather momentum before the next attempt.” The Bitcoin price chart shows a significant correction at the beginning of the week as the price retreats further from the crucial $100,000 level. BTC has been on an absolute tear since the elections, meeting expectations of surging past the $90,000 level. Analysts expect the world’s largest cryptocurrency to cross the $100,000 mark sooner rather than later. BTC went above $90,000 last Monday, increasing 1.17%. Bullish sentiment persisted as BTC rose to $92,457 on Tuesday and $94,204 on Wednesday as markets continued to push higher. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC surged past $95,000 after an increase of almost 4% and settled at $97,784. BTC set a new all-time high on Friday as it went above $99,000 for the first time, peaking at $99,655 before declining to $98,355. Source: TradingView The weekend saw an uptick in selling pressure as BTC encountered resistance around the $100,000 level. As a result, the price dropped by 1.26% to $97,113. Sellers drove BTC to an intraday low of $94,838 as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of 0.80% and settled at $97,891. The current week began with BTC experiencing a significant decline of just over 5% as it plummeted to $92,845. Buyers attempted a recovery on Tuesday as BTC rose to a day high of $95,012. However, buyers lost momentum at this level and BTC plummeted to a low of $90,707 before settling at $91,913. The current session sees BTC up by 1.40% as buyers attempt to mount a recovery despite facing growing selling pressure. Many analysts expected a market correction as BTC neared $100,000, with indicators like the RSI showing BTC firmly in the overbought territory. However, whether the correction drags BTC below $90,000 remains to be seen. Market watchers anticipated a correction but are confident BTC will break above the $100,000 barrier by the end of the year. “Historically, when new all-time highs are reached, there is typically a period of consolidation before further moves up. We know that new institutional money is coming into the space and retail activity is picking up via ETFs and exchanges. With positive macro and regulatory news ahead, we could see an uptick in price activity.” Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) rebounded impressively to stay above $3,000 as buyers looked for a way past the resistance at $3,500 and move towards $4000. Despite starting the previous week on a positive note, ETH fell back on Tuesday, dropping over 3% to $3,110. Bearish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as ETH dropped by 1.26% to $3,070. However, ETH made a strong recovery on Thursday, surging by 9.42% and settling at $3,360, going above the crucial $3,300 price level. ETH experienced significant volatility on Friday as buyers attempted a move higher and sellers looked to drag ETH lower. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and ETH fell by 0.96% to $3,328. Buyers returned to the market on Saturday as ETH surged to a high of $3,502 before declining and settling at $3,396, an increase of just over 2%. Source: TradingView Sunday saw an increase in selling pressure as ETH dropped to an intraday low of $3,288. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $3,301, registering a decline of 1.01%. The current week began with ETH surging past $3,500 and reaching an intraday high of $3,547, but buyers lost momentum after reaching this level and fell back to $3,415. Selling pressure and volatility returned on Tuesday as the price dropped 2.63% to a low of $3,253 before settling at $3,326. The current session sees ETH back in positive territory, with the price up just over 3% and trading at $3,425. Buyers will look to build momentum and push ETH above $3,500. A break above this level could open the doors for a move towards $3,800 or $4,000. On the other hand, if sellers drive ETH below $3,000, the price could drop to $2,850 before recovering. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) is attempting a recovery as it looks to rebound from the 20-day SMA and push towards $250-$260. The Ethereum killer encountered significant volatility over the past few sessions as prices rose and dipped significantly. SOL reached $239 last Monday after registering an increase of 1.04%. However, it fell back on Tuesday after a significant uptick in selling pressure and volatility. As a result, SOL dropped 0.89% on Tuesday and 0.97% on Wednesday to settle at $235. Bullish sentiment returned on Thursday, and SOL rallied by almost 9% to surge past $250 and settle at $256. However, SOL could not go above $260 on Friday and registered only a marginal increase after facing significant volatility. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted to go above $260 on Saturday, reaching an intraday high of $264 before losing momentum. As a result, sellers took over and drove SOL down by 0.78% to $254. Selling pressure intensified on Sunday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $241 before recovering and settling at $252, registering a drop of 0.83%. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL plummeted by 7.36%, slipping below $250 and settling at $234. Sellers continued to exert influence on Tuesday as SOL plummeted to a low of $221, briefly going below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered from this level to go past the 20-day SMA and settle at $230. The current session sees SOL up by 1.57% and trading at $234. Dogwifhat (WIF) Price Analysis Dogwifhat (WIF) has been trading in a downward trajectory since surging to an intraday high of $4.82. Since then, WIF has seen a dramatic collapse, with the price dropping to $$3.05 last week after consecutive sessions in the red. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, WIF recovered on Thursday, registering an increase of 7.03% and settling at $3.26. WIF experienced significant volatility on Friday as buyers and sellers attempted to exert control. As a result, it fell to an intraday low of $3.04 and rose to an intraday high of $3.43 before registering a decline of 1.94% and settling at $3.20. Source: TradingView The weekend began with buyers in control on Saturday as WIF rose to an intraday high of $3.57. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and WIF fell back to $3.27, ultimately registering an increase of 2.22%. Sunday saw volatility return as buyers and sellers struggled to exert influence. WIF briefly slipped below the 20-day SMA, falling to a low of $3.01 before recovering to reach an intraday high of $3.47 before ultimately registering a drop of 3.08% and settling at $3.17. The current week began with a substantial increase in volatility as WIF surged to a high of $3.65 before rapidly declining and settling at $3.17, registering only a marginal increase. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as WIF slipped below the 20-day SMA after a drop of almost 5% and settled at $3.02 as sellers attempted to drive the price below $3. The current session sees WIF up just over 2% and trading at $3.08. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) has seen a considerable decline after failing to stay above $1.50 as its unprecedented post-election rally hits a significant roadblock. XRP surged past $1 on November 16, buoyed by Donald Trump’s victory and Gary Gensler’s potential resignation from the SEC, a move that was later confirmed. However, XRP’s momentum stalled after crossing this level as it struggled to move past the resistance at $1.20. As a result, XRP began trading between $1.05 and $1.20 until Thursday, when it finally surged past the resistance after an increase of almost 13% and settled at $1.24. Bullish sentiment intensified on Friday as XRP rallied over 18% to settle at $1.47, with buyers eying $1.50. Source: TradingView However, XRP’s momentum stalled from here on. The price surged to an intraday high of $1.63 on Saturday. However, it fell back as buyers lost momentum, allowing sellers to take over and drive the price below $1.50 to $1.47. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as XRP dropped to an intraday low of $1.28. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $1.43, registering a decline of 2.54%. XRP attempted a recovery on Monday as it rose to $1.41, but buyers lost momentum again, and the price dropped by 1.25% to $1.41. Sellers remained in control on Tuesday, pushing XRP to a low of $1.28. Once again, the price recovered to settle at $1.39, registering a marginal decline of 1.17%. The current session sees XRP marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. SEI (SEI) Price Analysis SEI (SEI) has registered an impressive rebound after dropping to a low of $0.451 on Wednesday. Sellers drove the price to a low of $0.442 on Thursday. However, it recovered from this level, registering an increase of over 5% and settling at $0.485. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday as SEI rose by 6.54% to cross $0.50 and settle at $0.517. Buyers retained control on Saturday, pushing SEI up by 3.49% to $0.535. Sunday saw a substantial increase in bullish sentiment as SEI surged over 23% to go above $0.60 and settle at $0.662. Source: TradingView The current week began with a significant jump in volatility as buyers attempted to go above $0.70 and sellers looked to drag it below $0.60. As a result, SEI rose to an intraday high of $0.695 and fell to an intraday low of $0.592 before settling at $0.655, declining 1,08%. Sellers dragged SEI to a low of $0.600 on Tuesday as selling pressure persisted. However, buyers countered the drop, and SEI recovered, rallying 6% to settle at $0.694. However, despite the strong recovery, SEI could not move to $0.70. The current session sees SEI down by just over 5% as sellers look to drive the price below $0.60. Fantom (FTM) Price Analysis Fantom (FTM) has posted a significant rally, taking its price to levels not seen since March. The latest rally began after it dipped below the 20 and 50-day SMAs, dropping to a low of $0.663. However, FTM recovered on Thursday, registering an increase of 6.656% to move back above the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settle at $0.706. Bullish sentiment persisted on Friday as FTM registered an increase of 7.37% and rose to $0.758. Bullish sentiment increased substantially over the weekend as FTM surged to an intraday high of $0.949 before settling at $0.876, an increase of almost 16%. Markets remained bullish on Sunday as FTM surged past $1, registering an increase of nearly 15% and settling at $1. Source: TradingView However, the price fell on Monday as buyers returned to the market, dragging FTM to an intraday low of $0.907. However, it recovered from this level to settle at $0.978. Buyers returned to the market on Tuesday as FTM rallied almost 11% to reclaim $1 and settle at $1.08.

36910228,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102987,1732704403,Will a Wedge Breakout Boost AAVE Price Beyond $224?,"Will the recovery rally in AAVE push the price above $200 to reach a new 52-week high as it breaks out of a falling wedge pattern? AAVE has emerged as one of the top performers in the crypto space, surging by nearly 17% over the past seven days. With its market cap approaching $3 billion, the Aave network’s total value locked (TVL) is nearing a new all-time high.With the boost in its TVL, could AAVE’s price surpass $200 and achieve a new 52-week high? Let’s explore.AAVE’s Wedge Breakout Run The AAVE price trend in the 4-hour chart showcases a rising wedge breakout rally. The price jumped 11.79% in the past 12 hours with three consecutive bullish candles. AAVE Price Chart Currently, the DeFi token is trading at $191.83, sustaining above the broken resistance trendline. As per the November price action, the AAVE price trend showcases a double-bottom reversal from the baseline of $152. The recent recovery run has broken above the neckline at $174 for the third time, reflecting the increased volatility. Furthermore, the bullish recovery has surpassed the 50% Fibonacci level at $187.75. As the AAVE price trend gains momentum, the broader market expects a new swing high above the $200 psychological mark. If this happens, it will complete a new swing high, marking a change of character.The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have all aligned positively with the ongoing recovery. Moreover, the 4-hour RSI is approaching the overbought boundary, suggesting that short-term technical indicators are bullish.AAVE TVL Nears $19.44B, Hints Bull Run AheadAs AAVE’s price rises, its Total Value Locked (TVL) is approaching a new all-time high.

Having surpassed the $1 mark, Fantom is one of the top performers in the crypto market. With a 10.92% surge in the past 24 hours, the 7-day gains have increased to nearly 60%. Crossing the $3 billion market cap, Fantom shows high potential for a parabolic recovery. Will this rally result in an additional 50% surge? Let’s find out.Fantom (FTM) Price AnalysisOn the weekly chart, the FTM price trend reveals a rounding bottom reversal, gaining momentum. Starting from the 23.6% Fibonacci level with the Morning Star pattern, the uptrend has risen more than 300% since August. Fantom Weekly Price Chart The bull run started from a low point of $0.2631 on August 5 and has reached the current market price of $1.09. Completing the rounding bottom reversal, the Fantom price challenges the neckline stage. The overhead neckline coincides with the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $1.05. Furthermore, a resistance zone extending from $1.03 to $1.11 fuels the overhead supply. Fantom Price Chart The FTM price trend shows the rounding bottom reversal surpassing the long-standing resistance trend line. Furthermore, the recent surge has broken above a local resistance trend line that had been limiting bullish growth.The weekly RSI is gradually approaching the overbought boundary at 84.90. Based on the previous peak at 84.90, the RSI shows considerable room for further recovery.The weekly EMA lines are widening, indicating a bullish gap as the uptrend continues. Thus, the technical indicators suggest that Fantom’s bull run is likely to continue.Fantom Network Fuels FTM RallyAs FTM’s price surges, the Fantom network is showing positive numbers. According to FTMscan , the number of unique addresses on the Fantom network has reached 180 million. Additionally, the daily increase of ~18,000 unique addresses will likely accelerate the drive toward 200 million unique addresses on the Fantom network.Furthermore, the total value locked (TVL) on Fantom is at $134.35 million, gradually approaching the 52-week high of $227.44 million. As the network grows, the demand for the FTM token is directly increasing. Fantom TVL Fantom Price TargetsBased on the Fibonacci levels, an uptrend continuation with a weekly close above the neckline could trigger a massive surge. The immediate resistance stands at $1.7457, offering an upside potential of 60% from the current market price.On the other hand, the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.7387 will remain a crucial support level for Fantom.",POSITIVE,FTM,FTM | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/fantom-surpasses-1-mark-will-ftm-price-rally-reach-1-74/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fantom-surpasses-1-mark-will-ftm-price-rally-reach-1-74,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36910226,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=102990,1732701956,Crypto Industry Cheers as Federal Court Invalidates Tornado Cash Sanctions,"A federal appeals court has overturned U.S. sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash, a service designed to anonymize cryptocurrency transactions. This landmark decision challenges the authority of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which had previously sanctioned the protocol. The ruling asserts that the Treasury overstepped its legal boundaries by targeting open-source, immutable smart contracts that cannot be owned or controlled.Court Rules Smart Contracts Are Not “Property”The ruling highlights that while the Treasury can take action against “property,” the smart contracts central to Tornado Cash do not meet this definition. Their immutable and open-source nature makes them unownable, removing them from the scope of sanctions under federal law. The court emphasized that the Treasury’s actions stretched its authority beyond recognition. This decision is expected to restore U.S. persons' ability to use the protocol for privacy-protecting purposes.The case has drawn significant celebration from legal experts. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, expressed that the ruling is a pivotal moment for privacy and freedom. Grewal noted that blocking technology entirely due to misuse by a minority of bad actors was not authorized by Congress. Instead, he argued that the sanctions represented government overreach, which the court has now corrected. Grewal emphasized that the ruling is a historic win for crypto and all who care about defending liberty.https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1861549058797772874 Legal Experts Praise the RulingLegal professionals have joined the conversation, underscoring the decision’s significance. Bill Hughes, a lawyer at ConsenSys, explained that under existing regulations, the sanctioned smart contracts cannot be classified as property and are thus outside the Treasury's jurisdiction. Hughes noted that this specific ruling pertains to smart contracts without administrative keys, leaving other aspects of Tornado Cash open to potential Treasury scrutiny. He also suggested the Supreme Court would be unlikely to reverse the decision, further solidifying its impact.Hughes acknowledged Coinbase's role in challenging the sanctions, emphasizing their influence in shaping this legal outcome. He stated that this case aligns with broader judicial efforts to limit excessive agency discretion.Tornado Cash's Previous ControversyIn June, a Terra Classic community member accused the Terraport team of negligence after stolen funds from a prior exploit were routed through the mixer.Additionally, in September, the exploiter responsible for the high-profile hack of the India-based exchange WazirX transferred 2,600 ETH, valued at approximately $6.5 million, to Tornado Cash. The hacker executed this transaction through 27 separate on-chain transfers.

(August 2022) Grayscale Digital Large Cap: A Potential Arbitrage Opportunity (June 2023) Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund: Achievement Unlocked (December 2023) GDLC: Too Cheap To Ignore Again (March 2024) GDLC: Crypto's Deep Value Play (September 2024) This is a fund that I've covered for Seeking Alpha a half dozen times over the last two years: Seeking Alpha My main critique of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap fund has been what I view to be a poor fundamental methodology. To a larger degree than natural product competitor Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( OTC:BITW ), GDLC has a significant weighting to top coins Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). While I've viewed this as a fundamental weakness of the fund as an investment product, my opinion as a swing trader has been bullish. In this brief update, we'll again look at my 'fair value' framework and assess whether or not now is a good time to take the win in GDLC. Fund Details Inception: 2/01/2018 Expense Ratio: 2.5% AUM: $750 million I still believe the 2.5% expense ratio is far too high for what this fund actually does. Especially when considering the opportunity cost of not staking the proof-of-stake assets in the fund. When GDLC was launched, each share represented exposure to ten different digital assets. Today, we see just five, and those five assets haven't changed in the two months since my last piece. After BTC and ETH, GDLC gives investors exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ), Ripple ( XRP-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ). The chain-native staking rates observable today are shown below: Asset Reward Rate Staking Ratio ETH 3.19% 28.18% SOL 6.41% 65.73% AVAX 7.82% 52.83% Source: Staking Rewards, as of 11/26/24 What's important to understand is not staking AVAX, SOL, and to a lesser degree ETH has an opportunity cost because those assets should be earning yield if they're not going to be used for purchasing other assets on chain or paying gas for DEX swaps. This is a large reason why GDLC may not be a great way to invest in crypto long term. Of course, there is a US regulatory story at play here regarding asset staking, and we'll see if that changes in the future with a new administration in January. 'Fair Value' Framework Of the five assets in the fund, the only one that I personally have zero direct exposure to is XRP. For the purpose of diversified exposure to crypto, I think you can do worse than GDLC, but I still think BITW is a better option at this point due to the fact that BITW shares provide exposure to ten assets rather than just five. Back in September, I reiterated GDLC as a 'buy' again because the fund was trading at a 39% discount to net asset value, or NAV. Today, we find the fund trading at just a 17% discount to NAV. Thus, this has been a very successful trade; especially when considering the appreciation in the assets themselves. For those who have not seen the prior work, my 'fair value' calculation zeroes out the altcoins after BTC and ETH and assigns a full valuation to the BTC and ETH in the fund. The reason I'm not willing to write down either of those assets is because Grayscale has not one, but two ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum that trade at NAV. Thus, I view it as an inefficiency in the market that GDLC can trade at a discount to the BTC and ETH held by the fund: Asset Asset price Holdings/Share $ Val/Share Adjusted Val % of Fund BTC $93,027 0.00037288 $34.69 $34.69 75.5% ETH $3,305 0.00227141 $7.51 $7.51 16.3% SOL $228.6 0.00884517 $2.02 $0.00 4.4% XRP $1.35 1.06633127 $1.44 $0.00 3.1% AVAX $41.36 0.00766179 $0.32 $0.00 0.7% Share Value $45.97 $42.20 Source: Grayscale, CryptoPrices.cc, Author's calculations and adjustments as of 11/26/24 intraday Applying my standard adjustment to GDLC assets produces an adjusted 'fair value' price of $42.20. At a $38 market price, we get an adjusted discount rate of 10%. Given this, I very much believe there is still meat on the bone with this swing trade. However, there are additional considerations to keep in mind. Risks and other Considerations First of all, my view of 'fair value' may not be the same as the market's or that of any individual readers. Frankly, there is no real standard within the digital asset industry for assessing valuations. Furthermore, Bitcoin and Ethereum are very different types of networks and each investor may find valuing them at market price to be too generous. When I last covered GDLC, the 39% discount to NAV was compelling because it discounted even the Bitcoin in the fund if we wrote down the ETH to zero as we do with the SOL, XRP, and AVAX. We don't have that setup anymore, with a $38 share price and $34.69 BTC value per share. Alternative.me Something that I think investors should definitely be mindful of is the greedy sentiment in this market. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index printed a 94 on November 22nd. This took out the 2024 high of 90 on March 5th. BTC's March 14th high didn't get taken out until November 6th and the coin has gone up nearly in a straight line since. I would not rule out a deeper mini correction in Bitcoin before the end of the year. Finally, as discounted as GDLC was in September, related parties did not buy any GDLC shares during Q3-24. For quarter-ended September, related parties still owned 1,055,487 shares. We've generally seen related party holdings decline over the last few quarters. Investor Takeaways I'm still long GDLC, though I do hold less than I did in September. I see two primary reasons to hold the fund as a trade despite my fundamental issues with the product itself; NAV discount rate and broad crypto bullishness. Each of these reasons are less compelling than they were just 2 months. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index printed its highest figure in several years at 94 and the official discount rate has been more than chopped in half since mid-September. Even my adjusted discount is less compelling than it was previously, at just 10%. Again, I do still have some GDLC, but I'm downgrading the fund to a 'hold' and will surely revisit it again for Seeking Alpha when the setup merits.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740585-gdlc-achievement-unlocked-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/36904205.jpeg
36910225,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=103001,1732701810,Report: CFTC to Regulate Spot Market for Bitcoin and Ethereum Under Donald Trump,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump reportedly plans to expand the CFTC regulatory jurisdiction, giving the agency authority to regulate a huge portion of the crypto industry. FOX Business News, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that the CFTC could regulate certain crypto assets, particularly those deemed commodities like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), under Trump’s administration. CFTC to Regulate Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot Market According to the report, this authority would also enable the CFTC to regulate the exchanges where investors trade these crypto assets. Per FOX Business, the move is part of efforts by the forthcoming Trump administration and the Republican majority in Congress to drastically reduce the SEC's regulatory power over the crypto industry. Under the current administration, the SEC considered itself the appropriate regulator for crypto, pursuing stringent enforcement actions against crypto businesses. However, prominent players within Trump’s camp oppose this approach, advocating for friendly rules to drive innovation within the space. The CFTC oversees the derivatives market, including trading of options, futures, and other physical commodities like oil. It also has Congress' backing to establish market rules and prosecute violators. Under Trump's administration, its responsibility could be expanded, allowing it to regulate crypto assets deemed commodities. Despite the SEC’s attempt to label ETH a security, the CFTC maintains that Bitcoin and Ethereum are commodities. These two crypto assets account for over 70% of the $3.22 trillion valuation of the crypto market. With Trump’s administration planning to give the CFTC authority over Bitcoin and Ethereum spot markets, the federal agency will regulate not only the assets but also the exchanges where they are traded. This would provide regulatory clarity for Bitcoin and Ethereum, making the CFTC the main regulator for the spot market transactions of these assets. Currently, Congress has not given any federal agency such authority. Factors Hindering CFTC Crypto Regulation Former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo believes the agency could commence this regulation immediately after Trump's inauguration if it obtains the necessary funding.Giancarlo has been trying to convince Congress to give the CFTC spot authority over crypto. This saw him write a letter to the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2022, making a similar demand. For Giancarlo, the CFTC faces significant challenges in regulating the crypto industry, ranging from lack of funding to understaffing. For context, while the CFTC’s 2024 operating budget is $400 million, the SEC operates with a budget of $2.4 billion. The CFTC has a staff strength of around 700 compared to the 5,300 employees working at the SEC. Expanding the CFTC jurisdiction to include spot market regulation for Bitcoin and Ethereum could increase the agency’s budget and staffing.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/report-cftc-to-regulate-spot-market-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-under-donald-trump/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=report-cftc-to-regulate-spot-market-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-under-donald-trump,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The social network, which is mainly used in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia, will debut with 30 dapps in its portal by the end of January and plans for a further 150 by the end of the first quarter, said Sam Seo, the chairman of Kaia DLT Foundation, whose Kaia blockchain will host the applications.  Line's initiative reflects a growing trend of social media and messaging apps integrating blockchain technology to offer a wider range of services. Telegram, which has more than 900 million users, offers games including Catizen and Hamster Kombat over The Open Network (TON) blockchain. The so-called mini dapps (dapps within apps) also build on the popularity of utility functions added to programs such as WeChat.  “Games are the biggest portion,"" Seo said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""The others are social apps, some DeFi and AI-based chatting dapps.”  The move to dapps comes after the relative failure of earlier blockchain experiments with NFT functionality. In March 2023, Instagram said it would disable the NFT features it introduced the previous year that allowed people to share NFTs they created or bought. And while Reddit’s Digital Collectibles still exist, Collectible Expressions — which were used to animate them — were removed in July this year.  Line itself also made a foray into NFTs, starting an NFT marketplace in Japan in April 2022 and rolling out its own-brand NFT stickers.  “NFTs are too complicated for the normal users. The ideas were good, but I think we needed to improve the UX and UI,” Seo said, referring to the user experience and user interface.  “Previously, the way that users and even creators were looking at NFTs was just as an investment tool, rather than a tool for ownership. I think that was a kind of mismatch between the intention and then the result.”",POSITIVE,TON,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TON,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2024/11/27/line-with-an-eye-on-telegrams-in-app-games-success-to-launch-mini-dapps-next-year,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7486963009ac8da7e2a96d7c4fcf80c1672aecc-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This points to a mounting optimistic pressure. Price Fluctuations And Short-Term Growth In the near term, SHIB has experienced significant price swings. In the last week, its price has gone up by 3.35%, and in the last month, it rose to around 54%. These increases show that the “joke coin” is picking up a lot of steam. However, the trip is not completely uneventful. Despite the favorable short-term development, the price of SHIB has dropped by 4.08% over the last six months, suggesting considerable volatility. Analysts warn that short-term profit-taking after recent advances could obstruct the memecoin’s price movement as it evolves. However, SHIB has a great possibility to grow further with the strong support of its growing ecosystem projects and community.

Also, SHIB is trading 3.20% below what it is expected to be worth in a month, which suggests that prices could go up in the short run. The next goal could be $0.00000900 if SHIB breaks through support at $0.00000850. The coin is expected to experience a 102% increase in the next six months for long-term investors, followed by a 92% increase in the following year, data from CoinCheckup shows. Technical clues indicate a possible breakout and robust long-term forecasts, thus Shiba Inu might be ready for a new phase of development.

On the same day, Binance revealed it is delisting the REN token, leading to a sharp price drop and raising questions about the project’s motives. Critics in the crypto community, including on-chain investigator ZachXBT , have accused Ren Protocol of attempting to farm exit liquidity, further damaging its already fragile reputation. The announcement, shared on social media, promised ongoing work on the Ren v2 upgrade and hinted at future updates. However, many saw the timing as suspicious, especially as Binance’s delisting will halt REN trading, deposits, and withdrawals after December 10. This led to allegations that the team was using the news to briefly inflate the token’s value before its inevitable decline. Prominent critics like ZachXBT , known for exposing fraud in the crypto space, condemned the announcement, casting doubt on the legitimacy of the upgrade claims. “Sounds like you’re farming for exit liquidity,” one user commented, reflecting widespread skepticism in the community. Ren Protocol’s reputation took another hit as users recalled the lack of communication following the shutdown of its v1 network in 2022. Since then, the project has made little visible progress, fueling accusations of neglect and mismanagement. Many community members questioned the timing of this update, suggesting it was a strategic move to generate temporary interest and liquidity in the face of Binance’s delisting. The criticism reached a peak as most responses to the announcement echoed concerns about the project’s intentions. Even if Ren Protocol’s developers are making genuine strides with the v2 upgrade, the damage to their reputation may be hard to repair. The combination of prolonged silence, vague promises, and Binance’s delisting has created a cloud of mistrust around the project. In the fast-moving crypto industry, transparency and accountability are critical for maintaining trust. Ren Protocol’s missteps highlight the risks of prolonged communication gaps and poorly timed announcements.

Alongside this, Trump is also considering creating a “crypto czar” role to guide blockchain and cryptocurrency regulation, signaling a dual focus on emerging technologies. The AI czar would be tasked with overseeing federal AI policy, collaborating with agency officials, and driving innovation while addressing key challenges such as efficiency and fraud prevention. This move aligns with Trump’s broader goals of fostering technological growth and supporting private-sector investment. Elon Musk, a key player in Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), is expected to influence the selection process for this position, though he is unlikely to take on the role himself. The AI czar’s office would not only coordinate government efforts but also encourage private investments to expand energy and computational infrastructure critical for AI advancements. According to the Center for Data Innovation, the role should focus on accelerating AI adoption and ensuring U.S. competitiveness in the global market. Parallel to this, Trump’s administration is also exploring the appointment of a crypto czar to lead reforms in the digital asset sector. Frontrunners for the role include Chris Giancarlo , the former Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) chair known as “Crypto Dad,” and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The crypto czar would oversee regulatory shifts aimed at encouraging innovation while providing clarity to the blockchain industry. This reflects Trump’s intent to move away from the SEC’s contentious approach under outgoing Chair Gary Gensler. Industry leaders have expressed optimism about these plans. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, praised the idea of a crypto czar, emphasizing the need for a neutral leader with a deep understanding of blockchain’s unique potential. However, concerns about potential conflicts of interest have been raised, particularly regarding Musk’s influence in shaping AI policies, which could benefit his companies like xAI. The administration is also considering merging the AI and crypto czar roles into a single position focused on emerging technologies. This combined role would reflect the interconnectedness of AI and blockchain in reshaping the economy and advancing innovation. Trump’s plans include establishing a new regulatory council for digital assets , potentially reducing the SEC’s influence and creating a more innovation-friendly environment. Reports also suggest Trump may acquire a stake in the crypto exchange Bakkt , aligning his policies with his investments. While these appointments could boost U.S. leadership in AI and crypto, they also highlight the challenges of balancing innovation with regulation.

On November 22, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $99,800, just $200 away from hitting $100,000 , a milestone that the crypto community and the global finance space have been anticipating since the last cycle.However, in the two days that followed, Bitcoin traded in a tight range between $99K and $98K. The bears ultimately took control, and Bitcoin broke below this range, hitting a low of $90,700 by Tuesday.With anticipation for $100K slightly dampened, analysts have revisited historical performance, suggesting that Bitcoin may just be gathering stronger momentum to surpass the $100K level.How Bitcoin Initially Missed $20K But Rebounded StrongerSpecifically, they cited the 2016/2017 cycle when anticipation was high for Bitcoin to reach $20,000, but it initially failed to hit the mark. Notably, this happened in December 2017.Bitcoin started the month at $9,694, but eventually rallied 89% to $18,353 seven days later. However, it lost momentum and couldn’t continue climbing to $20K. After hitting $18K on December 8, 2017, Bitcoin dipped to $13,226 the next day.But then, just two weeks later, Bitcoin broke through the $20K level, reaching a cycle peak of $20,089 before entering a bear market, where it eventually tanked to around $3K. Bitcoin at $20K in 2017 Will History Repeat?Now, market participants believe a similar scenario is playing out with the $100,000 psychological price point. Analysts commentaries However, unlike in 2017, the market is still in the halving year, with the post-halving bull run only in its early stages, compared to 2017, when it was at the height of the post-halving rally.Notably, Bitcoin’s failure to surpass $100K last week is attributable to resistance from traders seeking to sell Bitcoin at this psychological level to take profits. However, analysts like Peter Brandt have criticized this reasoning. With the next anticipated rebound, analysts expect Bitcoin to break well beyond $100K. Popular forecasting suggests it could double to $200K or beyond by 2025 before a bear market sets in.At press time, Bitcoin is quickly recovering from the $90K dip, reaching $93,350.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/bitcoin-100k-dream-delayed-a-look-back-at-historical-cycles-and-whats-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-100k-dream-delayed-a-look-back-at-historical-cycles-and-whats-next,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
36903489,https://coinpaprika.com/news/tornado-cash-sanctions-overturned-by-u-s-court,1732700197,Tornado Cash Sanctions Overturned by U.S. Court,"A U.S. federal appeals court has overturned sanctions placed on Tornado Cash , a widely used crypto-mixing service, ruling that its smart contracts cannot be considered property. The decision, made by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, is seen as a major win for advocates of decentralization and privacy. At the same time, it has reignited debates about how blockchain tools, often tied to illegal activities, should be regulated. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022, alleging it was used by groups like North Korea's Lazarus Group to launder stolen funds. However, the court found that OFAC had overreached its authority. Tornado Cash operates through immutable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, which function autonomously without human control. The court determined these contracts do not qualify as property under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ( IEEPA ) because they cannot be owned or restricted. The judges emphasized that while sanctions can block specific users from interacting with Tornado Cash, its decentralized nature means no one, including hackers, can be completely barred from accessing the service. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal celebrated the ruling, calling it a ""historic win"" for crypto and individual freedoms. He stated, ""Sanctioning open-source technology because a small portion of users misuse it is an overreach of government authority."" Coinbase, along with other entities, had sued the government over the sanctions, arguing they unfairly targeted decentralized tools rather than addressing misuse directly. Following the court’s decision, Tornado Cash's native token, TORN , surged nearly 400%, signaling optimism among decentralized finance (DeFi) supporters. This spike highlights confidence in the resilience of privacy-focused blockchain technologies. The ruling also raises broader questions about how decentralized systems fit into current legal frameworks. Tornado Cash and similar crypto-mixing services occupy a legal gray area. They don’t operate like traditional financial institutions and cannot be controlled by a single authority. Critics warn the decision might embolden criminals to exploit blockchain tools, creating challenges for regulators. Supporters of the decision argue that technology itself should not be blamed for its misuse. The court’s emphasis on distinguishing tools from bad actors could set a precedent for how decentralized technologies are treated in the future. Still, lawmakers and regulators are likely to scrutinize these services further to balance innovation with security. In summary , the court's decision has reaffirmed the decentralized nature of smart contracts while exposing gaps in how existing laws address emerging blockchain technologies. As debates over crypto regulation continue, the Tornado Cash ruling underscores the tension between promoting innovation and preventing criminal misuse.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/tornado-cash-sanctions-overturned-by-u-s-court,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36903489.jpeg

36903319,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-plans-to-make-cftc-lead-crypto-regulator,1732699838,Trump Plans to Make CFTC Lead Crypto Regulator,"President-elect Donald Trump’s administration is reportedly considering granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) greater authority over the cryptocurrency market, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum. This plan would reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( SEC ) role in regulating digital assets and shift primary oversight to the CFTC, which is traditionally focused on commodities and derivatives. Under this proposal, the CFTC would oversee Bitcoin and Ethereum spot markets, treating them as commodities rather than securities. Together, these two cryptocurrencies account for about 70% of the global market, valued at approximately $2.24 trillion. The crypto industry largely favors the CFTC’s lighter regulatory touch, viewing it as an opportunity to reduce barriers to innovation. Former CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo, known as ""Crypto Dad,"" has publicly supported the agency’s expanded role, stating it could begin regulating digital commodities immediately with sufficient funding and leadership. This initiative reflects dissatisfaction with the SEC's enforcement-driven approach under outgoing Chair Gary Gensler , who has been criticized for aggressively targeting crypto firms. It also aligns with Republican priorities of fostering innovation and reducing regulatory hurdles. Shifting oversight to the CFTC could harmonize the regulatory landscape and address the longstanding debate over whether digital assets should be classified as securities or commodities. For years, the SEC and CFTC have clashed over jurisdiction, creating a fragmented regulatory environment that has pushed some crypto businesses to move operations overseas. While the SEC views most cryptocurrencies as securities, the CFTC treats Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities. This inconsistency has created uncertainty, stifling the industry's growth. A bipartisan legislative effort, the ""BRIDGE Digital Assets Act,"" aims to foster cooperation between the two agencies. Led by Tennessee Congressman John Rose, the act proposes a joint advisory committee of 20 private-sector representatives to harmonize regulatory policies. The bill criticizes the current enforcement-driven model, arguing it discourages innovation in the U.S. and promotes overseas investment. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam has already shown interest in broader crypto regulation, previously asserting the agency’s authority over Ethereum. The proposed changes could resolve disputes between the CFTC and SEC, such as the SEC’s 2023 classification of all Proof-of-Stake tokens as securities, which conflicted with the CFTC’s view of Ethereum as a commodity. The crypto community has largely welcomed the idea of the CFTC taking the lead. Many view the agency as more favorable toward crypto innovation compared to the SEC. One user commented, “The SEC will no longer be able to strangle the crypto market… The CFTC operates more gently, focusing on institutional players who can handle risks better.” However, challenges remain. The CFTC’s annual budget of $400 million and staff of 700 are significantly smaller than the SEC’s $2.4 billion budget and 5,300 employees. To effectively oversee the crypto spot market, the CFTC would require a substantial increase in funding and resources. Critics have also raised concerns about the potential impact on traditional CFTC constituencies, such as agricultural commodity traders. Addressing these issues in legislative language will be crucial to ensuring bipartisan support. The shift in regulatory focus could provide clearer guidelines for the crypto industry and investors while reducing conflicts between agencies. If implemented, the CFTC-led framework could mark a significant step toward resolving regulatory uncertainty and fostering growth in the U.S. cryptocurrency market. The Trump administration's plan , combined with the bipartisan legislation, may reshape how digital assets are regulated, with the CFTC poised to play a central role.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/trump-plans-to-make-cftc-lead-crypto-regulator,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36903319.jpeg

Long-term holders (LTHs), typically known for their reluctance to sell, have ramped up their distribution activities. According to Glassnode, these LTHs have sold approximately 507,000 BTC worth around $47 billion, which is notably lower than the 934,000 BTC sold during the March 2024 price surge.This selling activity highlights changing patterns among long-term investors, with billions of dollars in profits realized during this period.LTH Drive Bitcoin Supply RedistributionGlassnode data reveals that much of the sell-side pressure originates from coins aged between six months and one year. This trend highlights the potential for further distribution as prices rise, particularly among holders of relatively newer coins. Additionally, 0.27% of the aggregate long-term holder supply is being distributed daily. Remarkably, Glassnode points out that only 177 trading days in Bitcoin's history have seen a higher rate of LTH distribution. This indicates a more aggressive sell-off compared to the March 2024 all-time high (ATH), while older coins remain largely dormant.The ""LTH Liveliness"" metric provides additional insight into this activity. When the metric trends upward, it signals increased spending, while a downward trend suggests HODLing.Despite the current rate of supply distribution exceeding the March peak, the volume of ""Coinday destruction"" remains lower. This suggests that most LTH coins being transacted were acquired recently rather than being held for extended periods.Record Profits Reflect Bull Market DynamicsLong-term Bitcoin holders are playing a pivotal role in the ongoing price discovery by reintroducing previously dormant supply into circulation. Glassnode reports that these entities are locking in a record $2.02 billion in daily profits, surpassing previous highs. This profit-taking behavior aligns with historical trends, where long-term holders become more active during price rallies. However, absorbing this supply requires robust demand, potentially necessitating a period of re-accumulation for the market to stabilize. According to Glassnode, a sustainable equilibrium hinges on this balance between supply and demand.Supply Gaps and the Path to $100,000 For BTCExamining historical supply patterns offers further clarity on current market trends. Glassnode notes that during the March 2024 ATH, supply changed hands at several clusters between $40,000 and $73,000. These clusters formed critical support levels during subsequent market corrections. In contrast, the current rally has left an “air gap” between $76,000 and $88,000, where minimal trading activity occurred. This gap may create challenges for price sustainability if the market corrects lower before attempting to breach the $100,000 mark.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/27/data-shows-long-term-holders-dump-507k-btc-worth-47b-as-bitcoin-eyes-100k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=data-shows-long-term-holders-dump-507k-btc-worth-47b-as-bitcoin-eyes-100k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This organization, which spent nearly $200 million during the 2024 elections, is focused on supporting candidates who advocate for cryptocurrency-friendly regulations. Its influence has already led to significant victories, such as Bernie Moreno’s defeat of anti-crypto Senator Sherrod Brown . Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse contributed $25 million to Fairshake's latest fundraising efforts, joining other major donors like Coinbase and venture capital firm a16z, which contributed $23 million. These donations underline the growing bipartisan interest in supporting the crypto industry through favorable policies. Fairshake has positioned itself as a key player in shaping U.S. politics around cryptocurrency. In 2024, Fairshake backed candidates from both political parties, prioritizing their stance on crypto regulation over party lines. This approach not only secured crypto-friendly candidates in office but also established a foundation for further political influence. Ripple and Coinbase, among Fairshake’s largest donors, have gained increased access to policymakers, with Coinbase’s CEO reportedly consulted by President-elect Donald Trump on regulatory appointments. The success of Fairshake’s 2024 strategy has inspired its aggressive planning for 2026. The PAC’s growing war chest signals its intent to push a pro-crypto agenda more effectively in future elections. With over $100 million already raised, Fairshake is well-positioned to further influence the political landscape. President-elect Trump’s promises of crypto-friendly policies have added momentum to these efforts. His administration is expected to favor the industry, potentially shaping regulations in consultation with key crypto advocates. This growing bipartisan support could result in a more stable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Fairshake’s actions demonstrate how significant political investments can drive change. By focusing on crypto-related issues, the PAC has not only built a powerful coalition of donors but has also reshaped discussions around industry regulation. As 2026 approaches, the PAC is poised to expand its impact, creating opportunities for both the crypto industry and its supporters in Washington.

36902488,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655017,1732698001,"Current Bitcoin Hashrate Can Sustain $4.9 Trillion Cap, CryptoQuant CEO Reveals","The founder and CEO of the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has explained where the peak Bitcoin market cap lies based on the current hashrate. Bitcoin Ceiling Could Lie At This Level Based On Network Hashrate In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju discussed a BTC pricing model that puts upper and lower bounds on the cryptocurrency’s price using the trend in the mining hashrate. The mining hashrate here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total computing power the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners use their computing power to compete against each other to become the first to solve certain mathematical puzzles and receive the block reward as compensation. Related Reading: Chainlink May Reach New ATH If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Says Given that BTC can’t exist without the miners or, at least, not be as secure without a decentralized network, some believe the intrinsic value of the cryptocurrency can be measured using the hashrate. After all, the Bitcoin miners have to pay constant electricity bills to host the hashrate, and they would only be willing to run as many farms as would be worth it. The chart below shows that the BTC mining hashrate has been rising recently and setting new all-time highs (ATHs). The reason behind this uptrend is the rally that the asset has been observing; price is the main variable for the revenue of these chain validators, as the block subsidy they receive in BTC naturally fluctuates with it. Speaking of the block subsidy, a feature of the BTC network is that its value is permanently slashed in half about every four years in an event called the Halving. A consequence of the Halving is that miner revenue in BTC is constantly heading down. The pricing model shared by Young Ju considers this fact by adjusting the mining hashrate. This indicator then takes the market cap’s ratio with this adjusted hashrate and determines the highest and lowest values for this ratio in the asset’s history. Here is the chart for the model that shows what values the asset’s market cap would need to attain for the ratio to become equal to either of these extremes: As displayed in the above graph, the maximum potential Bitcoin market cap based on the current value of the network’s hashrate is almost $5 trillion. The asset’s market cap is a little under $1.9 trillion, which means it’s just 38% of this upper limit. Something to note, though, is that the 2021 bull run top occurred under the top line of the model. So, it’s possible that the top for the current cycle may not touch the line, either. That said, the market cap did come closer to the peak ratio back then than it has so far in this cycle, which could at least suggest there is room left for BTC in the rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes Under $93,000: What’s Behind It? A peculiar feature in the chart’s lines is that they have some abrupt drawdowns in 2016, 2020, and 2024. These naturally correspond to the Halving events that occurred in those years and reflect their economic effect on Bitcoin mining. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $94,400, up more than 2% over the last seven days.

Now, the Australian dollar-Japanese yen exchange rate or the AUD/JPY pair, the classic risk barometer, has turned south again, signaling caution to risk asset bulls.  The Australian dollar (AUD), a commodity currency, is a proxy for global economic health, particularly for emerging markets and China. On the other hand, the Japanese yen (JPY) is seen as a safe-haven currency that investors turn to during times of stress. Thus, a decline in AUD/JPY is considered a risk-off signal.  Matt Simpson, an analyst at The City Index, summed it up in his analysis as follows: ""As AUD/JPY is a classic barometer of risk, we should take note that all is not looking well around current levels. If AUD/JPY tanks, it’s likely to be followed by risk in general.""  A crypto bull might brush off the FX drama as a non-event, particularly against the backdrop of BTC's recent meteoric rise close to $100,000, but history suggests otherwise.  Remember late July and early August? The Japanese yen began rising on rumors that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) was about to hike rates, which it did at the end of the month. The AUD/JPY pair dropped over 8% to 98 in July, hinting at a wave of risk aversion that kicked in during the first week of August.  BTC fell from roughly $70,000 to $50,000 as the yen strength led to traders closing bullish bets in risk assets funded by the cheap JPY-denominated loans. The AUD/JPY pair eventually found a floor at 90 and rebounded alongside other risk assets.  Fast forward to now, the AUD/JPY pair has dipped below the trendline, characterizing its recovery from the early August low of 90. The breakdown points to a renewed strength in the yen accompanied by a growing chatter of a possible BOJ rate hike next month.  If that's not enough, markets are second-guessing the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by another 25 basis points next month and trade war fears are resurfacing with President-elect Donald Trump's plans to impose the supposedly-inflationary tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.  ""Expectations are growing that the BOJ will raise rates again in December. This comes amid the prevailing view that the Fed will keep rates on hold at the December FOMC meeting,"" ING said in a note to clients this week, adding it expects the BOJ to lift the benchmark borrowing costs in December.   ""On 21 November, [BOJ governor] Ueda left the door open for further tightening, stating that the BOJ would 'decide at each meeting,' fueling speculation of a December rate hike,"" ING explained.

This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up.

36901139,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24493,1732694778,Bitfinex Alpha | Dòng vốn ETF và nhu cầu từ tổ chức đang thúc đẩy giá Bitcoin,"Tải Full Báo Cáo Bitcoin đang tiến gần đến cột mốc lịch sử 100.000 USD với sức mạnh phi thường nhờ dòng tiền khủng ồ ạt từ các quỹ ETF Bitcoin và nhu cầu mạnh mẽ từ các tổ chức. Mặc dù gặp phải áp lực chốt lời gần 99.334 USD – mức cao nhất mọi thời đại mới nhất – nhưng BTC đã chứng tỏ khả năng phục hồi bất khuất, giữ vững gần 96.000 USD trong suốt cuối tuần, trước khi lấy lại sức mạnh vào đầu phiên giao dịch hôm thứ Hai. Với mức tăng 47% so với mức thấp trước bầu cử là 66.880 USD và mức tăng đáng kinh ngạc 130% từ đầu năm đến nay, BTC đang viết nên lịch sử cho riêng mình. Không thể phủ nhận hiệu suất vượt trội của BTC so với các tài sản truyền thống: Bitcoin hiện đã vượt mặt Saudi Aramco về vốn hóa thị trường, chễm chệ ở vị trí tài sản lớn thứ bảy toàn cầu, với mức định giá cao nhất vượt quá 1,9 nghìn tỷ USD và đã vượt xa vàng và bạc tương đối trong quý này. Mặc dù đà tăng của Bitcoin là rất đáng chú ý, nhưng không phải là sẽ luôn “êm đềm”, các Long-term holder (LTH) đã chốt lời kha khá . Hơn 461.000 BTC đã được “xả” ra thị trường kể từ khi phá vỡ mức cao nhất mọi thời đại 73.666 USD vào tháng trước, khi LTH tận dụng lợi nhuận cao hơn nhiều so với giá trị thực tế là 24.912 USD. Mặc dù có áp lực phân phối gia tăng, nhưng vẫn trong tầm kiểm soát so với các đỉnh lịch sử vào tháng 3/2021 và tháng 3/2024 . Những diễn biến này cho thấy đà tăng trưởng đang chững lại tạm thời, nhưng tích cực với thị trường nói chung và có khả năng hấp thụ áp lực bán để tiếp tục tăng trong trung hạn. Thị trường tiền điện tử nói chung, ngoại trừ Bitcoin và Ethereum được gọi là chỉ số phân tích kỹ thuật Total3, cũng đã đạt mức cao mới trong chu kỳ, được thúc đẩy bởi tâm lý nhà đầu tư đang hưng phấn. Total3 đã trải qua mức tăng từ đáy lên đỉnh 23,2% vào tuần trước – mức tăng lớn nhất kể từ tháng 4/2021. Các altcoin vốn hóa lớn, chẳng hạn như Solana ( SOL ), đã đạt mức cao nhất mọi thời đại mới, đánh dấu một bước ngoặt lịch sử khi chúng vượt qua các mức kháng cự quan trọng, bao gồm cả mức cao nhất vào tháng 4/2022. Vốn hóa thị trường altcoin hiện đang tiến gần đến đỉnh tháng 5/2021 là 984 tỷ USD, cho thấy sự dịch chuyển của vốn đầu cơ từ Bitcoin sang altcoin. Trong lịch sử, những vòng quay như vậy đã báo hiệu sự khởi đầu của “mùa altcoin”, một giai đoạn đặc trưng do mức tăng trưởng vượt trội của altcoin so với Bitcoin. Đúng là vậy khi lãi suất tài trợ hàng năm cho các altcoin vốn hóa lớn đang vượt qua ngưỡng 45%, báo hiệu hoạt động đầu cơ nóng dần . Khi sự tham gia của nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ tăng lên, biến động trong khung thời gian ngắn hơn dự kiến ​​sẽ tăng lên, tiếp tục thúc đẩy đà tăng của altcoin. Tuy nhiên, những điều kiện này đòi hỏi sự thận trọng, vì lãi suất tài trợ cực cao thường báo động trước những đợt điều chỉnh mạnh. Bối cảnh kinh tế Mỹ hiện cũng đang được định hình bởi những tín hiệu trái chiều, với dữ liệu tương phản từ tâm lý người tiêu dùng, hoạt động sản xuất và thị trường nhà ở, phản ánh sự pha trộn giữa lạc quan và những thách thức dai dẳng. Tâm lý người tiêu dùng đã tăng lên 71,8 vào tháng 11, nhờ sự lạc quan của Đảng Cộng hòa sau cuộc bầu cử, mặc dù kỳ vọng lạm phát dài hạn đã leo lên mức 3,2% , phản ánh lo ngại về các chính sách của ông. Hoạt động sản xuất hạ nhiệt, với chỉ số hoạt động chung giảm xuống -5,5 , nhưng xu hướng tích cực trong đơn đặt hàng và việc làm, cùng với kỳ vọng tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ trong tương lai cho thấy khả năng phục hồi. Thị trường nhà ở phải đối mặt với những thách thức đáng kể , với sự sụt giảm trong tháng 10 về số nhà khởi công và giấy phép xây dựng do lãi suất thế chấp cao và sự gián đoạn của bão, làm trầm trọng thêm tình trạng thiếu nhà ở trên toàn quốc. Những xu hướng này cho thấy sự lạc quan ở một số khu vực nhưng những thách thức mang tính cấu trúc dai dẳng ở những nơi khác. Trong tin tức về tiền điện tử tuần trước, SEC đã trì hoãn quyết định về đề xuất ETF kết hợp BTC-Ethereum của Franklin Templeton, mặc dù đã có phê duyệt cho việc giới thiệu các quyền chọn ETF BTC. Trong khi đó, Hàn Quốc có kế hoạch áp dụng thuế lãi vốn tiền điện tử 20% vào năm 2025, nhưng đang nâng ngưỡng miễn trừ lên 50 triệu won (~35.919 USD) để giảm thiểu tác động đối với các nhà đầu tư nhỏ. Các cuộc bỏ phiếu lập pháp dự kiến ​​diễn ra trong tháng này. Và như đã đề cập, Cboe sẽ ra mắt các quyền chọn thanh toán bằng tiền mặt gắn với Bitcoin giao ngay vào ngày 2 tháng 12, cung cấp các công cụ hiệu quả để tiếp xúc với giá và quản lý rủi ro. Những phát triển này nhấn mạnh sự hội nhập ngày càng tăng của tiền điện tử vào tài chính chính thống. Và đó là những tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha 132. Chúc bạn một tuần giao dịch thuận lợi!

In a recent interview, he suggested that the current market challenges could be temporary and that the rally might not be over. Bullish Future For Bitcoin Amid Regulatory Shifts Reflecting on Pantera Capital’s journey since launching its Bitcoin fund 11 years ago, Morehead acknowledged the skepticism they faced in 2013. “People totally thought we were crazy in 2013,” he stated, emphasizing the persistent negativity surrounding Bitcoin. The executive views this prevailing pessimism as a positive sign, reinforcing his bullish stance. “So many people are still negative. It’s far from being a bubble,” Morehead told Bloomberg. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained Pantera’s Bitcoin fund has yielded a substantial lifetime return of 132,118% since its inception in July 2013, when Bitcoin was valued at just $74. Morehead predicts that Bitcoin could eventually reach $740,000, attributing this potential growth to a changing regulatory landscape. Morehead highlighted the shift from “15-year regulatory headwinds to tailwinds,” particularly citing the more crypto-friendly policies expected from the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The original Bitcoin fund launched by Pantera is notable for being the first to provide US investors with direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. Having recently traded around $91,000 after nearing $100,000 last week, the Bitcoin price has surged approximately 120% this year. Advocating For Crypto Reserves Morehead also discussed Pantera’s new venture fund, Pantera Fund V, which aims to raise $1 billion to invest in various blockchain assets, including private tokens and “special opportunities” such as locked Solana (SOL) tokens from the FTX estate. “Fortunately, we raised the big fund right before the industry-wide blowups in 2022,” Morehead remarked, noting that this timing has allowed them to deploy capital effectively over the last few years. The company’s founder pointed out that many “generalist firms” have exited the cryptocurrency space, leaving fewer competitors in the market. This environment has reportedly enabled Pantera Capital to secure “better pricing and more advantageous deals.” Related Reading: BNB Price Sets Up for a Comeback: Bulls Eye Higher Levels Morehead, who has a background as a trader at Goldman Sachs, also commented on Trump’s proposal for a US Bitcoin stockpile. He described the idea as “rational,” arguing that holding gold as a reserve is an “outdated method” of storing wealth. “If they put some of that money in Bitcoin, that is a fantastic way to have a reserve currency holding,” he concluded. At the time of writing, the leading crypto has regained the $93,000 level, while recording a 1.5% decline in the 24-hour timeframe.

42389137,3da2a3b5-cfa7-4d41-be27-6c1d59eff709,1732692088,Think Ethereum’s ETH is Dead? Surging Metrics Show Otherwise,"The overwhelming chatter on social media, especially Crypto Twitter is that Ethereum’s ether (ETH) is dead, a narrowly moving token.  Still, the market is betting on higher ETH prices as traders pile into derivatives tied to the cryptocurrency alongside a boom in Ethereum's blob usage.  Cumulative open interest in perpetual and standard futures contracts has surged to a record 6.32 million ETH, worth over $27 billion, registering a 17% month-to-date gain, according to data source CoinGlass. An uptick in open interest alongside a price is said to validate an uptrend, and ether's price has surged 35% to $3,400 this month, matching the industry leader's bitcoin's price gain.  According to data source Velo, the gap between three-month ETH futures and spot prices, the so-called premium, has expanded to an annualized 16% on offshore exchanges Binance, OKX and Deribit. Meanwhile, the front-month premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has risen to 14%.  That's noteworthy because an elevated premium could generate greater interest in cash and carry trades used to capture the price differential between the two markets, leading to increased inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs. The strategy comprises a long position in the spot ETF with a simultaneous short in the CME futures.  Activity in the ether options market listed on Deribit is also picking up, with over 2 million contracts active or open at press time, the highest since late June. In notional terms, the open interest stands at $7.33 billion, according to Deribit Metrics.  The price uptick has further driven up the value of assets locked on Ethereum-based applications to $65 billion as of Wednesday, a figure last seen in May 2022.  A major chunk of those, however, are held on three applications. Liquid staking protocol Lido holds over $32 billion in locked ether, Aave, a lending protocol, holds $26 billion in various assets, and restaking platform EigenLayer holds $14 billion.  Data shows a bump in revenue, fees, new wallets and on-chain volumes on Ethereum, with the past month showing elevated levels of activity compared to the period from May to September. (The metrics are no where close to an year-to-date peak seen in March, when interest around ETH ETFs was at a high.)  The Solana network and its applications continue to dominate DeFi activity, however, due to its broader retail appeal and cheap fees.  Stablecoin data further shows that Ethereum has more USDT hosted than Tron, with $60.3 billion on Ethereum compared to $57.94 billion on Tron, for the first time since June 2022.  Among sentiment factors, president-elect Donald Trump’s victory has brought back hopes of a decentralized finance (DeFi) bull market, at least among some investors, and with it demand for ETH.  The campaign indicated a move toward reducing the regulatory burden on crypto, potentially making it easier for DeFi platforms to operate within the U.S — a promise that has spurred growth in ETH and major DeFi tokens since early November.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/27/think-ethereum-s-eth-is-dead-surging-metrics-show-otherwise,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2c54a47dc8de462c8b1143ab63e3e0e2c91a4da3-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The sector has recently reclaimed a key two-year level that could set the stage for a retest of 2021’s highs. Some analysts consider that Altcoins’ recent performance could kickstart the long-awaited Altseason. Related Reading: How High Can XRP Price Realistically Go After Gensler’s Resignation? Altcoins Market Cap Reclaims 2022 Levels The total crypto market has seen a remarkable performance for the past 21 days, jumping to a market capitalization of $3.36 trillion. This surge, fueled by the US elections on November 5, has led Bitcoin’s price to a 40% increase to its latest all-time high (ATH) of $99,645. Similarly, Altcoins have started to record their best performance in years, with tokens like Cardano (ADA) and XRP (XRP) surpassing the long-awaited $1 mark. Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and SUI (SUI) hit new ATHs recently, igniting investors’ bullishness for the cycle’s second leg up. The community has also expressed optimism for the ‘King of Altcoins’ recent performance after Ethereum (ETH) recovered the key $3,300 support zone last week. The crypto market’s performance has led the Altcoins’ market capitalization to hit a two-year high and reclaim key levels. Notably, the total cryptocurrency market cap, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, surpassed the Q1 2024 high of $788 billion as BTC soared past the $90,000 resistance. The momentum led the Altcoins market cap to break above the $840 billion mark last week, a level not seen since April 2022. Since then, Alts have held above this range despite the market retraces, turning this horizontal level into support. Additionally, it neared May 2021’s high of $984 billion, a crucial resistance level ahead of the Altcoins market cap ATH of $1.13 trillion. Altseason To Start Soon? According to Bitfinex’s Alpha report, this marks Altcoins’ “largest through-to-peak move” since April 2021. The 23.2% increase hints at an increasing investor appetite, leaving behind the previous “start of the bear market” levels. This movement “indicates a rotation of speculative capital and interest from Bitcoin into Altcoins as retail market participation increases,” the Bitfinex analysts explained, which tends to mark “the onset of the final stage of the bull market where altcoins begin to outperform Bitcoin on an aggregate basis.” Crypto analyst MikyBull pointed out that Alts dominance “just climbed above the trend ribbon” on Tuesday. The analyst’s chart, which excludes the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, displayed Altcoin’s dominance at 10.37%, breaking above the multi-month downtrend line. Per the post, this has indicated before that “Alts are about to outperform in the next coming weeks.” Similarly, he highlighted a breakout from a multi-year cup and handle pattern in the Altcoins’ chart. To him, the Alts have started running after breaking out from the pattern’s neckline, and investors will see the “full potential of the Altseason” from December to March 2025.

Nonetheless, the report noted that breaking above the $984 billion resistance would signal a continuation of altcoins ascend.

Bitwise filed an S-1 registration with the SEC to launch a balanced Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, while VanEck also recently announced that it will be extending fee waivers for its Bitcoin ETF to maintain a competitive edge in the booming market that surpassed $100 billion in net assets. Bitcoin's on-chain activity is nearing 1 million daily active users, which indicates that there is still growing retail adoption. Due to this, some analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin reaching $100,000 by the year's end. Bitwise Files S-1 Registration for Bitcoin and Ether ETF NYSE Arca filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of a new exchange-traded product (ETP) from asset management firm Bitwise. The product will provide balanced exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). In a Form S-1 registration statement that was submitted on Nov. 26, Bitwise outlined its plans to launch a spot Bitcoin and Ether ETP, which will hold both assets in proportions reflecting their relative market caps. The product is designed to offer investors an accessible way to get exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies. While Bitwise did not reveal a specific launch date, it stated that trading would start “as soon as practicable” after the filing's approval. The SEC’s decision on the proposed ETP is still uncertain, particularly considering the anticipated leadership changes in the regulatory body. Chair Gary Gensler is set to step down on Jan. 20. His successor will be chosen by President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office in January. With the recent Republican victories in the House of Representatives and Senate, industry leaders speculate that the regulatory landscape could become a lot more favorable to cryptocurrency starting in 2025. Bitwise’s filing happened during a time of increased activity in the crypto ETF space. On Nov. 21, the firm also submitted a registration for a spot Solana ETF, while other asset managers recently proposed ETFs tied to Hedera and XRP. Earlier this year, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, followed by spot Ether ETFs in May. This could suggest that the regulator is becoming a lot more willing to consider these kinds of crypto products. However, how the SEC will handle these new filings under its leadership changes remains to be seen. VanEck Extends Bitcoin ETF Fee Waiver VanEck also recently announced an extension of the fee waiver for its VanEck Bitcoin ETF (HODL) to try and attract more investors in the competitive Bitcoin ETF market. According to the asset manager’s statement on Nov. 25, the waiver will now cover management fees for the ETF’s first $2.5 billion in net assets until Jan. 10 of 2026. This is a big increase from the previous $1.5 billion threshold, which was set to expire in March of 2025. VanEck’s HODL ETF charges a baseline management fee of 0.20%, which, while competitive, is slightly higher than the 0.15% annual sponsor fee that is charged by Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Many crypto ETFs, including those tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum, initially waived some or all of their management fees when they were launched, and many set an expiration period of six months to a year. VanEck’s move to extend its fee waiver suggests that the company is taking steps to maintain its competitive edge and to encourage investors to consider Bitcoin as part of their portfolios. Currently, VanEck Bitcoin ETF manages approximately $1.22 billion in net assets, which positions it behind several larger competitors. The leading spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), amassed $46 billion in assets under management, according to BlackRock. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) The broader Bitcoin ETF market experienced very impressive growth , which was driven by increased adoption and investor interest, particularly after the U.S. presidential election victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump. Bitcoin ETFs even surpassed $100 billion in net assets for the first time on Nov. 21, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data . Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, attributed the growth to widespread Bitcoin adoption and the appeal of ETFs as a much simpler and cost-effective way for new investors to access the cryptocurrency. Armour pointed out that ETFs provide benefits like cheaper trading, lower fees, and secure Bitcoin storage, which appeals to those who are unfamiliar with setting up wallets or navigating crypto exchanges. Bitcoin Nears 1M Daily Active Users Bitcoin is nearing 1 million daily active users for the first time since 2019. This could suggest that here is a resurgence in adoption that could pave the way for the crypto to surpass the $100,000 milestone. Blockchain analytics platform IntoTheBlock pointed out BTC’s growth in on-chain activity, and shared that its daily active addresses are approaching a million. Analysts see this as a shift from dominance by large investors, or whales, to broader retail participation. Anndy Lian , a blockchain expert, shared that this transition could lead to more stable price movements, as retail investors typically behave differently from whales whose large trades very often cause a lot of price volatility. The increase in active addresses also indicates a healthier and more robust Bitcoin network, which is promising for long-term investors. Despite a recent 6% correction to $92,400 due to selling from long-term holders, the growing network activity is still a bullish indicator. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that these corrections are not linked to ETF outflows, and retail adoption is still gaining momentum. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Trading volumes have stayed relatively stable as well, and Blockchain.com data shows a daily average trading volume of $817 million on Nov. 26. This was down from the $1.58 billion that was recorded on Nov. 14. Anndy Lian suggested that while on-chain activity is increasing, it has not yet translated into buying or selling pressure. Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget Research, warned that profit-taking and liquidation risks from leveraged positions exceeding $3.4 billion could contribute even more to price volatility. The rising number of active users and solid on-chain foundations fueled optimism among some analysts that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 by the end of November. IntoTheBlock revealed that more than 458,000 addresses accumulated 344,000 BTC above $96,700, creating a strong base for upward momentum. This optimism is also supported by Bitcoin’s rally after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory. According to Isaac Joshua , the CEO of Gems Blockchain Launchpad, the current momentum, coupled with Bitcoin’s growing adoption as a hedge against inflation and a weakening dollar, could attract the $500 billion in additional inflows needed to push the price beyond $100,000. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs saw strong inflows , with $2.4 billion added to the funds last week. This contrasted sharply with $2 billion in outflows from China ETFs amid economic concerns.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6271/bitwise-submits-s-1-filing-for-etf-holding-bitcoin-and-ether,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

36896794,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655085,1732685423,"Polkadot Q3 Digest: Examining The Network’s Growth, Challenges, And Future Prospects","Market intelligence firm Messari recently released its third quarter (Q3) performance report for Polkadot (DOT), providing insights into the blockchain network’s development and financial metrics during this period. Polkadot Sees Strong Developer Engagement One of the notable findings from the report is the developer activity on Polkadot. According to Electric Capital, the network had approximately 2,400 monthly active developers in July 2024, with 760 classified as full-time contributors. This positioned Polkadot fourth among leading blockchain networks, trailing only Ethereum, Base, and Polygon. Furthermore, Artemis tracked an average of 630 weekly active core developers and 760 ecosystem developers during Q3, underscoring a vibrant development community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained Polkadot also made significant strides in Q3 2024 with several key initiatives aimed at enhancing its ecosystem. The Decentralized Futures program, backed by a substantial $20 million fund and 5 million DOT tokens, has been pivotal in driving innovation. This initiative provided grants to various projects focusing on marketing, business development, governance, and technology. Notable projects supported include AirLyft, DotPlay, and BlockDeep Labs. Another critical development is the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM), a standardized messaging protocol that facilitates communication between different consensus-driven systems, including rollups. Daily XCM transfers averaged around 1,000, representing a 34% decline quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). In contrast, non-asset transfer use cases, referred to as “XCM Other,” experienced a 5% increase, averaging 200 daily transfers. Overall, total daily XCM messages averaged 1,300, reflecting a 29% drop QoQ. Despite these fluctuations, a significant portion of activity on the Polkadot network continues to occur through Polkadot rollups. DOT Market Cap Plummets 27% In Q3 In terms of market performance, DOT has experienced notable volatility through the year. From Q3 2023 to Q1 2024, DOT’s market capitalization soared by 150%, rising from $5 billion to $13 billion. However, in the subsequent quarters, including Q2 and Q3 2024, DOT retraced alongside the broader market, ending Q3 2024 with a market cap of $6.3 billion—a 27% decline QoQ. This drop also saw DOT’s market cap ranking fall from 14th to 15th, even as it remains the seventh largest base layer network. Transaction fees on the Polkadot chain have generally remained lower compared to competitors, attributed to the network’s structural design. In Q3 2024, transaction fees aligned with historical averages, totaling $84,000—a 44% decrease QoQ. Fees denominated in DOT also declined by 21% to 17,000. Related Reading: Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin, Says MARA CEO The Polkadot Treasury on the other hand, saw continued active usage, with 9.5 million DOT allocated for proposals, 7.4 million for bounties, and 2.5 million burned. A significant development was the approval of Polkadot Referendum 457 in Q2 2024, which diversified the treasury with USDT and USDC, enabling treasury proposals to be denominated in stablecoins. By the end of Q3 2024, the treasury balance stood at $122 million. Daily active addresses dropped to 6,200 (-26% QoQ), daily returning addresses decreased to 5,300 (-23% QoQ), and daily new addresses fell to 900 (-38% QoQ). In terms of immediate price action, the DOT price has traded at the $8 level for the past four days, and has since consolidated above it. The token has been one of the best performers since Donald Trump’s election on November 5, posting a substantial 96% gain in the monthly time frame.

36896821,https://coinpaper.com/6272/incoming-trump-presidency-eyes-cftc-led-crypto-regulation,1732685417,Incoming Trump Presidency Eyes CFTC-Led Crypto Regulation,"The intersection of cryptocurrency and US politics is increasingly evident, as major industry players like Ripple and policy shifts under the incoming Trump administration signal a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation. Ripple's significant contributions to pro-crypto political action committees and discussions about granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) greater authority over digital assets shines the spotlight on the growing influence of blockchain advocates in shaping the nation’s regulatory landscape. Trump Administration May Reshape Crypto Regulation, Empowering CFTC President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration are reportedly considering granting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) enhanced authority over digital assets. The proposed shift, as reported by Fox Business, aims to redefine the regulatory responsibilities of federal agencies overseeing the burgeoning crypto industry. This development, if realized, would mark a pivotal change, particularly in the oversight of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These assets, widely considered commodities, are expected to fall squarely within the CFTC's purview under the proposed framework, reducing the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regulating the crypto space. According to sources cited by Fox Business, the revamped role of the CFTC could include jurisdiction over cryptocurrency exchanges and spot markets handling assets classified as commodities. This realignment would align with the CFTC's existing authority in derivatives markets, extending it into broader aspects of the crypto sector. For years, regulatory uncertainty has hampered the growth of cryptocurrency businesses in the US, with overlapping mandates from the SEC and CFTC creating confusion. The Trump administration's potential plan could streamline oversight, granting the CFTC a more prominent role while simultaneously curbing the SEC's involvement in areas outside its traditional focus on securities. Outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has faced criticism for his stringent stance on the crypto industry, previously supported this shift. Gensler acknowledged that Bitcoin, as a commodity, should fall under the CFTC's jurisdiction, an opinion he has expressed in public statements. Earlier this year, the CFTC also classified Ethereum as a commodity in its complaint against crypto exchange KuCoin, further cementing its claim to authority over key digital assets. A Crypto-Friendly Administration? President-elect Trump's commitment to reshaping the regulatory framework is part of his broader campaign promises to bolster the US crypto industry. Trump has outlined a series of measures designed to make the US a global leader in cryptocurrency innovation. These include: Creating a Federal Bitcoin Reserve: Trump has suggested establishing a federal bitcoin reserve, akin to a strategic commodity reserve, to underscore the government’s support for the leading cryptocurrency. Appointing a Crypto-Specific Role: The administration plans to introduce the first-ever crypto-specific role in the White House to advise on blockchain policy and digital asset regulation. Firing Gary Gensler: Trump's pledge to remove Gensler as SEC Chair has been widely anticipated, given the Chair's contentious approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Gensler confirmed last week that he intends to resign on January 20, 2025, coinciding with Trump's inauguration as the 47th president of the United States. These promises, if fulfilled, could mark a stark departure from the previous administration's regulatory approach, which was often characterized by legal battles with crypto companies and a focus on enforcement rather than clarity. The SEC-CFTC Power Struggle Under Gensler's leadership, the SEC has aggressively pursued enforcement actions against crypto firms, arguing that many digital assets should be classified as securities. This has led to disputes with companies like Ripple Labs, Coinbase, and Binance, creating a chilling effect on the industry. The proposed empowerment of the CFTC would dilute the SEC’s ability to regulate cryptocurrencies that are not securities, particularly those widely accepted as commodities. This shift would also align with global regulatory trends, where distinct agencies manage securities and commodities independently. Critics of the SEC's approach have argued that the lack of clear guidelines has stifled innovation and driven businesses offshore. By granting the CFTC greater authority, the Trump administration could create a more predictable environment for crypto businesses to operate, potentially attracting investment and talent back to US markets. News of the potential regulatory overhaul has sparked widespread speculation within the crypto community and financial markets. Industry leaders have largely welcomed the prospect of a more focused regulatory framework, viewing it as a positive step toward legitimizing digital assets and fostering growth. However, skeptics caution that transferring power to the CFTC may not resolve all regulatory challenges. Questions remain about how the agency will handle its expanded responsibilities and whether additional legislation will be needed to define its role in the crypto space. Global markets are also watching closely, as the US remains a key player in the adoption and regulation of digital assets. The Trump administration's approach could set a precedent for other nations navigating similar regulatory dilemmas. Ripple’s $25 Million PAC Donation Aims to Influence Pro-Crypto Political Landscape In other news, blockchain payments firm Ripple, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, has announced another major contribution to the Fairshake political action committee (PAC), reaffirming its commitment to influencing US elections and promoting pro-crypto policies. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed in a Nov. 26 social media post that the company would contribute $25 million to Fairshake to bolster efforts aimed at electing “pro-crypto, pro-growth, and pro-innovation candidates” in upcoming US elections. The announcement comes on the heels of Ripple's previous contributions to Fairshake, amounting to $45 million during the 2024 election cycle, positioning Ripple as one of the PAC’s most significant financial backers alongside cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Jump Crypto, and venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. Fairshake’s Impact on the Political Landscape Fairshake has become a driving force in shaping US politics around cryptocurrency regulation. The PAC confirmed that it has amassed approximately $103 million in funds, which will be deployed during the 2026 US election cycle. During the 2024 primaries and general elections, Fairshake emerged as one of the most influential spenders, with its efforts contributing to the election of a pro-crypto majority in Congress. According to Fairshake, about two-thirds of elected candidates are considered advocates for the cryptocurrency industry, a significant win for the sector. While Fairshake maintains a bipartisan focus, its activities come at a pivotal moment in US politics. The 2024 election resulted in a Republican sweep of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives—a “trifecta” win not seen since 2017. This shift could bring a new legislative agenda that prioritizes bills like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and stablecoin regulation. Ripple’s latest contribution is evidence of the crypto industry's growing involvement in US politics as it seeks to establish a favorable regulatory framework. By supporting Fairshake, Ripple aims to ensure that lawmakers take a balanced approach to crypto regulation, promoting innovation while addressing legitimate concerns. Brad Garlinghouse, a vocal advocate for clear and fair crypto policies, highlighted the importance of the 2026 elections in shaping the industry’s future. Fairshake has already indicated plans to focus on key races, such as the Ohio Senate seat currently held by Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chair of the Senate Banking Committee and a prominent crypto critic. While Ripple as a company has thrown its weight behind Fairshake, its leadership has demonstrated diverse political allegiances. CEO Brad Garlinghouse, for instance, refrained from direct contributions to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign but expressed confidence in the Republican president-elect’s ability to “make crypto great again.” In contrast, Ripple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen contributed $12 million to PACs supporting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign. The next US midterm elections, scheduled for Nov. 3, 2026, will see all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 Senate seats up for grabs. With a pro-crypto Congress in place, the 2026 cycle could be a turning point for the cryptocurrency industry as it continues to lobby for comprehensive and innovation-friendly legislation. Fairshake’s success in the 2024 elections suggests that the PAC will continue to play a critical role in shaping crypto-friendly policy debates. However, its ability to influence outcomes in 2025 and 2026 will depend on how the newly elected Congress addresses pressing regulatory issues, including: Stablecoin Legislation: Establishing clear rules for stablecoin issuers to promote transparency and stability. Digital Asset Frameworks: Crafting laws that define the roles of agencies like the SEC and CFTC in regulating cryptocurrencies. Tax and Reporting Policies: Simplifying tax obligations for crypto users and companies while ensuring compliance. The stakes are high for the crypto industry as it pushes for clarity and consistency in regulation. While some in the industry view the Republican majority as an opportunity to pass pro-innovation laws, others caution against overconfidence, noting that partisan divides could still hinder progress on complex regulatory issues.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6272/incoming-trump-presidency-eyes-cftc-led-crypto-regulation,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Ripple utilizes XRP to enhance network liquidity and support its ecosystem, placing 55 billion XRP in escrow for controlled supply release.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is making waves as the newest dog-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this token brings a playful spirit to the crypto community. Meme coins thrive on fun and community engagement, often emerging from internet jokes or pop culture trends. WIF joins a pack of dog-themed tokens, but its unique meme origin sets it apart, attracting enthusiasts looking for the next big thing in the meme coin world. Riding on Solana's fast and efficient network, Dogwifhat taps into the growing interest in alternative meme coins beyond the usual Ethereum-based tokens. In a market cycle where meme coins are catching eyes again, WIF offers a fresh option for those captivated by viral trends. While it doesn't promise groundbreaking technology, its appeal lies in community building and the potential for rapid growth. However, like its meme coin peers, WIF comes with high volatility and a massive supply. As the crypto market watches for the next standout meme coin, Dogwifhat presents an intriguing possibility amid the current trends. POPCAT (POPCAT) Meet POPCAT, the latest meme coin bringing joy to the crypto world. Inspired by the viral Popcat meme from October 2020, this token stars Oatmeal, a cat whose quirky expressions captured hearts online. The meme features two images: one with Oatmeal's mouth closed, and another edited to form a surprised ""O"" shape. These simple pictures sparked laughter across the globe, and now, POPCAT aims to spread that same cheer in the realm of cryptocurrency. POPCAT is designed purely for entertainment. It doesn't promise financial gains or serious investment opportunities. In a market often filled with complex projects and hefty expectations, POPCAT stands out with its lighthearted charm. While other meme coins like Dogecoin have soared in popularity, POPCAT offers a fresh, fun twist that's all about embracing the lighter side of crypto. In the current market cycle, where traders and enthusiasts might welcome a dash of whimsy, POPCAT could capture some attention. After all, sometimes the best value a coin can offer is a good laugh and a sense of community. Ponke (PONKE) PONKE is a new digital asset on the Solana blockchain, known for its speedy transactions and low fees. With a total supply of 555 million tokens, PONKE takes a unique approach to how it manages and distributes its tokens. It's crafted especially for online traders and gaming fans, aiming to make their experience smooth and fun. What makes PONKE stand out is its focus on community. It offers features like the 'helmet' tool for its members, encouraging engagement and interaction. Being listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges means it's reachable for many people. In today's market, where community and user experience matter more than ever, PONKE's strategy could make it an attractive option. Compared to other tokens, its blend of innovative design and user-focused features might give it an edge in the digital asset world. SPX6900 (SPX) In today's digital era, where numbers on a screen often hold more sway than precious metals, SPX6900 bursts onto the scene with audacious ambition. Born from the depths of internet culture, this meme token aims to outshine the S&P 500 by reaching a mind-boggling $69 trillion market cap. The logic is delightfully simple: 6900 is greater than 500, so SPX6900 must be superior to any traditional financial instrument. This whimsical journey towards financial domination is powered by the playful belief that bigger numbers make better investments. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, SPX6900 taps into the enthusiasm of online communities. Its potential doesn't just lie in lofty goals but in the collective excitement it generates. While it may not offer groundbreaking technology like some of its crypto counterparts, its meme status gives it a unique edge. In a market cycle that has seen meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture headlines and investor interest, SPX6900 stands poised to attract those looking for the next big trend. Its appeal is in its bold challenge to the norm, making it an intriguing option for risk-takers in the current financial landscape. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured a smiling Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which is scarce, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant. There's no limit to how many can exist, and 10,000 new coins are mined every minute. People first saw it as a fun internet currency. But in 2021, its value shot up. Social media buzz and support from figures like Elon Musk helped it reach a market value of over $50 billion. Suddenly, Dogecoin was one of the top cryptocurrencies. So, what makes Dogecoin special today? Its technology allows for quick and easy transactions. The large supply means each coin is cheap, which is great for tipping and small purchases online. Some investors are drawn to it because of its strong community and the power of social media backing. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin is less about scarcity and more about accessibility. In the current market, it offers a different kind of appeal. While it's hard to predict the future, Dogecoin's journey shows that sometimes, community and enthusiasm can drive a coin's success just as much as technology.

Currently, BTC trades at a price below the $95,000 mark, down by nearly 7% from its all-time high above $99,000 recorded on November 22. Related Reading: Bitcoin Leverage Remains High – Data Reveals Selling Pressure Above $93K BTC NVT Golden Cross Outlook Amid the ongoing pullback in its price, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Darkfost shared insights on the market’s current state, focusing on a key on-chain metric: the NVT Golden Cross. This metric, which evaluates the relationship between market capitalization and transaction volume, recently turned positive. However, Darkfost cautioned against interpreting this shift as inherently bullish. He noted that while the current NVT Golden Cross value is low and doesn’t pose significant risks, traders should keep an eye on it to avoid potential market pitfalls. Notably, the NVT Golden Cross, quantifying whether Bitcoin’s market cap is outpacing its transaction volume, could be a leading indicator for market trends. According to Darkfost, if the metric climbs to 2.2, it could suggest that Bitcoin’s valuation exceeds its transactional utility. In such cases, Darkfost noted that the market might witness a “reversion to the mean,” signalling potential opportunities for short positions. The CryptoQuant analyst added: This scenario could lead to the beginning of a ranging pattern, which might create a favorable environment for altcoins to perform. Bitcoin Performance Outlook As Bitcoin trades at $93,196 at the time of writing, down by 3.3% in the past day, analysts have turned to their respective sources to assess what is happening with Bitcoin. The crypto market has experienced significant volatility, with roughly 191,493 traders liquidated in the past 24 hours, accounting for $571.80 million in total liquidations, according to CoinGlass data. IntoTheBlock, a renowned market intelligence platform, has recently suggested a major fundamental reason Bitcoin is facing a correction. In a post uploaded on X earlier today, the platform reveals that “elevated funding rates” which signal “excessively leveraged positions” contribute to the ongoing decline in BTC’s price. IntoTheBlock pointed out that the good news is that “funding rates have largely normalized,” indicating that the “leverage flush may have run its course.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Profit Hits ATH At $443 Million – Local Top Or Continuation?

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.420 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.450 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.5389 swing high to the $1.2828 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.4550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $1.50. A clear move above the $1.50 resistance might send the price toward the $1.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.600 resistance or even $1.620 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.650 or $1.6550. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $1.4550 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.3200 level. The next major support is near the $1.30 level.

36892613,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655023,1732676407,Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy,"Bitcoin (BTC) corporate adoption continues to gain momentum as video-sharing and cloud services platform Rumble recently unveiled a BTC treasury strategy. This move aligns with a growing trend of corporations worldwide embracing Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Rumble Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Stock Rises The YouTube competitor is the latest company to join the Bitcoin bandwagon, as its Board of Directors approved a corporate treasury diversification strategy that allocates a portion of its excess cash reserves to BTC. Related Reading: Samara Asset Group Eyes $32.8 Million Bond Issuance To Increase Bitcoin Holdings As part of this strategy, Rumble plans to purchase up to $20 million worth of BTC. The company described Bitcoin as a “valuable tool for strategic planning.” Rumble CEO and Chairman Chris Pavlovski explained: We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration and increased institutional adoption. Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. The company stated that its management would evaluate factors such as market conditions, Bitcoin’s trading price, and Rumble’s cash flow needs to determine the timing and amount of BTC purchases. However, it emphasized that the strategy could be modified, paused, or discontinued. Interestingly, the announcement followed a poll conducted by Pavlovski on X, where he asked users whether Rumble should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Over 93% of the 43,790 respondents voted in favor of the proposal. Rumble’s stock price surged after the announcement, reflecting investor confidence. The tech company’s shares closed at $7.31, marking a 12.63% increase in a single day. BTC as a Corporate Asset: A Winning Strategy? Rumble’s decision to add BTC to its balance sheet mirrors the approach of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a pioneer in Bitcoin treasury management. Yesterday, the Michael Saylor-led firm revealed that it had acquired an additional 55,000 BTC, bringing its holdings to $5.4 billion. Related Reading: Metaplanet’s Total Bitcoin Holdings Exceed 1,000 BTC Following Latest Purchase MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin play has worked tremendously for the company’s stock performance. In the past year alone, MSTR price has increased by more than 670%, outperforming both BTC and the S&P 500 regarding returns on investment. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet recently crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone as it continues to bolster its Bitcoin holdings with frequent purchases. Additionally, speculation about major tech giants like Dell and Microsoft entering the Bitcoin market could fuel demand and drive the asset’s price to new highs. A recent analysis by crypto experts shows that BTC may hit the highly-anticipated six-figure price target early next year. BTC trades at $92,071 at press time, down 5.5% in the past 24 hours.

36890183,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655020,1732671042,The Current Correction In Bitcoin Is The Last Before A Major Rally—Here’s Why,"Bitcoin price momentum has grabbed significant attention as it gradually sheds some of its gains acquired in the past weeks. So far, Bitcoin has plunged 7.6% from its all-time high (ATH) of $99,645 seen last week. Particularly, at the time of writing, the asset trades for $92,476. Marking roughly 4.6% drop in the past day alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Pauses Before $100K—Here’s What Could Happen Next What To Expect From This Current Bitcoin Decline Amid the ongoing correction in Bitcoin’s price, a recent analysis from CryptoQuant’s BaroVirtual has highlighted the steady decline in Bitcoin reserves across major crypto exchanges. According to the analyst, this pattern indicates a market amid a “bull run.” The analyst drew parallels with the March to November 2020 period, noting that exchange reserves saw a similar decline back then, followed by substantial inflows in December 2020 that fuelled upward buying pressure. The conclusion? The current dip in exchange reserves suggests that participants who missed earlier accumulation opportunities may now be entering the market before the next price surge. BaroVirtual noted: Some market participants who have not properly accumulated Bitcoin earlier are likely doing so now, realizing that this is likely the last downward correction before another upward price surge. Retail Traders Yet to Join The Market Meanwhile, although institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals seem to dominate the current market, retail traders appear to be lagging. Another CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu has shed light on this trend, noting that the Korea Premium Index—a key metric for retail involvement—remains below -0.5. This figure highlights limited activity from retail participants in the ongoing rally. According to Woominkyu, the Korea Premium Index has historically shown spikes to extreme levels preceding Bitcoin’s price peaks. He emphasized that monitoring this index could provide vital insights into identifying potential market tops. It is worth noting that the absence of retail traders in the recent crypto rally is quite noteworthy, as their eventual participation could lead to heightened buying pressure and potentially drive Bitcoin’s price higher. At the time of writing, the crypto market is facing a bloodbath, with the global crypto market cap valuation sipping by nearly 6% in the past day to a current valuation of $3.34 trillion.

The super PAC has made an unprecedented head start on the 2026 election cycle. Between Ripple, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fairshake has amassed $73 million in fresh commitments. That's on top of $30 million held over from the 2024 cycle.  The PAC is still awaiting the results in one U.S. congressional contest in the Nov. 5 elections, but Fairshake's track record includes backing at least 53 members of next year's Congress.  ""Fairshake is the most successful multi-candidate, bipartisan super PAC in American history,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted Tuesday on X (formerly Twitter). ""Electing pro-crypto, pro-growth and pro-innovation candidates is a no-brainer, and to continue that momentum, Ripple is contributing another $25M to Fairshake.""  The $103 million war chest makes Fairshake an unmatched political force to influence the session beginning in 2027, more than two years and a whole congressional cycle from now.  Ripple, Coinbase and a16z made up the vast bulk of resources Fairshake devoted to congressional races in an attempt to ensure pro-digital assets candidates would pass legislation during the session beginning in January. The industry has waited for years for the U.S. government to clarify its rules for this sector, and the resulting uncertainty has left a lot of potential business on the sidelines.  None of the three companies will comment on how decisions are made in the operation of Fairshake, nor how they guide the super PAC's strategy. But Fairshake's spokesman, Josh Vlasto, has said the political strategy is a transparent support of crypto advocates from either party who are willing to work across the aisle on legislation.  Each of the three companies has now participated in three rounds of funding for the PAC, each at approximately the same level. The other two had already jumped into the post-election support, and Ripple is now joining them, bringing the company's overall support to about $73 million.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/26/ripple-drops-another-usd25m-into-crypto-pac-to-sway-2026-congressional-races,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/260b57a4fe560b018cc5f2eb91b9df196b57dc92-3773x2122.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
36888412,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/11/doge-and-btc-navigating-the-storm-and-positioning-for-the-next-leg-up,1732667864,Bitcoin’s $100K Dream or $83K Nightmare? Dogecoin Fights for Survival Amid Market Chaos,"Crypto markets are entering the week like a ticking bomb, primed by global macro pressures and critical technical levels. Today’s session close (November 26, 2024) added more kindling to the fire. Bitcoin is wobbling near $92K after shedding -2.60%, Dogecoin dominance is holding by its fingernails at 1.76%, and the US Dollar Index (DXY) continues its iron grip at 106.87—bad news for risk assets. This isn’t a market for hopeful moonshots; it’s a game of precision, survival, and brutal honesty. But crypto is still crypto—a beast that loves chaos. The long-term bullish thesis remains intact as the bigger players quietly load up while the rest panic. So here’s the plan: get ready for short-term pain, stay defensive, and position yourself for the inevitable rebound. 1. The Current Battlefield: Markets at a Crossroads Key Observations From Today’s Close 1. DXY Remains Dominant: The 106.87 close underscores the dollar’s strength, fueledby ongoing rate hike fears and resilient US economic data. A stronger dollar pressures Bitcoin and altcoins, as money flows into safer assets.2. Traditional Markets Hold Steady:o Nasdaq 100: Up +0.56%, showing tech investors haven’t abandoned ship.o S&P 500: Barely moved, but it held the line—a decent sign for market stability.o These slight gains suggest a wait-and-see mode ahead of this week’s economic reports.3. Crypto Weakness Deepens:o Bitcoin: A -2.60% retracement, dragging the king coin to $91,936. With liquidation zones lurking at $86K and $83K, don’t rule out more blood before the bounce.o Ethereum ($ETH ): Down -3.51% at $3,331, reflecting growing fragility across the altcoin market.o Solana ($SOL ): -2.57% to $230, a stark reminder that high-performing alts aren’t immune to the broader market mood. Why This Matters Wednesday’s GDP revisions and labor market data are shaping up as the pivot point. Strong numbers could send the dollar higher and Bitcoin lower, while weaker numbers might deliver the breather crypto needs. Until then, the risk lies firmly to the downside. That’s the reality—face it. 2. Bitcoin’s Roadmap: Follow the Liquidity source: coinglass.com Bitcoin ($BTC ) sits at $91,936, teetering just above major liquidity pools. Let’s dissect the battlefield. BTC’s Key Levels: 1. $86K–$87K Zone:o This is Bitcoin’s first stop if sellers push harder. High leverage long liquidations are stacked here, meaning a sweep to this zone is almost inevitable.o Why It Matters: It’s a shallow correction level where buyers could step in for a short-term rebound.2. $81.2K–$83K Zone:o The ultimate stink order zone. This daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) is a honey trap for liquidity sweeps during market chaos.o Why It Matters: Flash crashes love inefficiencies, and BTC tends to bounce hard from these zones.3. Above $100K:o The psychological barrier. If BTC can reclaim this level, it opens the floodgates for speculative mania.o What’s Needed: A weak dollar and a shift in macro sentiment. Without these, it’s a dream, not a strategy. BTC Strategies • Defensive Stink Orders:o Buy Levels: $86K–$87K for the shallow correction; $81.2K–$83K for deeper panic wicks.o Stop-Loss: Below $81K to avoid a full-blown trend reversal.o Targets:▪ TP1: $92K, reclaiming minor resistance.▪ TP2: $99K, a psychological barrier to watch.• Breakout Play:o Trigger: Daily close above $100K with volume confirmation.o Stop-Loss: Below $98.5K to manage breakout failures.o Targets:▪ TP1: $105K, initial breakout euphoria.▪ TP2: $110K, a speculative rally extension. Dogecoin’s Setup: Dominance on Thin Ice DOGE ($DOGE/USDT ) is riding shotgun with BTC’s volatility, but its dominance chart (DOGE.D) offers some crucial clues. DOGE Dominance Levels (DOGE.D) 1. 1.76% Support:o This level has held multiple times, but the cracks are showing. If it breaks, DOGE is likely heading back to $30c–$32.5c.o Key Signal: Watch for volume divergence here—fading volume means trouble.2. 1.87%–1.97% Resistance:o DOGE needs a clean break above this range to reenter bullish momentum. Without it, $42c remains a pipe dream.3. Below 1.76%:o This is DEFCON 2 for DOGE. A dominance breakdown likely means Bitcoin is visiting $83K, pulling DOGE into the abyss. DOGE/USDT Levels 1. $30c–$32.5c Zone:o The defensive stink order zone. This range aligns perfectly with BTC’s $81.2K–$83K dip.2. $34c–$36c Zone:o The lower accumulation range for safer entries.3. $42c Resistance:o Breakout territory. DOGE needs BTC stability above $92K and dominance above 1.87% to hit this level.4. $48c–$50c Zone:o The Santa Rally target, but only if BTC pushes above $100K. DOGE Strategies • Stink Orders ($30c–$32.5c):o Trigger: BTC dipping to $83K while DOGE dominance holds 1.76%.o Stop-Loss: Below $30c.o Take-Profit Targets:▪ TP1: $36c, initial bounce.▪ TP2: $42c, a breakout test.• Range Accumulation ($34c–$36c):o Trigger: BTC stabilizing above $86K.o Stop-Loss: Below $33c.o Take-Profit Targets:▪ TP1: $42c.▪ TP2: $48c.• Breakout Play Above $42c:o Trigger: DOGE dominance reclaiming 1.87% with BTC strength above $92K.o Stop-Loss: Below $41c.o Take-Profit Targets:▪ TP1: $48c.▪ TP2: $50c+. 4. Preparing for the Worst, Betting on the Best This isn’t a market for blind optimism. The technicals are clear: Bitcoin needs to hold liquidity zones, and Dogecoin must defend dominance or face deeper corrections. Your job is to prepare for these scenarios with stink orders, disciplined stop-losses, and realistic targets. But the long-term picture hasn’t changed. Institutional accumulation, ongoing monetary easing in 2024, and ongoing crypto adoption keep the bullish thesis alive. This market rewards patience and cold-blooded execution—play the downside, but don’t lose sight of the bounce. 5. The Conclusion: Survival First, Profit Second Crypto thrives on chaos. BTC and DOGE are staring down critical tests this week, and the only way through is preparation. Stick to the plan: • Defensive stink orders for worst-case scenarios.• Aggressive breakout plays for when the dust settles. Because when crypto rebounds, it doesn’t ask if you’re ready—it just moves. Make sure you’re on the right side of it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The decision answers a controversial privacy debate on whether the government — via a sanctions list maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department — has a right to target the technology because it's associated with criminals. The ruling reversed a district court's August ruling that had sided with the government's pursuit of what it had characterized as a ""notorious"" crypto-mixing service.  ""Tornado Cash’s immutable smart contracts (the lines of privacy-enabling software code) are not the 'property' of a foreign national or entity,"" according to a U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruling, so they can't be blocked under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ""overstepped its congressionally defined authority"" when it did so.  Read More: Coinbase-Backed Group Loses Lawsuit Arguing Tornado Cash Sanctions Overstepped U.S. Treasury's Authority  OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash last year, contending that it was a vital tool used by bad actors including North Korea's Lazarus Group to launder crypto tokens pilfered from platforms and games such as Axie Infinity.  Coinbase Inc. (COIN) and others had sued the government, claiming it had overreached. Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of crypto exchange Coinbase, cheered the ruling in a Tuesday post on X, calling it a ""historic win for crypto.""  ""These smart contracts must now be removed from the sanctions list and U.S. persons will once again be allowed to use this privacy-protecting protocol,"" Grewal wrote. ""Put another way, the government’s overreach will not stand.""  The circuit court recognized the difficulty of this situation.  ""We readily recognize the real-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC’s sanctioning authority,"" the judges said, referencing the ineffectiveness of a law that was established well before the world moved online. ""But we must uphold the statutory bargain struck (or mis-struck) by Congress, not tinker with it.""  In the hours following the ruling, Tornado Cash's TORN token rallied over 500%, according to CoinGecko data, passing the $20 mark. TORN dropped from this price range to below $8 in mid-2022 as its founders faced legal challenges and the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned the protocol, which blocked its use on most major centralized crypto exchanges.

36887787,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=654946,1732665637,"Bitcoin Crashes Under $93,000: What’s Behind It?","Bitcoin has observed a plunge under the $93,000 level during the past day. Here’s what the trend in an indicator suggests about what could be behind this downturn. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Gone Cold As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has returned to neutral levels recently. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This metric essentially tells us about how the buying or selling behaviours differ between the user bases of the two cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase’s main traffic is made up of American investors, especially large institutional entities, while Binance serves investors around the world. When the Coinbase Premium Gap has a positive value, it means the US-based whales are participating in a higher amount of buying or a lower amount of selling than the Binance users, which is why the asset is more expensive on Coinbase. Similarly, it being negative implies a net higher buying pressure on Binance. Related Reading: Chainlink May Reach New ATH If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Says Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past couple of days: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been at notable positive levels earlier, but during the past day, its value has declined to the neutral zero mark. According to Maartunn, the source of the positive premium was Microstrategy’s latest buying spree. Indeed, the cooldown in the indicator matches up with the timing of the completion of the $5.4 billion purchase by Michael Saylor’s firm. The significant accumulation from the company had helped the cryptocurrency maintain its recent highs, but with the buying pressure depleted, Bitcoin has retraced to price levels under $93,000. BTC and the Coinbase Premium Gap have held a close relationship throughout 2024, so the metric could be to keep an eye on in the near future, as where it goes next may once again foreshadow the asset’s next destination. Naturally, a decline into the negative region could spell further bearish action for its price. In some other news, the Bitcoin Active Addresses indicator has observed a sharp jump recently, as Maartunn has shared in another X post. This metric keeps track of the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart shared by the CryptoQuant analyst for the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Active Addresses: With this latest surge, the 14-day SMA of the Bitcoin Active Addresses has reached its highest point in eleven months. This suggests that a lot of activity has recently occurred on the network. Given that the asset has gone down in the past day, though, the most recent user interest has certainly not come for buying. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $92,400, down almost 6% over the last 24 hours.
