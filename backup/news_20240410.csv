25530484,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602560,1712790038,"Bitcoin Tumbles on Hot CPI Data, But This Analyst Stays Ultra Bullish: Here’s Why","The better-than-expected United States Consumer Price Index (CPI) released on April 10 is already sending shock waves through the financial market. Bitcoin and most crypto assets are trading lower, extending losses recorded on April 9, weighing negatively against optimists. United States CPI Data Came In Hot According to Trading Economics data on April 10, CPI, a key economic metric for gauging inflation, rose 0.4% in March, pushing the annual inflation rate to 3.5%. Notably, this surpassed economist predictions and, most importantly, dashed hopes for the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) to slash rates aggressively this year. However, amidst the market jitters, Matt Hougan, the CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, offered a contrarian perspective as fear permeated the Bitcoin and crypto market. In a post on X, Hougan downplayed the influence of the CPI data on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Related Reading: XRP Heading To $100-$500? Analyst Provides Speculated Timeframes The executive argues that investors and traders should track other market factors like spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows and rising government deficits. In Hougan’s assessment, these can strongly influence price, even lifting Bitcoin higher since they are currently aligned. Time To Buy The Bitcoin Dip? As such, even with the fall in BTC, the drop could offer potential buying opportunities for long-term holders. Some supporters believe the “hot” CPI data only exposes the vulnerabilities of fiat currencies. This would potentially drive investors to use Bitcoin as a hedge. Moreover, this upbeat sentiment is backed by solid demand for gold, a store of value asset preferred by traditional finance investors. Analysts anticipate Bitcoin will follow a similar path as investors seek to protect value amid rising inflation. Further bolstering the bullish sentiment is the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF launch in Hong Kong before the end of April. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has been assessing various applications. Leading Chinese asset managers have submitted some. If the product is approved, it could further channel more capital to BTC, boosting inflows from the United States. When writing, BTC is steady but under pressure. April 9’s losses have been confirmed. The coin might track lower if bulls fail to push prices above all-time highs of around $74,000.

25528149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602594,1712786438,Changing Tides: Restaking Takes Center Stage In Ethereum (ETH) Staking Landscape,"In recent months, the Ethereum staking landscape has witnessed significant transformations, prompting a shift in investor preferences and reshaping the sector’s dynamics. According to on-chain data researcher and strategist at 21Shares, Tom Wan, key metrics indicate a notable change in the approach towards Ethereum staking, with restaking gaining prominence as a preferred method. Ethereum Restaking Landscape Wan’s observations, shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlight a steady increase in ETH staking deposits from restaking, rising from 10% to 60% since 2024. Restaking can be accomplished in two primary ways: through ETH natively restaked or by utilizing a liquid staking token (LST). By staking their ETH, users secure additional applications known as Actively Validated Services (AVS), which yield additional staking rewards. A significant player in the staking landscape is EigenLayer, which has emerged as the second-largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Are The Odds In Bitcoin Bulls Favor? These Analysts Forecast BTC’s Future EigenLayer has achieved a significant milestone with the release of EigenDA, its data availability Actively Validated Service (AVS), on the mainnet. According to a research report by Kairos, this launch marks the beginning of a new era in restaking, where liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) will become the dominant way for restakers to do business. Currently, 73% of all deposits on EigenLayer are made through liquid restaking tokens. The report highlights that the growth rate of LRT deposits has been significant, increasing by over 13,800% in less than four months, from approximately $71.74 million on December 1, 2023, to $10 billion on April 9, 2024, demonstrating the growing confidence in EigenLayer’s approach to restaking and contributing to the shifting tides in Ethereum’s staking landscape. According to Wan, the rise of liquid restaking protocols has also contributed to a decline in the dominance of Lido (LDO), a staking service solution for Solana (SOL), Ethereum, and Terra (LUNC). On the other hand, Etherfi has emerged as the second-largest stETH withdrawer, with 108,000 stETH withdrawn through the first quarter of 2024. This trend exemplifies the increasing popularity of liquid restaking protocols, allowing stakers to withdraw and actively utilize their staked assets while still earning rewards. Ether.fi Set To Surpass Binance In ETH Staking Data provided by Wan also shows a decline in the dominance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) in ETH staking. Since 2024, CEXs have seen their share of staking decline from 29.7% to 25.8%, a significant drop of 3.7%. As a result, the decentralized staking provider Kiln Finance has surpassed Binance and become the third-largest entity in terms of ETH staking. With Ether.fi poised to follow suit, it is expected to surpass Binance’s position shortly, according to the researcher. Related Reading: Crypto Experts Predict Massive Price Surge For XRP Price, Is $20 Possible? In short, these developments signify a paradigm shift in the Ethereum staking landscape, with re-staking methodologies gaining traction and decentralized protocols like EigenLayer and Ether.fi challenging the dominance of established players. As of this writing, ETH’s price stands at $3,500. It has been exhibiting a sideways trading pattern over the past 24 hours, remaining relatively stable compared to yesterday.

42408517,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJd6P,1712782852,"Bitcoin Rebounds to $70K, Shrugging Off Hot U.S. Inflation Print","Bitcoin {{BTC}} climbed back to $70,000 Wednesday, reversing its knee-jerk dip following hotter-than-anticipated U.S. inflation data for March.  BTC slipped nearly 4% to $67,500 during early U.S. hours after a government report showed the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising faster than analyst expectations, prompting investors to temper their expectations for rate cuts this year.  The dip echoed through multiple asset classes, but bitcoin gradually erased all its losses, and was up over 1% over the past 24 hours, outperforming U.S. equities and gold, both of which finished with sizable declines for the day. At press time, bitcoin had slipped a bit from the $70,000 level, trading at $69,800.  Most cryptocurrencies lagged behind BTC, with the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index down 0.6% during the same period, dragged lower by a 5%-7% decline in major altcoins polkadot {{DOT}}, bitcoin cash {{BCH}}, near {{NEAR}} and aptos {{APT}}.  Decentralized exchange Uniswap's governance token {{UNI}} plummeted more than 10% as it received an enforcement notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, foreshadowing regulatory actions against the platform.  Digital asset hedge fund QCP Capital said the rebound showcased the underlying demand for bitcoin, with investors seeing dips as a buying opportunity.  ""This bounce is not surprising as the desk continues to see strong demand for long-dated BTC calls even on this dip,"" QCP said in a Telegram update. ""It is indicative of deep structural bullishness in BTC.""  Will Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, noted in an X post that the ever-increasing U.S. debt levels are more important for the big picture than individual CPI readings, and the most likely scenario is that policymakers will let inflation run higher than the 2% target to help inflate the debt.

In his latest update, Kamaz noted three bullish price targets for SHIB in a long position after noting a potential market upswing. Interestingly, this bullish prediction comes amidst a wider market uncertainty and with Shiba Inu registering a bullish reversal in on-chain metrics. Analyst Drops Bullish Trading Strategy Kamaz’s analysis is based on a 4-hour chart timeframe which he shared on social media. At the time of analysis, SHIB was trading at $0.00002883 and recent candle formation shows the bulls trying to reverse the formation of bearish candles which has already lasted for 24 hours at this point. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? The analyst recommended opening a long position, with three consecutive targets materializing by April 12. The earliest target is just above $0.0003. Particularly, this target coincides with the low of the last candle formation on March 31. If Shiba Inu can break through the $0.00003 resistance level and hold steady above it, this puts Kamaz’s next target just below $0.0000315, which also coincides with the March 21 high of $0.000031336. Kamaz’s final SHIB target is at $0.000032930, the crypto’s highest on March 28, representing a 14% increase from the current price level. This small profit potential for reaching the final target makes it interesting to note that Kamaz’s prediction is of a short-term price outlook. SHIB has, in fact, gone past these price targets in the current bull cycle to reach as high as $0.000044 on March 5. However, the crypto has since corrected over 20% from this peak. Cryptocurrencies are volatile, so Kamaz’s analysis came with setting a firm stop loss at $0.00002810 to avoid getting caught in a reversal. Current Shiba Inu Outlook According to Kamaz, his analysis was based on various reasons ranging from SHIB turning resistance to support, inside 1-day bullish order block, and inside discount, among others. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Warns Of Burgeoning Bitcoin Fire Sale, Here’s What It Means On-chain metrics are also pointing to a bullish reversal for SHIB in the near future. These metrics include increased accumulation from whales and a meteoric surge in SHIB burns. Fundamentals and constant updates from the Shiba Inu team also point to a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. One of these is the recent update for Shiba Eternity, Shiba Inu’s collectible card game. According to crypto analyst Armando Patonja, SHIB is on the verge of breaking out of a triangular formation, which could see it surging to the $0.000048 price for the second time this year. Once Shiba Inu breaks $0.000048, the next target is $0.0006, over 100% higher than today’s price.

Lawyers for Nerayoff allege their client was framed by the FBI and federal prosecutors in order to get him to turn over evidence on high-profile people in the crypto industry.  Steven Nerayoff, an early adviser to the Ethereum network, has filed a notice of his intent to sue the U.S. government for $9.6 billion in damages connected to his 2019 arrest on criminal extortion charges, which his lawyers called “fabricated” and “baseless.”  Nerayoff’s Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) form, which was provided to CoinDesk by his lawyers, is the first step towards filing a lawsuit against the Department of Justice (DOJ). In FTCA cases, the agencies involved must be notified of the claimant’s intention to sue at least six months before a lawsuit is formally filed.  Well-known civil liberties lawyer Alan Dershowitz confirmed Wednesday that he will serve as a consultant on constitutional issues for Nerayoff’s case.  The government’s charges against Nerayoff were dropped in May 2023. Two months earlier, prosecutors moved to end the case, admitting that they had obtained material exculpatory evidence and were unable to prove the charges in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt. Nerayoff’s lawyers had, before that, filed a motion to dismiss that was chock-full of explosive claims against the federal investigators and prosecutors involved in the case.  Read more: U.S. Prosecutors Drop Extortion Charges Against Early Adviser to Ethereum Network  Nerayoff and his lawyers say that he was the victim of an elaborate, years-long setup by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the ultimate intention of getting him to turn over evidence on important figures in the crypto industry.  The FBI did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by the time of publication.  On the morning of Sept. 17, 2019, Nerayoff claims he was arrested by a dozen gun-wielding FBI agents and interrogated for “hours” in an unmarked van parked outside his home. According to Nerayoff, the agents told him he would “not see his young minor children grow old” unless he cooperated by giving them information.  The government denied the majority of Nerayoff’s claims in a filing of its own, including the assertion that Nerayoff’s colleague and former co-defendant on the extortion charges, Michael Hlady, was a government informant. Nerayoff’s lawyers maintain that Hlady, who was convicted of swindling Catholic nuns out of nearly $400,000 in 2010, was “insinuated … into [his] orbit” by the FBI, in order to help them build a case against Nerayoff.  In 2021, Hlady pleaded guilty to the extortion charges Nerayoff was also tied up in. But last month, the government moved to drop the charges against him and allow him to withdraw his guilty plea, instead having him plead guilty to one count of wire fraud in an unrelated fraud scheme he committed while out on bond.",NEGATIVE,없음,ETH | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/10/former-ethereum-adviser-intends-to-sue-us-government-for-96b-over-dropped-extortion-charges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d4a7b4a89a50be14b64623ea9e509f66d6a63eb0-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42408515,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJczn,1712780035,Hong Kong's Incoming Spot Bitcoin ETFs Could Be 'Big Deal.' Here's What Analysts Say,"Hong Kong regulators will likely approve spot bitcoin ETFs as early as next week, Reuters reported Wednesday.  The funds could offer an alternative to Chinese investors reluctant to invest in domestic real estate and stocks, one observer noted.  ""The market should not expect flows anywhere near the size of U.S. spot ETF flows,"" said a K33 analyst.  Heightened anticipation for spot-based bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. and the eventual inflows supercharged bitcoin's run-up to new all-time highs, and now Hong Kong regulators reportedly are inching closer to approving similar funds, news that thus far has been mostly unnoticed in crypto circles.  These vehicles, however, could open the floodgates for Chinese investors looking for a new haven next to gold and overseas real estate and stocks in which to store their wealth.  Read more: Hong Kong Said Likely to Approve Spot Bitcoin ETFs Next Week  ""[They] will be a big deal,"" Noelle Acheson, macro analyst and author of Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in an email interview with CoinDesk. ""It's not just for the access to hedge funds and family offices based in the region; it's also because of the access it gives to mainland investors.""  Chinese investors are reluctant to invest in domestic real estate and stocks given the well-documented troubles of the country's housing market, construction sector and equities. That, in turn, has spurred interest in alternative assets like gold, Acheson explained. Notably, trading with a gold-linked ETF in China was halted earlier this week after its price premium reached 30% as investors piled into the asset trading at record high prices.  In similar fashion, there could be ""a significant flow of funds into BTC,"" Acheson said, adding that the investment case for the largest cryptocurrency will become even more prevalent if concerns about further devaluation of the yuan ramp up.  ""Chinese authorities most likely realize that a significant portion of their citizens will be diversifying into hard assets whether approved or not, and would probably prefer that they be in assets not related to the U.S. economy,"" Acheson noted.  Markus Thielen, founder of Singapore-based analytics firm 10x Research, said that the ETFs could raise the probability of a Chinese retail buying frenzy similar to the 2013 bull market. Bitcoin's popularity exploded in the country that year, driving the price to over $1,000 from only $10 in January., The rally didn't end until China's government banned financial institutions from trading the asset in December.  ""70% of Chinese own property and as the market has recently repriced lower together with the stock market, there are not many alternatives,"" Thielen said. ""Bitcoin is one.""

While the approval of ETFs could be a further positive catalyst for bitcoin, the market should not expect flows anywhere near the size seen by the U.S. spot funds, said Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research.  The two futures-based bitcoin ETFs listed in Hong Kong have seen ""solid"" growth this year more than doubling their assets in BTC terms, he noted, but their combined size is less than 2,000 BTC, or just 2% of the U.S.-listed futures ETFs.

25522334,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602555,1712777426,Is The Bull Run Nearing its End? Marathon CEO Asserts Bitcoin ‘Halving’ Rally Already Priced In,"In anticipation of the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event, which is expected to occur later this month, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel believes that the price impact may already be factored into the market to a certain extent. Thiel shared his insights in a recent interview with Bloomberg, in which he discussed the potential catalysts for further price increases and their implications for the mining industry. Related Reading: From Hat To Heights: Dogwifhat’s $17 Crypto Leap Electrifie Investors Bitcoin Halving Impact Mitigated By ETF Surge? The “halving” event, a software code update that occurs approximately every four years, is often regarded as a key driver of Bitcoin’s price appreciation. The update will reduce the block reward for miners by half, meaning they will receive fewer Bitcoins as a reward for validating transactions on the blockchain. However, Thiel noted that the impact of The Halving may not be as significant this time, as the recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has already attracted substantial capital to the market. Thiel explained: The ETF approval, which has been a huge success, has attracted capital into the market and essentially brought forward what could have been the price appreciation we typically would have seen three to six months post-halving. So I think we are seeing part of that now already and that has put forward some of the demand. While the halving event is expected to reduce the daily supply of new Bitcoins by approximately 450, Thiel believes the price impact may be relatively modest. However, the Marathon CEO expressed excitement about the positive price trend leading up to the halving, stating: As miners, we are very excited to go into a halving, where for once prices have not declined prior to the halving rather prices have gone up so everybody is obviously maximizing to that. Balancing ETF Inflows And Previous Halving Patterns Thiel’s observations come amidst the noteworthy inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, which have amassed nearly $12 billion in just three months of trading in the United States. While these inflows may have contributed to the current price appreciation, historical data reveals that Bitcoin still possesses considerable growth potential leading up to The Halving. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it is crucial to examine the recent surge in Bitcoin’s value, which has soared by nearly 370% from its bear market low of $15,400 to an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14, 2024. In conjunction with this surge, past halving events provide valuable insights into Bitcoin’s price movements and the likelihood of surpassing the significant milestone of $100,000. During the first halving in November 2012, Bitcoin’s price experienced a remarkable surge from a low of $13 to a peak of $1,152 the following year, illustrating an impressive increase of 8,753%. Similarly, the second halving event in July 2016 witnessed Bitcoin’s price ascending from $664 to a new ATH of $17,760, reflecting a surge of 2,580% after the halving. The most recent Halving event in May 2020 saw Bitcoin’s price reach a significant milestone of $67,000, surging from a low of $9,730, which accounted for a substantial increase of 593% following the halving. Related Reading: Ethena (ENA) Is ‘The LUNA Of This Cycle’ With 20x Potential: Expert In perspective, while the potential scenario outlined by Thiel suggests that The Halving may be partially priced in due to the influence of ETF inflows, historical patterns suggest that Bitcoin still has plenty of room to run before the event. Several market pundits have also set their price targets for this bull run at the coveted $100,000 level in light of the upcoming halving event. However, it remains to be seen how the price of Bitcoin will react, taking into account factors such as the influx of capital through ETFs, historical data, and potential market dynamics. Currently, BTC is trading at $68,400, down 0.4% from yesterday’s price.

It remains unclear whether Uniswap’s native token, UNI, was implicated as a potential security in the SEC’s notice.  Ammori said that he believes that Uniswap does not meet the SEC’s current definition of an exchange. He also pointed to a recent ruling in the SEC's case against Coinbase – in which a judge said that Coinbase Wallet was not a broker – as a good sign for Uniswap's ability to beat the SEC on the same charges (the judge ruled that the SEC's other allegations against Coinbase could move forward).  “I am confident that the products we offer are legal and that our work is on the right side of history,” Adams wrote. ""But it’s been clear for a while that rather than working to create clear, informed rules, the SEC has decided to focus on attacking long-time good actors like Uniswap and Coinbase. All while letting bad actors like FTX slip by.""  Adams said that Uniswap will fight the charges.  “I'm frustrated that the SEC seems to be more concerned with protecting opaque systems than protecting consumers. And that we'll have to fight a US government agency to protect our company and our industry,” Adams wrote. “This fight will take years, may go all the way to the Supreme Court, and the future of financial technology and our industry hangs in the balance. If we stand together we can win. I think freedom is worth fighting for. I think DeFi is worth fighting for.”  An SEC spokesman said the agency ""does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.""  Regulation via enforcement  In a Wednesday blog post, Uniswap wrote that the Wells notice, as well as the SEC’s lawsuits against Coinbase and other crypto companies, indicates that their action against Uniswap is just “the latest political effort to target even the best actors building technology on blockchains.”  Uniswap denies that the tokens it offers for sale are securities, despite the SEC’s position that most tokens besides bitcoin fall under their jurisdiction.  “The reality is that tokens are a digital file format, like a pdf or spreadsheet, and can store many kinds of value. They are not intrinsically securities, just as every sheet of paper is not a stock certificate,” the blog post said. “The overwhelming volume of traded tokens are definitively not securities – they are stablecoins, community and utility tokens, and commodities like Ethereum and Bitcoin.”  The blog post added that, in cases where a token may in fact be a security, “the SEC has refused to create a path for businesses to register.”  Uniswap did not comment further on the matter, aside from directing CoinDesk to Adams' social media post and the company's blog post.  Waiting on Congress  Uniswap argued that the SEC has “no authority from Congress” to oversee the crypto markets, citing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s past testimony before Congress that a new law would need to be passed to give the agency the necessary powers to effectively regulate the industry, though Gensler has since argued that the existing securities laws are sufficient for the regulator to police crypto.  Efforts to pass a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto industry have stalled, and will likely remain stagnant ahead of the upcoming presidential election.

According to a deck reviewed by CoinDesk, the company is planning to hire AI engineers “soon,” and its product team is working to plan AI workstreams over a 3-6 month transition phase. The deck was presented earlier today via a virtual town hall meeting by NEAR co-founder Illia Polosukhin with NEAR core employees.  This comes as the intersection between AI and blockchain continues to be a hot topic, with NEAR attempting to position itself at the forefront. Polosukhin was on a panel at Nivida’s conference titled ""Transforming AI"" last month, and saw its token NEAR double in price in anticipation of the event.  The company is well seasoned in terms of AI expertise, Polosukhin is an artificial intelligence researcher and software engineer that co-built the ‘Transformer’ architecture. The architecture powers generative AI systems like ChatGPT.  NEAR will use near.ai for surfacing AI information and will make an external announcement in May, according to the slide show.  The layer-1 says it believes it is uniquely positioned to make AI open source, given its not-for-profit and decentralized nature. The company also said the growth of revenue incentives will always take over at for-profit companies, whereas at NEAR, its token economy will create value in an open, permissionless ecosystem.  NEAR has been pushing its “chain abstraction,” narrative over the past few months, which aims to tackle the user experience in crypto by simplifying the hurdles that exist in a multichain environment.

What's clear is that blockchain tech enables all sorts of monetary strategies.  In this week's issue:  The new meme coin generator called ""Pump"" is used to spin up new tokens for yuks and trading. It's getting lots of use.  Pioneering restaking protocol EigenLayer launches on Ethereum mainnet.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column of blockchain project updates: Saga, Open Campus, EOS, Farmsent, Ordz Games  >$250 million of blockchain project fundraisings.  Network News  Side-by-side charts showing impact of the proposal to adopt a new Ethereum issuance curve. (Ansgar Dietrichs and Caspar Schwarz-Schilling/Ethereum Magicians Forum)  SOUNDER MONEY? Earlier this year, a pair of Ethereum Foundation (EF) researchers put forth a proposal to reduce the pace of new issuance of ether (ETH) tokens. It was part of a concerted plan to reduce incentives for new stakers – the investors who lock cryptocurrency into the blockchain as a way of helping to secure the network. The freshly minted ETH is a crucial component of the rewards these investors hope to receive, in the form of staking yields. As the researchers' thinking went, there's already enough stakers to provide effective security for the blockchain, and in fact any additional increases in the level of participation could enable the unwanted dominance of fast-growing third-party staking platforms like Lido. A side benefit of the proposed change would be to harden ether as a form of money, since the total supply of the cryptocurrency wouldn't grow as quickly – effectively tapering ether's inflation rate. The current issuance rate ""dilutes ETH holders beyond what is necessary for security,"" the researchers wrote. They estimated that the proposal would reduce ETH staking yields by nearly a third. Now, though, some members of the community are pushing back, as reported by CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk. There are questions over whether there's really a need to change the tokenomics of ether and, in the extreme, whether the Ethereum Foundation plays an outsize role in influencing code upgrades on the decentralized network. Viktor Bunin, a protocol specialist at Coinbase Cloud, wrote on the social-media platform X, “If it's not broke don't fix it.”  MEME COIN GENERATOR GO BRRR… In last week's The Protocol, we made the point that blockchain teams have, generally speaking, succeeded in coopting the über-power of printing one's own money, long reserved for governments and banks. An integral element of the process are the various ""launchpads"" that teams use to spin up their new tokens. In an article this week, CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa highlighted a project called Pump, which in the short period since going live last month has already earned $5 million in fees – partly due to the meme coin frenzy on the Solana blockchain. ""Selling shovels in a gold rush was one of the surest ways to make profits, and it’s no different today in the digital asset world,"" Malwa wrote. ""While there are likely tens of thousands of tokens that have been released on Pump since its March launch, only a few have reached market capitalizations of more than $10 million. The largest tokens so far are Shark Cat (SC), a cat wearing a shark cap, and Hobbes, named after the cat of popular Solana trader Ansem, with valuations of $100 million and $35 million, respectively,"" according to Malwa. Even so, Pump is on track to reap about $66 million of annual revenue, based on current usage and growth, DefiLlama data shows. Whether this token-generation business is legal, or approved by securities regulators, may depend on the circumstances, or the terms of use, or on the jurisdiction. But in the meantime investment bankers who used to lead elaborate offerings in exchange for Wall-Street-size fees (and Lambo-scale bonuses) are basically being replaced by apps.  EU vs. MEV. The European Union markets regulator flagged maximum extractable value (MEV), whereby blockchain operators reorder user transactions to maximize their own profits, as a potential form of market abuse, a stance that is worrying some industry watchers who say the case is not clear-cut, CoinDesk's Sandali Handagama reports. “MEV by itself should not at all be considered as a market abuse and should not have a negative connotation,"" Anja Blaj, a policy expert at the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI), told Handagama in an interview over WhatsApp.  BITCOIN HALVING FACTOID: On average, it has taken about 57 days after a Bitcoin halving for the network hashrate to recover to its pre-halving hashrate. (This is for the three halvings that have taken place since Satoshi Nakamoto launched the original blockchain in 2009. Bitcoin's fourth halving is estimated to arrive next week, coincidentally and yet characteristically on the very meme-y date of April 20.)

Some of these experts see the cryptocurrency’s price rising higher from its current level, with one analyst expecting XRP to rise as high as $20 in the coming bull market. XRP Price On The Verge Of Breakout One of the crypto experts that has shown incredibly bullish sentiment toward the XRP price is Matthew Dixon, the CEO of crypto rating platform, Evai. Dixon took to X (formerly Twitter) to share with the crypto community that the XRP trading volume had been seeing positive headwinds in recent times. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Warns Of Burgeoning Bitcoin Fire Sale, Here’s What It Means At the time, the Evai chart shared by the the crypto CEO showed that XRP had recorded an approximately 42% increase in its daily trading volume to cross $2.1 billion. Using this increase in trading volume, Dixon believes that it shows the rising interest in the altcoin. Naturally, increased interest often translates to increased demand, which can be bullish for a cryptocurrency’s price. This was the thought shared by the Evai CEO who believed the surge in trading volume and interest meant that the XRP price was on the verge of a breakout. However, this does not seem to be the case, at least in the short term, since the XRP price continues to trend around the same level since Dixon first made the post. It is hovering around $0.61 at the time of this writing, with a0.96% gain in the last 24 hours. Can Price Get To $20? Predictions for the XRP price going into the next bull market have had a wide variety, from very conservative to very ambitious. For many, though, the expectation is that the XRP price will rise very quickly as regulatory clarity from the Ripple vs SEC case is fast approaching. Crypto analyst Armando Patoja takes the ambitious route with his own prediction, forecasting an over 3,000% price increase for XRP. According to Patoja, the predictions that put XRP’s future price at $5 severely underestimate the ability of the altcoin. On his own, the crypto analyst believes that the XRP price has the potential to rise even further to reach between $10 to $20. Patoja posits that saying XRP will reach just $5 is like expecting Bitcoin to top out at $1,000 in 2015. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal In On-Chain Metrics, Can SHIB Price Recover?

Thoughts? — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) April 6, 2024 Despite the growing XRP community, it is no doubt that Patoja’s prediction has been received with a grain of salt. One community member responded to the post saying XRP could not possibly rise that high because major projects who were building on the XRP Ledger have been abandoning it for other chains because it is a dead chain. Due to the lack of builders, they do not believe that XRP has the steam to run that high.

42408521,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJdaA,1712771987,"EigenLayer, Crypto's Biggest Project Launch This Year, Is Still Missing Crucial Functionality","The blockchain project EigenLayer didn't go live on Ethereum's mainnet until Tuesday, but it had already become one of the network's biggest-ever protocols, with $12 billion worth of user deposits – a hot ticket partly because of its highly touted innovation of ""restaking,"" a new technology that could usher in dramatic changes in the way crypto protocols bootstrap their security.  A closer inspection reveals that EigenLayer has not yet activated most of the core features that make the project notable – including its reward system and its mission-critical ""slashing"" mechanism.  In the fast-moving, big-money world of crypto, EigenLayer has attracted a level of investor, developer and media interest that's rare: On top of its $15 billion worth of deposits at press time, Eigen Labs, the project's developer, raised a staggering $100 million from venture giant Andreessen Horowitz last year.  There's also a cottage industry of startups – called ""actively validated services"" (AVSs) – that are waiting to plug into EigenLayer's security apparatus, as well as ""liquid restaking"" startups aiming to piggyback off of EigenLayer's success, already netting billions of dollars in their own deposits.  EigenDA, a data-availability protocol built by Eigen Labs, was the first AVS to launch on EigenLayer – released on Tuesday in tandem with the rest of the EigenLayer protocol. As other AVS networks wait in the wings – for now, they're only allowed to ""register"" – EigenDA is supposed to be a proof-of-concept for what EigenLayer will eventually enable for other services: A way for networks to base their own security on Ethereum's.  In EigenLayer's current, arguably still larval state, however, EigenDA relies on a strikingly conventional security model. The protocol is controlled by a globally distributed set of operators, but they won't be financially punished if they act dishonestly – a core component of EigenLayer's purported security model. The protocol also won't pay out rewards to depositors, which is supposed to be the main incentive for restaking.  Sreeram Kannan, EigenLayer's founder and chief architect, acknowledged in an interview last week that the launch would move forward without some crucial functionality, instead proceeding under a ""phased"" rollout under an unspecified timeline.  ""We are allowing the EigenLayer marketplace to develop and stabilize before introducing in-protocol payments and slashing to mainnet later this year,"" EigenLayer said on Tuesday in its launch thread.  The use of so-called training wheels is not out of the norm in crypto – particularly given the experimental culture of the industry: When a startup is trusted with billions of dollars in user deposits, Silicon Valley's ""move fast and break things"" approach doesn't really cut it.  ""There are a lot of other projects that just take shortcuts and kind of balloon and are much, much higher risk than this,"" said Mike Silagadze, CEO of Ether.fi, a liquid restaking service that has deposited $3.8 billion worth of its users' funds into EigenLayer. ""I think relative to other crypto projects, this has actually been reasonably measured.""  But as the third-largest decentralized finance protocol in terms of total value locked (TVL) – and competitors beginning to encroach on its turf – expectations for EigenLayer couldn't be higher.  The current state of EigenLayer  EigenLayer centers around ""restaking"" – a way of repurposing the Ethereum blockchain's security to cover additional protocols, these AVSs. Technically how it works is that investors can take the ether (ETH) they've staked on the main Ethereum chain, and then reapply (or ""restake"") it to secure the AVSs; they could be blockchain bridges, crypto exchanges or data storage facilities.  The benefit for EigenLayer investors – called ""restakers"" – is that they get an extra rate of return on top of the interest they already receive for staking ETH. The AVSs get the advantage of ""pooled security.""  Kannan gives the example of 100 blockchain protocols that are each secured by $1 billion worth of stake.  Imagine that ""instead of each of the protocols having $1 billion separately staked, there was $100 billion commonly staked across 100 protocols,"" said Kannan. ""To attack any one protocol, now you need $100 billion rather than needing $1 billion.""  That's the idea, at least. The actual meat of the EigenLayer security system remains more theory at this point than reality, as do the pieces of EigenLayer's design that are supposed to pay out interest to depositors.  Take, for example, the ""slashing"" feature that sits at the center of EigenLayer's security system. Slashing is integral to EigenLayer: It ensures that networks built on top of the protocol can penalize operators if they act dishonestly – by revoking all or a portion of their restaked deposits.  But slashing wasn't included in EigenLayer's launch this week, and in an interview, Kannan couldn't give a firm timeline on when it would be ready – beyond that it would be sometime later this year.  There also remain big questions about how the whole thing will actually work – including how, and in what proportion, slashed tokens will be burned and distributed once they've been revoked. For AVSs to build on EigenLayer, such questions eventually need to be answered.  ""Even though the full slashing is not live, we are going to run this system in beta and make sure that people are able to use it, and maybe have redundant backups and other stuff,"" said Kannan.  Another yet-to-be-defined element of EigenLayer's programming is its ""attributable security"" system – a fallback mechanism that Kannan plans to use to protect against black swan events that threaten to wipe out the protocol's security apparatus. The feature exists to address the potential for contagion risk – the idea that a slashing event triggered by one AVS could hurt the security of every other AVS.  Attributable security works a lot like insurance (crypto founders mint new terms as quickly as they do new tokens), and in principle, a new actuarial market will spring up with pricing for each of the AVSs, ostensibly linked to their perceived risk.  ""A service that's built on Eigenlayer can come in and say, 'Out of this $100 billion that is totally staked, I want a particular attribution of $3 billion,'"" explained Kannan. ""Now, it's EigenLayer as a protocol's job to make sure that even if every other AVS is simultaneously depleted, I will be able to redistribute the amount of $3 billion to this AVS.""  But asked to define how EigenLayer's attributable security market will actually price things in practice, Kannan said that his team ""has not published"" anything on it yet.  Then there's EigenLayer's fee system – the source of revenue it will use to reward interest to depositors, which is supposed to be the main incentive for restaking.  Kannan said in an interview with CoinDesk that the fee system is at the top of his team's priority list and should be easy to implement, but its absence means that users won't be able to earn interest for restaking with AVSs.  In the absence of this core feature, the billions of dollars deposited into EigenLayer thus far have come as a result of the platform's point system: EigenLayer prints out loyalty points that investors hope will eventually be convertible into real crypto tokens.  Until EigenLayer launched this week, many crypto traders and users were simply pursuing these points – Earning them by depositing assets into EigenLayer and liquid restaking protocols like Ether.Fi, and, in some cases, buying the points outright and trading them on 40x leverage via third-party crypto protocols aimed at risk-seekers.  ""In hindsight, I would probably say, man, we should have really toned down the point stuff because that just went really crazy,"" said Ether.Fi's Silagadze. ""Crypto is insane, so people took it way too far.""  Read more: As Crypto 'Points' Farming Grows, So Does Risk of Vague Promises  Looking ahead  Without slashing, fees and attributable security, EigenDA, currently the only AVS, is a far cry from what is ultimately envisioned for EigenLayer.  In the near term, EigenDA will be operated by a community of validators, but those validators won't be at risk of slashing – this means they won't be financially incentivized to act honestly (which is, well… the whole point of EigenLayer's ""pooled security"").  Kannan says most of EigenLayer's main features will arrive by the end of this year, but some find it difficult to take those estimates at face value.  “In some cases, there's just engineering problems, where you kind of bat your head against it, and eventually you're gonna figure it out,"" said Silagadze. ""And then there's research problems [...] there's literally no solution known.""  When it comes to those research problems, ""it's hard to respect timelines,"" said Silagadze, ""because these are unsolved problems that you're trying to sort out.""  The lack of clarity around the state of EigenLayer's technical stack has led to mounting frustration among some EigenLayer developers who requested anonymity in order to discuss the topic candidly – along with confusion for users around where EigenLayer currently sits on its ambitious roadmap.  There are also concerns that EigenLayer's design is tantamount to ""rehypothecation"" – an oft-criticized practice from traditional finance where collateral is repackaged for higher potential returns, but also a higher risk of losses. (Kannan vehemently rebuts this argument, stating that, among other things, EigenLayer is different from conventional rehypothecation because it grants users complete control over their assets.)  ""I think we need to get better at communicating changes and our roadmap to the broader EigenLayer ecosystem,"" said Kannan. ""We did not expect to be at this scale where there's so many projects that are dependent and are downstream of our codebase.""  Calvin Liu, Eigen Labs' chief strategy officer, says he welcomes the scrutiny.  ""When something has a ton of hype, that’s when you should examine most closely and be most skeptical. I appreciate that and take that view to other projects all the time,"" Liu said in a message on Telegram. ""I am confident that in time we’ll stand up to that view. And I welcome the prodding - it only makes us better in the long run.""",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | ZRX,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/04/10/eigenlayer-cryptos-biggest-project-launch-this-year-is-still-missing-crucial-functionality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/41194257c5fa19c8b5bc7eb5efc578e2af54582d-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Dogecoin Has Notable On-Chain Resistance Near $0.20 In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed the recent trend in the price of DOGE and what it would take for the memecoin to register a new high for the year. According to the analytics firm, Dogecoin must solidly break above the level where on-chain resistance is currently the strongest. In on-chain analysis, a level’s potential to act as resistance or support is based on the number of coins that were last bought at it. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Below is a chart that shows this investor cost basis distribution for DOGE at price ranges near the cryptocurrency’s current spot value. The distribution of tokens based on where they were last transacted on the blockchain | Source: IntoTheBlock on X Here, the size of the dot represents the number of coins acquired within the corresponding price range. In terms of the levels ahead, the prices around $0.20 have held the cost basis of the most number of tokens out of the ranges listed. To be more particular, about 32,000 addresses bought 3.78 billion DOGE around this mark. Since this price is above the current spot value of the asset, all of these investors would be holding at a loss. Generally, the cost basis is a special level for investors, and as such, they are prone to reacting when the asset retests. Investors holding at a loss may tend to show a selling reaction when such a reaction happens. This is because investors like these may fear that the cryptocurrency will dip again shortly, so exiting at the break-even mark might not sound like a bad idea, as they would at least be able to avoid any losses in the future. Of course, if only a few investors are involved, any such reaction from the market wouldn’t be relevant to the Dogecoin price. However, if a large number of investors show this reaction, the asset may very well feel some visible fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin 40% Of Way Through Bull Run If This Metric Is To Go By This is why the strength of an on-chain level’s ability to act as resistance or support lies in the number of coins acquired there. More coins mean a potentially larger reaction once the level is retested. As the $0.20 level holds the cost basis of a notable number of investors, it’s possible that it could act as a source of major resistance when Dogecoin retests it next. IntoTheBlock says that, for DOGE to continue its recent rend, it would have to break past this barrier solidly.

42408529,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJdqh,1712765100,The Rise of Crypto Options and Structured Products,"The crypto options space, primarily on the retail side, has had stints of exponential momentum starting from July 2021 until June 2022, followed by a decimation in vault TVL and absolute returns during periods of pronounced realized volatility. The retail consensus from options and structured products vaults, which have employed systematic short volatility strategies is far from good.  Source:defillama.com/protocols/Options  Options and structured products are naturally complex and require at least quasi-active management. While the demand for convexity increases, and 0DTE options rise again in the retail consciousness, institutional providers have been quietly advancing the required infrastructure for the non-retail investor base to get involved. These types of structured products give investors a breadth of crypto payoffs while also solving for degrees of customization.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The problem  The issue, here and in the development of many other crypto instruments, has always been market microstructure. Crypto began as a grassroots ideological experiment with buy-in from a very niche group of people who wanted to exchange an asset that had no certainty around it. As a result, the market microstructure that was designed to service it was self-serving, unguided, and naturally unregulated. Some of the infrastructural issues that exist today in crypto such as fragmented liquidity, no consensus around centralized pricing mechanisms, and supply/demand disparities from one trading platform to another are legacy challenges that are just now becoming more addressable as crypto begins to transition from a fully retail market.  Where we are  While there has been a big focus around on-chain structured products, an equally exciting opportunity lies in delivering crypto payoffs to traditional investors. As crypto becomes increasingly relevant in portfolio allocation, we will begin witnessing a strategic allocation capture that is far more material than we have seen in the past. This is made possible by the breadth and quality of institutional grade products and delivery pipes that have been developed including ETFs, ETP, and other non-listed notes.  There is already back tested data that supports the view that adding BTC to a balanced portfolio leads to improvements in both gross terms and as measured by both Sharpe and Sortino Ratios. View the below table from Coinshares:  Further crypto-based products can contribute positively to a balanced portfolio as well. At ARP Digital, our role as a structured product provider is to optimize a broader portfolio with volatility products across the suitable crypto universe.  Volatility Products  Crypto volatility is a dynamic, rapidly changing space influenced by the polarization of market participants, access to outsized leverage, and market microstructure. The lack of historical adoption has been the result of a reflexive cycle of crypto dealers not having enough demand to prioritize it with their own distribution and bank dealers not having regulatory clarity, or incentives to advance it. As such the historical volatility profile, shown below in a graph by Amberdata, is a very telling depiction of the outcomes of the lack of institutional infrastructure and participation.  Since traditional delivery pipes for crypto structured products rely on integrations between crypto participants and traditional intermediaries, there have been hurdles that have resulted in important compromises, from capital efficiency to collateral management, which have further deterred investor demand.  Conclusion  As spot bitcoin ETFs continue to be a massive success, and the broader consciousness recognizes the value of the asset class from an investable and psychological level, the demand for product development will follow. Modeling the trajectory of other asset classes, the crypto structured product sector will have exponential growth.  At ARP Digital, we are confident that there will always be a demand for yield-bearing and volatility products. In crypto, the first generation of yield products involved unsecured lending to various market participants to deliver yield, sometimes unknowingly.  Following the destabilizing events of 2022, investors are beginning to think deeper about the sources of yield and how to quantify the risk they take for it; there is no such thing as “a free lunch.” Structured products offer yields that are deterministic and mathematically verifiable based on market outcomes, which fortunately lead to more peaceful nights.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Abdulla Kanoo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/10/the-rise-of-crypto-options-and-structured-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fb0879acae27a116f810f8142a27de7344dcc90-5120x3413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyst Provides Speculated Timeframes,"Following an extended period of stasis, the price of XRP has suddenly begun to rise, fueling several bullish predictions regarding the altcoin’s direction from several cryptocurrency analysts. Bullish Timelines For XRP The most current positive forecasts came from cryptocurrency expert and XRP enthusiast BarriC, who has established multiple timelines for the digital asset to rise to unprecedented heights in the long term. Taking to the X (formerly Twiter) platform, BarriC voiced his opinions, noting that as time goes on, crypto investors might have fewer chances to purchase cheap XRP. According to the analyst, inexpensive XRP today is defined as less than $0.80. Related Reading: Analysts Say XRP Price Is Ready To Breakout, Here Are The Targets Furthermore, the expert underscored his prediction that XRP would trade between $1 and $3. BarriC specifically contended that by the time this bull market ends, a cheap XRP would be between the aforementioned price levels. Moving on, BarriC has regarded the crypto asset as undervalued between the $10 and $15 threshold in the next 4 to 5 years, particularly around the subsequent Bitcoin halving event and bull cycle between 2028 and 2029. If, toward the conclusion of the next bull run, XRP is cheap, trading between $10 and $15, then the analyst is expecting it to reach much higher prices at the peak of the bull cycle. BarriC envisions a significant surge from the anticipated $10 to a triple-digit landmark. Following the succeeding halving and bull cycle, which is expected to occur by 2032 and 2033, the analyst expects the token to also be undervalued at $100 and $500. Concluding his forecast, he affirms that market participants will always have access to affordable prices. However, it is up to those interested in the altcoin to decide how much funds they are willing to invest. $1,000 Is Possible In The Long Run It is worth noting that the analyst previously projected a $1,000 price mark for XRP. According to BarriC, XRP’s path over the coming several months and years promises to be exciting. He believes XRP’s price will rise as the cryptocurrency market expands and changes, and as a result, it will be poised for massive growth and more widespread adoption. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals What To Expect For Bitcoin, Dogecoin, And XRP In 12-16 Months Given his expectations for greater mass adoption and growth of the coin in the upcoming months and years, he foresees a peak of $1,000 in the long term. Other prices set aside by the expert to watch out for include $1, $5, $10, $50, $100, and $500. Whether in the short term or long term, BarriC is confident the token will change people’s lives.

42408530,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJdu0,1712764800,BTC Halving: Sell-The-News or Buy-The-Alt-Rotation,"""IBIT is the fastest growing ETF in the history of ETFs,"" Blackrock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink recently declared in an interview with Fox Business. The SEC approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and subsequent performance has driven BTC and the broader crypto market to new heights.  First, Bitcoin itself has made a new “all-time-high,” as prices broke past $70,000. U.S. based CME futures contracts for Bitcoin surpassed the open interest of all other exchanges, including Binance, to become the largest BTC derivatives venue. And, finally, the futures basis reached over 25% annualized, nearly five-times the U.S. risk-free rates.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Where does that leave us today?  Bitcoin has one more major fundamental milestone that’s keeping traders and investors excited for higher prices, and that’s the Bitcoin halving. Scheduled to occur around April 20 (the perfect meme, of course) the Bitcoin block issuance rate will drop from 6.25 coins per block, to 3.125.  Although a small sample size, the past years in which Bitcoin had a halving event, the Jan to Dec performance averaged about 200%. This would imply an end-of-year price for BTC of about $91,500.  That said, from a derivatives trading perspective, the predictability and certainty around halving isn’t like the uncertainty of an SEC spot ETF decision and the subsequent ETF adoption. That means that traders aren’t likely to be surprised by a completely known event. Given this understanding, using Bitcoin derivatives as a contrast to Ethereum tells us a story around the potential opportunity for a post-halving rotation.  Looking at the April 26 option expiration (top) versus the June 28 expiration (bottom), we can clearly see the dynamics being priced into both Bitcoin and Ethereum options. Firstly, for April 26, Bitcoin options on the call wing are priced at a substantial premium to the Ethereum call wing, while the Ethereum put wing is priced at a premium to the BTC put wing.  Longer-dated options for June 28 are nearly identically overlaid, showing a tight relationship between BTC and ETH to be regular in the longer term.  Read More: Did Strong Bitcoin ETF Demand Kill Halving's Potential Bullish Rally?  What this tells me is that the current halving narrative is being priced into short-term BTC options, while at the same time, the lack of optimism around Ethereum due to a potential “securities” designation from the SEC and likely disapproval for a spot ETF in May are causing traders to bid for Ethereum puts.  Something else I’d like to point out is the differential in CME-led positioning between BTC and ETH.  Looking at the top chart for BTC derivatives positioning we can see that CME futures (in green) really started in earnest in October around the enthusiasm for a spot ETF approval. Today, CME BTC open interest dwarfs any other exchange, including Binance.  If we look at Ethereum CME open interest, we see nearly no increases while Binance continues to exceed CME open interest by a large margin. This tells me that the US market has yet to begin building up positions in Ethereum; and should we move towards a spot ETF for Ethereum, whether in May or much later (after initial rejections), buyers haven’t crowded Ethereum yet.  So why should we even care about this opportunity to buy the laggard Ethereum?  While the market is excited about the BTC halving slowing down the issuance rate for coins into circulation, (clearly displayed through 4/26 options) the ETH supply has not only already stopped growing, but since September 2022, is actively decreasing, due to EIP-1559 burns.  Ethereum has also just successfully completed the Dencun upgrade, as L2s and L3s begin to facilitate RWA, DeFi and NFT growth, along with the ability to build native “app-chains” for high throughput protocols that want to isolate activity within their own environment.  No one knows for sure what the future holds, and investing is peppered with risk. But a general axiom that I like is whether the fundamentals are already priced-in, or is the market under-invested in a potential opportunity?  In my mind, after halving, the BTC events will be behind us, and instead of merely “selling the news,” we can “rotate into the alts” in this case, specifically Ethereum.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Greg Magadini,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/10/btc-halving-sell-the-news-or-buy-the-alt-rotation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15287df33c1f531f11121e90edf5b14c06d14f30-5001x3334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The protocol, which is almost profitable, is designed to give depositors exposure to high-yield rate arbitrage trades, for which it charges a 10% or higher fee.  The company building Stream Finance, one of the Ethereum blockchain's newest crypto derivatives platforms, has raised $1.5 million from Polychain and a handful of angel investors.  Stream Trading raised its seed round at a $20 million valuation, founder Diogenes Casares said in an interview with CoinDesk. He and co-founder Solal Afota built the team quickly to capitalize on this year's crypto bull market, which is paying fat dividends for trading platforms across decentralized finance (DeFi).  Derivatives exchanges are a fixture of the on-chain landscape for speculating on token prices, with platforms such as dYdX and Vertex getting much of the attention and hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto deposits. In comparison, Stream, which emerged from beta testing just this week, has $5 million in total value locked.  Still, that's already enough to nearly turn Stream profitable, Casares said. The protocol is designed to give depositors exposure to high-yield rate arbitrage trades, for which it charges a 10% or higher fee.  Over time Casares said Stream plans to become a decentralized perpetuals exchange that competes with dYdX and the other ""legacy"" names in DeFi derivatives, an industry barely five years old. He said most protocols focus too much on cutting fees while doing little to improve funding rates – the interest traders pay when speculating on the future price of assets.  ""We're focusing more on the funding rate side than the swap fees side,"" he said.  Stream is also building with the super-hot restaking protocol Eigenlayer in mind, said systems engineer Emanuel Adamiak.

Metaco, the cryptocurrency custody firm acquired by Ripple for $250 million, has seen almost all of the executives and marketing teams depart the Switzerland-based firm since the deal closed last year.  Metaco, whose CEO Adriene Treccani and chief product officer Peter Demeo both recently departed, has now lost Angel Nunez, who was CTO and chief customer officer, according to a person familiar with the matter, who shared an internal email detailing some of the departures with CoinDesk. The head of sales, Craig Perrin, as well as marketing manager Mei Li Powell, head of product marketing, plus marketing officers Gene Peterson and Rahul Mudgal have also left the firm, according to the person  Ripple declined to comment on the departures.  Before being acquired by Ripple, Metaco had become a favorite partner for European banks looking for assistance with the custody of digital assets.

42408518,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJdGK,1712762552,"EU's MiCA Rules Have Had Little Influence on the European Crypto Market, Regulator Says","Although MiCA is set to start taking effect at year-end, it has yet to lead to an increase in crypto-euro transactions, the European Securities and Markets Authority said.  The level of euro-denominated crypto transactions has held steady at about 10% since the regulation became law last year.  The European Union's crypto asset regulation, which became law in 2023 and starts to take effect at year-end, has yet to spur any increase in euro-denominated crypto transactions, the bloc's securities regulator said.  ""The announcement of the MiCA regulation has not caused an increase in euro volumes at the current juncture but could constitute a potential growth driver once implemented in 2024, as it is intended to enhance investor protection,"" the European Securities and Markets Authority said in a report published Wednesday.  The 27-nation trading bloc was one of the first regulatory regimes to introduce a comprehensive rulebook for crypto assets, the Markets in Crypto-Assets law. The rules cover crypto assets and stablecoins, with stablecoin provisions set to kick in six months after the others.  Worldwide, fiat-to-crypto trading volumes fell to 20% in 2023 from 30% in 2021 because of the crypto winter, the report said, though the market has since recovered. This is partially due to the rise in popularity of stablecoins, which are digital assets whose value is pegged to assets like national currencies and allow investors to change their exposure without leaving the crypto ecosystem.  Around 80% of on-ramp and off-ramp transactions, that is those entering or leaving the crypto environment, involve the U.S. dollar or the South Korean won. The euro's ""minor role"" – a share of 10% – has not changed since the announcement of MiCA, the report said.  Stablecoins form part of over 60% of all crypto transactions, ESMA said in its report.

42408522,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaJdMw,1712762472,'What Are We Waiting for'? SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Discusses Moving Crypto Regulation Forward,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not a monolithic institution. Look no further than Hester Peirce (a.k.a. Crypto Mom), who is currently serving her second term as one of five overseeing commissioners. Over the past several years, Peirce has made a reputation as a defender of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology — writing innumerable dissenting opinions regarding the many legal actions the SEC has waged against crypto protocols and companies.  SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce will speak at Consensus 2024 this May. Grab your pass here.  To some extent, Peirce’s disagreements with SEC Chair Gary Gensler stem from their varying philosophical and political beliefs. Peirce, a Republican and member of the Federalist Society, thinks the government should have a limited hand in regulating commerce. Whereas Gensler, who swims in Democratic circles, is often harder to pin down. While Gensler has seemingly evolving opinions on crypto (having appeared as a blockchain supporter while teaching the subject at MIT), Pierce has remained steadfast in her support of economic innovation.  “It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices,” Peirce told CoinDesk in an interview. This view colors Peirce’s opinions on whether the SEC should block spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), go after U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken as well as what role agency should play in overseeing crypto markets.  CoinDesk caught up with Commissioner Peirce ahead of Consensus 2024, where she’s scheduled to speak this May, to discuss the SEC’s enforcement actions, her distaste of Big Banks and where U.S. crypto regulation first went wrong.  Hi mom. To start off with an easy one, would you be able to describe the fundamental split in opinion that you have with SEC Chair Gary Gensler?  It's not an easy question.  Just to start out, look, the views I represent and will reflect are my own views, not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow commissioners, so I can't speak for anyone else at the commission.  Are you talking about crypto specifically or about the universe of issues?  I wanted to maybe widen the scope. What are your fundamental political or philosophical differences?  So, in terms of philosophy — I have the view that I don't necessarily know what's best for other people. We have our statutory mandates that we have to implement. But within those mandates, we're often given discretion. And if we have discretion, my preference is to say, well, let's let market participants make a decision about what they want to do. Now, sometimes there's a reason that we have to step into the middle of a transaction, and say “No, you can't do that” or “Yes, you can do it, but you have to do it in this particular way.” But we better have a really good reason for stepping into the middle of that transaction.  See also: SEC in 'Enforcement-Only Mode' for Crypto, Commissioner Peirce Says  It’s a fundamental American principle that people are free to make choices. The government is not there to protect people from their own choices. It's there to protect people if someone else harms them, but not to make their life decisions for them.  In the past, you've been critical of big banks but have also argued that the regulatory response to the Great Financial Crisis was offbase. I’m wondering if this somehow connects to your interest in crypto?  I think my interest in crypto stems from a couple of things. First, I think it's a good test for how we handle innovation — or maybe a bad test in the sense that I think we're not passing it. Crypto came to us with a lot of new players and a lot of new ideas. I think we should have figured out how to work with these new players and figure out a way how they could do what they wanted to do in a way that would be compliant, but also allowed them to move forward.  There is a connection in the sense that when I look at the financial crisis — a lot of people have looked at it and come to different conclusions about the causes — one of the things going on was poor regulatory design. A regulatory design that led to everyone making the same dumb mistake at the same time. One way to address that is to build resilience into the system, and having heterogeneity in the system is a good way to build resilience. There are some interesting concepts within crypto that allow for more decentralization of the financial system.  So yes, in that sense, there's a connection. But do I think that the decentralized future is going to replace centralized intermediaries in the financial system? My prediction would be not; people want to deal with a centralized intermediary. But I think that there will be a role for decentralized finance. Maybe it's in the background. Maybe it’s more than that. I predict most people will access it through a centralized intermediary. I could be wrong.  You don't have to answer this question, but do you hold cryptocurrencies?  Because I work on these issues all the time. I do not, and would not even if I could. I feel like there'd be a conflict. If you work on these issues, you can't have crypto, basically. I'm speaking only for what the rules are that apply to me.  A question from my editor: Prometheum; what's going on there? Is this an example of the SEC picking winners?  I'm not going to speak to any particular entity. Nice try.  That's fair enough. Your Safe Harbor proposal is common sense, but in the intervening years since you've published it, I think it's arguably become clear that maybe three years is too short of a time for protocols to decentralize. Solana, Cardano, even Ethereum to an extent have centralized entities directing development — the non-profit organizations founded alongside the network. Do you think we should be thinking about decentralization on a longer timeline? Decades?  Again, decentralization is not an end in itself. It is the right thing in certain circumstances. However, sometimes having a centralized entity is the right thing. We should all take a step back and think about what we're trying to achieve. And fundamentally, what we need to achieve is the ability for people to know whether or not they're dealing with a security, so when they do something or sell something they understand whether it’s a securities offering.  They need to know that in the primary and secondary markets. Then, if we decide that certain crypto assets are securities, or that it doesn't make sense to adjust the rules, there is a sensible framework that makes sense for crypto assets. Does it make sense to set up some sort of disclosure regime for centralized entities? That's really a congressional decision. But we can't even really have these conversations at the SEC right now because the conclusion is just to apply exactly the same rules that apply to stocks and be done with it — and I just don't think that works.  But just taking a step back and thinking about what we're really trying to solve might take some pressure off the decentralization question.  How closely do you or the other four commissioners work with the Enforcement Division. Do you suggest cases to litigate?  So, just to give you a sense of how things work on the enforcement side. As with the rulemaking side, it's the staff that does the bulk of the work. They consider a rule and will propose it for us and we'll consider it. Often the vote happens at a public, open meeting. With enforcement actions, we also get recommendations. Typically, the staff will recommend authorizing an enforcement action and settling it at the same time. So we often don't see the case until the end, and are not involved in the guts of the matter. So we're either going to authorize the division to sue or authorize you to sue and settle with them on the same day. Most of our cases settle like that right away. The voting happens in a process called seriatim, where we're just voting on the papers, or we vote at a meeting where we have a discussion, but those meetings are, as you might guess, not open to the public.  So in a way, if there was a change in the presidential administration in the upcoming election, then the current enforcement regime could continue, more or less, as is?  I think these are great questions because the structure of the agency is a little strange. Strange in the sense that it's not like a lot of other agencies that have a single head. But while there are five of us commissioners, Chair Gensler does have the authority to set the rulemaking agenda and staff also report to him. The chair can certainly push the direction that things go, but you're right, it's not as if when a new chairman comes in all the existing enforcement investigations just stop. The agency is designed to keep going.  Would you take the job if Trump or Tulsi were elected?  That's not even on the radar.  No?  Yeah, I'm focused on The Now, and trying to try to shift us to a better place. I've been here for six years, and it's very discouraging to see that we have not taken a productive path at all. To me, it's inevitable that we'll have to take a productive path at some point — so why not start now? What are we waiting for?  This isn't a question about the present, but I am curious in what ways the agency has changed since your first couple of stints during the early 2000s at the SEC?  Over the years we've gotten progressively more prescriptive in our rulemaking approach. An issue I raised in a speech last week is that we've gotten less willing to engage on some of the difficult issues with the staff and the public. That has not been a positive set of changes.  Is there any reason to believe or to hope that the spot market ETH ETF process won't unfold similarly to what happened with the spot market bitcoin ETFs?  I can't talk about that one because we've got some applications under consideration.  Do you think the 2017 DAO Report set the crypto regulation off on the wrong foot?  Yeah, I do. Because I think that the facts of the DAO Report are different from the facts of most crypto offerings that we see, right? The facts were unique. And I just don't think that the legal analysis that we've applied to thinking about tokens has been helpful for really getting to the crux of the issue.  See also: SEC Blasts 'Purportedly Decentralized' DAOs in $1.7M Barnbridge Settlement  So if I could rewind — I wasn't here at the time of the DAO report, though I’ve learned a lot in that time — I would change the way we approach things.  Do you agree with Judge Failla’s interpretation in the XRP case, that tokens aren't necessarily securities, but when you sell them to qualified investors it’s an investment contract?  Well, again, because that's litigation, I don't want to talk about any particular judge's opinion. But as I have said, in other contexts, when you think about an investment contract, whether it's a digital asset or some other kind of a tangible asset, the asset itself is not the security on its own. It’s when you offer that asset along with an investment contract that’s what makes a security a security. It becomes the object at the center of the investment contract. But you still have to think about those two things as distinct. The orange groves in Howey were not on their own securities.  Your dissenting opinions are often quite artful. Was it your idea or your co-author Mark Uyeda’s idea to include a play in the ShapeShift document?  I can't answer that question either.  Thanks again for your time.  Well, I appreciate you taking the time and I hope you have a great afternoon.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/10/what-are-we-waiting-for-sec-commissioner-hester-peirce-discusses-moving-crypto-regulation-foward,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b5aa9c6db3010c4ffbc625087aeef9e8cd90549-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the crypto analytics firm, the highly anticipated halving event is no longer the key driver for a bullish momentum in BTC. Bitcoin Halving Effects On Prices Is Fading CryptoQuant wrote in a recent research report that the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled this April may not deliver the desired price shock expected by most crypto analysts and investors in the space. According to the analytics firm, the influence of the Bitcoin halving event has been dwindling over time, with the price of the cryptocurrency and a potential bullish rally being driven by a new change in market dynamics. Related Reading: VeChain On The Edge: Insider Says VET Will Reach The Finish Line Notably, CryptoQuant disclosed that the demand from long-term and large-scale investors, whales, has become one of the primary factors pushing the price of BTC upward. The Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Monero disclosed on Tuesday, April 9, that the demand for Bitcoin from permanent holders has recently outpaced issuance for the first time in history. In its report, CryptoQuant also highlighted an 11% month-on-month increase in large-scale Bitcoin investors holding between 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, reaching unprecedented levels. This elevated demand is in sharp contrast with BTC’s supply dynamics and is poised to increase further after the halving event concludes. Currently, long-term Bitcoin holders are accumulating more tokens than the new investors entering the market. CryptoQuant revealed that permanent holders have also been adding as much as 200,000 BTC to their portfolio every month while long-term holders are amassing seven times more BTC per month. “We argue that the effect of the halving has been diminishing, as the new issuance of Bitcoin gets smaller relative to the amount of Bitcoin selling from long-term holders,” the analytics firm wrote. Analysts Remain Optimistic About Halving Influence Despite CryptoQuant’s report on Bitcoin’s supply and demand dynamics, numerous analysts still expect a significant uptick in Bitcoin’s price following the halving event. Analysts like Joe Consorti have predicted BTC’s price to rise to $100,000 following the Bitcoin halving. Additionally, he has expressed optimism about a potential bullish rally for the cryptocurrency during this period. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? Moreover, due to historical trends revealing a correlation between the Bitcoin halving event and a price surge for the cryptocurrency, various crypto investors have predicted a similar bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency this year. Recently, open interest in Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs above $18 billion. This increase suggests that traders and investors are still bullish on Bitcoin’s future value, seeing any price dips as buying opportunities before a potential rally.

42418436,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCEH,1712758131,Ordinals Defy Bitcoin's Design Principles but Offer Miners Huge Post-Halving Advantages,"It wasn’t supposed to be possible. Yet, with the advent of Ordinals and BRC-20, the Bitcoin network is seeing an influx of major developments that have unlocked BTCFi — DeFi using Bitcoin as its primary asset. This has brought new capabilities to a network traditionally known for its transactional simplicity, with the total market cap of BRC-20 tokens alone reaching $2.8 billion. From the standpoint of network health, the takeaway from all this is that Ordinals inscriptions, in particular, have contributed over $438 million in fees to miners, which helps secure the Bitcoin network by incentivizing miner participation.  Andy Handika is CEO and Co-Founder of Loka Mining, a platform that enables retail investors to acquire BTC at a lower-than-market price through co-investing to Bitcoin miners. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin package,"" published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024.  The Ordinals protocol enables the inscription of unique data, including NFTs, on individual satoshis, Bitcoin's smallest unit. This innovation was expanded upon with the launch of BRC-20 tokens, which enabled the creation of tokenized assets on Bitcoin. Prior to this, DeFi on Bitcoin was deemed impossible.  Putting bitcoin to work  Bringing more complex products to the network had the effect of using up more block space, and competition for this space drove up transaction fees. In fact, in May of 2023, during the height of the initial Ordinals craze, transaction fees accounted for a full 43% of the total income per block. Later in 2023, Ordinal demand again spiked and saw fees on individual transactions spike as high as $37, a level not seen in over two years prior.  New token standards, such as Runes, which is set to launch during the halving (currently expected on April 20), aim to challenge BRC-20's dominance and introduce more efficient options for tokenization on Bitcoin.  This growth is coupled with the introduction of native decentralized applications and the investment of major cryptocurrency exchanges in inscription services and BTCFi assets, including the debut of Bioniq, a platform for launching and trading Ordinals, along with a variety of BRC-20 initiatives and decentralized mining solutions on the ICP network.  These advancements significantly benefited from the development of ckBTC, a digital counterpart of Bitcoin pegged on a 1:1 basis with BTC on the ICP network. As a result, transaction activity for ckBTC has soared, with more than a million transactions recorded in December, amounting to more than $67 million in total value.  Another recent development that is augmenting this next halving cycle is the approval of several Bitcoin ETFs in January by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not only does this speak to the rising institutional acceptance, but it has also specifically been projected that the approved products alone could see upwards of $220 billion over the next three years. It’s also likely this will lead to a wave of additional new funds launched in the years to come. This increase in capital coming into the space not only stands to drive up the spot market price of Bitcoin but further increases competition over blockspace and, by extension, fees.  Offset halving concerns  The Bitcoin halving is a regular event that occurs every four years, reducing the mining reward on each block by half. It has become a race for miners fighting for a more scarce reward and ever-increasing mining difficulties.  For the last few years, larger publicly-traded mining companies from North America have been in a better position to increase their dominance by getting funding from retail investors. They can offer their shares or sell future hash rates on a platform like Luxor's Hashrate Forwards.  But this year, miners of any size from other parts of the world have additional funding options to upgrade their operations. They can utilize the upcoming Loka's permissionless marketplace, which can connect miners directly to retail investors looking for BTC at lower-than-market prices. This creates a two-sided marketplace. On the supply side, Bitcoin miners provide future hashrate. On the demand side, retail investors — looking for more cost-efficient access to Bitcoin — provide liquidity.  Bitcoin moving forward  These developments point to a few implications post-halving for the broader Bitcoin space. Given that transaction fees are explicitly intended to eventually be the only form of compensation for miners, the health of the entire network depends on them continuing to thrive over time, so this is overall positive.  This upcoming halving, and all future ones, create incentives for additional development and building on top of the existing Bitcoin infrastructure. Reducing rewards over time stands to make the entire network healthier and more diverse, not the other way around.  Right now, the future looks positive, with an ecosystem set up to continue expanding, even accelerating, as block rewards shrink. This could mean that Satoshi’s vision for a decentralized asset is right on track. But, no matter what, we’ll be finding out pretty soon.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Andy Handika,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/10/ordinals-defy-bitcoins-design-principles-but-offer-miners-huge-post-halving-advantages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ddb53a921f61edad21d14d9b188470d47f05fdb-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Edwards elaborated, “It’s 100% collateralized and the yield is variable based on market forces. Two things Luna wasn’t.” He also noted that at its zenith, Luna’s valuation exceeded ENA’s current market cap by more than twenty-fold, yet he cautioned, “ENA is not risk-free, custody and execution risk exist.” Ethena is the Luna of this cycle, except the underlying economics are actually sustainable. It's 100% collateralized and the yield is variable based on market forces. Two things Luna wasn't. At it's peak LUNA was over 20X bigger than what ENA is now. ENA is not risk free, custody… — Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) April 10, 2024 Since its launch on April 2, ENA has seen a meteoric rise from under $0.30 to a high of $1.45. This rally is largely attributed to Ethena Labs’ strategic enhancement of its rewards program, now in its “Season 2,” which offers a 50% reward boost for users locking their ENA tokens for at least seven days. This move aims to bolster user engagement and loyalty, fostering a sustainable ecosystem for the Ethena platform.

Fantom founder Andre Cronje, among others, has raised concerns about the sustainability of these yields, which are the highest in the entire crypto industry. Risks Involved With Ethena Noteworthy, ENA is often compared to Terra Luna (LUNA), but the differences could not be much bigger, as Edwards also noted. While ENA is not risk free, a demise like the one of LUNA is highly unlikely. Despite that, investors need to be aware of other risks involved with ENA. Diving deeper into the discussion of risks, CL (@CL207) from eGirl Capital offers an intriguing perspective on the behavior of derivatives traders. She clarifies, “It appears Ethena is making many people who don’t trade derivatives have a really hard time wrapping their heads around the fact that derivatives traders are so genuinely retarded that we’re willing to pay like 50%+ APR to enter a position.” Related Reading: Ethena (ENA) Surges 60%, But Fantom Co-Founder Warns Of Luna-Like Demise Notably, last cycle crypto traders were bidding futures so high that Bitcoin quarterlies earned “a locked-in >50% apr.

Through his examination, several key areas of concern are outlined: Oracle Risk: The potential impact on exchange positions due to Ethena providing inaccurate quotes on minting or redeeming operations. However, MonetSupply notes, “there’s rate limits on this tho so max loss is constrained and counterparties are all whitelisted (can’t just run away with the money).” Liquidation Risk: Deemed not a significant factor as the portfolio is leveraged less than 1x, suggesting a conservative approach to borrowing and leverage. Spread Risk: The possibility of increased basis leading to higher funding revenue, which should theoretically attract inflows. Conversely, a negative basis might cause outflows, but Ethena could benefit from closing hedged positions profitably. Collateral Ratio Risk: Even though liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are given less than 100% weight on centralized exchanges (CEX), the overall low leverage mitigates this risk. The proportion of LST in spot collateral is relatively minor. Custody Risk: Highlighted as one of the more significant concerns, given the reliance on custodians with a good track record and the distribution of assets across multiple entities. Exchange Solvency Risk: This risk could lead to the loss of unsettled profit and loss (PnL) and some trading costs to rehedge on other exchanges. However, MonetSupply adds, “the Binance/ceffu nexus might change this assessment though, are they actually independent?” Ethena Entity Risk: The internal risk related to Ethena’s keys or authentication tokens being compromised, or a team member acting maliciously. MonetSupply concludes that despite these risks, the framework of overcollateralization on platforms like Morpho, the Maker surplus buffer, and the MKR backstop, supported by a substantial Proof of Liquidity (POL), serves as a robust mitigating factor.

42418432,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThC97,1712757505,How the Halving Will Impact the Bitcoin Market,"There are many forces moving bitcoin, yet few attract the same level of attention as the halvings (when the block reward is cut in half). Historically, halvings have proven to be important catalysts for bull markets, and while the rate of impact is decreasing, the upcoming halving is likely to prove important for bitcoin’s price formation.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's ""Future of Bitcoin"" package published to coincide with the Halving in April 2024. Torbjørn Bull Jenssen is the CEO of K33.  At K33, we expect speculators to yet again front-run the event, as they have in all past halving events. On average, bitcoin has appreciated 14% over the month leading up to the halving, and we would not be surprised if 2024 would be in line with this. That said, there are many factors at play, and neither we nor anyone else can predict with certainty. But there are certain things we do know with certainty.  Demand is key  First of all, the bitcoin price is always determined by the net demand for holding bitcoin. With a given amount of bitcoin available at any point in time, its value must adjust until investors realize their desired allocations, denominated in e.g. USD.  To make a simplified example: If there was only one bitcoin and two investors wanted to hold 1000 USD worth of bitcoin each, that would only be possible with bitcoin valued at 2000 USD a coin and each investor holding half a coin each.  The current inflation rate is around 1.8%, around the same as for gold, and will drop to 0.9% in late April. This means that without a change in demand, the halving should only trigger a 0.9% price increase over the first year after the halving, relative to what would be the case without the halving.  Without a change in demand, the market cap should stay fixed. With 1.8% yearly inflation in the stock of bitcoin, the price must drop 1.8% for the market cap to stay the same. With 0.9% inflation, the drop would only need to be 0.9%.  The demand for bitcoin is of course nothing but fixed, but ironically, the analysis above proves an important point: While the halving is a supply-event, all of its impact on price must come from the demand side, as the pure supply-effect is a near non-event.  Hodlers are fully invested  In other words, it looks like the supply side effect is irrelevant. But that is not 100% true. The reason is that a lot of bitcoin hodlers are fully invested. They will keep holding if the price goes up, but they do not have more USD to buy BTC for. The price is therefore to some degree determined by the balance between the marginal buyer and the marginal seller, as the total portfolio demand is endogenous and, to some degree, determined by price.  To make a simplified illustration of the point: Imagine that all existing coins are held by strong hands not selling. Miners have to sell to cover costs, but no one has to buy. A halving in the supply of new bitcoin would, for a given rate of inflow of new USD to bitcoin, lead to a doubling of price. Once the price has doubled, half the number of coins will be enough to absorb the incoming USD.  A doubling in price would be a significant move, but looking at the past halvings and popular predictions like the long-since debunked but still used Stock-to-Flow model, optimists are expecting a 10x price increase. This can not be explained by the halving in isolation, and will only happen if there is a massive increase in demand, which is actually not too unlikely.  The halving is driving attention to bitcoin’s scarcity  The halving could tilt the balance between the marginal buyers and sellers, setting off a bull market with a feedback loop where more people want to buy when the price rises.  In addition, the current halving draws attention to the absolute scarcity of bitcoin at a time when it is more accessible for investors than ever before, thanks to the ETF-approvals in the U.S. There are also growing concerns about the debt overhang in the U.S., leading some to argue that bitcoin could serve as a hedge against the potential of falling trust in the dollar.  Against this backdrop, more and more people are learning about the halving and the scarcity of bitcoin and finding it appealing. That way the halving works as a Schelling Point, accelerating the already strong momentum for bitcoin. It is therefore not unlikely that we can see a pre halving pump, followed by a correction, before the underlying growth trend in adoption and awareness drives bitcoin towards new highs.  The daily reduction of bitcoin production from 900 to 450 on the halving day (likely April 20) is unlikely to have any immediate impact, but combined with demand triggering awareness, and positive feedback from a climbing price, the annual effect of 164,250 is definitely material.  The halving-day is expected to be a non-event  The upcoming halving is a known event and should, according to the efficient market hypothesis be priced in. Bitcoin is a volatile asset, with a correspondingly high expected future return, but events like the halving should have no predictable effect on the event day itself.  One can, of course, discuss whether the efficient market hypothesis holds or not. But, judging by the options market, it looks like the halving itself will be a non-event. If anything, traders seem to be more interested in hedging downside risk with put options than speculate on a large upside with OTM (out of the money) call options. In the medium term, there is a bullish bias, but we’ve recently seen a slow reduction in the optimism in the options market.  What should you do as an investor?  While speculators are likely going to position themselves in advance of the halving event, as they have in the past, long-term investors should pay minimal attention to the halving itself, and rather focus on the demand side of the market.  As such, perhaps the most important effect of the halving will be its marketing effect for bitcoin and its long term absolute scarcity in a world of inflationary fiat currencies.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Torbjørn Bull Jenssen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/10/how-the-halving-will-impact-the-bitcoin-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffa4471adf942bdae5ce9559029c41119f4ff88d-4240x2832.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of Tuesday evening, its value surged by nearly 10%, however, the canine-inspired cryptocurrency could not sustain the momentum and by Wednesday, it lost 14% of its value. Related Reading: Bitcoin Below $70,000: Is $80K Still Possible, Or Is The Rally Over? Dogwifhat’s Aggressive Rise And Sudden Dip The rollercoaster ride began with a bang. Dogwifhat, a newcomer to the meme coin scene built on the Solana blockchain, quickly drew investor interest. Its lighthearted name and association with the ever-popular dog meme trend fueled a buying frenzy, pushing its price up by double digits. This bullish sentiment echoed a wider trend in the meme coin market, which saw a 1.5% increase over the past week. WIF’s price has risen by 90% during the past month, adding an enormous $0.32 on average to its present price tag.

Source: CoinMarketCap On March 29, Dogwifhat surpassed Pepe (PEPE) to become the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, the euphoria surrounding Dogwifhat proved short-lived. The broader Solana meme coin category, which includes WIF, witnessed a steeper decline compared to the overall meme coin market. This suggests factors specific to Solana meme coins, possibly network congestion or concerns about the platform’s scalability, might be contributing to the price drop. WIF market cap currently at $3.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Dogwifhat’s Future: A Lofty Prediction, But Is It Realistic? Despite the recent dip, some analysts remain optimistic about Dogwifhat’s future. Changelly, a leading on-chain metrics and price prediction firm, has released a forecast that has set tongues wagging. Their prediction? Dogwifhat could reach a staggering $17 in the near future, representing a potential surge of a whopping 300% from its current price.

While the potential for massive returns in meme coins exists, so too does the risk of significant losses.

The CPI for March rose 0.4% versus expectations for 0.3% and February's 0.4%. On a year-over-year basis, CPI was up 3.5% versus 3.4% expected and 3.2% in February.  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.4% in March versus 0.3% anticipated and 0.4% the previous month. Year-over-year core CPI was up 3.8% versus 3.7% expected and 3.8% in February.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} fell more than 1% to $68,200 in the minutes following the report.  Traditional markets aren't taking the numbers well either, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures both tumbling about 1.5%.

Gold, which has been carving out new record highs on nearly a daily basis of late, is down 0.5% to $2,352 per ounce.  In addition to the spot ETFs and the halving, easier U.S. monetary policy was expected to be one of the bullish catalysts for bitcoin in 2024. Markets came into the year having priced in about 5 or 6 Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024, but inflation – which fell steadily through much of 2022 and 2023 – hasn't cooperated. It's actually risen a bit through the first quarter and remains well above the U.S. central bank's 2% target.  A series of Fed members have made clear they're not inclined to begin easing monetary policy until seeing a sustained path, i.e., more than just one monthly report, of inflation trending downward. Traders, meanwhile, have quickly whittled away their expectations of rate cuts, and prior to this morning's report had priced in just two or three for the full year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with the first move coming in June or July.

42418438,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCIP,1712750460,First Mover Americas: Meme Coin Indexes Are Here,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Crypto exchange WOO X has introduced a set of index perpetual contracts linked to meme coins, the top 30 cryptocurrencies and layer-2 (L2) tokens in partnership with market maker Wintermute and index provider GMCI. WOO X closed a $9 million funding round in January with participation from Wintermute and Amber. The firm is offering traders GMCI’s MEME index, which includes top meme coins like SHIB, PEPE and DOGE, and an L2 index that monitors scaling tokens like MATIC, IMX and OP, the companies said. Indexes are widespread in traditional finance, allowing traders to monitor and – through linked products – gain exposure to a broad range of securities. The new products will soon be complimented by a copy-trading option, as well as on-chain U.S. Treasury bills, WOO X Chief Operating Officer Willy Chuang said.  Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of digital asset investment manager Grayscale, sees outflows from the company's bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) reaching an equilibrium, Reuters reported. Sonnenshein said the selling connected to settlements of bankrupt crypto companies like FTX is ""largely behind us,"" according to the report, citing an appearance on a Reuters podcast. When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January, Grayscale's product (GBTC), which had already existed for several years as a trust, experienced significant outflows as existing investors likely sold their shares to buy into one of the new funds. Another reason for the outflows was GBTC's comfortably higher fees compared to its competitors. Sonnenshein said last month that he expects the fund's fees to decrease over time.  Blockchain venture studio Thesis unveiled Mezo, a Bitcoin layer-2 network, from stealth with a $21 million fundraising round led by Pantera Capital. Mezo is a ""permissionless Bitcoin economic layer that leverages a neutral smart contract infrastructure"" to offer a wide range of applications for users, Thesis said. It is designed to amplify the Bitcoin blockchain’s infrastructure and provide cheap and fast transactions by allowing users ""to access applications that use Bitcoin for everything, enabling a thriving circular economy,"" the venture firm said. Mezo will go live with support from Thesis’ bitcoin-backed Ethereum token tBTC, which allows users to get bitcoin into Ethereum’s decentralized-finance (DeFi) ecosystem. “Our goal with Mezo is to extend the Bitcoin network to bring 25% of the world’s economy on-chain – roughly in line with the size of the U.S. economy today,” Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis and founder of Mezo, said in a release.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's hourly realized volatility since the spot exchange-traded funds began trading in the U.S. three months ago.  Prices are considerably more volatile between 14:00 UTC (10:00 ET) and 18:00 UTC (14:00 ET).  Volatility was more evenly scattered in three months before ETFs began trading.

25506590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602446,1712750420,"Here Are The Drivers Behind The Bitcoin Price Crash To $68,000","Bitcoin has again experienced a price decline since briefly climbing above the $72,000 mark on April 8. This price dip is believed to be due to a couple of factors, which no doubt present a bearish outlook for the flagship crypto. Inflation Data Expected To Come In Hot The March Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is scheduled to be released on April 10. Some market experts predict that the report will show a rise in overall inflation. This could lead to the Federal Reserve taking a hawkish stance on interest rates, negatively impacting Bitcoin’s price and the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Sees Bullish Reversal In On-Chain Metrics, Can SHIB Price Recover? This would explain why Bitcoin’s price has declined lately, as crypto investors remain on the sidelines ahead of the CPI report. However, if the inflation figures come in favorable, this could restore investors’ confidence in the economic situation and provide a much-needed bullish outlook for the crypto market. Also, considering that January and February’s inflation data exceeded expectations, it is necessary to highlight what last month’s data exceeding expectations could mean in the long term. So far, the Fed has continued to hold interest rates steady at about 5.3%, and there was even optimism at the beginning of the year that there could be rate cuts at some point this year. However, with inflation continuing to stay well above the Central Bank’s target of 2%, there is a growing feeling that they might be forced to take drastic measures at some point. That is ultimately not good for Bitcoin’s price, especially since different crypto analysts gave bullish predictions partly based on their assumption that there would be several rate cuts this year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Back In The Red The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also contributed to Bitcoin’s recent decline. These investment funds experienced a net outflow on April 8 and 9, leading to a significant Bitcoin dump on the market. Specifically, these outflows came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which recorded an outflow of $303.3 million and $154.9 million on April 8 and 9, respectively. Related Reading: VeChain On The Edge: Insider Says VET Will Reach The Finish Line Meanwhile, the other Spot Bitcoin ETFs have not recorded impressive inflows during this period, which shows their demand has slowed. For context, 6 out of the 10 Spot Bitcoin ETFs (excluding GBTC) recorded zero inflows on April 9, while 5 out of 10 recorded zero inflows on April 8. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also recorded a relatively low inflow of $21.3 million that day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,300, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42418437,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCHN,1712749150,Crypto Miners Run Down Bitcoin Inventory to 3-Year Low in a Strategic Pre-Halving Move,"Bitcoin miners have been running down inventory in a rising market, moving away from the accumulation strategy seen ahead of the previous halving in May 2020.  The shift likely stems from miners selling into the rising market to upgrade equipment and ensure sustainability after the impending halving of rewards on April 20, according to Wintermute.  Bitcoin miners are depleting their coin stashes, possibly to ensure the sustainability of operations in the face of the impending halving of per-block rewards from April 20.  The number of bitcoin held by miners, which receive the coins in return for validating transactions in the blockchain block, declined to 1.794 million BTC this week, the lowest since early 2021, according to data source CoinMetrics.  The so-called miner balance has fallen by 27,000 since November, implying steady selling in the months leading up to the quadrennial mining reward halving. The pivotal event is set to reduce the per-block BTC emission to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.  The drawdown in balance contrasts the steady accumulation of about 25,000 BTC in the five months leading up to the previous halving, which occurred on May 11, 2020.  The change in strategy stems from bitcoin's recent rally to record highs above $73,000. The cryptocurrency has surged 63% this year, surpassing the previous cycle peak of around $69,000 well before the halving. Historically, new highs have come months after the halving.  The rally has allowed miners to take profits at higher prices and fund equipment upgrades to prepare for the reduced rewards rate, according to algorithmic trading firm Wintermute.  ""With miners' holdings still near an all-time high in USD terms ($124 billion), this sell-off appears to be a strategic move for profit-taking and operational upgrades, marking a behavioral change from the last cycle,"" Wintermute said in a weekly newsletter.  The upgrades are evident from the rise in the hashrate, or the total computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions, on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The hashrate has increased by 45% to over 600 exahashes per second over five months, registering a more significant growth than the 15% increase seen ahead of the previous halving.  ""The consistent rise in hashrate suggests that some of the miners are either adding or upgrading their equipment to mitigate the impact of the upcoming halving on revenues,"" Wintermute noted.

After a surge over the weekend that brought it close to shattering its all-time high, the digital asset has dipped back below the crucial $70,000 mark in the last 24 hours. This sudden correction has left investors wondering if the predicted surge to $80,000 is still on the table. Source: Coingecko Related Reading: Polkadot Shines – Is Now The Time To Buy DOT Before $10? Bitcoin Erases Weekend Gains Just days ago, Bitcoin bulls were celebrating as the price climbed to near record highs exceeding $70,000. This bullish momentum fueled optimism, with analysts like Markus Thielen predicting a swift climb towards $80,000. However, that optimism has been tempered by the recent price drop. Bitcoin has plummeted roughly 6% from its peak, effectively erasing the gains made earlier this week. While the price has recovered slightly to hover around $69,200, it remains below the psychological barrier of $70,000. Is The $80,000 Dream Dead? The recent correction has undoubtedly dampened spirits, but some analysts are still confident that Bitcoin’s journey to $80,000 is far from over. Proponents of this view point to a few key factors that continue to fuel their bullish sentiment. Stablecoin Inflows: A Beacon Of Hope? One factor cited by Thielen is the continued strength of stablecoin inflows. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar, are often used as an entry point for investors into the crypto market. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView According to Thielen, these robust inflows suggest sustained investor interest despite the short-term price fluctuations. Additionally, he highlights a recent technical chart pattern breakout, specifically a symmetrical triangle, as another bullish indicator. Technical analysts believe such breakouts often signal a continuation of the prior trend, which in this case would be positive for Bitcoin. On-Chain Data Bolsters Bullish Case Some analysts point to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, which reveals significant buying support at current price levels. This data suggests that a large number of addresses (essentially unique identifiers for cryptocurrency wallets) purchased Bitcoin within the range of $68,200 and $70,325. This buying activity indicates potential resistance against further price dips, as these addresses would likely be hesitant to sell at a loss. Bitcoin price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko Bullish And Bearish Forces The current situation presents a classic tug-of-war between Bitcoin bulls and bears. While the recent price correction has shaken some confidence, strong stablecoin inflows and on-chain buying activity suggest underlying bullish pressure. However, they remain cautious, pointing to the slowdown in investments specifically targeted at spot Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) as a potential concern. These ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Source: CoinShares Meanwhile, a report by CoinShares, a digital asset manager, highlights a significant decrease in inflows to such ETFs in recent weeks, suggesting that some institutional investors might be adopting a wait-and-see approach.

One observer said the pullback could soon run out of steam as selling pressure from wallets with a history of holding coins for the long term is weakening.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is on the defensive under $69,000, nursing a 2.5% drop on a 24-hour basis, having briefly climbed to a high of $69,300 during the Asian trading hours.  Profit-taking from Monday continued as several major tokens slid lower. Ether and Solana’s SOL lost 2.8% and Cardano’s ADA and dogecoin (DOGE) slumped as much as 4%. BNB Chain’s BNB was the only token in green with a slight 1.8% rise.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20, a liquid index of the biggest tokens, excluding stablecoins, was down 3%.  The Asian session demand for bitcoin and leading altcoins represented trade optimism, FxPro Senior Market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a message, warning of potential volatility explosion following the release of the U.S. consumer price index later Wednesday.  “The U.S. CPI report, which in recent years has caused a spike in volatility comparable to NFP [nonfarm payrolls report], has an impressive potential to influence the market on Wednesday,” said Kuptsikevich.  Still, some analysts said bitcoin correction could be over. Selling pressure from certain long-term wallets seems to have cooled in recent weeks, alongside a bump in demand for spot bitcoin, on-chain analysis firm Glassnode said in a Tuesday report.  “Bitcoin’s strong performance over the last 12 months is supported by a surge in spot trade volume and exchange deposit and withdrawal volumes,” analysts at blockchain data tracking firm Glassnode wrote. “Profit-taking by long-term holders spiked meaningfully into the $73k ATH and has been cooling down in recent weeks.

42418424,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThC1t,1712744186,Grayscale CEO Says Bitcoin ETF Outflows Are Reaching Equilibrium: Reuters,"After the approval of several spot bitcoin ETFs in January, investors may have sold their GBTC shares to move into new products.  Daily outflows from GBTC have fallen significantly since hitting $600 million in March.  Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of digital asset investment manager Grayscale, sees outflows from the company's bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) reaching an equilibrium, Reuters reported on Wednesday.  Sonnenshein said that some of the selling connected to settlements of bankrupt crypto companies like FTX is ""largely behind us,"" according to the report, citing an appearance on a Reuters podcast.  When the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January, Grayscale's product (GBTC), which had already existed for several years as a trust, experienced significant outflows as existing investors likely sold their shares to buy into one of the new funds.  Another reason for the outflows was GBTC's comfortably higher fees compared to its competitors. Sonnenshein said last month that he expects the fund's fees to decrease over time.  In the three months since, GBTC has seen total outflows worth $15 billion, according to BitMEX Research. In March, these were hitting $600 million a day but have fallen significantly since. On Monday and Tuesday this week, they stood at $303 million and $155 million, respectively.  Grayscale did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment.

Over 50% expect another major crypto to collapse by 2026, the report said.  Consumers became more positive about cryptocurrencies during the first quarter, according to a March survey by German lender Deutsche Bank (DB).  “Consumers have become more positive on crypto in Q1 2024, with less than 1% thinking they are a fad,” the April report said.  The data is hardly surprising given the strong rally in crypto markets in that period that was fueled by the January approval of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Nevertheless, the survey showed that consumers are not overly optimistic about the outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, with only 10% of people saying they expect it to exceed $75,000 by year-end. Bitcoin was trading over 2% lower over 24 hours at around $69,000 at publication time.  Just under one-third of the 3,600 surveyed said they expected the bitcoin price to tumble below $20,000 by the end of 2024 and over 50% of respondents said they were worried about another major cryptocurrency collapsing in the next two years.  As many as 40% said they expected bitcoin to thrive in the coming years, while almost as many – 38% – said they expected the digital asset to disappear.  “78% of U.S. consumers see cryptocurrencies as a form of commodities, 76% as alternative assets, and 74% a store of value. 65% see it as replacing cash,” the report said, adding that 52% see cryptocurrencies as an “important asset class and method of payment.”  Read more: Many Retail Investors See Bitcoin Price Dropping Below $20K by Year End: Deutsche Bank  UPDATE (April 10, 16:00 UTC): Replaces ""retail investors"" with ""consumers"" throughout; adds number of people surveyed in fifth paragraph.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/10/bitcoins-bullish-quarter-eases-retail-skepticism-deutsche-bank,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63126360ef150190e76c7bbb4dbbe581a2f30645-2559x1439.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

WOO X closed a $9 million round in January of this year with participation from Wintermute and Amber.

Related Reading: Don’t Miss The Boat! Ethereum Whales Signal Bullish Run With $40 Million Bet Based on the latest figures, DOT tallied an all-time high in active wallets and unique accounts in March, surpassing 600,000 and 5.59 million, respectively. This suggests a growing interest in the platform, potentially driven by the thriving developer ecosystem on Polkadot’s parachains, specialized blockchains that connect to the main Polkadot chain. Moonbeam, a prominent parachain, played a particularly significant role, contributing the highest number of active addresses with nearly 250,000. Source: Data Polkadot Transactions Dip Despite Active User Growth However, despite the influx of new users, the number of transactions on the Polkadot network hasn’t kept pace. While there was a modest increase in transactions compared to February, the current volume remains significantly lower than the peak recorded in December. This inconsistency raises concerns about how actively users are engaging with the network. The possibility exists that users are holding or staking their DOT tokens instead of utilizing them for transactions on the platform. Total crypto market cap is currently at $2.5 trillion. Chart: TradingView Polkadot Price Seeks Stability After Recent Decline The price of Polkadot’s native token, DOT, seems to be finding support around $9. This could indicate a period of consolidation after a decline from its previous highs above $11. While a price increase is typically seen as a positive sign, it’s important to consider it alongside actual network usage. Source: Data Is Polkadot Building Without Using? The current situation with Polkadot presents a paradox. The platform is attracting new users, but they aren’t necessarily translating into active network participants. This could be due to several factors. Perhaps users are waiting for a specific application or service to be built on Polkadot before actively engaging. It’s also possible that technical limitations are hindering user activity. Related Reading: SUI Slips After Hitting All-Time High: TVL Tumbles 12% – Token Price In The Gutter? Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind the lagging transactions. Examining the types of transactions occurring on the network could provide valuable insights. For instance, an increase in governance-related transactions might suggest a more engaged user base, even if overall transaction volume remains low. Polkadot’s Future Hinges On Active Network Use While the growth in active wallets and accounts is a positive sign for Polkadot, it’s crucial to convert this interest into actual network usage. The success of Moonbeam demonstrates the potential for a vibrant developer ecosystem on Polkadot. However, broader adoption across various use cases is necessary for the platform to reach its full potential.

Recent developments, including a possible FRIEND token and expansion beyond X, have renewed interest in the platform.  More than $7 million has flowed into the platform in anticipation of the developments.  Money is flowing back into social application Friend.Tech as a new version teases an eventual airdrop, bringing users back to what was among the biggest revenue-generating platforms during the bear market.  Over $7 million flowed to Friend.Tech last week after months of outflows, boosting the value locked to nearly $40 million, data shows. Weekly fees have crossed $1.3 million for the first time since November, making the platform over $600,000 in revenue.  Built on Base, a layer-2 network, Friend.Tech lets crypto personalities on X issue “shares” for access to a closed group chat. For users, the allure of these chats is that their owners could offer trading insights, token picks or access to seed-funding deals – which raises the value of the shares.  The bump in activity precedes the coming of version 2 of the application, which developers said will be released after April 20. A key element of the update is expanding the platform beyond X to attract newer users.  Over the weekend, developers also teased a FRIEND token. Expectations among users are that these could be distributed based on how many points – a reward for Friend.Tech usage – they accumulate before the token release.  Friend.tech was earning in excess of $1 million per day in fees at its August peak after going viral on X and gaining more than 100,000 unique users, a significant number for crypto application standards. Shares of some crypto X personalities, such as @Cobie and @HsakaTrades, jumped to as much as three ether, or nearly $5,000, at the time.

This movement can be attributed to a risk-off sentiment among investors, largely in anticipation of the latest US Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures today. Following a low of $68,200 on Tuesday, Bitcoin managed a slight recovery, stabilizing above $69,400 at the time of reporting. Concurrently, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has updated its registry of virtual asset management funds early on April 10. Notably, the SFC is poised to announce the inaugural list of four Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on April 15, as reported by Tencent News. This announcement marks a significant milestone, setting the stage for the ETFs’ launch on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by the end of April. Despite the magnitude of this news, the immediate market reaction has been muted. Hong Kong To Launch Spot Bitcoin ETFs By End Of April According to a Tencent News report, Harvest International Asset Management and Huaxia Funds (Hong Kong) Limited have been officially approved to manage virtual assets, signaling their entry into the cryptocurrency sector in Hong Kong. This development is significant as it introduces mainland China’s leading public fund companies into Hong Kong’s virtual assets industry. Currently, there are 18 funds in Hong Kong authorized to manage cryptocurrency assets, with Harvest International and Huaxia Fund being among the first public funds to venture into this space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Two Important On-Chain Levels: What Happened Last Time Harvest International emerged as the pioneer in submitting a proposal for a spot Bitcoin ETF in Hong Kong as of January 26. Following this initial submission, both companies have now secured the necessary qualifications to issue cryptocurrency-related fund products, including Bitcoin spot ETFs. This move enables retail investors to access these products through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The urgency to update the virtual asset management funds list stems from the SFC’s plan to unveil the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs by April 15. The initial batch was anticipated to include Huaxia Fund, Bosera Fund, and Value Partners Financial, alongside Harvest International. However, Bosera and Value Partners were notably absent from the updated list due to their lack of an independent responsible officer (RO) qualified in cryptocurrency asset management. These funds are reportedly collaborating with Hashkey Capital and VSFG, both qualified crypto asset management organizations. Related Reading: Ethena’s (ENA) Crucial Role In Bitcoin Bull Market: Expert Identifies Critical Factors For Sustainable Growth In preparation for the ETF launch, some applicants, including Huaxia Fund, have been rapidly assembling dedicated teams and submitting their applications by early March. Huaxia’s swift approval by the SFC, achieved in just two weeks, underscores the rapid pace of development in this area. The application process for a Bitcoin spot ETF in Hong Kong involves extensive collaboration with over 20 institutions, including custodian banks and market makers. Following the SFC’s approval, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is expected to spend approximately two weeks preparing for the ETF launch. Notably, this move opens up the crypto sector to Chinese retail investors, coming three months after the US SEC’s approval of the first batch of Bitcoin spot ETFs on January 11.

The integration is part of an effort to make the token more embedded into the decentralized finance space, First Digital's CEO said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Hong Kong-based stablecoins issuer First Digital Trust said Wednesday that it is expanding its $3 billion dollar-pegged FDUSD token to the Sui {{SUI}} blockchain after being available of Ethereum {{ETH}} and BNB Chain {{BNB}}.  The expansion is part of First Digital's effort to boost FDUSD usage among decentralized finance (DeFi) users, CEO Vincent Chok said in an interview with CoinDesk.  FDUSD, issued under Hong Kong's digital asset rules and backed by U.S. Treasury bills and bank deposits to keep its price anchored to $1, quickly became the fourth-largest stablecoin behind Tether's USDT, Circle's USDC and MakerDAO's DAI, amassing $3.3 billion market capitalization since its launch last year.  The token has largely benefitted from crypto exchange giant Binance's trading promotion following the shutdown of the Paxos-issued Binance USD stablecoin, ordered by New York state regulators. FDUSD's trading volume surpassed $10 billion over the past 24 hours, with more than 90% of that coming from bitcoin {{BTC}}, ether {{ETH}} and USDT spot trading pairs on Binance, according to CoinGecko data.  ""Sui is an up-and-coming network and very supportive of the DeFi space,"" Chok said in the interview. ""Their growth within a year is amazing as well, so we want to grow together as a new stablecoin.""  Sui, created by the developer team that led Meta's shuttered Diem crypto project, has seen a rapid growth in DeFi activity recently. The network's total value locked (TVL), a key DeFi metric showing the combined worth of assets on a protocol or blockchain, has mushroomed to around $700 million from $100 million six months ago, DefiLlama data shows.  The expansion to Sui also makes FDUSD the first top stablecoin natively issued on the Sui network. Sui hosts $340 million worth of USDC and USDT stablecoins, per DefiLlama, but users had to use bridges to transfer tokens from other blockchain rails, which incurs fees and risks.  ""This integration will have a profound impact on the Sui community, fueling enhanced liquidity, expanding the network's utility, and unlocking new possibilities for builders and users,"" Greg Siourounis, managing director of ecosystem development organization Sui Foundation, said in an emailed statement.",POSITIVE,BNB | FDUSD | SUI,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BNB | FDUSD | SUI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/10/hong-kong-based-first-digitals-3b-stablecoin-arrives-to-sui-network-in-defi-push,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/638c18c01f900eb928b26eda713574e58c1efdd7-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418464,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCFJ,1712731932,Bitcoin Breakout Halts as U.S. Inflation Data Looms,"Bitcoin’s failed breakout likely represents temporary nervousness ahead of the U.S. CPI release, and not an outright bearish trend reversal, 10x Research’s Markus Thielen said.  Markets have pared back Fed rate cuts ahead of the CPI release.  A soft inflation print could put the June rate cut back on the table, injecting upside volatility in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} dropped 3% in the past 24 hours, invalidating a bullish breakout, ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data that could dictate when the Federal Reserve (Fed) starts cutting interest rates.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value slipped back into a triangular consolidation pattern identified by trendlines connecting March 15 and March 27 highs and March 20 and April 3 lows. The symmetrical triangle consolidation had ended with a bullish breakout early this week, opening doors for a rally to $80,000.  Failed breakouts often result in short-term traders closing or reversing bullish bets in anticipation of a steeper price decline. Still, Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, cautions investors against reading too much into Bitcoin’s bull failure.  “Bitcoin’s failed breakout likely represents nervousness ahead of the U.S. CPI release. I would not write it off yet,” Thielen told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Thielen added that Wall Street’s tech-heavy index, Nasdaq, rose Tuesday, offering positive cues to bitcoin and other risk assets. In other words, bitcoin’s dip could be short-lived. The cryptocurrency closely follows trends in the Nasdaq and the Nasdaq-to-S&P 500 ratio.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release March 2024 CPI data on Wednesday at 08:30 ET (12:30 UTC).  The consensus is that the consumer price index, a measure of cost of living, has increased by 3.5% since March 2023, accelerating from February’s 3.2% annual inflation rate, according to economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. The monthly pace is forecast to have eased to 0.3% from February’s 0.4% rate.  Similarly, the monthly pace in core inflation, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have slowed to 0.3% in March, following February’s 0.4% gain, equating to a 12-month decline to 3.7% from 3.8%.  A resilient economy and labor market conditions have already forced markets to pare bets on the timing of the first Fed rate cut and the number of rate cuts this year. On Monday, the Fed funds futures showed expectations for 60 basis points of rate cuts this year, down significantly from 150 basis points in early January. The probability of the first 25 bps rate cut in June stood below 50%, down from nearly 60% before Friday’s upbeat nonfarm payrolls report.  Thus, a hotter-than-expected CPI release may not inject a significant downside volatility in bitcoin. On the contrary, a soft print could put the June rate cut back on the table, reviving bullish sentiment in the leading cryptocurrency.  “The market is already walking back expectations of rate cuts – the first cut coming in June is now down to a 50% probability, according to CME pricing. In other words, there could be some volatility, but it feels like the market is already more bearish on the inflation outlook,” Noelle Acheson, author of the popular Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, said in Tuesday’s edition.  “Inflation unexpectedly dropping would most likely have a bigger impact on assets, including crypto, as it would signal that maybe the Fed does have an excuse to cut in June after all,” Acheson added.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/10/bitcoin-breakout-halts-as-us-inflation-data-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/185234c740e58ca8524ff7c5df97ebae143c9ffd-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418443,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThCJR,1712716200,Is the Sam Bankman-Fried Story Over?,"Last month, I attended Sam Bankman-Fried's sentencing hearing. Not that anyone asked, but I have some thoughts.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  25 Years  Former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison last month. Just like during last year's trial, CoinDesk journalists were in attendance.  The sentencing hearing took 1 hour and 59 minutes. In that time, we heard from Judge Lewis Kaplan, defense attorney Marc Mukasey, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Roos, an FTX creditor, an attorney representing other FTX creditors and Bankman-Fried himself. In some respects, the hearing was a final chance for everyone – the judge exorcized some demons in summing up who he thought Bankman-Fried was, the prosecutor dropped a final nail into Bankman-Fried's coffin and the former CEO whiffed his last chance to define himself in court.  The hearing's brevity perhaps belied its significance. The judge presiding over the case first worked through various objections the defense had to sentencing guidelines recommendations made in the Presentence Investigation Report, disagreeing with the defense's objections to how the crimes Bankman-Fried was convicted of were characterized and landing at a baseline sentence of 110 years.  Sunil Kavuri, a vocal FTX creditor, and FTX creditor group attorney Adam Moskowitz both spoke. Kavuri pushed back against the defense argument that creditors haven't suffered any real losses because they'll get their money back, but mostly directed his ire at the current bankruptcy team (prompting the judge to interrupt him twice). Moskowitz spoke of the cooperation he received from FTX insiders in trying to secure funds for creditors, including ""Sam and his team,"" asking the judge to keep that under consideration.  New defense counsel Mukasey said Bankman-Fried was a ""beautiful puzzle"" who didn't intend to harm anyone and was not malicious. Roos repeated the closing statement he made at trial, saying Bankman-Fried stole funds – and even if he didn't spend it on cars, that doesn't mean he wasn't greedy.  Bankman-Fried spoke. A defense attorney I spoke to before the hearing said it would be a bad idea for him to say anything. The consensus among observers after the hearing was that Bankman-Fried didn't really help his case. He said FTX's customers are who matter, shouted out many of his former colleagues and their efforts and said his management led to FTX's 2022 bankruptcy before veering off-topic, blaming the bankruptcy estate for the fact creditors haven't received refunds yet.  ""I made a series of bad decisions,"" he said. ""They weren't selfish decisions. They weren't selfless decisions. They were bad decisions. And those culminated with a bunch of other factors along with the liquidity crisis for Alameda in November of 2018. It wasn't bankrupt. FTX wasn't bankrupt. Alameda wasn't bankrupt. There were no losses to socialize to customers.""  ""My useful life is probably over,"" he said at one point.  He reiterated his previous stance that customers ""could have been paid back,"" saying there are currently enough assets – and have been – to repay customers in full. And again, he hinted that current FTX CEO John J. Ray III and the bankrupt exchange's cleanup crew were doing something wrong.  ""This isn't the time or place to tell that full story for why they are still waiting, for why they are not sure if they are going to get petition-date value or current values,"" he said. ""But a good place to start with is Dan Friedberg's affidavit that he filed a bit over a year ago in bankruptcy court. It was a brief affidavit. I don't think he made a lot of friends for filing that. I suspect he made some enemies.""  He closed by saying there was ""an opportunity"" for his former colleagues or someone ""to do what the world thought I would do.""  AUSA Roos pointed to this in his own statement, arguing Bankman-Fried hadn't accepted responsibility for the collapse of FTX, just that he seemed to say things could have worked out differently if he hadn't made the mistakes he'd made.  And finally, it was the judge's turn again.  Over the past few months of watching Judge Kaplan during pretrial hearings and the trial itself, I've come to appreciate just how on top of this case he has been. He's got a busy docket – one of his other cases features a former U.S. president as a party, for example – but he has been a colorful figure when addressing Bankman-Fried's trial details.  This is a judge who seems to recognize that he's going to be quoted in press reports and filings for quite some time to come. His actions during the entire case will certainly be scrutinized when Bankman-Fried's appeals last year's guilty verdict.  ""I reject entirely the defendant's argument that there was no actual loss,"" he said at the outset of the hearing. ""The defendant's assertion that FTX customers and creditors will be paid in full is misleading, it is logically flawed, it is speculative.""  It's no secret that the judge appears to have a dim view of Bankman-Fried. He was all but openly derisive toward the former crypto mogul when Bankman-Fried testified during the trial itself, to the point where I did genuinely wonder how the jury perceived his comments about the defendant on the stand. Eighteen random members of the public, who had no little or no familiarity with FTX, crypto, Bankman-Fried or being on a jury, may well have easily taken cues from the most visible legal expert who ran the show. Judge Kaplan sent the jury out for some part of his ""what are you all doing?"" lectures but he couldn't or didn't hide his disdain for the defendant all the time.  Of course, Sam did not help his case much. Despite the polished responses he provided his own counsel, he floundered against the slightest pushback during cross-examination, as my colleagues and I noted last year.  Judge Kaplan, when he spoke during the sentencing hearing, had an air of a man finally able to unleash the full force of his disdain. He cited three specific examples of when he believed Bankman-Fried committed perjury on the stand, and didn't just rely on a general idea that he perjured himself simply by pleading not guilty and being convicted.  ""I did not think it a fruitful use of time to spell out every time I thought Mr. Bankman-Fried testified willfully and knowingly falsely at trial. There are more than the ones I've articulated, but that suffices,"" the judge said. ""And when he wasn't outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions and trying to get the prosecutor to reword questions in ways that he could answer in ways he thought less harmful than a truthful answer to the question that was posed would have been.""  It's a harsh, but accurate assessment of Bankman-Fried's performance on the stand. His performance, as the judge put it, was awful. I'm somewhat sympathetic to the idea that being in jail made it difficult for Bankman-Fried to properly prepare for cross-examination, but he seemed to resent his narrative being questioned during his testimony and it undoubtably made an impression on the jury, witnesses and the judge.  More than that, Bankman-Fried didn't quite seem to grasp how his demeanor and responses were received by the judge and jury. This was true last year and remained true last month.  ""I've been doing this job for close to 30 years,"" the judge said. ""I've never seen a performance quite like that.""  A friend asked me what I thought of the sentence after it was handed down. I don't know yet. I agree with AUSA Roos, who told the jury – and later, the judge – Bankman-Fried lied during the course of FTX's life.  ""He spent his customers' money and he lied to them about it. Where did the money go? The money went to pay for investments, to repay loans, to cover expenses, to purchase property, and to make political donations,"" Roos said last year. During the sentencing hearing, he went further, saying, ""the fact that Mr. Bankman-Fried spent the money on investments, rather than sports cars, or whatever you might expect for someone classically greedy, does not make him not greedy or does not express a motive of greed. The fact that he had ambitions that seem altruistic does not make him not ambitious, is not a motive for doing these things.""  In other words, Bankman-Fried may genuinely believe that using his companies' funds for pandemic preparedness and other purposes was for the net benefit of humanity, but it doesn't mean he didn't use customer funds or lie about it.  Does that warrant 25 years in prison? Perhaps. But I also want to touch on something I wrote when he was first convicted – 25 years is a long time. The world moves quickly, more quickly than we can immediately appreciate in our day-to-day lives. This time 25 years ago, people used pagers and car phones were just finally dropping out of popularity. Steve Jobs was years away from sparking the smartphone revolution, GeoCities was an exciting Yahoo! product and Pokémon was just three years in.  Bankman-Fried's new legal team is going to appeal. We've known he would appeal since the start of his trial. There'll be a hearing, and it's anyone's guess how the appeals court may rule. But from my view as a reporter, it'll be a long shot for his team.  We're closing this chapter on Bankman-Fried, though as we've seen, jail won't stop him from sharing his views and so the book remains open.

The first of these levels is the “MVRV +1SD.” The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio is a famous indicator for Bitcoin. In short, it compares the value that BTC holders are currently carrying (that is, the market cap) against the value they put into the cryptocurrency (the realized cap). Related Reading: Bitcoin 40% Of Way Through Bull Run If This Metric Is To Go By This metric is generally used to determine the scale of profit or loss that the market as a whole is carrying right now. Based on this, the fairness of the coin’s price may be judged. In the context of the current discussion, the +1 standard deviation (SD) of the MVRV ratio from its mean is of relevance. More specifically, the price level at which the market would satisfy this MVRV ratio condition is of focus. The other on-chain level of interest here is the “Vaulted Price.” This indicator is a product of the “Cointime Economics” framework that Checkmate came up with alongside David Puell from Ark Invest. In reference to this metric, the paper reads: Vaulted Realized Price may be considered to be a pricing level that reflects the ‘potential energy’ stored in the system. Somewhat counter-intuitively, the more long-term coin accumulation that takes place, the larger the uncertainty becomes between the proportion of truly lost vs. HODLed supply. Vaulted Realized Price will trade lower in this instance, as more cointime accumulation takes place, and uncertainty regarding future distributive pressure builds (and vice-versa). Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in these two indicators, as well as some other “original” on-chain levels, over the past few years: Looks like the asset has been near these two levels in recent weeks | Source: @_Checkmatey_ on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot price earlier broke through the Vaulted Price and went to the MVRV +1SD (note that the labeling is flipped in the chart by mistake, as Checkmate has noted in reply to the post). Since then, the price has come down a bit and is trading under both of these levels. Nonetheless, it currently stands quite near to them and far above the other on-chain price levels like the realized price.

Obviously, what followed then was the bull run of 2021. It remains to be seen how Bitcoin’s interactions with these levels will be this time around and whether a similar euphoric run will follow with a potential break above them.

Woo particularly underscored the potential for Bitcoin’s price to surge dramatically, using the term “ballistic” to describe the expected trajectory post-Halving. Notably, Bitcoin’s Halving is an integral component of its protocol. It occurs approximately every four years and reduces miners’ reward for validating transactions on the blockchain. This event also effectively reduces the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, increasing the asset’s scarcity and potentially impacting its price dynamics. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Warns Of Burgeoning Bitcoin Fire Sale, Here’s What It Means Bitcoin Would Go ‘Ballistic’ Based On This Woo’s analysis delves into the profound implications of the impending Halving, particularly regarding Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. The cryptocurrency experiences an annual supply growth rate of 1.7%, which will be halved to 0.85% following the upcoming event. This reduction favors Bitcoin’s supply growth rate compared to traditional assets like gold, which boasts an annual supply growth rate of approximately 1.6%. Moreover, Woo juxtaposes Bitcoin’s supply growth against the US dollar, characterized by a negative growth rate attributed to inflation. As the USD supply growth trends back to a standard range of 5% to 10%, Woo anticipates a momentous surge in Bitcoin’s price, driven by its inherent scarcity and growing recognition as a hedge against inflationary pressures. 10 days to the halvening… #Bitcoin‘s annual supply growth drops from 1.7% to 0.85%.

The survey findings reveal a palpable division among respondents regarding Bitcoin’s trajectory, with approximately one-third expressing negativity about its price prospects. These individuals anticipate Bitcoin’s value to plummet below $20,000 by year-end, representing a stark deviation from the prevailing bullish sentiment. Adding to the discourse, Authur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, offers a dissenting view characterized by a bearish outlook on Bitcoin’s post-halving performance. In a comprehensive analysis shared via a blog post, Hayes outlines his concerns regarding the potential for a significant price decline after the halving. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Resumes Upside, Why BTC Could Soon Hit New ATH While many analysts anticipate a bullish rally during the halving period, Hayes posits a scenario in which Bitcoin experiences a more subdued trajectory, emphasizing the need for careful consideration amid heightened market volatility.

25478760,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=602364,1712707243,Ethena’s (ENA) Crucial Role In Bitcoin Bull Market: Expert Identifies Critical Factors For Sustainable Growth,"The recent volatility in the Bitcoin (BTC) price and its struggle to consolidate above the $70,000 mark has raised questions about the sustainability of its ongoing bull run. However, market expert Charles Edwards, co-founder of Capriole Invest, believes that the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena Labs (ENA) could significantly extend and boost Bitcoin’s bull market to new heights. In a recent post on social media site X (formerly Twitter), Edwards suggested that Ethena’s actions, such as constraining over-leverage in derivatives markets and reducing spot supply, can propel Bitcoin’s price higher for a longer period. Bitcoin Bull Market Boost To provide further context as to why Edwards is suggesting this possibility, on April 4th, Ethena Labs announced its intention to engage in a cash-and-carry trade involving Bitcoin. According to the protocol’s announcement, Ethena Labs can manage risk and provide a more stable backing for its product by buying and shorting Bitcoin. Related Reading: Solana Open Interest Drops $370 Million Amid Network Troubles, $200 Still Possible? One of the key factors Edwards highlights is Ethena’s ability to constrain over-leverage in Bitcoin derivatives markets. By doing so, Ethena aims to prevent excessive risk-taking and potential market instability. Additionally, Ethena’s taking spot supply off the market can reduce selling pressure, thus supporting Bitcoin’s price and prolonging the bull market. The protocol also noted that Bitcoin derivative markets offer superior scalability and liquidity compared to Ethereum (ETH). This characteristic reportedly makes Bitcoin a suitable asset for delta hedging, a risk management strategy employed by Ethena. With $25 billion of Bitcoin open interest available for Ethena to delta hedge, the capacity for its synthetic dollar product, USDe, to scale has increased significantly. Ethena Labs noted in their announcement the following: In just 1 year, BTC open interest on major exchanges (exc. CME) has grown from $10bn to $25bn, while ETH OI has grown from $5 to $10bn BTC derivative markets are growing at a faster pace than ETH and offer better scalability and liquidity for delta hedging Weighing The Risks While Edwards’ statement is optimistic about Ethena’s impact on Bitcoin’s bull market, one user raised concerns about potential downsides. Edwards acknowledges that execution risks, such as custody failure or delta neutrality failure, could have adverse effects. Edwards identifies custody risk as the most significant risk in this context. However, he highlights that any negative impacts will likely be short-lived, and market forces will ultimately dictate Ethena’s net annual percentage yield (APY). Related Reading: Bitcoin To $150,000 Is “Programmed” With Halving Approaching: Analyst In short, by limiting over-leveraging in future markets and reducing spot supply, Ethena could significantly support the price of BTC and extend the current bull run. Currently, BTC’s price has experienced a significant decline, plummeting to the $68,800 level. This marks a 4.3% decrease compared to Monday’s price. In parallel, Ethena’s native token, ENA, has also followed the overall downtrend of the market, reflecting BTC’s price movement with a 4% decrease. Presently, ENA is trading at $1.22.
