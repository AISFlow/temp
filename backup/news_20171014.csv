This increase sparked confidence from investors in the Bitcoin market. The reason that this price increase was completely unexpected was due to the SegWit2x hard fork, which is scheduled for November, and due to hit major markets such as Japan, the US and South Korea. This pre-planned adjustment has split opinions, with some businesses and exchanges losing confidence in Bitcoin. Some of the largest wallets and exchanges have reaffirmed their stance on the upcoming changes, and it is not always in the favour of SegWit2x. What is the SegWit2x? The SegWit2x was proposed to upgrade Bitcoin, in a couple of ways. It would enact the long-proposed code optimisation Segregated Witness, which alters how some of the data is stored on the network. The 2x would reflect the timeline for increasing the network’s block size to 2MB, which is doubled from 1MB. Who is for this upgrade? Like we mentioned before, this proposed change has very much divided businesses and exchanges. Coinbase and Bitfinex have reaffirmed their stance on the upcoming SegWit2x hard fork, and the Bitfinex development team have revealed that they plan to utilise the moniker, ‘B2X’ to list the SegWit2x fork of Bitcoin upon the completion of its hard fork in November. A member of the team released this statement; “We have elected to designate the SegWit2x fork as B2X, for now. The incumbent implementation will continue to trade as BTC even if the B2X chain has more hashing power. We are doing this for practical and operational reasons. Political considerations are irrelevant here. While we cannot change or re-assign ticker symbol, we can change the label or description associated with that ticker symbol. For the time being, BTC will continue to be labelled as ‘Bitcoin’ and B2X will be labelled as ‘B2X’”. For these two major exchanges, it is important to note that they are listing the new coin as B2X, even if it has more hashing power, because the investors and traders will likely remain on the legacy chain, or the original Bitcoin blockchain. This means that in November, the market, users and investors can then decide which Bitcoin blockchain will be referred to as ‘Bitcoin’ and ‘BTC’. Who opposes it? The market confidence and price surge for Bitcoin, could actually demonstrate a lack of support for SegWit2x. Trading of Bitcoin has been increasing greatly in major regions such as Japan and the US, which has seen the price surge. This price has been predicted to rise further, but only if the SegWit2x turns out to be a minority fork. Tuur Demeester spoke on this topic saying; “The chart needs to confirm, but if the Bitcoin 2x hard fork turns out to be a nothing burger, it could provide tailwinds for a rally and $5,000” Unfortunately, this claim could soon be backed up, as the market is not doing anything to demonstrate that these predictions are not correct.

On finding the bug, the team behind ethereum's most popular client published a new software release, yet data from blockchain analytics site Ether Nodeshttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/geth shows a relatively low rate – only 1.9 percent of Geth nodes – of adoption at press time.  With Geth comprising about 75 percent of all ethereum nodes, the vulnerability could leave nodes running the previous Byzantium-compatible release more susceptible to DoS attacks after the hard fork.  Explained by ethereum developer Casey Detrio on Reddit, the vulnerability stems from an oversight in one of the new Byzantium features. The risk is that this bug could be exploited by an attacker who wants to take ethereum nodes offline – a form of attack that the ethereum community has dealt with in the past.  Bug fixes have been coming from other ethereum node software groups ahead of next week's planned fork as well.  Yesterday, the team behind Parity, ethereum's second largest software client, issued a new release of its software (the fourth iteration) that corrected a ""consensus bug"" – an error which could have caused the network to partition during the hard fork. Currently, less than 20 percenthttps://ethernodes.org/network/1/forkWatch/parity of Parity nodes have updated to the new release, according to Ether Nodes.  Hard forks are hard  The issues unearthed by the tests have been of an unexpected severity, leading some ethereum developers to question their approach to the hard fork release process.  Internal discussions are also underway about the possibility of postponing Byzantium, but this approach also poses risks. This strategy would require all nodes to update their software so that the software change is triggered at a later time – a complicated prospect with such little time before the fork.  Indeed, the Parity team tweeted out that, in their view, the fork should be delayed given the recently discovered issues.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Detrio explained that ""updating is not necessarily a quick and easy process for users with extensive infrastructure,"" such as exchanges or mining pools, and requires ample time to be done correctly.  He added:  ""The second concern is that there may be more undiscovered consensus bugs that could be found after the activation block, which would then result in needing to perform emergency client updates.""

42427914,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4g5h,1507975209,Afraid of ICOs? Bankers Heap Criticism on Token Tech at Exchange Event,"Several high-profile banking executives had not-so-nice things to say about initial coin offerings (ICOs) at an event in New York City this week.  Hosted by the Moscow Exchange Group, around 400 attendees were present at the forum, including central bankers and representatives of the ""Big Four"" accounting firms. And though a range of topics was discussed, none proved more top-of-mind than the blockchain token sector.  In line with the wider discourse on display in recent weeks, the first deputy governor of Russia's central bank, Ksenia Yudaeva, went so far as to compare ICOs to the pyramids schemes of the 1990s that cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars.  The comments come at a time when government bodies throughout the world are investigating the blockchain use case, with some taking a heavy hand and banning token sales, while others have been more open-minded to the possible advantages of the tech.  Yudaeva, though, is not in the latter camp. She told the audience:  ""They tried to attract a lot of ordinary people to get high gains from nothing, in a short period of time, but then all these people had high losses in a short period of time.""  And the negative pressure that these fundraising efforts have put on the economy is something Yudaeva, who reports directly to the Russian central bank's governor, said she fears might happen again, stating: ""We are very much afraid of this problem. We are very skeptical.""  Whatever the potential benefits of blockchain itself might be, she continued, cryptocurrencies are no longer viewed by the bank as a legitimate means of exchange.  ""Our opinion is that the ruble is the only payment instrument in Russia and we think we should be extremely careful with cryptocurrencies and how they work,"" she said.  The comment aligns with those made by Russian Vladimir Putin when he called cryptocurrencies ""serious risks"" recently. But they also stand in stark contrast to a regulated Russian clearing house agreeing to host its first sanctioned ICO just a month ago.  'Cute' technology  Following Yudaeva's comments, global chief economist at Citi, Willem Buiter, went even further in his condemnation of cryptocurrencies and ICOs.  ""I think that cryptocurrencies are going to meet the fate with other authorities that they have met with China's authorities,"" he said, alluding the country's ban of token sales.  ICOs ""will be cracked down upon,"" Buiter said.  Buiter, like Yudaeva, also gave a nod to the potential benefits of blockchain itself, but quickly returned to disapproval with the way some people and companies are using the technology.  ""Initial coin offerings are just regulatory arbitrage to avoid IPO restrictions,"" he said, referring to initial public offerings on which companies raise money by selling stock shares on a regulated exchange.  Buiter concluded with a little grudging praise for ICOs, saying:  ""Cute, and I admire the ingenuity – but it is pure regulatory arbitrage, and the regulators are always a couple of years behind – but they're catching up.""

42427892,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4bVh,1507971608,"Logical or Not, Bitcoin's Coming Fork Is Boosting Its Price","Bitcoin may be trading at an all-time high, but the reasons why have experts wondering.  Despite increased dialogue about the cryptocurrency's potential, and growing acknowledgment from the mainstream, there are some who believe now isn't the best time to buy the notoriously volatile asset. After all, in just weeks, bitcoin is likely to see not just a contentious split of its blockchain, but an adversarial one.  Looking for context on what could happen if bitcoin splits and one version tries to destroy the value of the other? As developers freely admit, you're unlikely to find it – it's a first.  ""Bitcoin traders are some of the most irrational investors you'll come across,"" OpenBazaar developer Chris Pacia said in a Facebook post addressing the issue.  The brutal sentiment points to what has been the uptick in buying that appears to be taking place not just despite – but because of – the coming fork, now slated for November. In contrast to zealous investors, developers like Pacia are finding it hard to believe anyone would put big money into a protocol about to undergo a process even they're just beginning to understand.  Yet it seems, investors believe the momentum is warranted given the results of the last hard fork in August, which split the network in two, but did so in a way that fairly safely created a new asset called bitcoin cash.  Distributed to all bitcoin owners at the time of the fork, investors were suddenly given an equal amount of valuable cryptocurrency (bitcoin cash has held relatively steady around $300 per coin, but has traded for as much as $1,000). Far from a risky proposition, investors see that extra value as just created out of thin air and delivered to existing investors for free.  But while developers are aware the mechanisms and politics of the coming fork are different, investors seem to be planning for the same results.  Harry Yeh, managing partner at cryptocurrency investment firm Binary Financial, told CoinDesk:  ""Investors are just looking at it like, 'I'm going to get more tokens right now.' It's just that simple.""  And these investors aren't new to cryptocurrency (or to trading in general), they're well-established investors.  Ronnie Moas, the founder of Wall Street firm Standpoint Research, for example, echoed Yeh's belief, saying, ""I don't see [investing in bitcoin as Segwit2x closes in] as risky – especially if you hold onto the spin-off [coins].""  Not the same  Is this merely a case of aggressive trading, or is it wishful thinking? Some would argue, that on this issue, the traditional finance guys are getting in over their heads.  For one, the bitcoin cash hard fork and the Segwit2x hard fork will be different in that the former's supporters were defined by their interest in creating a competing (and now seemingly complementary) cryptocurrency. With Segwit2x, the motivations aren't exactly that.  Still, traders counter, cryptocurrency just doesn't function like more established markets, meaning that in the high-risk world of experimental assets, more risk is still just risk.  ""Historically, one would assume that if you have one token and it splits into two, your mindset would be that both tokens would be worthless,"" Yeh said. ""But, traditional rules of economics and finance don't really apply in the cryptocurrency world.""  Yeh points to last summer's ethereum hard fork, which led to a split and the creation of two competing assets as yet another sign forks have historically resulted in value creation.  While the price of ethereum and ethereum classic (the new coin) dropped initially after the split, ethereum's market value recovered quite nicely, currently hovering around $32 billion, while ethereum classic continues to hold value at just over $1 billion.  ""History has shown that, any time there's been a hard fork, that people get more tokens – and those tokens become tradeable somewhere,"" Yeh said.  As a consequence, retail investors are betting that if they buy more bitcoin, another fork will drive prices higher, and that this will result in them holding a more diversified portfolio.  More about bitcoin  However, some investors say the rally could be less about diversification and more about going all in on bitcoin with the expectation of even more long-term gain.  According to Arthur Hayes, a former Citigroup trader who now heads a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, confidence is high that the existence of additional versions of the bitcoin protocol won't affect this long-term future. Further, with bitcoin holding steady, even though three of the world's largest exchanges in China closed down, there's confidence that nothing can quite derail its current trajectory.  As a result, investors aren't really worried about Segwit2x.  Yeh agreed with the bullish outlook on bitcoin broadly, saying he expects a run-up both before and after the hard fork.  He argued that ideological belief in bitcoin – even at its most uncertain, even at its lowest – is what will continue to push the price higher and new investors into the market.  Summing up that investor optimism, James Altucher, a former hedge fund manager, popular business blogger and bitcoin bull, told CoinDesk:  ""When people say that bitcoin is like a penny stock, it's like a scam internet stock, no. Bitcoin actually has huge amounts of software and science behind it to make it the best store of value in the world.""  Ash Bennington contributed reporting.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in OB1, the company that develops OpenBazaar.
