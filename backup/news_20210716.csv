42406968,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hSV,1626467641,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Holds Above $30K but Price Chart Looks 'Ugly',"Bitcoin bounced to around $32,200 after touching a 2.5-week low early Friday near $31,000.      The largest cryptocurrency by market value may have been buoyed by a CoinDesk report that Bank of America has approved trading in bitcoin futures for some clients, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst for Oanda.      ""This is a big commitment for America’s second-largest bank and signals that interest in trading cryptocurrencies is here to stay,"" Moya wrote in an email. ""On Wall Street, if one bank sees opportunity in doing something risky, the rest will easily justify following suit.""    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC): $31,964.2, +1.04%  Ether (ETH): $1,917.5, -0.29%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4327.1, -0.75%  Gold: $1810.9, -1.01%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.299%, compared with 1.303% on Thursday    Analysts said bitcoin might be prepping for a price breakout – higher or lower – after trading in a range between roughly $30,000 and $40,000 for the past eight weeks.      The big concern is a drop below the psychological level of $30,000 might trigger additional selling as options traders look to square positions.      ""There is a big move coming,"" blockchain analyst William Clemente III wrote Friday in Anthony Pompliano's newsletter."" Theoretically, we could be looking at this big move in the next few days but could take up to those full three weeks.""      The breakout looks more likely to be to the downside, based on the look of bitcoin's price chart, according to Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange analysis firm Quantum Economics.      ""Bitcoin's chart looks really ugly at the moment,"" Greenspan wrote in his newsletter. ""The downward slope that has materialized over the last few days gives the appearance that gravitational forces are calling for a retest of the red-line support at $20,000, the previous all-time high. In technical terms, this is known as capitulation.""    Circle and crypto investors    Earlier this month, Circle, the company behind the fast-growing dollar-linked stablecoin USDC, announced plans to become a public company at a $4.5 billion valuation, via a deal with a special-purpose acquisition corporation (SPAC).      Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree Asset Management, speculated this week the deal could end up luring more investors to cryptocurrencies.      It’s “unquestionably the starter stock for the cautious,” Morris wrote July 14 in his weekly newsletter.      Big investors might find the stock hard to resist due to USDC’s fast growth: The stablecoin’s supply has soared to more than $25 billion, from about $3.9 billion at the start of the year. “It’s clear to the eye this company is growing like a weed,” Morris wrote.      What might make the new shares more attractive for portfolios is that USDC “powers crypto, yet has none of the volatility, making it a natural haven in comparison to the asset managers or miners whose fortunes are linked to crypto prices,” according to Morris.      But that might just be a camel’s nose under the tent:      “The old world will end up owning all of these stocks regardless, and that is why index funds always amuse me. They just buy whatever is stuck in front of them, meaning that investors who are trying hard to avoid crypto will end up owning it. Before long, everyone will be invested in crypto and crypto stocks, whether they like it or not, and Circle’s listing will be a crowd pleaser.”    What's up with tether?    The parabolic growth in the market cap of stablecoin giant tether (USDT) suddenly came to a grinding halt at the end of May, just as bitcoin’s price was coming off its all-time highs.      According to analysts and market participants who spoke to CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen, the sudden pause reveals that the most traded cryptocurrency in the world is seeing its dominance threatened by three unprecedented challenges combining in a perfect storm to rattle the stablecoin.    China’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies and money laundering has choked off the fiat on-ramp to crypto markets through over-the-counter brokers, while listless bitcoin prices have reduced the incentive to invest: “Tether’s market in Asia is mostly through OTC merchants, and with less cash going into the market there is less demand for tether,” Rachel Lin, former vice president and founding partner at Singapore-based crypto investment firm Matrixport, told Shen.  The rising star of the stablecoin market is increasingly USDC. “I think USDC has a chance to compete in the stablecoin market in Asia against tether,” said Justin Sun, who helms the Tron blockchain.  More questions have been raised recently by regulators and governments around the world about USDT and other stablecoins. “The market is infused with bearish sentiment and traders are looking for a reason,” said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at crypto prime broker Genesis Global Trading, a CoinDesk sister company. “It’s FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) season, and tether’s vulnerabilities are almost always a part of that conversation.”    An executive from Tether, while acknowledging the demand for USDT has fallen, argued the trend is not exclusive to the token.      “Demand for tether ebbs and flows, and has been impacted by lower demand in recent weeks,” Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said in a written response via a spokesperson.    Altcoin roundup  Thorchain loses 4K in ether in attack: Thorchain suffered an attack on the crypto trading protocol that drained about 4,000 ETH, worth about $7.7 million based on ether’s price as of press time. The company tweeted that it would provide a “more detailed assessment and recovery steps” soon. Administrators wrote earlier that the network had been halted while developers investigated the extent of the breach. “While the treasury has the funds to cover the stolen amount, we request the attacker get in contact with the team to discuss return of funds and a bounty commensurate with the discovery,” the administrators wrote on Telegram.  Binance halts support for stock tokens: Crypto exchange Binance said it will no longer support tokens linked to stocks, barely three months after it made them available on its trading platform. Binance announced Friday that stock tokens are unavailable for purchase on its website effective immediately, and support for such tokens will end on Oct. 14, with all positions closed the following day. The embattled exchange, which has been facing regulatory headwinds, said the move will allow it to focus on other products.  FOX token's rally: Following ShapeShift’s announcement that it would transform into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), its governance FOX token rose 300% to $1.16 in several hours. While the cryptocurrency has retraced to $0.55 in the past 24 hours, it’s still up almost 200% this week – a stellar performance considering the broader market lull. Analysts stand divided on whether the rally represents an ever-intensifying search for yield or investors cheering ShapeShift’s early-mover advantage as a DAO.

42406969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hUT,1626462016,Money Reimagined: Why the World Still Needs Uncensorable Marketplaces,"Earlier this week I wrote a long-overdue postmortem on OpenBazaar, the cryptocurrency-powered e-commerce marketplace that folded in January. What follows is a eulogy of sorts.      Skeptics might wonder why I suggested, in my interview with OpenBazaar co-founder Brian Hoffman, that someone might want to dust off the open-source code and have another go at building a peer-to-peer version of eBay. Or at least, why would anyone other than a criminal want to build a marketplace where anyone can take part and no product or service can be banned?      I’ll give two examples that illustrate the need for such a service. Those who scoff at the first may be convinced by the second, and vice versa.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here. Michael Casey is away. This week's main column is written by Executive Editor Marc Hochstein.    In March, Dr. Seuss Enterprises, the organization that owns the rights to the late Theodor Geisel’s works, announced it would cease publishing six of his 60 books because they contained illustrations depicting racial stereotypes. To be clear: This was absolutely the organization’s prerogative, and the claims in some corners that a beloved children’s author had been “canceled” were overblown.      Far more concerning was the decision by eBay to stop used-book sellers from listing the half-dozen books in question on its platform.      Because these discontinued books, published from the 1930s to the 1970s, were now collector’s items, they were more likely to end up sitting in Mylar bags or behind museum glass than corrupting impressionable minds. eBay nevertheless decided that protecting its brand from any association with offensive drawings was a higher priority than letting a few small-business owners make a buck or two during the coronavirus-induced recession.      Again: eBay’s house, eBay’s rules. I am not a lawyer, but to the best of my understanding the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution doesn’t guarantee vendors the right to use an internet platform, however dominant it may be in its market. (As of May 2020, eBay ranked third in U.S. e-commerce sales, behind Amazon and Walmart, with a 4.5% market share.)      Yet, had OpenBazaar still been around then, the booksellers might have had another way to monetize the musty old volumes collecting dust on their shelves at a time when the coronavirus pandemic was likely discouraging garage sales.      No one would have been hurt.    Sexless in Texas    Perhaps you think eBay took the high road by refusing to facilitate resales of out-of-print books that reflect the prejudices of their day, and that there’s no good reason to help anyone circumvent such enlightened corporate censorship.      If so, consider another, older example.      In 2016, when Sen. Ted Cruz was vying for the Republican presidential nomination, the Texas Republican was mocked for having once defended a Texas law that criminalized the sale of, er, marital aids.      Nine years earlier, as the state’s solicitor general, Cruz had responded to a lawsuit challenging the law’s constitutionality by arguing, among other things, that “there is no substantive-due-process right to stimulate one’s genitals for non-medical purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship.” Unconvinced by his brief, an appeals court struck down the law in 2008 (the year Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper).      But what if the ban, which most readers would probably consider archaic and intrusive, had stood?      Neither bricks-and-mortar nor online retailers would have been able to sell these products to Texans without risk of prosecution. Yet, OpenBazaar would have given randy residents of the Lone Star State another way to obtain their sex toys. Granted, this would have fallen under the “illicit uses'' category.      But, again, no one would have been hurt.    The P2P frontier    Both of these examples may be outliers, but they speak to a broader principle.      In the old world of physical stores and face-to-face business dealings, trade is almost always censorship-resistant by default. You hand banknotes to the baker or the butcher or the barber, she gives you a brioche or a brisket or a buzzcut. No third party gets to second-guess or overrule your choices. As commerce moves online, more and more transactions are funneled through ever-more-powerful intermediaries.      “Electronic P2P markets at scale are still unexplored lands,” said Tim Pastoor, an independent researcher on peer-to-peer identity and reputation systems. “Sure, people have been transacting P2P since the dawn of time, but digitally and at scale is another one of those magical nuts that hasn't fully been cracked yet.”      Pastoor sees a practical economic benefit to cracking that nut.      “It would be cheaper for both buyer and seller if the middleman is eliminated from the process,” he said. “Think eBay, Amazon or even Netflix or Spotify, or ordering a pizza from your local shop, but without the centralized infrastructure between the buyer and seller, that always comes with some sort of fee for the upkeep of the infra[structure] and for the business building and maintaining it to operate.”      Costs aside, the Dr. Seuss example shows the veto power of intermediaries becomes a problem when they block innocuous transactions. Those incredulous that I question eBay’s offensive-materials policy should consider how they would react if the company’s executives instead enforced Ted Cruz’s views on morality.      Bitcoin restored censorship resistance to payments in the digital realm. OpenBazaar did the same for commerce in general but found little traction. Still, it was a valiant effort. I hope someone picks up where Hoffman’s team left off. –Marc Hochstein    Off The Charts: DeFi Grows, So Does Front-Running    Miner/Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) has been a hot topic in the Ethereum community over the past few months due to the increasingly disruptive strategies Ethereum miners are using to capture it. According to data from Dune Analytics and Flashbots, a cumulative $765 million in additional miner revenue has been generated from different MEV tactics since Jan. 1, 2020.      Ethereum miners extract MEV by ordering transactions within blocks. The ability to order transactions enables miners to front-run trades on decentralized exchanges (DEX), take advantage of price arbitrage across DEXs, and liquidate positions at the most optimal times on decentralized lending apps. Bots are commonly programmed to identify these profit opportunities within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem of Ethereum and exploit them by paying off miners to manipulate transaction order.      As seen in the chart, MEV tends to follow trade volume on decentralized exchanges. This is because growing liquidity and trade sizes on DEXs lead to more profitable arbitrage and front running opportunities.      Critics of MEV tactics believe the process of extracting additional value through transaction ordering threatens the integrity of the Ethereum network. While price arbitrage and liquidation are beneficial for the usability of DeFi, MEV is controversial because of the negative effects it simultaneously has on the Ethereum ecosystem. Front-running consists of stealing basis points from other transactions, by buying before the pending transaction and then selling the asset for a profit after the other transaction confirms. Furthermore, front-running bots are associated with creating a slower and more costly Ethereum network. MEV can also cause transactions to fail for gas fee and slippage errors.      While daily MEV revenue has cooled considerably from its peak of $5 million reached in May during the height of the crypto bull market, MEV remains a source of contention and debate on Ethereum that is only expected to become more heated as the DeFi ecosystem continues to mature. –Teddy Oosterbaan",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/16/money-reimagined-why-the-world-still-needs-uncensorable-marketplaces,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/331216ad66997a23920892f73d62cbf1c527d3e0-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406952,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hHg,1626456816,Can Coinbase Keep Wall Street Happy During the Crypto 'Pause'?,"I’d love to spend this morning writing about yesterday’s announcement that Square will be developing what sounds like its own decentralized finance (DeFi) platform on Bitcoin. But there’s nearly no information in the world about the project right now – even the name is (for now literally) TBD.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    We do know it will be led by Mike Brock, a former Red Hat team member. The idea of building DeFi on Bitcoin, which doesn’t natively support all of the smart contracts required, is exciting and novel and frankly a little weird. But I trust Square CEO Jack Dorsey, so I’m eager to hear more.    Read more: Square to Create New Bitcoin Platform for Financial Services    But in the absence of that “more,” let’s talk about the fact that markets seem so indifferent to this possibly game-changing news, and what that means for other crypto businesses – specifically, exchanges.      Bitcoin edged up less than 1% in the last 24 hours, which is a pretty typical daily fluctuation and can’t be tied to the Square announcement. For first-timers, that’s because we’re entering at least a bit of a crypto pause, with public interest having been redirected to, among other things, going outside. Search volume for both “bitcoin” and “Ethereum” have cratered over the last few weeks, and as we’ll discuss, so have exchange volumes. Hopefully this won’t turn into a full-fledged bear market like 2018-2019’s “Crypto Winter,” but at least for a little while, this kind of news may just not move the needle as much as it would have closer to the market top when there were more eyes on the sector.      That’s a problem, above all, for cryptocurrency exchanges, which make most of their money from trading fees. In the past, trading lulls have led to lots of layoffs and strategic contraction. But this time around, there’s something new to consider: Among all cryptocurrency exchanges, dormant cycles may be worst for those that are publicly listed.      Long periods of dormancy have so far proven typical for crypto, as adoption waves come and go like tides. These big fluctuations in public interest are very bad for the bottom lines of companies like Coinbase, not only because they’re making less money, but because Wall Street is not particularly well set up to value businesses with that kind of intrinsic ebb and flow.      But first, let’s look at just how bad things are out there! The situation was highlighted last night by Frank Chaparro, news director of The Block, who characterized exchange volumes as “falling off a cliff.” But I’ve seen actual cliffs I’d rather fall off – aggregate exchange volumes are down roughly 60% since the May market peak. Some exchanges are doing better than others: Binance, possibly thanks to its legal troubles, is off more like 85%, according to data from CoinGecko. Derivative trading volume on FTX is down roughly the same amount. These may be higher than the aggregate because newcomers were more likely to use these more prominent platforms. It’s also quite possible that smaller exchanges in the aggregate are spoofing volume, and everyone’s down as much as the big boys.    This is not the type of performance Wall Street likes.    Trading volume on Coinbase, according to my calculations, is off an even more chilling 92% from its May peak. As Jeff Roberts over at Decrypt pointed out, this will lead to a pretty crazy situation for Coinbase’s stock. They should report second-quarter earnings soon, but that will be for April through June, which includes the May peak, so that report will probably look great. The report will also (because the SEC has some standards) include major caveats about how their third quarter outlook – that is, the business actually happening at the time – is an absolute dog’s breakfast.      This is not the type of performance Wall Street likes. Wall Street, big surprise, likes numbers to go up – the more steadily, the better. Even if you’re a money-losing public startup, you’d better be able to lose a little bit less money each quarter. Coinbase, because it is deeply tied to a market that moves in rather long, slow, and deep cycles, is going to have a very hard time meeting those expectations.      Some Wall Street analysts may be knowledgeable and generous enough to try to make allowances for Coinbase’s unusual market position. But most won’t, and they’ll look at the huge gap between the Q2 numbers and the publicly-viewable volumes actually happening the same day, and they’ll think, “My god, this stock is terrible.” I’d bet there’s resistance to even covering the stock, since analyst reputations hinge on the accuracy of their calls, and setting a medium-term price target for Coinbase’s stock is like trying to guess which way a hand grenade will bounce. (Coinbase does have non-exchange revenues, such as custody services, but transaction fees are as much as 96% of its revenue.)      That said, this arguably creates an opportunity. For many, many years, Bitcoin has been slammed for its volatility, but supporters said that things would smooth out with enough adoption – enough coins spread out across enough hands creates stability. That has started to show signs of coming true. In fact, the past two months of relatively tight trading between $30K-$34K has been far worse for exchange trading volumes than a few wild swings would have been.      By a similar token (pun intended), Coinbase is a long-term bet that crypto exchange activity will diversify and deepen to a degree that its revenues smooth. Both the Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, are publicly listed, and they’ve been pretty good long-term bets. If you think the crypto market will thrive alongside the stock market in coming years, Coinbase is still probably a good bet – but maybe wait a few weeks to fill your bags. A lot of investors have already concluded they aren’t interested, which is why $COIN is off a precipitous 31% since its initial stock listing. But as the current bloodbath makes its way into Wall Street’s full awareness, there’s further left for it to fall, at least in the near term.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is convening the working group, which consists of major financial regulatory agency heads, to examine stablecoin regulation and risks, and to find suggestions for future work around this issue. The President's Working Group is an interagency entity tasked with monitoring the U.S.'s financial markets.      In the press release announcing the meeting, Yellen said the meeting could help protect users, markets and the broader financial system from any risks that stablecoins pose, while still enabling the government to ""assess the potential benefits.""      “In light of the rapid growth in digital assets, it is important for the agencies to collaborate on the regulation of this sector and the development of any recommendations for new authorities,"" she said.      The group expects to publish written recommendations in the near future.      The President's Working Group already published one document about stablecoin regulation in December, which examined retail payments and sought public feedback on how these types of payments are being used.      The December statement warned there may be risks around stablecoins, particularly with regard to end user rights, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering issues, market integrity and monetary stability.      Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Acting Chair Rostin Behnam will also be part of Monday's meeting. While the December iteration of the group asked former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks to weigh in on its report, it's unclear whether current Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu will be a part of any future recommendations.      The news comes just after Powell told Congress that greater regulations are needed around stablecoins before they can become a significant part of U.S. payments networks.      “Stablecoins certainly have some advantages in terms of faster payment systems and have some attributes of CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] but there are some risks with stablecoins right now,” Powell told the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. “I think the issue is that stablecoins are a lot like money market funds or bank deposits or a narrow bank.”",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/07/16/us-presidential-advisory-group-to-discuss-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/56d6322cde5241ad8dfe850adcddefdfa6315af6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Central bank researchers estimated the government’s $1,200 stimulus checks sent to Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic fueled a 3.8% jump in trading volume and a 0.7% rise in price. Overall, they estimated just 0.02% of the stimulus money ended up in bitcoin.      Framed against bitcoin’s wild volatility, these figures don’t add up to much.

42406966,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hRW,1626451871,FOX Token Rally: Yield Play or ShapeShift DAO Craving?,"""ShapeShift has begun decentralizing,"" the Colorado-based exchange's CEO, Erik Voorhees, said in an announcement on Wednesday detailing the company's decision to dissolve the corporate model and evolve into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).      The disclosure lit a fire under ShapeShift's governance FOX token, sending its price higher by over 300% to $1.16 in a matter of hours. And while the cryptocurrency has retraced to $0.55 in the past 24 hours, it's still up almost 200% this week – a stellar performance considering the broader market lull.      Analysts stand divided on whether the rally represents an ever-intensifying search for yield or investors cheering ShapeShift's early-mover advantage as a DAO.      ""The FOX token moved higher because people bought the token to provide liquidity in the new FOX/ETH pool to receive liquidity provider tokens,"" said Nick Hotz, senior analyst at the U.S.-based investment management firm Arca.      Read more: Voorhees Applauds Crypto’s Hyper-Capitalism as ShapeShift Goes ‘Gray’      ShapeShift was scheduled to start its initial liquidity mining program Friday. The program allows FOX holders to provide liquidity on the decentralized exchange Uniswap v2 and stake their liquidity provider tokens in the ShapeShift Staking Rewards contract for a proportional share in 15,768,000 FOX tokens that will be distributed over the following three months.      Hotz told CoinDesk the program was paying a ridiculously high annual percentage yield (APY) of 20,000% on Wednesday. While the APY has slipped below 1,100% since then, it is still well above the yield offered by liquidity pools of the top decentralized finance (DeFi)-protocols like Venus, Curve, SushiSwap, according to CryptoCompare. The ultra-high returns may have enticed traders into buying the FOX tokens.             A DAO giveaway like the FOX airdrop has several advantages over traditional market initial public offers and may have attracted some value buyers.      ""ShapeShift users will become financially invested in the success of the project, incentivized to use the platform more frequently and recruit friends,"" Arca's Hotz said. ""In comparison, IPO investors don't have a voice in the companies' decision-making unless they purchased stock. They have little incentive to evangelize for the company.""      ShapeShift has earmarked extra tokens for paying people to use its products, incentivizing further customer acquisition, a feature never available to initial public offering subscribers.      Dennis Hui, a DeFi portfolio manager at DAO Ventures, voiced a similar opinion, adding the price rally also shows ""everyone wants the piece of an exchange"" that has already established a niche.      ""ShapeShift has existed as a business for many years, has been generating revenue and is a leader in decentralized ownership,"" Hui said in a LinkedIn chat. ""So it is very different from many regular DAOs who only set up operations in the past year.""      Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, said FOX's reaction to ShapeShift's decision reflects markets' craving for a DAO – a democratized decision-making system using cryptocurrency and blockchains.      While the decentralized finance space has seen explosive growth over the past 12 months with an influx of venture capital, achieving complete democratization has proven to be challenging.      ""DAO is a great idea on paper, but turning that into reality by unwinding various links to the foundation has proven difficult to achieve,"" Vinokourov said. ""The significant influence of venture capitalists over decision making has been particularly highlighted during the recent Uniswap approval of the $20 million education fund.""      Read more: DeFi Gets Proactive About Policy Thanks to a $20M Grant From the Uniswap Community      Recently, a DeFi education fund promoted by Harvard Law's Blockchain and Fintech Initiative requested and received 1 million UNI tokens (the native coin of Uniswap) from the decentralized exchange's treasury. Per the Reddit post, most of the Uniswap community opposed the idea of granting approximately $17 million, as of this writing, to the DeFi fund. However, the proposal was approved based on the votes of a few large UNI token holders.      ""Almost the total margin of victory came from the proposer itself and Penn Blockchain, which is sponsored by [venture capital fund] a16z and helped write the [World Economic Forum] report with several of the board members who will now hand out the UNI that left the treasury,"" one of the Uniswap community members called ""hlspunk"" noted, according to Decrypt.      The episode raises questions about decentralized token-based governance when large holders call the shots and probably explains the market's reaction to ShapeShift's plans to decentralize itself out of existence via one of the largest airdrops in history.      As CoinDesk's Brady Dale noted, ""Many companies in crypto build a decentralized protocol but leave a business standing that takes part in creating profit atop their blockchain creation (case in point, Compound Labs just launched Treasury to do precisely that).”      ShapeShift, however, is going a step further by airdropping 340 million FOX tokens to all past users of the exchange (around 900,000 addresses) and 120,000 addresses on several well-known DeFi protocols.      ""This is why the reaction by ShapeShift's token has been so dramatic after it took steps to become a DAO,"" Vinokourov said. ""PR stunt or not, the reaction shows that it is exactly what markets want.""

42406955,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hDk,1626451265,Terra Attracts $150M for DeFi Ecosystem Fund,"Terraform Labs, the South Korean company behind the Terra public blockchain, has raised $150 million from a handful of major crypto investors, including Arrington XRP Capital, Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital and BlockTower Capital.      The $150 million commitment is to Terra’s Ecosystem Fund, which Terraform Labs uses to sponsor projects built on the Terra blockchain.      Terra, which is a Tendermint-based blockchain, deploys a suite of stablecoins based on its dollar-pegged TerraUSD (UST). Terra uses an algorithm to maintain a steady value for UST and its derivatives, incentivizing traders to purchase excess supplies of UST if there’s a drop in value in exchange for Terra’s native governance token LUNA.    Read more: The Quest for a Truly Decentralized Stablecoin    UST’s stability has led to a Terra boom, and investors are noticing the stablecoin. Earlier this year, Pantera Capital and Coinbase Ventures contributed to a $25 million funding round to help Terraform Labs build more UST-backed applications, like CHAI, a popular mobile payments dapp with over 2.5 million users in South Korea.      The explosion of decentralized finance (DeFi) has led to a scramble for a truly decentralized stablecoin that is capable of scaling. Stablecoin projects like Tether’s USDT, the first successful stablecoin and still by far the largest, led to DeFi, but centralization has mired USDT in years of legal trouble. According to Terra’s founder and CEO, Do Kwon, other decentralized stablecoins like MakerDAO’s DAI are capital intensive and have thus struggled with scalability.    Read more: Terra’s 25-Fold Price Jump This Year Shows Growing Bet on Algorithmic Stablecoins    TerraUSD, now the fifth-largest stablecoin with a $2 billion market cap, aims to solve the problem. Kwon hopes UST will become the inter-chain stablecoin of choice.      The Ecosystem Fund will be used to develop projects in Terra’s DeFi ecosystem. Most of the projects currently being built on Terra are decentralized protocols and other applications aiming for mainstream adoption using Terra’s stablecoins. Terraform Labs will allocate the funds over the course of two years.      “We’re thrilled to have the continued support of many long-time, early investors in the Terra ecosystem,” Kwon wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “We’re delighted to offer the Ecosystem Fund as an opportunity for builders, entrepreneurs and our community to supercharge the Terra economy and build something extraordinary.”",POSITIVE,LUNA | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | USDT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/07/16/terra-attracts-150m-for-defi-ecosystem-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66a065c348d0ed391405e8ff4b3cded139f35c36-1177x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406967,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hTU,1626449501,Tether Hasn’t Printed New USDT in Weeks: 3 Possible Explanations,"The money printer has gone quiet.      The parabolic growth in the market cap of stablecoin giant tether (USDT) suddenly came to a grinding halt at the end of May, just as bitcoin’s price was coming off its all-time highs. With bitcoin trading in a range of roughly between $30,000 and $40,000 ever since, a new round of chatter has been circulating linking the two events and echoing an old conjecture: Did Tether stop pumping up the price of bitcoin?      According to analysts and market participants who spoke to CoinDesk, however, the sudden pause of tether printing has instead revealed that the most traded cryptocurrency in the world is seeing its dominance threatened by three unprecedented challenges combining in a perfect storm to rattle the stablecoin: Trouble in its biggest geographic market has made it hard for traders there to buy USDT with fiat. One of USDT’s most promising competitors appears to be gaining market share. And regulatory pressure around the world is increasing.      An executive from Tether, while acknowledging the demand for USDT has fallen, argued that the trend is not exclusive to the token.      “Demand for tether ebbs and flows, and has been impacted by lower demand in recent weeks,” Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer at Tether, said in a written response via a spokesperson, noting that USDT is not the only stablecoin that has seen reduced demand.    China’s crackdown on crypto    The crypto crackdown in China – both on bitcoin mining and trading – has hurt bitcoin’s prices, which are now down by 52% to around $31,000 from their all-time high at $64,928.14 in April.      But another victim of China’s renewed crypto crackdown is USDT, the stablecoin whose success can be largely attributed to its dominance among Chinese traders and investors. They routinely use the dollar-pegged stablecoin as an on-ramp to crypto markets through over-the-counter (OTC) brokers because fiat-to-crypto trading or buying digital assets with government-issued cash remains illegal in the country.      Last month, Chinese police arrested more than 1,000 people on money-laundering charges, alleging they used crypto to help them evade the law. Such action against OTC merchants may help explain why USDT’s growth has slowed significantly in China.      “It is extremely difficult to [go] on and off ramp in China [to crypto,]” Annabelle Huang, a partner at Hong Kong-based crypto asset manager Amber Group, said. “A lot of the OTC merchants have stopped deals.”      With bitcoin struggling to move above its current range of $30,000-$35,000, there is also no incentive for new cash in China to enter the crypto market.      “Tether’s market in Asia is mostly through OTC merchants, and with less cash going into the market, there is less demand for tether,” Rachel Lin, former vice president and founding partner at Singapore-based crypto investment firm Matrixport, said.      Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel recently told CoinDesk that it cut its interest rates for USDT deposits because of weak demand for the stablecoin.      A spokesperson for Babel, however, would not say why demand has decreased recently.      It seems China’s crackdown on crypto-related money-laundering activities remains ongoing. A report from South China Morning Post late Wednesday says that Hong Kong customs has shut down a local money-laundering syndicate that used crypto – specifically USDT – to process illegal funds worth about $155 million, the first crackdown of its kind in the city.      The news in Hong Kong “could pressure any Singapore and Hong Kong desks to reconsider trading USDT/USD [pairs],” Dan Burke, managing director of institutional sales in Asia-Pacific at BitGo, a custodian of digital assets, said.    USDC on the rise    While demand for USDT appears to have dried, the rising star of the stablecoin market is increasingly USDC, another dollar-pegged stablecoin powered by crypto financial services firm Circle.      Boston-based Circle recently announced its plan to go public using a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), not long after it revealed its goal to expand USDC to at most 10 more blockchains outside Ethereum.      Tron, a blockchain helmed by crypto influencer Justin Sun, is among the blockchains that recently started supporting USDC, and according to Circle’s website; one of the goals of doing so is “enabling [USDC] growth in Asia and around the globe.”      As it stands, there is more USDT on Tron than on Ethereum as traders in Asia favor blockchains that provide faster and cheaper transactions. That makes USDC’s entry to Tron a more enticing proposition.      “I think USDC has a chance to compete in the stablecoin market in Asia against tether,” Sun told CoinDesk. “I feel like right now the stablecoin market in Asia is in need of a diversified infrastructure and clients in Asia are looking for more stablecoin options.”      According to Lin, unlike USDT, which is largely relying on the OTC channel, USDC can be easily purchased by investors in Asia thanks to the human-intensive customer service offered by Circle, the company that operates the stablecoin business.      “Doing business with USDC is very upfront,” Lin said. “They usually have a manager to work with you by email communications once you submit the required documents.”      It may be too early to conclude whether USDC can beat USDT’s dominance in Asia, but USDC is already winning in another white-hot sector in crypto: decentralized finance.      Nearly 50% of USDC supply is currently locked in smart contracts compared with tether’s 20%, according to data from Glassnode.      “USDC is increasingly being used for on-chain and payments use cases, which continue to grow,” Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, said. “Whereas USDT is primarily used for inter-exchange settlement and margin for derivatives, use cases which have pulled back as the market has calmed.”    Crypto bears vs. tether’s vulnerability    One of the lingering problems of USDT – its reputation within the crypto community – is a third obstacle the world’s largest stablecoin by asset size is facing.      “The market is infused with bearish sentiment and traders are looking for a reason,” said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at crypto prime broker Genesis Global Trading. “It's FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) season, and tether's vulnerabilities are almost always a part of that conversation.”      According to Acheson, the market is “starved” for explanations about why the price is so “listless” and USDT is a perfect target as long as the company behind the dollar-pegged stablecoin remains murky about its reserves. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      More questions have been raised recently by regulators and governments around the world about USDT and other stablecoins. Testifying before the U.S.. House of Representatives' Committee on Financial Services Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell addressed a question from Rep. Anthony Gonzalez (R-OH) about Tether’s assets, which, according to its disclosure in May, was nearly half made up of unspecified commercial paper.      “Commercial papers are short-term overnight obligations from companies, and most of the time they’re investment grade, most of the time they’re very liquid, it’s all good,” Powell said. But in the face of crises, “the market just disappears. And that’s when people will want their money. It’s very simple: These are economic activities very similar to bank deposits and money market funds, and they need to be regulated in comparable ways.”      Some of that bearish sentiment infused with regulatory concerns is reflected in the growth of the USDC/USDT trading pair on the Binance exchange. The trading pair is currently the most active one in the spot market to include the USDC stablecoin. In other words, Binance’s traders are swapping between USDC and USDT, potentially for a bet that USDT’s price will go down or at least because they find more utility in USDC      Some traders could be “borrowing USDT and swapping for USDC,” said Hassan Bassiri, vice president at Los Angeles-based asset management firm Arca. “You know USDC is worth $1, so you borrow USDT by swapping for USDC. If USDT isn’t fully backed, you can use USDC to buy back the USDT at a price lower than $1.”      To be sure, a counter-narrative for the increased trading volume in the USDC/USDT pair on Binance is that many small-cap tokens available on Binance only have trading pairs with USDT, said Lin, the ex-Matrixport VP.      Indeed, AXS, the latest hot token from Axie Infinity that hit a record high Wednesday, is available on Binance with trading pairs with USDT, Binance USD (BUSD) and BNB, according to CoinGecko, while there are almost no AXS/USDC trading pairs available on centralized exchanges. The trading pair of USDC/BUSD is another popular trading pair on Binance involving USDC; it is just behind USDC/USDT, BTC/USDC, and ETH/USDC by trading volume in the past 24 hours.      If traders are shorting USDT, they are doing so in response to FUD, Bassiri said. However, he dismissed concerns around the stablecoin.      “USDT is fine [and has] always been fine,” he said.",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,ASIA | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | USDC,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/16/tether-hasnt-printed-new-usdt-in-weeks-3-possible-explanations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/613d45cf32201db63a9f310255d6c4372b0f80ae-2560x1410.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406965,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8hQX,1626442344,Hard Forks Are Fan Fiction,"Bitcoin Cash is fan fiction. Or so I shall argue. So are Bitcoin SV and Ethereum (or maybe Ethereum Classic). According to writer and philosopher Craig Warmke, the Bitcoin network is a story about the movement of a fictional substance – bitcoin – across addresses. If that’s true, we can make sense of what hard forks are: They’re fan fiction of that story. And the same is true of other cryptocurrencies.    Crypto Questioned is a forum to discuss the ideas and philosophies that drive the cryptocurrency industry.Bradley Rettler is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wyoming. He is co-authoring a book on Bitcoin as a tool to resist corporate and state overreach.  Hard forks    A hard fork occurs when there’s a change in the protocol of a blockchain-based currency. But not just any change will create a hard fork. Four things need to happen. First, the changes have to be such that some blocks that are valid according to the new rules are not valid according to the old rules. Second, the new rules have to mark the old blocks as valid in order to continue the chain. Third, there must be such a block; a fork will not occur until the new version of the software adds a block that the old version wouldn’t add because it’s invalid. Fourth, there must be old versions of the software still running. If a protocol changes and expands the rules but literally everyone moves to it, then there’s no fork.      Suppose a Bitcoin hard fork has happened. We are left with two blockchains – let’s call them “A” and “B” – that share a history up to block height n but have different blocks at height n+1. It’s overwhelmingly likely, then, that A and B differ with respect to what they say about how much bitcoin is at some addresses. That is, A is saying of Bitcoin that there is a UTXO of x size at y address and B does not say that. And so, given the fixed supply of bitcoin, what B says is contradictory to what A says; there’s an implicit “That’s all” clause at the end of each blockchain, meaning that there is no bitcoin at any address that isn’t mentioned in the blockchain.      So, after a hard fork, we are almost certainly left with two blockchains that make incompatible claims about where some of the bitcoin is. Supposing that Warmke is right about the nature of Bitcoin, we should say that one of the blockchains is a fan fiction of the other one.    Fan Fiction    Fan fiction is fiction, written by a fan, about the thing they are a fan of. There’s fan fiction for ""Harry Potter,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""My Little Pony"" and nearly every other moderately popular work of fiction you can think of. In essence, fan fiction starts from canon and then either adds to it or transforms it. That, of course, requires canon; fan fiction that starts from nothing is just fiction. The existence of a canon, then, requires rules – rules for when something is canon and when it’s not.      The rules may be about the permissible authors or about permissible content, or both. Fan fiction can become part of the canon, perhaps by an authority pronouncing it so (as in Andy Weir’s “Lucero,” a fan fiction of Ernest Cline’s novel ""Ready Player One"" that Cline declared to be canon). Perhaps more surprisingly, canon can also become fan fiction, as when the ""Star Wars Extended Universe"" was de-canonized by Disney – something it may also do with aspects of the Marvel canon.    Read more: Bitcoin Is Batman    So there must be some rules about what counts as canon. There also must be rules about what can be fan fiction. If you intend to write a ""Harry Potter"" fan fiction where Harry is not magical but was rather a 30-year-old dentist in America and bears no other resemblance to the stories, you haven’t written fan fiction; you’ve written fiction. It’s impossible to pin down exactly how similar the story has to be to count as fan fiction, but there must be some overlap of properties of some characters, and the fan fiction must add properties to the characters; copying a chapter from the novel verbatim doesn’t count as fan fiction.    Hard forks as fan fiction    Fan fiction comes about as a way of changing or adding to the canon by changing or adding properties that an original character didn’t have. Similarly, Bitcoin hard forks come about as a way of changing or adding to the Bitcoin blockchain by changing or adding properties to the Bitcoin protocol.      The result in the case of fan fiction is either a story incompatible with the canon (because properties are changed) or a story about which the canon is silent (because properties are added but none are changed or removed). The fan fiction will say different things about the activities and nature of the characters than the canon does. The result in the case of Bitcoin is a blockchain that is incompatible with the canon because properties are changed. The forked blockchain will say different things about the movement of bitcoin across addresses – and thus which addresses have bitcoin and how much – than the canon.      Some fan fiction changes the story: What if Luke had been raised by Obi-Wan? What if Hermione and Luna were lovers? What if Eddard Stark had become king? Some fan fiction adds to the story, by either adding to the backstory or adding to the end: What was James and Lily Potter’s relationship like? What happened after Wade got control of the OASIS?      Hard forks change the protocol: What if a Bitcoin block could be 2 megabytes instead of 1 megabyte? What would happen if the Bitcoin block size was 2mb AND Bitcoin never adopted SegWit? I wonder what it would be like if we let miners decide how big the blocks they mine could be … What if we tried to make it harder for application-specific integrated circuits to mine and easier for graphics processing units to mine and we pre-mined 100,000 coins?      These thoughts and ideas are incompatible with the Bitcoin canon. And so if someone starts running a protocol that changes them, they are making claims about the movement and location of bitcoin (the fictional substance) that are incompatible with the canon. They are, quite literally, fan fiction.      Some fan fictions are more popular than the originals. That is the case in cryptocurrencies, as well. ETH is a hard fork from ETC that restored stolen ETH to those from whom it was stolen; ETC kept building on the chain that kept the block with the stolen transactions. In this case, at least by market cap, people prefer the hard fork. That is (if I’m right), they prefer the fan fiction.    Read more: Why Bitcoin Needs Philosophy    But maybe you think that ETH is canon, and ETC is fan fiction. Maybe we need meta-rules about the canon, such that sometimes the canon changes and the fan fiction is what keeps the story the same. In the Sherlock Holmes universe, Watson’s war injury is once described as being in his leg, and later in his arm. This is canon, but it’s inconsistent. A fan fiction that began immediately after the book in which it’s in his leg would be more consistent than the actual Holmes canon. But that wouldn’t by itself make it canon.      Usually the original work is more popular than the fan fiction. The whole reason there is fan fiction of a work is because people like the original work. They see value in it. So it would be surprising for some readers to write a more popular story of the characters than the original author who provided the reason to write fan fiction in the first place. This seems to be what has happened with Bitcoin, and the number of hard forks off Bitcoin and Bitcoin’s hard forks. Each successive hard fork tends to be less popular (by market cap) than the currency off of which it forked.",NEGATIVE,ETC,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | MARKET | FORKS,Bradley Rettler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/07/16/hard-forks-are-fan-fiction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/031236f0e5787d7bda02e4bb0e7c1fb3c0d67799-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of XRP's price is expected to cross below the 200-day SMA in the next day or two, confirming the so-called bearish death cross. While in theory the pattern implies a deeper sell-off, historical data suggests otherwise.      Previous occurrences observed in early February this year, March 2020, August 2019, April 2018, January 2017 and May 2016 marked major or interim price bottoms. One in May 2014 brought immediate selling pressure to the market.      Death cross' dismal record as a reliable indicator is hardly surprising, as moving-average studies are based on backward-looking data. In other words, death crosses are the result of a prolonged sell-off and have limited predictive powers. More often than not, the market is oversold by the time the crossover happens.      The previous bearish crossovers (above left) were accompanied by an oversold, or below-30, reading on the relative strength index (RSI).      This time, however, the RSI is biased bearish. So, the possibility of the death cross inviting stronger chart-driven selling cannot be ruled out.      Immediate support is at the June 22 low of $0.51, followed by $0.43, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the December to April bull run. The June 29 high of $0.73 is the level to beat for the bulls.

The embattled exchange said the move will allow it to focus on other products.      Binance introduced its stock token service in April, enabling customers to buy fractions of shares in companies, starting with Tesla and followed quickly by Coinbase. MicroStrategy, Microsoft and Apple were added shortly thereafter.      It did not take long for regulators to raise their eyebrows, with the financial watchdogs of the U.K. and Germany expressing concern in the following weeks.      The backlash against Binance has come to a head in recent weeks, with regulatory bodies around the world issuing warnings that the crypto exchange is not licensed to offer regulated services in their markets, including the U.K. and Japan.      The most recent warning came from Hong Kong, whose markets regulator announced today that Binance is not registered to operate in its jurisdiction.      CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao addressed Binance's woes in an open letter July 7, calling compliance a ""journey"" and spoke of the need for ""clearer regulatory frameworks"" in response to the wider adoption of crypto.

The PBOC also said for the first time that the CBDC will be compatible with smart contracts.  The total number of transactions was 70.75 million, spread among almost 21 million personal wallets and 3.5 million enterprise wallets, the central bank said in a white paper.  Digital yuan wallets will be tiered based on the amount of personal information provided, the central bank said. The tiers will determine transaction and balance limits.  Users will be able to open ""least-privileged"" wallets by default, without providing any personal information, and later upgrade them to unlock features.  The central bank also offered details on the trials planned for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.  Unmanned vans, self-service vending machines, unmanned supermarkets, payment gloves, payment badges, Winter Olympics payment clothing, and other wearable devices will be deployed at the global sports event, it said.  The paper assessed that the basic design of the digital yuan is in place. Authorities will continue existing trials across the country, and launch new ones.  Trials for the digital yuan started over a year ago and were initially restricted to four cities – Chengdu, Shenzhen, Suzhou and Xiong'an – and were accessible only to whitelisted individuals.  They later opened to the public through lotteries in the four cities, and expanded to more cities, including Shanghai and Beijing.

A drop below the $31,000 daily support level may result in a deeper drawdown to $28,600 based on June 22's prior low.  Low volume, as indicated in Thursday's four-hour view, is consistent with a lack of trading interest in the short-term.
