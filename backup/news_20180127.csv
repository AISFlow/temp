42400944,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTEn,1517096580,Tether Confirms Its Relationship With Auditor Has 'Dissolved',"Tether, the issuer of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency USDT, said its relationship with audit firm Friedman LLP has ended.  The statement, provided Saturday evening by a company spokesperson to CoinDesk, confirms the suspicions of online sleuths and is likely to raise new questions about the company's finances.  Friedman had been working on an audit of Tether, which has close ties to the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Critics of the two companies, most prominently the blogger who goes by the handle Bitfinex'd, have claimed that Tether had been printing tokens out of thin air to drive up the price of bitcoin on the exchange.  It is not clear from the spokesperson's emailed statement who broke up with whom. The statement reads:  ""We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved. Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame. As Tether is the first company in the space to undergo this process and pursue this level of transparency, there is no precedent set to guide the process nor any benchmark against which to measure its success.""  The company remains ""committed to the process,"" the spokesperson added.  Eagle-eyed cryptocurrency enthusiasts on Twitter had raised doubts about the status of the relationship last week, noting that Friedman had dropped Bitfinex's name from the list of clients on the audit firm's website. Friedman did not return calls and emails from CoinDesk over the course of the week.  In a preliminary report released in September, Friedman said Tether had $442.9 million of cash on reserve, matching the outstanding issuance of USDT – but that assessment was not a full audit and contained numerous caveats.

42400955,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTQb,1517056291,A Haven for Blockchain: The Case for Wyoming,"Rep. Tyler Lindholm is a rancher in Sundance, Wyoming, and a Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives. Caitlin Long, a Wyoming native, is former chairman and president of Symbiont and a former managing director of Morgan Stanley.      Wyoming is stepping up to welcome the blockchain community with open arms.  A grassroots group, the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, has garnered significant momentum to pass a package of legislation that would bring significant benefits to both the blockchain community and the State of Wyoming.  The package of blockchain bills, which will be introduced during the upcoming session in February, will build on two characteristics of Wyoming that make it particularly attractive to the blockchain industry: zero corporate income or franchise taxes, and strict privacy laws governing LLCs formed in the state.  Companies don't need to move to Wyoming physically to take advantage, just as most Delaware corporations aren't located in Delaware. But but there are real reasons why businesses might want to move there. Cheyenne, the state capital, has tremendous fiber-optic bandwidth and cheap power that is already attracting major data centers to locate there, for example.  And our initiative has active support by officials at the state’s only university. So Wyoming has “good bones” upon which to build a regulatory framework to attract the blockchain sector.  Licensing exemptions  The blockchain community is likely to be most excited by one of the bills just introduced, H.B.0070, which would exempt tokens issued on an open blockchain from Wyoming's money transmitter and securities laws, as long as the token has not been marketed as an investment and is exchangeable for goods or services. This bill would also exempt token exchanges (or people exchanging tokens) from being deemed broker/dealers under Wyoming law. The bill has garnered senior co-sponsors, including the Speaker of the House.  As always, whether a token would be considered, under Wyoming law, either a security or exempt pursuant to the new legislation, would be a facts-and-circumstances analysis. Businesses should seek their own legal counsel.  We view non-securities blockchain tokens as a new asset class that is neither money nor securities, and therefore believe existing money transmitter and securities regulations should not apply.  In many cases, for example, such blockchain tokens are simply prepaid software licenses. If tradeable gift cards and prepaid cell phone minutes are not regulated as money or securities, why should prepaid software licenses fall into those categories?  In many states, they do. In Wyoming, they should not, and we are optimistic that the legislature will agree.  Wyoming's consumers will be protected by its strong anti-fraud and consumer protection laws, which we believe are sufficient to deter bad actors from doing business in the state. And businesses should analyze whether federal securities laws would still apply.  Other measures  The Wyoming Blockchain Coalition also supports two other bills as part of the package for the February session.  The so-called ""bitcoin bill,"" H.B.0019, proposes to exempt virtual currencies from Wyoming’s money transmitter laws. Alone, this legislation will allow businesses that pulled out of Wyoming in 2015, such as Coinbase, to operate in Wyoming. This will add a vital new industry to the State’s financial sector. It, too, has garnered many co-sponsors, including the President of the Senate.  The third bill, the so-called ""filings bill,"" would enable the Secretary of State to collect registrations on a blockchain, similar to that enacted by the State of Delaware last July. It would cover the filings made for corporations, LLCs and UCC financing statements. The goal of this legislation is to allow the official record of ownership and the official record of changes of ownership to exist on a blockchain. Eventually this will allow the State, counties, municipalities and businesses to eliminate paper trails such as deeds, titles and receipts.  LLC City  Wyoming led the way when it passed the nation's first LLC law in 1977, and it can again be first by offering the ability to register LLCs on a blockchain. This could attract meaningful business to register in Wyoming, as academic research shows that nearly two-thirds of new companies that register in the U.S. are LLCs.  New types of LLC users, such as those seeking to limit liability for autonomous cars and other internet of things (IoT) devices, could be attracted to efficiencies enabled by blockchain-registered Wyoming LLCs. This is especially true for series LLCs, which is another initiative supported by the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition.  LLCs are so popular in Wyoming today that there is almost one for every two citizens of the state.  Wyoming can become a haven for the blockchain sector, building on its already-attractive attributes, if the package of blockchain bills are enacted. The bills provide tremendous benefits for blockchain businesses that either locate or register in Wyoming, as well as significant upside to the State. We welcome the blockchain community’s support in bringing these efforts to fruition.  As we say in Wyoming, let 'er buck!

42421805,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXunz3,1517050212,The Opportunity for Interoperable Chains of Chains,"Kyle Samani is co-founder and Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital, a thesis-driven crypto fund that invests exclusively in crypto assets.      Today, blockchain interoperability is virtually non-existent.  If you want to move value across chains, you must do so by moving tokens into a centralized exchange, trade on the exchange's in-house ledger and then withdraw the new asset on a new chain. This process is slow, expensive and involves substantial counterparty risk.  Fundamentally, there are two types of chain interoperability:  Relaying messages about the state of one chain to another. This includes synthetic tokens (AKA one-to-one pegs, two-way pegs, or sidechains).  Cross-chain atomic swaps. The exchange of tokens between users across chains, without trusting a third-party.  A number of high-profile projects such as Polkadot and Cosmos are vying to be the meta ""blockchain of blockchains."" Each of these systems has a native staking token that validators must stake in order to perform work for their respective networks.  Another chain of chains, Block Collider, proposes a radically different technical mechanism to achieve many of the same functions.  Building on insights drawn from Vitalik Buterin's excellent paper on chain interoperability, I'll walk through both of the functions above and highlight that the largest opportunity for these systems is message relaying. Cross-chain atomic swaps can be accomplished trustlessly without dedicated chain of chain systems.  Cross-chain messaging  Cross-chain messaging is fundamentally a question of trust: How does one design a system to trustlessly relay messages between chains?  This is especially difficult given what I'll refer to as orphan chain risk: if a service relays the state of Chain A to Chain B, but it turns out that the relayer was on a fork of Chain A that is ultimately orphaned (either benignly or maliciously), then the relayed message to Chain B is invalid.  If one is relaying messages to issue synthetic tokens across chains, this would result in cross-chain double spends, which is unacceptable. Accommodating the perpetual ""what if the relayer is on an orphaned fork"" risk is by far the greatest challenge in message-relaying systems.  Cosmos and Polkadot address the orphaned-chain problem through two mechanisms. First, using the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, they store Merkle-ized block headers for each cross-chain transaction. Building on a history of Merkle-ized block headers, Cosmos/Polkadot maintain global invariant balances of the total supply of each token. Together these mechanisms prevent cross-chain double spends.  It would be nice if systems such as Oraclize could relay messages between chains. But these kinds of systems don’t account for the orphaned chain problem.  If we look out into the future, it’s possible to envision a time in which the orphaned chain problem is solved by the sending chain itself. How? By leveraging finality in proof-of-stake (PoS) based systems. This is the explicit purpose of Casper FFG, which is in alpha now. However, it's unclear how fast finality can be given tradeoffs in parametrizing such a PoS system.  Even with a finality guarantee, there are still other challenges.  We're currently witnessing a Cambrian explosion of blockchain innovation. This is likely to continue for the next few years at a minimum. Given the number of new chains that are emerging, each chain will be required to store and validate Merkle-ized block headers of every other chain with which it communicates.  Each blockchain could become bloated with blockheaders of every other chain. Using a bridge chain reduces the bloat per chain from a function of n! to to a function of n.  While I'd like to see a future in which blockchains communicate directly with one another without an intermediary chain, this seems highly unlikely. This problem is compounded by the fact that systems such as bitcoin may never move off of proof-of-work (PoW) consensus and towards PoS consensus with guaranteed finality.  If you project out far enough, it seems possible that intermediary chains will become superfluous, but that future is still unclear. For the foreseeable future – at least a few years – Cosmos/Polkadot have a real opportunity to become the backbone powering cross-chain messaging.  Cross-chain atomic swaps  The first cross-chain atomic swap recently occurred between Litecoin and Decred.  These are both chains that don't support Turing-complete programming languages. Cross-chain atomic swaps will be technically easier to implement between general-purpose smart contract platforms. It will take another one or two years for these libraries to mature and become widely adopted, but they will. There aren't many technical questions remaining.  The other major challenge with cross-chain atomic swaps is price discovery and order matching. That's where decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as 0x and OmiseGo come into play. OmiseGo is fully decentralized, meaning that the order book lives on chain.  In 0x, orders are hosted by relayers (centralized entities), who then submit matched orders to the chain for settlement.  If the market ultimately demands DEXs to be fully decentralized – including on-chain order books – then systems like OmiseGo will be necessary for cross-chain atomic swaps to function. However, given the intrinsic limitations of on-chain order books (settlement time, miner front-running, miner griefing, etc), I believe that the 0x model will prevail for the foreseeable future.  Although 0x only works within the ethereum ecosystem today, the 0x roadmap includes cross-chain* support (it will likely leverage much of the tech built in the Litecoin-Decred proof of concept for Scrypt based chains). 0x relayers will host order books for price discovery, and will relay messages between chains to trigger the release of funds from the escrow on each chain. This should offer many of the best elements of decentralization (no counterparty risk) and centralization (speed, order matching), with minimal trust guarantees (only that the relayer actually relays the messages to both chains).  On-chain DEXs are theoretically possible.  However, given the limitations they face, the intrinsic network effects of liquidity in order books, time-to-market and go-to-market advantages, and minimal trust guarantees of a 0x relayer, I contend that the 0x model will prevail, leaving little opportunity** for Cosmos/Polkadot/Block Collider-based DEXs.  Conclusion  With the Cosmos launch approaching in the next month or two, we're about to witness a huge hype cycle about the opportunity for an internet of blockchains. Systems like Cosmos solve fundamental cross-chain communication problems, but aren’t necessarily the answer to all cross-chain communication challenges.  It's paramount to recognize that not everything these systems can do actually needs to be done by a chain of chains. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, expect more diversity in trust models, relayers, and solutions broadly.  * Note: Cross-chain atomic swaps are only possible if both chains offer a native escrow function. This requires bitcoin-esque script functions at a minimum. Some chains, such as IOTA and sia, for example, don’t support on-chain trustless escrows at all, and as such cannot implement trustless cross-chain atomic swaps.  ** One of the greatest limitations of cross-chain atomic swaps is settlement time. By definition, these transactions can only settle as fast as the block time of the slower of the two chains. Block Collider’s system allows for settlements that are theoretically even faster than the block times of either chain. Enabling cross-chain swaps to settle more quickly than the block times of either chain is a pretty wild idea. Given how slow bitcoin blocks are, Block Collider could carve out an interesting niche.
