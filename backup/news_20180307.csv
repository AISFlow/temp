Christopher Giancarlo said Wednesday.  Speaking during a U.S. House of Representatives committee hearing on his agency's forthcoming budget, Giancarlo said he has spoken about the issue with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), as well as regulators in Europe, according to Forbes.  The collaboration has seen the CFTC working with domestic agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as officials in the Treasury Department, which earlier this year detailed the work being done by a group focused on enforcement issues.  Giancarlo's reported comments are notable, given the proactive approaches that have been taken by these agencies, with the CFTC itself scoring a win this week when a U.S. district judge ruled that cryptocurrencies are commodities on Tuesday – all but confirming the position it staked out back in 2015.  The hearing notably featured a critique by Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) on the attention paid by the CFTC to cryptocurrency issues, which she argued weakens other, more developed markets. Giancarlo responded that would-be investors, particularly young ones, face risks that warrant attention.

42380424,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NbXZ,1520456434,Messari Raises Seed Funding for ICO Answer to EDGAR,"Messari, the startup aiming to create the crypto-equivalent of Crunchbase or the SEC's EDGAR system, has raised a new seed funding round.  A number of industry firms backed the round – the exact amount of which wasn't disclosed – including Anthemis Group, Blockchain Capital, CoinFund, Digital Asset Investment Company, Danhua Capital, Kindred Ventures, Rising Tide, Semantic Ventures, SparkLabs Global and Underscore Venture Capital.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Messari is envisioned as a database for crypto-assets, with the idea being that the open-source tool would nudge the ecosystem closer toward self-regulation. CEO Ryan Selkis said that the funds will be used to build out the startup's development resources, with an eye to begin testing its first product as early as the second quarter of this year.  Notably, while Selkis did not rule out the idea of a token sale, he told CoinDesk that Messari would focus on developing its product in the short-term, citing regulatory uncertainty around token projects.  ""We don't want to pigeonhole ourselves until we have a better idea,"" he said. As a result, the beta project he expects to be released in the next few months will not incorporate a token.  The information stored will include a project's funding figures, development history, governance structure and supply schedules.  ""We're going to crowd-source as much information on these token projects as possible, but that only gets us so far,"" he explained. ""The second stage is when we think about enforceability, and how we can create social pressure or maybe legitimate regulatory pressure on projects to abide by certain standards and report on an ongoing basis.""  Ultimately, the goal is to automate that reporting process, setting up tools for investors to more easily research a project and its associated token.

42380432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Nbdr,1520452844,Bitmain Wants to Invest in Blockchain-Powered 'Central Banks',"Bitcoin mining hardware giant Bitmain announced Wednesday that it intends to invest in as many as thirty startups working to create ""private central banks"" powered by blockchain.  Co-founder Jihan Wu gave the first keynote address at the DC Blockchain Summit, hosted by the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Georgetown University's Center for Financial Markets and Policy. During his remarks, Wu examined the differences between central banks that back fiat currencies and the growing plethora of cryptocurrencies worldwide.  Perhaps most notably, his presentation ended with the revelation that Bitmain wants to invest in 20 to 30 startups that would bridge those two worlds, arguing that private central banks – distinct from institutions like the Federal Reserve, which is technically private but is linked to the U.S. government – ""are better at creating more convenient user experiences of consumers.""  Wu explained:  ""We at Bitmain are very interested in private central bank startups that are going to use blockchain technology to issue private currencies and set it as a service, in a legal way. We would like to invest in 20 to 30 startups whose efforts are focused on this unique emerging economy.""  He also argued that such ventures are potentially lucrative, highlighting the income earned by the Fed and noting that ""we all know that a central bank is a very profitable business.""  The statements reveal the widening ambitions of the company, which is also looking into applications in the area of artificial intelligence, as previously reported by Quartz. The central bank-focused push also comes as Bitmain reportedly looks to grow its mining footprint, with an eye to expanding in Canada.  On markets and regulation  The startup investment announcement came at the tail end of Wu’s speech, which otherwise focused on a number of topics, from economist Friedrich Hayek to token-powered incentivization.  Notably, he challenged the idea that the cryptocurrency market would consolidate around a few significant coins, pointing to the fast growth experienced by some networks.  ""The fact is that bitcoin's dominance has been declining and we see that lots of other cryptocurrencies like ether and dash grow very fast, and you just cannot explain if you think the theory is right that the market will consolidate,"" he remarked.  Indeed, Wu argued that there is no one ""perfect"" cryptocurrency, and as a result, there's demand for numerous options within the market.  ""There's no perfect cryptocurrencies on the market, so the market will require more cryptocurrencies,"" he told attendees.  Wu also touched on the topic of regulation and tokens in particular – a notable topic given the recent chatter around rumored investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which on Wednesday stated that trading platforms offering exchange services for ICO-derived tokens would need to register with the government if the tokens in questions are deemed to be securities.  The Bitmain co-founder said that he thinks many of the tokens on the market today will fall under that definition.  ""Most tokens will very likely fall into the definition of a security and will be subject to the regulation of a security,"" he said, going on to argue:  ""But I believe regulators need to prepare a good answer on how to deal with such business innovations.""

UPDATE (7, March 20:10 UTC): Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the irregular trades have been identified, and will be reversed. He also warned users to learn how to secure their accounts against future phishing attacks.      Binance has reassured customers that their money is still in their accounts following hours of speculation that the cryptocurrency exchange had been hacked.  ""All funds are safe,"" Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao tweeted Wednesday afternoon.  Rumors that Binance has been hacked spread that morning after social media users reported seeing their balances at the exchange drained, sold at market rates and converted to viacoin. However, the exchange said its platform was not breached.  https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/971454040704872448  In its initial statement on Reddit, Binance said it was investigating these reports, announcing all withdrawals had been suspended but pushing back against claims that the platform was hacked.  “As of this moment, the only confirmed victims have registered API keys (to use with trading bots or otherwise). There is no evidence of the Binance platform being compromised,” the post said. “Please remain patient and we will provide an update as quickly as possible.”  Discussion on Reddit indicated that investors using trading bots may have fallen victim to stolen API keys, but it is unclear how widespread the issue was.  Viacoin became one of the few cryptocurrencies to rise on the day, jumping more than 40 percent to $3.53, according to data site CoinMarketCap. Similarly, it saw a tenfold spike in trading volume on the day, beginning at roughly the same time as the hack rumors.  Meanwhile, bitcoin has recovered from its intraday low of less than $9,500 to about $9,675 as of press time, and prices appear to have stabilized according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

Bannon alluded to both the financial and nonfinancial applications of blockchain, such as for managing personal data, on Tuesday at an event in Zurich sponsored by the Swiss newspaper Die Weltwoche.  During his lecture, part of a European speaking tour, he described cryptocurrency and blockchain technology as the “very heart” of a populist movement in Switzerland.  The former head of right-wing media outlet Breitbart, who helped Trump win the presidency in 2016 as the campaign's chief strategist, lauded the importance of decentralization when he said:  “Central banks are in the business of debasing your currency. Central governments are in the business of debasing your citizenship. The central technology conglomerates are in the business of debasing your own personal sovereignty and your own personal data.”  Bannon, a former member of the National Security Council, was dismissed from the White House in August 2017. During his brief tenure often criticized “financial elites,"" including those in Wall Street and Silicon Valley.  Now the former media mogul is calling cryptocurrency a perfect tool to escape the control of such elites. Bannon said:  “We take control of the central banks away. That will give us the power again...Once you take control of your currency, once you take control of your data, once you take control of your citizenship, that’s when you’re going to have true freedom.”  However, he went on to say the best way to “break” what he described as the globalized culture of economic oppression is with populist, nationalist movements like the one he popularized in the U.S.  His political rallying cries about cryptocurrency inspired resounding applause from the European audience.

CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) hit a low of $9,494.45 – representing a decline of more than $1,200 from the day's opening price of $10,709.53. The sharp drop is notable, considering that the cryptocurrency's price had risen above $10,800 earlier in the day.  At press time, bitcoin's price had recovered slightly, and was trading at $9,714.  While it's not entirely clear at this time what factors sparked the sell-off, the timing coincides with reports of unauthorized sells on cryptocurrency exchange Binance. The exchange has since suspended withdrawals, according to statements, with the situation coming less than a month after a prolonged system upgrade raised fears of a hack.  ""We are investigating reports of some users having issues with their funds. Our team is aware and investigating the issue as we speak,"" a representative wrote on Reddit Wednesday, adding:  ""As of this moment, the only confirmed victims have registered API keys (to use with trading bots or otherwise). There is no evidence of the Binance platform being compromised.""  Similarly, cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX announced that some users were having difficulty logging into its platform and that it was investigating the issue. BitMEX later reported that it was back online, citing a spike in load as the underlying cause.  Market data indicates that other cryptocurrencies are experiencing price declines as well. With the exception of monero, all of the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have fallen in excess of 10 percent in the past 24-hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

To that end, Jessel explained that while his focus will be on Kadena's private blockchain offerings, he is working with the team behind its public Chainweb network, which is expected to launch later this year.

To help in solving that puzzle, Kadena offers its clients access to the language behind its blockchain, simplifying the process to add to it.

42380426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NbTn,1520440240,Mt Gox Trustee Sells $400 Million in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash,"As much as $400 million in cryptocurrencies was sold in the past few months by the bankruptcy trustee of the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt Gox.  The details of the sale  were published on March 7 by trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi, revealing that JPY 42,988,044,343 – an amount worth roughly $405 million at press-time prices – was generated. According to the creditor report, the trustee liquidated 35,841.00701 BTC and 34,008.00701 in bitcoin cash.  As Kobayashi explained:  ""As a result of the consultation with the court, I considered it necessary and reasonable to sell a certain amount of BTC and BCC at this point and secure a certain amount of money for distribution resources, and thus, I sold the amount of BTC and BCC above. I made efforts to sell BTC and BCC at as high a price as possible in light of the market price of BTC and BCC at the timing of sale.""  Indeed, the amount roughly matches the number of claims made against Mt Gox, which collapsed in 2014 amid claims of insolvency. Hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin were lost at the time, though 200,000 BTC was later found amid the recovery efforts. The exchange's collapse triggered a global regulatory response, including in Japan, and CEO Mark Karpeles was ultimately charged with embezzlement and data manipulation, to which he pled not guilty last year.  Notably, wallets associated with the Mt Gox trustee saw significant withdrawals between December and February – the period in which they were sold – including 18,000 BTC that was moved on February 5. As CoinDesk previously reported, that day saw steep declines across all cryptocurrency markets, pushing prices down roughly 50% from their 2018 highs.  According to Kobayashi's report, additional liquidations could be coming, pending approval from the bankruptcy court.  ""I plan to consult with the court and determine further sale of BTC and BCC,"" he wrote.  As it stands, Kobayashi is in possession of 166,344.35827254 BTC – an amount worth $1.7 billion at press time – as well as about $197 million worth of bitcoin cash.

42380438,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Nbk9,1520439313,Report: Japanese Regulator Could Suspend Some Crypto Exchanges,"Japanese authorities are reportedly preparing to crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges by issuing ""administrative punishment notices"" to several and suspending others from doing business.  The move, which comes a few weeks after Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck was hacked, is a response to the country's Financial Services Agency discovering issues with exchanges’ customer protection and anti-money laundering procedures, according to Nikkei.  Specifically, Nikkei reportshttps://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Economy/Policy-Politics/Japanese-cryptocurrency-exchanges-to-be-hit-with-penalties that several exchanges had flawed processes, meaning they may allow money laundering or fail to ensure customers' funds remain safe.  It is unclear what exactly the punishments will be or which exchanges will receive the notices, according to Reuters.  That being said, Coincheck at least will likely receive a notice to raise its system’s standards, Nikkei reported, which would be the second time it would be told to do so.  The FSA investigated exchanges to evaluate their risk management and cryptocurrency storage methods over the last few weeks, but the results of these investigations have not been released.  The regulator looked into both licensed and unlicensed exchanges, asking them to self-report their security protocols. Last month, it inspected 15 unlicensed exchanges, as previously reported.  The FSA's efforts to more stringently regulate Japan's cryptocurrency exchanges started after Coincheck admitted to losing roughly 500 million NEM tokens from its digital wallets.

Prices fell to $779 earlier today, which is the lowest level since Feb. 8, as per data source CoinMarketCap.  The sharp price recovery seen last month ran out of steam at a high of $982 on Feb. 18. Ether has since depreciated by 19 percent.  The bad news for the bulls doesn't stop there, either, as the chart analysis indicates this could just be the beginning of an extended sell-off towards $700–$670.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  The retreat from the Monday's high of $866 has left another higher low near the descending trendline resistance, signaling continuation of the sell-off from the record high of $1,420.

View  ETH looks set to test $700 and could extend the drop to $676 (Dec. 28 low) over the next few weeks.  On the higher side, a break above the descending trendline (white dotted line) would signal bearish invalidation.

42380427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Nba5,1520431536,Comcast Makes First Big Bet on a Multi-Blockchain Future,"Comcast is banking on a world with multiple blockchains.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the venture arm of the telecommunications giant is leading a $3.3 million seed investment in Blockdaemon, a New York City-based startup that creates enterprise software for interacting with a wide range of blockchains.  While Blockdaemon has so far allowed its clients point-and-click deployment of R3's Corda, Hyperledger Fabric, Multichain and Quorum, the startup also revealed today it's widening support to include public blockchains as well.  With the introduction of software that lets enterprises quickly spin up and support nodes on bitcoin and ethereum, Comcast's investment in Blockdaemon is also part of a broader push to jumpstart enterprise blockchain innovation.  ""We think it can be a great business and we think it can fuel the growth of other blockchains,"" said Comcast Ventures managing director Gil Beyda. ""Maybe as a byproduct of our investment in Blockdaemon perhaps we'll see other companies using blockchain and looking for investment.""  The investment, which also saw participation from enterprise venture capital firm Boldstart Ventures and enterprise blockchain accelerator mState, is Comcast's first into a blockchain startup. It marks the beginning of what the company previously described as an ""aggressive"" push into enterprise blockchain investment.  While Comcast Ventures' strategy doesn't necessarily require that portfolio companies provide a direct service to its $170 billion parent company, in this case, Beyda hinted that several subsidiaries could benefit from Blockdaemon's products.  Beyda, who will be joining Blockdaemon's board of directors as part of the deal, told CoinDesk:  ""We have a lot of folks at Comcast and NBC Universal who are developing blockchain applications, and we thought it was brilliant that [Blockdaemon] came up essentially with blockchain as a service.""  More blockchains  While this so-called ""blockchain as a service"" functionality is not new, the public blockchain options reflect a new willingness among enterprises to explore the technology  As far back as 2016, companies such as Microsoft had helped coin the phrase ""blockchain as a service"" with the launch of its own blockchain sandbox with Azure cloud integration.  Similarly, Blockdaemon's blockchain support platform lets enterprises spin up fully supported nodes starting at $249 a month, with part of the recent venture capital investment being used to subsidize adoption of the bitcoin and ethereum platforms down to a rate of $14.99 a month.  Blockdaemon also plans to use the new capital to double the size of the company's engineering team from 10 to 20 in the next few months, resulting in a proportionate doubling of the corporate run-rate to about $100,000 a month.  While it may seem unlikely at this time that a major enterprise would – at least publicly – spin up a bitcoin or ethereum node, it's not entirely far-fetched.  Not only are more enterprises looking ethereum as a blockchain to build on, but Blockdaemon's CEO and founder, Konstantin Richter, pointed to another public blockchain, Stellar, as well. In October, IBM revealed the results of a partnership with Stellar that had the chip-maker using Stellar's custom cryptocurrency to settle real transactions.  As such, Richter hinted that a Stellar integration might be next.  ""Stellar is important for us,"" he said. ""Because we believe the Stellar ecosystem will be the ethereum of this year.""  Getting accelerated  As part of the investment, Blockdaemon has formally become the first participant of mState, an enterprise blockchain accelerator backed by Comcast and Boldstart, with technical and marketing support from IBM.  Throughout the three-month accelerator, Blockdaemon will be the first company to trial a bootcamp, of sorts, designed to ensure there's a product-market fit between the company and Fortune 500 firms exploring blockchain.  Mstate plans to invest in and host in five enterprise blockchain startups in the accelerator, which will offer lessons in pitching to enterprises, as well as provide access to a database of Fortune 500 leaders.  As revealed to CoinDesk, mState has assembled an enterprise blockchain Index that rates 300 companies using a proprietary system. While part of that index will be made available to the public, most of the metrics will be offered exclusively to mState members and other participants.  The enterprise accelerator will culminate in May with a ""speed dating"" round in New York, where Blockdaemon and the other participants will meet with 20 unnamed Fortune 500 companies interested in further exploring blockchain.  Mstate CEO Rob Bailey explained why increasing enterprise interest in blockchain marks a crucial shift in how the accelerator operates, concluding:  ""Getting that reality check from customers and what they're actually willing to pay for is an incredibly effective filter to be able to look at where we'll be deploying our capital and time.""

As of writing, litecoin (LTC) is changing hands at $194 and has depreciated by 5 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data source CoinMarketCap. The world's fifth largest cryptocurrency fell to $189 earlier today, the lowest level since Feb. 23.  LTC was solidly bid for a better part of the last month, rising as high as $252 on Bitfinex on Feb. 20. However, following the litecoin cash (LCC) hard fork, the bull run faltered and prices fell to a low of $182 on Feb. 23.  Subsequently, LTC saw its price range narrow, forming a series of lower highs and higher lows, which ended with a downside break yesterday. The drop to 12-day lows seen today is largely in line with the weakness seen in the broader market, however.  For instance, bitcoin has depreciated by nearly 3 percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ether and cardano have dropped at least 5 percent each.  The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies stands at $431 billion today – down 16.79 percent from the high of $518 billion see on Feb. 16.  Litecoin daily chart: A series of lower highs  The ""falling tops,"" or lower highs, (marked by red arrows) followed by a break below $200 suggests the bears have regained control. The relative strength index (RSI) has also dropped below 50.00 (bearish territory) and indicates there is scope for further losses.  Weekly chart: Recovery from Feb. 6 lows ended?  The previous two doji candles signaled indecision after a sharp rally from Feb. 6 low of $106. The outlook, as per the weekly chart, would turn bearish if the cryptocurrency ends this week below $181 (Feb. 23 low).  View  LTC looks set to extend the decline to $181 (Feb. 23 low) as indicated by the bearish set up on the daily chart.  A weekly close below $181 would open doors for a drop to $137 (Jan. 17 low).  On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above $210 (previous day's high) would signal bearish invalidation. Meanwhile, a bullish reversal is seen only above the descending trendline resistance (currently seen at $230).

In its latest patent application, released by China's State Intellectual Property Office on Tuesday, the Shenzhen-based technology firm details an invention that claims to add a verification feature to a peer-to-peer content distribution network powered by blockchain technology.  According to the filing, first submitted in August 2016, the system would store verification information for digital content on a blockchain. When parties initiate download requests over the peer-to-peer network, the system matches their private keys or licenses for accessing the content with the verification information.  Only if a consensus is reached in validating the request will the blockchain allow the download, the patent filing says. Huawei claims that the technology is, in essence, a way to guard intellectual property rights for digital content that is distributed over peer-to-peer networks.  Although it remains to be seen whether the application will be granted by the patent office, the filing marks a further effort by Huawei in moving to develop and adopt blockchain technology.  The company joined the Hyperledger blockchain consortium in October 2016, months after its patent submission. As reported by CoinDesk in January this year, the telecommunications firm is also among the early adopters of Hyperledger's Sawtooth software, for which the firm is currently developing a decompiler.

Although many have said they believe the agency is undertaking a sweep of the industry, one that could be focused on a particular type of token sale.  Only one person has admitted to receiving a subpoena, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, who raised $100 million to start crypto hedge fund, Arrington XRP Capital.  That said, over the course of a week, CoinDesk has repeatedly asked each project if they have received subpoenas. Statements, and even the absence of statements, from these issuers can be somewhat illuminating.  Direct answers  Of the 14 projects CoinDesk reached out to, only one directly answered questions regarding SEC subpoenas: Quoine.  A spokesperson for the issuer, which raised $108 million through the sale of its Qash token, said it had not been subject to a subpoena or a request for information.  While Bancor, which raised $153 million selling its BNT tokens, a spokesperson indicated it had ""nothing to report"" to CoinDesk, suggesting it had not received a subpoena.  And Overstock.com subsidiary tZero, which is still in the midst of its token raise targeting $250 million, confirmed that it is under investigation by the SEC, but did not receive a subpoena.  Instead, tZero said, it was ""willingly working"" with the SEC.  Kind of comments  Other than that, several issuers responded to CoinDesk with the infamous ""no comment"" comment.  TenX, which raised $80 million during its token sale, declined to comment via a spokesperson and so did Kik, which raised $98 million in its Kin token sale.  Kik's corporate development director, Tanner Philp, even sidestepped a question during the Blockchain for Business conference in Toronto on the subject, saying regulators are ""really trying to wrap their head around this whole ecosystem.""  He continued:  ""Kik as well as many others in the ecosystem are trying to be as collaborative as possible throughout this process, and are having active conversations with many people across the globe.""  Nabil Naghdy, the COO of Status, which raised $107 million for its Status Network Token, similarly dodged directly answering questions about receiving a subpoena.  Instead, Naghdy said, ""When we started with this technology there was more uncertainty than there is today, we had a duty to set high standards and narrow the scope of our offering, i.e. excluding the U.S. There are many projects that don't respect the technology, and a balanced regulatory body can protect consumers while enabling innovation.""  Brendan Blumer, CEO of Block.one, whose token sale for EOS is ongoing, with current estimates at $700 million, also said the company's token wasn't offered in the U.S. but did not respond directly about a subpoena.  And high-profile token issuer, Protocol Labs Founder Juan Benet, whose company raised $257 million from its Filecoin token sale, told CoinDesk, ""As a policy, we do not comment on legal questions that we have not explicitly decided to comment on beforehand. This is not specific to SEC, it’s very broad and comes from our legal team’s policies.""  Crickets  And that's it. The rest of the issuers CoinDesk contacted did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Those issuers included: Blockstack, which raised $50 million for its stax token; Opskins, which raised $68 million for its wax token; GameCredits, which raised $53 million for its mobilego token; Polkadot, which raised $145 million for its dot token; Sirin Labs, which raised $157 million for its srn token; and Tezos, which raised $232 million for its tezzie token.  According to Carol Van Cleef, CEO of decentralized technology solutions startup Luminous and a long-time crypto-interested attorney, ""Depending upon the nature of subpoena, they may or may not be at liberty to disclose that they received it.""  Although, since Arrington's admission, it's clear that not all the SEC subpoenas issued to ICO stakeholders have gag orders attached.  ""The choice of whether to disclose a subpoena is a matter of company policy,"" Van Cleef said, adding:  ""Depending upon the circumstances, it may be indicative of sensitive issues, but it also doesn't have to be an indication of issues for concern.""

42380439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Nbhd,1520419209,"Cryptos Are Commodities, Rules US Judge In CFTC Case","A U.S. district judge has backed the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in defining cryptocurrencies as commodities.  According to a Memorandum & Order for a court case that the CFTC had brought against cryptocurrency business operator Patrick Kerry McDonnell, Judge Jack Weinstein from a district court in New York ruled that ""virtual currencies can be regulated by CFTC as a commodity.""  ""Virtual currencies are 'goods' exchanged in a market for a uniform quality and value. ... They fall well within the common definition of 'commodity',"" the judge wrote in the order on Tuesday.  At issue in the case was whether the CFTC had the authority to regulate cryptocurrency as a commodity in the absence of federal level rules, and whether the law permitted the CFTC to ""exercise its jurisdiction over fraud that does not directly involve the sale of futures or derivative contracts,"" according to the document.  In both instances, Weinstein answered in the affirmative, meaning the case can be brought against the defendant.  The judge further granted a preliminary injunction barring the defendant from further engagement in cryptocurrency investment as the case continues.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the CFTC defined cryptocurrencies as commodities as far back as 2015, a decision that has led the agency to recently target cryptocurrency businesses that it considers are hoaxing investors.  In one of several cases filed in January this year, the CFTC sued McDonnell and his company CabbageTech for allegedly absconding with customers' digital assets.  The agency said at the time that McDonnell branded himself as a cryptocurrency investment expert with trading advice that could result in highly attractive returns on investment. Yet soon after customers sent in money and cryptocurrencies, the defendant allegedly misappropriated the funds, according to the case.

42401192,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxvb,1520416824,Bitcoin Eyes $10K After High Volume Drop,"Bitcoin is looking increasingly heavy and could test the $10,000 mark in the next 24 hours, according to the technical charts.  Having failed to cut through resistance around $11,600, the cryptocurrency witnessed a high volume drop below $11,000 yesterday. CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) closed (as per UTC) at $10,709 – its lowest for a week – and extended the losses to $10,435 today.  As of writing, the BPI is seen at $10,465 – down 9.5 percent from the high of $11,160 seen on Monday.  BTC's peers are also trading on the back foot. EOS is down 11.74 percent on a 24-hour basis and is the biggest loser among top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to data source CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, ether, Ripple's XRP, litecoin and bitcoin cash have all depreciated by at least 7 percent.  Price chart analysis indicates that bitcoin's 9.5 percent decline from the recent high has weakened the bulls and further losses could be in the offing.  Daily chart: Bullish trendline breakout failed  BTC closed above the descending trendline (drawn from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high) on March 4, indicating a bearish-to-bullish trend change.  However, the follow-through was hardly encouraging and the prices fell below the trendline yesterday, signaling a failed bullish breakout. Also, as seen in the above chart (prices as per Bitfinex), the break above $11,306 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement) was short-lived (marked by circles).  The cryptocurrency now appears to be creating a double top-like pattern with the neckline support of $9,280. 4 (Feb. 25 low), having also failed to take out the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance.  Clearly, the price action indicates the rally from the Feb. 6 low of $6,000 has made a temporary top around $11,600. The story does not end here, as the candlestick pattern and the moving averages favor a further drop in prices.  Daily chart: Bear doji reversal and a close below the 10-day MA  The above chart shows a bearish doji reversal, as represented by Monday's inverted bearish ""hammer"" pattern (also known as a shooting star) and Tuesday's negative follow-through (drop below $11,000) – all of which suggests the tables have turned in favor of the bears.  Furthermore, BTC closed below the 10-day moving average (MA) yesterday, signaling bullish invalidation.  1-hour chart: MAs favor the bears  The chart above shows:  A 50-MA and 100MA bearish crossover.  The 200MA has shed bullish bias (is flatlined).  The bias is clearly bearish.  View  BTC looks set to test 50-day MA at $10,171 and could possibly extend the decline to $10,000.  A daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would only add credence to the bearish setup detailed above (on the daily chart) and open the doors for a sell-off to $9,280 (Feb. 25 low) and $8,880 (200-day MA).  On the higher side, a high volume break above the previous day's high of $11,411 would indicate bearish invalidation.  Meanwhile, a big move above $11,600 would signal a long-term bearish-to-bullish trend change and allow stronger rise to $17,000.

42401186,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxoi,1520415004,Fujitsu Touts New Tech to Detect Ethereum Smart Contract Bugs,"Japanese IT giant Fujitsu has revealed a new technology that it says could help to mitigate problems with ethereum's smart contracts.  In a statement released Wednesday, Fujitsu said the new system aims to detect in advance the risks associated with a smart contract source code on ethereum. In effect, the tech helps the blockchain authenticate the source call that triggers smart contract transactions.  Smart contracts are a primary feature differentiating ethereum from bitcoin, enabling developers to build applications on top of the ethereum blockchain to automatically execute programming orders (or contracts).  However, Fujitsu said that, currently, there are six common risks associated with the platform. While existing technologies are capable of solving most of those issues, the authenticity of the source call still remains problematic.  For instance, as the firm explained, since multiple smart contracts could have been built indirectly into a blockchain, there's a risk that the system may not correctly execute the original intention of a source call.  To that end, the new system, a result from joint efforts by Fujitsu's laboratory and its R&D center, is claimed to alert developers of any source code vulnerability that could be exploited to abuse the language of ethereum, and which could ultimately ""fake the origin of a transaction.""  In addition, the two divisions also tout the new technology as being able to pinpoint the code location of such bugs.  In other news, Fujitsu said it will also extend its blockchain research and development efforts to help commercialize Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain framework developed by the blockchain consortium of which Fujitsu is member. That project is slated for completion later in 2018.

Ripple said the new application will allow customers of the three banks to initiate domestic transactions 24 hours a day and seven days a week. It further states that by using a bank account or phone number, or by scanning QR codes, users can make instant transactions without the usual the time constraints imposed by traditional bank transfers.  Currently, the three banks – all members of the Japan Bank Consortium led by SBI Ripple Asia – appear to be in the first phase of testing the product. Following its launch later this year, the smartphone service is planned to be rolled out to the other 61 Japanese bank members of the consortium, according to the announcement.

In his role at the CFTC, Chilton was known for his aggressive stance against fraud and was among the first regulators to openly talk about the potential need to regulate bitcoin. Indeed, as far back as 2013, Chilton had begun considering the need for government oversight of cryptocurrency. As a possible nod to Chilton's concerns, just a year after his final term ended, the CFTC officially deemed bitcoin a commodity.  While regulatory guidance is typically viewed by many in the cryptocurrency industry as a negative, the technology's status as a commodity helped set the stage for the regulated bitcoin futures that would give the cryptocurrency more mainstream appeal.  And now, Chilton, a Democrat, is watching as the GOP is coming around to his viewpoint on crypto regulation. Case in point, just a few months after U.S. Representative Ron Paul (Texas, R) told state regulators to ""stay out"" of cryptocurrency, other Republicans, including South Dakota Senator Mike Rounds, began publicly espousing the benefits of regulation in this area.  In an in-depth interview with CoinDesk, Chilton discussed how the value of bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets, in general, is influencing this ideological shift.  ""The value gets so large that there might be a contagion into the largest financial institutions,"" Chilton said. ""And all of a sudden people's bank accounts get wiped out because of the fear of missing out, and they invest their retirements when they shouldn't.""  Chilton continued:  ""Maybe it's stupid, but that starts to make people say, 'This could have a larger impact on the investors.'""  The magic number  At the top of Chilton's list of reasons why Republicans are worried about cryptocurrency now is a single number: $20,000. It was that price, which bitcoin flirted with in December, that Chilton believes made Republicans do a double-take.  Before then, according to Chilton, most political leaders viewed cryptocurrency as a periphery concern, overshadowed by other more pressing matters.  ""These congressman and senators have 300 issues they have to worry about. They're dealing with infrastructure and the budget deficit and agriculture — a zillion things — the FCC and trade and war and oh my gosh,"" Chilton said, adding:  ""I think when bitcoin hit $20,000 and as it was going up, people started saying, 'Something is happening here, and we've got to pay attention.'""  As the market frenzy drove bitcoin's market value up above $300 billion, Chilton said politicians, for the first time, began to imagine — and worry about — an economy if the price never came down. And he describes how elected officials then began scrambling to learn about bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space from any source they could, including each other, culminating in the first-ever Senate hearing on cryptocurrencies in February.  What Chilton said was most remarkable about the event was that normally, speakers and other members of the audience only stay through a small portion of the proceeding, but during the cryptocurrency hearing, the majority of people stayed through the entire thing.  And two weeks later, Republican's tone around regulation began shifting.  For instance, Reuters reported that Republican Congressmen Bill Huizenga of Michigan, Tom MacArthur of New Jersey and Dave Brat of Virginia joined Senator Rounds — also an influential Senate Banking Committee member — in support of crypto regulation.  Referring to Senator Rounds, Chilton said, ""It was significant because this is a guy who is a free market Republican.""  Who's regulating who?  However, as Republicans increasingly seem interested in abandoning their position on regulation when it comes to cryptocurrency, uncertainty remains about what rule-making for the industry will look like.  In bitcoin's early days, enthusiasts were keen to describe the cryptocurrency as unregulated and unregulatable, and in certain ways, they could be right. But increasingly, it's become popular for legislators, regulators and industry stakeholders to point to existing regulations for traditional products as a means by which to regulate at least the companies that provide consumer-facing services.  Still, what has become clear, especially after the Senate hearing, is that there's still confusion over which government agency has enforcement powers over this new industry.  Either way, though, Chilton argues that regardless how that all shakes out, the best path forward for cryptocurrency startups is being very open with regulators and doing their best to comply with any rules they think do apply to their business model.  In an effort to help, Chilton became an adviser of ethereum startup Omega One, which is building a compliant cryptocurrency exchange. The company is part of a new wave of startups taking preemptive action in an effort to satisfy regulatory concerns.  Speaking to his approval of those startups' decisions, Chilton concluded:  ""I always thought it's better to work with the government and fine-tune where they are to move forward, than to just hope something happens, and then you're over-regulated.""

Notably, he highlighted how some companies are turning to the blockchain funding model after having issues trying to raise money through more common means, calling the trend ""troubling.""  Clayton said in the interview:  ""We have seen instances where companies seem to have had trouble raising money in a traditional private placement and then have switched to an ICO in order to raise the money. The business hasn't changed substantively, but it's a form-over-substance way to raise money. That is troubling.""  The SEC chair also repeated his argument that many of the tokens his agency has reviewed fall under the definition of a security.  ""Many ICOs and many of the ones I've looked at specifically are securities,"" he told the network. ""They are offerings of interest in an enterprise where the buyer of the ICO of the token, you can call it a token you can call it a security, is basically saying I'm investing with you with the promise of a future return.""  Ultimately, Clayton demurred when asked how the SEC would enforce its regulations, saying that there are both public and private solutions for violations of federal securities laws.  On the other hand, he had a message for firms looking to launch their own token sales: ""We are watching.""

42401188,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxse,1520395269,PBoC's Yao: Chinese Digital Currency Should Be Crypto-Inspired,"A central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) released by the People's Bank of China should incorporate elements of cryptocurrencies, according to Yao Qian, who spearheads the central bank's research in this area.  In his latest opinion piece, published by China business media outlet Yicai on Tuesday, Yao – who is director of the central bank's Digital Currency Research Lab – further explained his vision regarding a technological approach towards the development of a CBDC.  Such features – including possible steps to boost privacy in transactions – would help give a future currency more of a competitive edge, he wrote, while acknowledging that the PBoC would likely centralize its issuance.  Yao argued:  ""At the current phase, CBDC may mainly focus on digitalizing the fiat currency. But it's inevitable for CBDC to integrate more features in the future. An approach that just rigidly mimics and digitalizes the fiat currency may undermine the competitive edge of CBDC in the long term.""  The lab director's comments offer a new window into the thinking within China's central bank on this issue. His commentary follows a January op-ed by Fan Yifei, the vice governor of the PBoC, which specifically distinguished CBDC from decentralized cryptocurrencies.  And yet Yao argues in his opinion that, in the long-run, a Chinese CBDC should nonetheless include some key features of cryptocurrency.  For example, he outlines a scenario in which a cryptocurrency wallet would be introduced to customer accounts among existing commercial banks which would utilize a dual-key mechanism maintained by both customers and banks – similar to the concept of public and private keys used in most cryptocurrencies.  In addition, Yao also said that a certain degree of anonymity can be adopted by a Chinese CBDC, arguing that the central bank should consider the advantage of a more private transaction environment for better user experience and privacy protection.  ""[An] anonymous front-end with [a] real name back-end,"" Yao wrote.  That line of thinking is perhaps shared by Fan, who previously argued in his op-ed that while a CBDC can be anonymous from the perspective of consumer-to-consumer payments, transparency would be vital within the central bank's issuance system.

42401173,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxcu,1520393430,Ex-IMF Economist: Bitcoin Could Drop to $100 in the Next Decade,"A well-known economist has predicted a steep drop in the price of bitcoin over the long-term.  Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said on CNBC’s Squawk Box program on Tuesday that he expects a fall to as low as $100 over the net decade.  Rogoff remarked on the show:  ""I think bitcoin will be worth a tiny fraction of what it is now if we're headed out 10 years from now...I would see $100 as being a lot more likely than $100,000 ten years from now.""  Rogoff struck a critical tone about bitcoin's use as a means of payment, arguing that there aren't many uses for bitcoin payments beyond tax evasion and money laundering. Indeed, the former IMF economist has put forward what could be called an ultra-bearish stance on bitcoin prices in the past. Last October, he wrote an op-ed for The Guardian arguing the price of bitcoin will collapse even if the underlying technology thrives.  In part, he based this theory on the idea that governments would not allow decentralized or anonymous cryptocurrencies to completely replace state-issued tender.  Other researchers, looking at bitcoin's value proposition through the payments angle, have reached other conclusions in the past. Digital Asset Research estimated that bitcoin transaction use cases in 2017 would have established roughly a $2,074 value – even without speculative trading or any store of value market.  And on the illicit activity front, a study by the British blockchain analytics firm Elliptic found only 0.61 percent of the money involved in European bitcoin exchanges and conversion services were verifiably connected to such uses.  Although Rogoff may not be the biggest fan of bitcoin, he still advocated during Tuesday's interview for a global regulatory response rather than outright bans.  ""It really needs to be global regulation. Even if the U.S. cracks down on it and China cracks down, but Japan doesn't, people will be able to still launder money through Japan,"" he said.  Japan is a unique example to cite, considering the nation boasts perhaps one of the world's most mature regulatory frameworks to date. Japanese regulators said in February that they plan to ramp up on-site exchange inspections – a notable position to take considering that the National Police Agency reportedly identified 669 cases of suspected money laundering from exchange platforms between April and December 2017.

42401170,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxdt,1520383522,Venezuelan Lawmakers Declare Petro Crypto Illegal,"One of Venezuela’s two opposing lawmaking bodies has ruled that the country’s issuance of a national cryptocurrency is illegal under domestic law.  Announced Tuesday  , Venezuela’s Asamblea Nacional, a group of politicians largely at odds with President Nicolas Maduro and his policies, declared it believes the petro cryptocurrency is unconstitutional, using harsh rhetoric that denounced the project as not only a fraud, but a threat to potential investors.  In a public statement, the group's members lashed out against the sale, which is said to have already raised $735 million, arguing it's simply a symptom of the country's ongoing political crisis.  At issue, the legislature said, are claims by the government that businesses and retirement accounts would need to accept the cryptocurrency, which if issued, would mark the first time any nation-state has issued a blockchain-based form of payment.  Still, while potentially historic, members of the lawmaking body sought to frame the petro as yet another way a corrupt government is seeking to embezzle funds from citizens. In recent years, Venezuela has been rocked by high unemployment and inflation. As reported by The New York Times, this period has also seen the introduction of a competing legislature, dubbed the National Constituent Assembly (ANC), which was created by President Maduro.  In turn, the ANC has notably backed the release of the petro as an ""act of rebellion"" that will enable the nation to sidestep harmful western sanctions.  Representative Rafael Guzman, who chairs the body’s economic and finance commission, responsible for budget, public credit, financial, monetary and exchange policies, was most heavily quoted in the release.  He said in a statement:  “This deepens the crisis that we are living in. The PTR is another [example] of corruption, and we will come out of this crisis with measures that we have announced from this Parliament.”  As reported by CoinDesk, Venezuelans are so far deeply divided on the idea that they may soon be able to use a government-backed cryptocurrency, with reactions to the decision, spearheaeded by President Maduro, largely splitting on partisan lines.
