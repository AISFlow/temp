42407755,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga41al,1722987000,"Post WazirX Hack, India's CoinDCX Starts Investor Protection Fund With $6M","CoinDCX has established a crypto investors protection fund to compensate users in case of a security breach.  The decision comes a few weeks after prominent Indian crypto exchange WazirX suffered a $230 million hack.  Indian crypto exchange CoinDCX's co-founder Sumit Gupta has told CoinDesk that his company has established an investor protection fund, saying that if other exchanges did this too ""it would be better for the ecosystem.""  The investor protection fund is designed to ""compensate users for losses incurred in extremely rare scenarios such as security breaches"" and at the start it will hold nearly $6 million (INR 50 crore), which comes solely from ""our profits,"" Gupta said.  The decision comes in the wake of the $230 million hack – worth nearly 45% of customer funds which were in one wallet - suffered by WazirX last month. After the hack, Gupta was one of the first to criticize a work in progress plan suggested by WazirX to manage the customer funds.  ""This is approximately 1.8% of the roughly $350 million customer funds we hold and we intend to continue to increase it over time. We will contribute 2% of whatever monthly brokerage income we make. The thought was to start somewhere and then continue to revaluate this number moving forward. International exchanges have done this. But in India we want to at least take the lead and start this as a standard.""  Last month, WazirX's founder Nischal Shetty told CoinDCX that the hack of his exchange was rare, possibly the first of its kind.  Gupta denied that the creation of the fund was because such rare events could happen to CoinDCX too if one happened to WazirX.  ""Nobody can assure 100% security. But how do we ensure customers remain protected even if there is the slightest chance of a breach. In our case, we don't concentrate our funds in one wallet, it's diversified.

Changing hands at around $8, LINK fell by 64% from March highs, breaking out from a bull flag, signaling weakness. The correction was across the board, and leading altcoins like Solana and Cardano also posted sharp losses. LINK Holders Accumulating, Outflows From Exchanges Spike However, as the markets bled, breaking below key support levels, smart investors saw this as an opportunity to accumulate. According to IntoTheBlock data on August 6, yesterday, there was a marked increase in the number of active LINK addresses, rising to levels not seen in roughly three months. Related Reading: UNI Price Bounces Back 13% Above $5.6, Can Bulls Maintain Control? The uptick in active addresses coincided with a spike in outflows from exchanges. This development suggests that users were more keen to accumulate LINK, not sell, despite falling asset prices. Outflows from centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are usually considered net positive. With users controlling coins via their non-custodial wallets, they can’t readily sell for other liquid coins or stablecoins. Over the years, prices tend to recover steadily afterward whenever there is extreme fear, especially among LINK holders. Like the events of March 2020, when crypto prices flash crashed due to a COVID-19-led collapse, aggressive investors can consider such drops an opportunity to buy. In March 2020, LINK fell by a whopping 70%. However, months later, as the money printers were powered on, crypto prices rose, lifting LINK by nearly 35X at its 2021 peak. Similar to what happened then, the drop in prices coupled with outflows from exchanges and accumulation among entities makes it likely that LINK will bounce back strongly. Most Holders Are In Red, But Partners Are Interested In Chainlink Solutions So far, IntoTheBlock data reveals that 65% of LINK holders are in losses, and only 32% are in green. Encouragingly, though, most LINK holders are “diamond hands” and have been holding their stash for over a year. The more long-term holders or addresses holding the coin or token for over 155 days, the more resilient prices are in the wave of liquidation. Besides price action, optimism is high among LINK holders. Chainlink is a leading decentralized oracle provider offering services to DeFi and NFT protocols.

AAVE, the namesake token of the platform, surged to nearly 20% in the past 24 hours, capturing the momentum of the broader market which is still up by over 5% since yesterday. Related Reading: Binance Coin In Turmoil: Nearly 10% Value Erased In Market Shake-Up Aave’s recent developments also contributed to this rally. However, the broader crypto-finance market might be in disagreement with the platform’s current performance. $200 Million In Market Size Unlocked On Aave Lido Finance, a crypto staking platform, recently onboarded the platform’s Lido V3 market instance, custom-made for Aave which is tailored to Lido’s staked Ethereum (stETH) and wrapped staked Ethereum (wstETH). This will significantly improve user experience in lending and borrowing stETH and wstETH as it can be fine-tuned to maximize profitability for Aave users. The Lido V3 market on @aave has been live for 48 hours and just surpassed $200m in market size 👻 Here’s what you need to know 👇 pic.twitter.com/aNSGxsq2fy — Lido (@LidoFinance) July 31, 2024 This helped AAVE recover in price. The platform also experienced a significant bump in the total value locked (TVL) with a near 10% increase since yesterday. However, the broader market seems to be at odds with Aave’s recent bullishness. The 2nd quarter revealed some cracks within the lending portion of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. According to CoinGecko’s 2nd Quarter research, over $31.87 billion in TVL is dedicated to lending, marking a significant cut of the pie on DeFi. However, the main functions of DeFi such as staking, lending, and cross-chain bridges saw a huge decrease in TVL, totaling over $8 billion. The value that left these sectors returned in the form of restaking in other platforms or to basis trading protocols that saw a whopping 154% increase in TVL in Q2. This decrease in lending activity also translated to the assets on the platform. Blockanalitica reveals that a majority of the wallets that hold collateral on Aave are either medium or high risk. If the market drops by 25%, majority of the wallets are in the red which represents liquidation. This shows that lending on DeFi remains to be dangerous, especially with the current market volatility experienced this week. A Short Squeeze? AAVE is currently occupying the range between $93 and $102. This position, although a big downgrade from its return from June price levels, is a solid support for a possible breakthrough in the near future. Related Reading: Bloody Monday: Cardano Not Spared From Bloodbath, Suffers 30% Loss However, as it moves independent of the market, this current bullishness might just be a short squeeze or a sudden increase in price before a sharp fall. With the current market environment reflecting this volatility, AAVE will have a hard time securing its June price level bringing in the possibility of further downturns.

32089503,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633476,1722974451,Bitcoin Sellers Running Out Of Coins As Dominance Hits 3-Year High,"Crypto analyst Rekt Capital has provided some form of optimism for Bitcoin investors, suggesting that the massive sell pressure on the flagship crypto is almost over. This comes amid a significant surge in Bitcoin’s dominance. Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion Is At Its Peak In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Rekt Capital mentioned that “the sell-side volume has reached and even dramatically eclipsed Seller Exhaustion levels seen at previous price reversals to the upside.” The analyst added that Bitcoin hasn’t seen this level of sell-side volume since the Halving event in April earlier this year. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Compares Bitcoin Adoption To Gold, Reveals Why Price Will Touch $350,000 This undoubtedly presents a bullish development for the flagship crypto since Bitcoin is bound to witness a massive reversal with the sell pressure almost over. This is already happening, as Bitcoin has rebounded in the last 24 hours, following its drop below $50,000 for the first time since January. Rekt Capital also suggested that Bitcoin could rebound to as high as $62,550 in the short term as it looks to fill the CME gap, which is currently between $59,400 and $62,550. He noted that the odds favor Bitcoin filling this gap since the crypto token has filled all of the CME Gaps it has created over the past several months. Crypto analyst Skew also commented on the massive sell-side volume that Bitcoin recently experienced. He explained that this happened because Bitcoin failed to hold above $70,000 following its July price rebound. The analyst added that there is “no actual chaos yet,” suggesting there was no need to be worried about the recent price correction. With seller exhaustion at its peak, there is also the likelihood that Bitcoin has found a bottom and that this could be the final correction before the bull run kicks into full gear. Veteran trader and analyst Peter Brandt noted that Bitcoin’s decline since the halving means it has now achieved a price drop similar to the one during the 2015 to 2017 Halving bull market cycle. BTC’s Dominance Hits 3-Year High Amid the market turmoil, data from Coinglass shows that Bitcoin’s dominance recently hit its highest level since April 2021. This rise has been largely due to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have caused new money to flow into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, altcoins have had to battle for capital from existing retail investors who continue to divest their money between several crypto assets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Sees Sharp 24% Drop, Where Does Price Go From Here?

42407750,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga41Dc,1722973681,Semler Scientific Studied MicroStrategy’s Success Before Adopting Bitcoin Strategy,"Semler Scientific's decision to covert its cash holdings to bitcoin came a bit more than a year after Eric Semler became an active investor in April 2023.  Semler said he and the board studied MicroStrategy's success in adopting its bitcoin strategy.  The medical device manufacturer has since spent more than $60 million acquiring the cryptocurrency and plans to buy more as soon as a hoped-for capital raise gains SEC approval.  It was more than two years before Bitcoin's birth when Dr. Herbert Semler, who served as a flight surgeon in the Korean War before leading cardiology at a Portland hospital, co-founded Semler Scientific (SMLR) in 2007.  Seventeen years later, the medical device manufacturer has converted much of its cash holdings to bitcoin and aims to buy a lot more.  “He was so excited,” Eric Semler, the company’s chairman and son to Herbert Semler, said about his father’s reaction to this new investment strategy. Herbert's father and Eric's grandfather, Harry Semler, had seen gold as a great investment during his time, so he would’ve loved seeing the company invest in the “new gold,” Eric Semler told CoinDesk in an interview on Tuesday.  Herbert – at almost 96 years old – is now retired and not involved in Semler Scientific anymore, and even Eric had only been a passive investor in SMLR until he took a more active role in April 2023, spurred by governance issues at the company.  A lot has changed since the younger Semler's arrival, most notably the company’s decision to adopt bitcoin as a treasury strategy which was announced in May of this year. In this, Semler is attempting to follow the path of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which under the leadership of Michael Saylor famously began converting its cash holdings to bitcoin and today holds nearly $14 billion worth of the token.  “Michael Saylor’s drumbeat about zombie companies with a lot of cash that were small and weren’t getting attention in the stock market kind of resonated with all of us on the board,” Semler said. So they decided to study MicroStrategy’s success and saw the value in adopting its strategy.  Semler Scientific has so far purchased 929 bitcoins for a total of $63 million, or an average price of a bit less than $68,000 each, according to the firm's second-quarter earnings report. The recent decline in price to about $57,000 has trimmed the value of those holdings by about $10 million, but that doesn’t change the board’s conviction, Semler said.  “When you believe in something so strongly and when you have conviction you have to be willing to step up and buy things when they go against you,"" he said. ""I think that the ultimate test of conviction is whether you will buy something that's down and that you bought 20% higher.“  Taking another page from the Saylor playbook, Semler has moved to raise money in the capital markets to purchase far larger amounts of bitcoin. The company filed a $150 million mixed shelf offering in early June and is currently awaiting SEC approval to move forward.  Seasoned issuers like MicroStrategy typically receive the green light from the regulator in quick fashion, but because Semler Scientific is a smaller company and this is the first time it has attempted this sort of capital raise, the approval is taking more time.  An early believer  Having been a professional investor since 1998, Semler met with bitcoin entrepreneurs early on in the crypto's life and began personally buying in 2016. His investment focus had always been on future trends, Semler said, and he liked to look for stocks and companies that could go from small cap to large cap.  “Bitcoin fits into that realm,” he said and in recent years, he realized that the cryptocurrency had shown staying power, specifically during the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, one of three lenders that succumbed to bank runs in 2023. All three banks had provided banking services to cryptocurrency firms, which in turn increased uncertainty about the industry.  “Bitcoin’s durability through that crisis impressed me and had an impact on my thinking about it,” Semler recalled.  The ultimate decision to use bitcoin as a treasury reserve was a simple business move, Semler explained. The company had plenty of free cash on its balance sheet and was generating additional positive cash flow each year – fundamentals that Semler believed his firm wasn't getting credit for from Wall Street.  “It was the result of a lot of soul searching about how to provide shareholder value,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/08/06/semler-scientific-studied-microstrategys-success-before-adopting-bitcoin-strategy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/605ce816629211e87ca1f2db875c5ab3843e4f3b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32085633,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633439,1722969009,3 Reasons To Buy XRP Now: Crypto Analyst Shares Bullish Forecast,"Crypto analyst Doctor Magic (@Doctor_Magic_) has outlined three reasons for investors to consider buying XRP now. In a series of posts on the X, Doctor Magic detailed the dynamics and data points positioning XRP as a potentially lucrative investment in the current state of the market. #1 Relative Strength Of XRP The crypto analyst highlights the XRP price relative to Bitcoin (BTC) and its resilience in the broader market. “XRP’s strength against BTC and across the board is notable and should not be ignored at this point. When markets turn up again (soon) the pump on XRP will be violent!” This analysis is based on a chart that plots the market cap dominance of as a ratio against BTC and the entire crypto market on a weekly timeframe. The dominance percentage is a critical metric, serving as an indicator of market capitalization relative to BTC, and thus reflects relative investment flows and market preferences. From 2016 to 2021, XRP’s dominance displayed a significant downward trend, suggesting a period during which market preference leaned heavily towards Bitcoin. However, beginning in 2022, this trend leveled off, indicating a potential stabilization or bottoming relative to Bitcoin. This phase suggests that XRP may have found a floor in terms of its market cap dominance, setting the stage for a possible reversal. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Sees Sharp Decline In Major Metric That Threatens To Send XRP Price To $0.2 A key support level for XRP/BTC is identified at 0.00000750 by the analyst. This level has been tested multiple times without a decisive break, establishing it as a critical floor where market sentiment has consistently supported the price relative to BTC. In 2024, following a bounce off this support area, there was a noticeable increase in dominance, suggesting growing investor confidence in its potential for a recovery. In terms of dominance over the entire crypto market (XRP.D), the metric currently stands at 1.47%. After touching down in the support zone ranging from 1.02% to 1.05%, XRP.D also experienced an uptick, further underscoring the renewed market interest and potential bullish sentiment. #2 Recovery Post-Dump With Stable Open Interest Doctor Magic also highlights a notable aspect of the market behavior — its swift recovery from yesterday’s price crash without any increase in open interest (OI). “XRP has now retraced the whole yesterday dump with zero OI added. ZERO. And negative funding,” remarked Doctor Magic. Related Reading: Why XRP Price Won’t Skyrocket After Ripple-SEC Ruling: Crypto Pundit This recovery pattern is significant as it implies the rebound was not fueled by a surge in speculative trading or new positions being opened, but rather by solid buying interest, likely from investors confident in fundamentals or long-term potential. #3 Support From Historical Open Interest Level Finally, the crypto analyst points to the current levels of Open Interest (OI) for XRP, which aligns with a historical baseline that has consistently marked significant market tops and bottoms over the past four years. “OI on XRP at the baseline [blue line] that has marked every top and every bottom the last 4 years,” Doctor Magic notes. This observation suggests that current OI levels are at a critical juncture, indicative of potential turning points in the market. Historically, when OI reaches these levels, it has preceded major price movements. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5030.

42407747,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga4170,1722963804,Blockchains Against Corruption,"Does your company do worst-case scenario planning? What will you do if the rule of law erodes and corruption accelerates?  The year 2024 is set to be one of the biggest and most important election years in history. It comes at a time of global instability, where there is, once again, a war in Europe, and the post-World War II international order itself is under strain. Although decentralized technology cannot provide meaningful protection against a total collapse of the rule of law, such a scenario remains unlikely.  Nevertheless, erosion of the rule of law is still possible. There are several areas where extreme political actions could undermine businesses and investors that depend on predictable and stable environments, leading to significant problems for companies. I identify three risks in particular that can at least be offset by careful application of decentralized technology:  The one that most blockchain boosters think about right away is currency manipulation. From printing money to finance deficits to pre-election spending splurges, central banks and treasuries face a lot of political risk. Shifting away from volatile local currencies to stablecoins is the most practical alternative for businesses. Keeping as little of volatile local currency as possible is advisable, where it is legally permitted.  Another big risk is political interference in the judiciary. Courts are where people go to resolve disputes, and if the umpires are corrupt, the risk of a bad or unfair outcome is high. The best option is to stay out of politically compromised courts as much as possible. Moving from paper contracts to transparent, blockchain-based smart contracts that are enforced automatically offers an opportunity to reduce the risk of nonpayment or disputes. Furthermore, it increases the likelihood of automated and fact-based dispute resolutions.  Corruption at all levels is another big risk, internally and externally. Corrupt officials often pursue arbitrary regulatory actions or selective and extreme enforcement against firms that won’t play ball. Their best ally in this process is opacity. Corruption is never popular, and bad actors rely on others' silence to get away with their behavior. The best protection against this kind of rent-seeking is extreme and total transparency. If all your orders, shipments, purchases and prices are public, then theft is immediately visible to all.  This last practice, extreme transparency, is something businesses in mature economies would hesitate to embrace, but it’s a real and proven strategic option. In the Indian state of Maharashtra, cooperative farmers at the Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company, frustrated with the immensely variable prices and wildly different markups by middlemen, put all their shipments and prices on the Polygon blockchain with the help of a local startup, Emertech. The result: lower overheads and fairer prices for all involved.  Most companies, especially big ones, have little choice other than to play by the rules, however arbitrary they might be. This is one of the reasons cryptocurrency adoption in many countries by consumers has far outpaced that by enterprises. Governments generally do not have the power to prosecute every consumer for every infraction. Exchanging your local currency for crypto or stablecoins may not be legal, but individuals can often fly beneath the radar. Businesses, however, have real-world assets, such as real estate and factories of immense value, that can be seized as penalties.  Blockchains and cryptocurrency can only mitigate some of the big political risks faced by enterprises in the coming years. But, to make money, you must take risks, and that means having assets, people and resources in the market, and accepting the ups and downs that come with it. No risk, no reward.

The miner now expects to generate a total of $6.7 billion in revenue over the life of the contract, starting in the first half of 2026.  The shares of bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) surged as much as 17% on Tuesday, outperforming other crypto-linked stocks, after the company signed an extension of its earlier high-performance computing (HPC) contract with CoreWeave.  The miner said in a statement that it has exercised its option from a previous contract to host about 112 megawatt (MW) of additional GPUs for ""AI Hyperscaler"" firm CoreWeave. The new contract is expected to add about $2 billion of additional revenue, bringing the total to $6.7 billion, starting in the first half of 2026. CoreWeave will be bearing the cost for all capital investments needed to get Core Scientific’s existing mining infrastructure ready for HPC, the statement added.  ""We have now contracted with CoreWeave for a total of 382 megawatts of HPC infrastructure, reflecting the strong demand for high-power data center infrastructure and the unique ability of our team to deliver it,"" said Adam Sullivan, Core Scientific’s CEO.  Previously, the miner said it will provide hosting infrastructure for 200MW worth of GPUs for CoreWeave, with options to add further capacity. Subsequently, the two companies expanded the deal by 70MW more, making this new deal a third extension.  The original deal brought the limelight back into the mining industry, which was hurt by the brutal crypto winter and a low profit margin due to recent halving.  The HPC and artificial intelligence (AI) companies require energy intensive data centers, sites and infrastructure which are expensive and time consuming to secure. Bitcoin miners on the other hand, already have power contracts and infrastructure that are ready to support such needs, making them the easier candidates to host the HPC and AI-related machines than building from scratch or use legacy data centers.  Taking advantage of this market opportunity, Core Scientific said it has options for another extension of the contract to host 118MW worth of additional machines for HPC computing.  ""The latest contract also validates that our strategy for developing application-specific data centers aligns with the increasing energy density requirements for high-performance computing that legacy data centers do not typically satisfy,"" said Sullivan.

Just today, INJ processed a total of $200 million worth of transactions on its native decentralized exchange (DEX), marking another milestone for the platform. These are only some of the factors that will inevitably contribute to Cosmos Hub’s position to solidify in the market. With some time, ATOM might rebound from its cautious state. Investors Should Be Cautious Of This Level As of writing, the token still sits on a fairly unstable price range at between $3-$5. This shows the token’s precarious position in the short term as bearishness still lingers on the market.

This article explores the reasons behind this significant move and highlights the advantages of Mpeppe (MPEPE) over Dogecoin (DOGE). The Rise and Stagnation of Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts, thanks to its vibrant community and celebrity endorsements. However, despite its popularity, some investors have started to feel that DOGE’s growth potential has plateaued. The lack of substantial new features and utility in Dogecoin (DOGE) has led some whales to seek more promising opportunities. Staking and Earning Rewards with MPEPE Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a compelling alternative to Dogecoin (DOGE). Inspired by the viral nature of internet memes and the energy of professional soccer player Mbappé, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique and engaging approach to the cryptocurrency world. Its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) adds significant value and utility, making it an attractive option for investors. One of the standout features of Mpeppe (MPEPE) is its ability to allow users to stake Mpeppe (MPEPE) within DeFi liquidity pools to earn rewards. This staking mechanism offers a way for investors to generate passive income, a feature that Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks. By participating in these liquidity pools, Mpeppe (MPEPE) holders can earn attractive returns, enhancing the overall investment experience. The Synergy Between MPEPE and DeFi Mpeppe (MPEPE) and decentralized finance (DeFi) synergize effectively, integrating DeFi elements into Mpeppe (MPEPE) tokenomics. Features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance mechanisms add utility and value to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) community. This integration allows Mpeppe (MPEPE) to provide a wide range of financial services such as lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming without traditional intermediaries. In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) does not offer such advanced financial functionalities. Yield Farming and Liquidity Mining By adopting DeFi protocols such as yield farming and liquidity mining, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides its users with multiple avenues for earning and growth. These features enable users to earn additional tokens by participating in the network, further incentivizing holding and using Mpeppe (MPEPE). Dogecoin (DOGE), on the other hand, has not yet embraced these advanced DeFi strategies, making it less attractive to investors seeking these opportunities. Conclusion: A Strategic Shift from DOGE to MPEPE The decision of a Dogecoin (DOGE) whale to switch to Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the growing recognition of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s potential.

The industry's political action committees supported candidates in Tuesday's primaries in Washington state and Missouri, and they devoted $1.4 million in the hopes of ousting a prominent Democrat in Missouri.  Support for one Arizona Democrat may be paying off, with the Yassamin Ansari's race moving to a recount with her still holding a 42-vote lead.  After a very tight victory last week in Arizona that's now facing a recount, the cryptocurrency industry's political forces are shifting their attention toward some of the final U.S. congressional primaries of 2024, including Tuesday's elections in Missouri and Washington state.  The political action committees (PACs) backed by crypto firms have waged a $1.4 million ad campaign against Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), one of the standout progressives in the U.S. House of Representatives who advocacy group Stand With Crypto has rated with an F on digital assets issues. And the PACs have recently dropped $1.5 million into Washington state's 6th Congressional District to support Democrat Emily Randall, according to a filing with the Federal Election Commission.  Meanwhile in Arizona, the industry can chalk up a very tentative win in the state's 3rd Congressional District, where Yassamin Ansari, a Democratic former vice mayor of Phoenix who has been a crypto advocate, took a 42-vote lead at the final count from last week's election there. Under state rules, that race now goes to a recount.  So far, the focus of the Fairshake super PAC and its affiliated committees has been on transforming Congress into a friendlier entity for digital assets interests, and the groups have shied away from the presidential race, despite some of the key backers of the PACs loudly supporting former President Donald Trump.  A Fairshake spokesman declined to comment on the live races on Tuesday.  After Tuesday's elections, several final states are soon finishing their primaries – including Wisconsin, Connecticut and Alaska – and the political calendar will then turn entirely toward November's general election. Most of Fairshake's congressional primary victors are favored to win their fights in November, potentially adding two dozen crypto fans from both political parties to Congress in the next session.  Read More: Crypto Giants Notch Wins in Expensive Quest to Sway U.S. Politics – Without Mentioning Crypto  Fairshake has used its $169 million war chest – virtually unrivaled in current U.S. politics – to support dozens of candidates, but also to buy ads opposing several. Its unlimited advertising spending, an allowed category of ""independent expenditures"" by super PACS, devoted about $10 million to derailing the Senate hopes of Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and $2.1 million against Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.). More recently, a similar effort turned toward Bush in Missouri.  Fairshake-funded ads don't generally address crypto issues, and – by law – they can't be directly affiliated with the campaigns.  Also in Missouri, Fairshake's affiliates kicked in about $260,000 to support Republican candidate Robert Onder, a state senator, in the crowded 3rd Congressional District race.",POSITIVE,없음,REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/06/crypto-industry-tries-to-tally-final-wins-as-us-congressional-primaries-wind-down,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/caffa5a237bb5581ec857078ef22267c7141c3f1-4802x2701.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin whales, or large asset holders, seized the opportunity of lower prices to purchase, while small investors sold as the panic ensued, data by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock shows.  Crypto wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, worth roughly $56 million and $560 million at current prices, ""demonstrated confidence during the recent dip, consistently increasing their holdings as prices fell,"" IntoTheBlock analysts said.

32078264,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633435,1722958245,XRP Whales Take Advantage Of 20% Drop To Buy Millions Worth Of Tokens,"XRP whales are taking advantage of the price downturn to accumulate more tokens. XRP recently bottomed out at $0.438 in the wake of an intense selloff in the wider crypto market, which saw the value of many cryptocurrencies drop sharply. This intense selloff resulted in a dramatic 20% decline in the price of XRP within a 24-hour timeframe. Despite this steep fall, on-chain transaction data reveals that some large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ remain undeterred. These investors are seizing the opportunity presented by the lower prices to accumulate more XRP on various exchanges. Whales Buy Millions Of XRP Recent data from the whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts reveals an intriguing accumulation pattern among XRP holders. Over the past 48 hours, Whale Alerts has noted multiple instances of substantial XRP transfers to and from various exchanges. The majority of these transfers involve moving significant amounts of XRP into private, unknown wallets from crypto exchanges. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Compares Bitcoin Adoption To Gold, Reveals Why Price Will Touch $350,000 The latest huge transaction recorded was the transfer of 26.69 million XRP tokens worth $13.6 million from the Binance exchange to a private wallet identified as “rhWj9g.” This transaction is part of a broader trend observed by Whale Alerts, which highlights a cumulative total of 157 million XRP tokens, worth approximately $75.16 million, being moved from crypto exchanges into private wallets over the past 24 hours. Interestingly, most of these transfers originated from Binance. Interestingly, the data also indicates a likely selloff transaction, where 31.7 million XRP tokens, valued at $15.1 million, were transferred into Bitstamp from a private wallet. This movement contrasts with the general trend of accumulation, suggesting not all whales are accumulating. Expanding the timeframe to the past 48 hours, Whale Alerts data reveals a cumulative accumulation of 228.54 million XRP tokens worth $108.78 million from crypto exchanges into private wallets. Quick Rebound For Price? This accumulation by whales could signal a future price recovery, as significant buy-ins from large holders often lead to market upswings. The strategic buying amid the price slump shows confidence that the current downturn is a temporary setback. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Sees Sharp 24% Drop, Where Does Price Go From Here? Recent price action saw the cryptocurrency fall from $0.653 to $0.438 in the space of five days, effectively canceling out the gains it made in July. This drastic price slump saw the cryptocurrency enter the oversold region on the Relative Strength Index (RSI). XRP has managed to recover some of its losses. The RSI indicator now reflects an increase in buying momentum, suggesting that investors are starting to re-enter the market. At the time of writing, the altcoin is trading at $0.5016, reflecting a 7.11% increase over the past 24 hours. This recovery has brought XRP back to a crucial multi-month resistance and support level around the $0.5 mark, a price point that has historically been both a floor and a ceiling for the cryptocurrency. This price point has proven to be a significant threshold, one that XRP has struggled to break away from for quite some time now.

32074615,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633409,1722952807,"UNI Price Bounces Back 13% Above $5.6, Can Bulls Maintain Control?","Uniswap (UNI) based on recent price movements has experienced a 13% rebound, pushing its price above the critical $5.6 level. This rebound which follows a period of bearish surge by the cryptocurrency has raised optimism among investors and traders as to whether the bulls can maintain this momentum and drive the price even higher. By offering insights and expert analysis, this article aims to provide readers with a comprehensive analysis of Uniswap’s recent 13% price rebound, which has pushed it above the $5.6 price mark. Additionally, it will assess the sustainability of the bullish momentum and evaluate whether the bulls can maintain control and drive UNI’s price higher. UNI is currently trading at around $5.77 and has increased by 13% with a market capitalization of over $3.4 billion and a trading volume of over $274 Million as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, the asset’s market cap has increased by 13.23%, while its trading volume has decreased by 13.55%. Technical Indicators: Signs Of Sustained Bullish Momentum For UNI Currently, the price of UNI on the 1-hour chart is bullish and is heading toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The digital asset has been on an upward spiral since breaking above the key level of $5.6, which indicates that the bulls are gaining control of the market and could drive the price higher. Additionally, an analysis of the 1-hour Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that the bulls are currently controlling the market. The signal line and its SMA have risen above the zero line and are approaching the overbought zone. This indicates that there is potential for the price to continue climbing higher. On the 4-hour, although Uniswap is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it can be observed that the crypto asset is attempting a bullish move toward the $6.7 resistance level. After the rebound at $4.8, UNI has been showing bullish resilience, thereby keeping its pace above this level. With this recent positive momentum, the digital asset could extend its rally to other resistance levels. Finally, on the 4-hour chart, the composite trend oscillator also indicates a rising bullish strength for the cryptocurrency as the signal has crossed above the SMA of the indicator and both are attempting to move out of the oversold zone. Expert Opinions: Will The Bulls Maintain Control? If the bulls can sustain their strength in the market, the price of UNI will continue to move upward toward the $6.7 resistance range. Should the price break and close above the $6.7 level, it may continue its rally toward the next resistance point at $8.7 and possibly other levels beyond. However, if Uniswap reverses its route at any of the previously mentioned resistance levels, it would begin to drop toward the direction of its previous support range at $5.6. When the price breaches this support level, it could signify a deeper bearish trend, leading to further price declines towards other lower levels.

42407762,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga41kg,1722952581,Kamala Harris Taps Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as Running Mate,"Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for U.S. President, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate for the 2024 presidential election.  Walz has been the governor of Minnesota for five years, after previously serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. Prior to that, he was a schoolteacher and a non-commissioned officer in the Army National Guard. He does not appear to have made any public statements about cryptocurrencies during his tenure, though he did receive (and later return) a $4,000 donation from former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh in the 2022 election cycle.  He also signed a law earlier this year targeting crypto kiosks, setting a $2,000 daily limit and offering fraud protections.  Harris' choice Tuesday sets up November's election, as the pair run against former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance. Trump and Vance have both sought to appeal to the crypto community, including through a keynote speech at last month's Bitcoin Nashville conference.  A prediction market on Polymarket expected Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to get the vice presidential nod, giving him a roughly two-thirds chance of being the nominee until Monday afternoon when Walz's odds began surging.  In a statement, Harris said, ""One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep. It's personal. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his own. We are going to build a great partnership.

According to the latest market data, HNT rocketed up by 31% in the past 24 hours representing a strong flip from bearish to bullish. Related Reading: Binance Coin In Turmoil: Nearly 10% Value Erased In Market Shake-Up Helium’s recent performance can be attributed to a strong investor base, built over the years by constant innovation that was only overrun by market anxiety since the market’s correction phase. Despite this, the platform has continued to innovate despite the lingering bearishness still felt today. Helium Mobile Users Skyrocket, Bringing HNT Mainstream Since its launch in 2023, Helium Mobile continues to rise as one of the most mainstream crypto-base products in the market. With Helium’s entry into the telecom industry, its mobile arm has garnered 106,765 signups with a little under 15,000 hotspots deployed. This is huge. With Helium Mobile leveraging the network’s established web of hotspots around the globe may open more opportunities for the platform to establish itself within the retail space. As of writing, the Helium network boasts 380,629 hotspots, accounting for the total number of LoRaWAN and 5G devices. Mobile’s entry into the telecom industry was smoothened further by its Carrier Offload Program. The program enables users from different carriers to connect with Helium hotspots. As expected, the user count on this metric is higher with nearly 300,000 users from several carriers using only 39 hotspots. With the average phone plan price in the United States becoming more expensive, a new alternative, albeit small and somewhat in the works like Helium Mobile remains an attractive deal for the average Joe. This translates to an increased use of the network which correlates with an uptick in data credit (DC) burning. Messari’s recent overview of Helium shows that the network is currently experiencing strong growth in the burning of DCs, contributing to the network’s finances. HNT: Turning Point Or False Flag? Current market conditions are unpredictable. Market volatility increased because investors and traders realized they had overreacted to the market correction and interpreted it as a hint of further sell-off, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Related Reading: Bloody Monday: Cardano Not Spared From Bloodbath, Suffers 30% Loss As of writing, HNT is back on top of its May levels which can sustain a small breakthrough towards $4.919. With the market’s current jitters, HNT bulls face market volatility coupled with strong market anxiety. But with the similar phenomenon happening within equity markets, we might see a return to bullish attitude in the next few weeks. Investors and traders should exercise caution, keeping an eye on the performance of the broader crypto market before making a move. The bulls are expected to hold on to $4.439 as a support before any movement upward.

Previously, Martin Shkreli, known as ""Pharma Bro,"" had claimed he helped Barron Trump create the token and contributed to its promotion on social media. Shkreli appeared to blame Barron for Tuesday's price drop.  The Donald Trump-themed DJT token on Solana dropped 90% earlier Tuesday after a single wallet sold $2 million worth in a single transaction, bringing its market capitalization down to $3 million from $55 million within seconds.  The wallet ‘4UGm6’ held 20% of the DJT token supply and pocketed 15,500 SOL from the transaction. It then transferred the holdings to four different wallets, crypto social application @0xppl_ said.  DJT was issued in early June and quickly gained virality and market capitalization amid rumors that it was directly related to Republican candidate Donald Trump and his son Barron.  Crypto groups on X wondered who was behind the token given its outsized growth at the time. On June 18, Martin Shkreli, also known as ""Pharma Bro,"" claimed he and Barron Trump created the DJT token despite initially denying involvement. He said he helped Barron issue the tokens and helped popularize them on X.  On or around June 19, blockchain sleuths discovered that DJT’s Telegram channel appeared to share the same admins as another token supported by Shkreli.  Meanwhile, at least one large holder in both DJT and Shoggoth.ai, Shkreli’s other project, had been profiting when he was publicly backing the token. One large DJT holder sold nearly $830,000 worth of DJT from a wallet that held millions of dollars worth of SHOGGOTH tokens around June 19.  The Trump campaign has not officially commented on the matter or Barron’s involvement in the token.  Nevertheless, Shkreli appeared to blame Barron for Tuesday’s price drop. He repeatedly claimed he did not hold any DJT tokens and did not share access to the private keys that controlled its liquidity pools.  “Ask Barron, i don't have the keys or any tokens,” he claimed in an X post when asked for comment alongside a graph showing the token’s price drop.  “I helped make it with understand (sic) it was the official trump token, not that this would happen,” he said in a reply to another X post.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/06/trump-themed-djt-token-issued-by-martin-shkreli-suddenly-dives-90,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be89f922de179c2b5e0364bd9cd759dff62315e8-2039x1147.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Currently priced at $0.00107, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is catching the attention of high-profile investors and traders within the Solana (SOL) community. Here’s why this emerging cryptocurrency is attracting such significant interest and how it’s set to make a substantial impact. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Bridging DeFi and Sports Passion Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a unique decentralized finance (DeFi) coin that combines soccer and decentralized finance principles, offering features like staking, yield farming, and liquidity mining, providing significant value beyond speculative trading. DeFi Features Enhance Investment Opportunities By incorporating DeFi elements, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers Solana (SOL) whales access to a wide array of financial services, including lending, borrowing, trading, and yield farming. This functionality not only increases the utility of Mpeppe (MPEPE) but also aligns with the broader trend of integrating DeFi into various blockchain projects. The promise of these advanced financial mechanisms makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an attractive investment for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Strategic Community Building and Wealth Creation Fostering a Global Community with a Sports Focus Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than a financial asset; it aims to create a vibrant community around the excitement of soccer and the potential of blockchain technology. This focus on community building and global engagement appeals to investors looking for projects with a strong social and cultural component. By uniting sports enthusiasts with blockchain innovation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is setting the stage for significant community-driven growth and wealth creation.

This approach not only helps in building a dedicated user base but also in creating real-world value. For Solana (SOL) whales, the opportunity to be part of a project that emphasizes both community and financial growth presents a compelling case for investment. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s Potential for Future Growth Early Entry into a Promising Cryptocurrency Priced at just $0.00107, Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a low-entry opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on potential future gains. The token’s current valuation, combined with its innovative features and community focus, makes it an appealing choice for those seeking to get in early on a promising new asset.

This stark contrast highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto space and the rising prominence of Mpeppe (MPEPE). Here’s a closer look at the factors driving this shift and why Solana (SOL) investors are taking notice of this new player. Solana (SOL)’s Recent Struggles: A 27.4% Drop Market Dynamics Affecting Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL), once a shining star in the cryptocurrency universe, has recently faced a substantial decline of 27.4%. This drop has been influenced by various market dynamics, including macroeconomic factors, regulatory concerns, and shifting investor sentiments. Despite its robust technology and strong community, Solana (SOL)’s recent performance has raised questions about its short-term stability and long-term growth prospects. Impact of External Factors The decline in Solana (SOL)’s value can also be attributed to external factors affecting the broader crypto market. Fluctuations in investor confidence, changes in market regulations, and macroeconomic uncertainties have all played a role. As Solana (SOL) navigates these challenges, the broader market volatility continues to influence its price trajectory. The Appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE): Why Solana (SOL) Investors Are Taking Notice Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success is largely due to its unique blend of sports passion and blockchain innovation.

This focus on community-building and strategic planning resonates strongly with investors looking for new opportunities in the crypto space.

By offering services such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming, Mpeppe (MPEPE) provides added value and functionality beyond what traditional memecoins offer. This approach not only enhances its appeal but also positions Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a serious contender in the crypto market. Conclusion: The Shifting Landscape of Crypto Investment The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a shift, with Solana (SOL) experiencing a 27.4% decline and Mpeppe (MPEPE) gaining 310%.

32072185,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633464,1722949231,3 Reasons Ethereum (ETH) Investors Are Buying Mpeppe (MPEPE) Over ETH ETF,"As Ethereum (ETH) continues to shape the cryptocurrency landscape, a new player is emerging that’s catching the attention of seasoned investors. Mpeppe (MPEPE), a groundbreaking meme cryptocurrency, is drawing significant interest from those who previously focused on Ethereum (ETH) and its associated financial products like ETFs. Here’s why Ethereum (ETH) investors are turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE) instead of traditional ETH ETFs. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Fresh Take on Cryptocurrency Investment Ethereum (ETH) has been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency world, known for its smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, traditional investment avenues such as ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) offer limited exposure to the cryptocurrency’s growth. These ETFs typically track the price of ETH and provide a more conventional investment route, but they lack the dynamic and engaging elements found in newer crypto projects. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, represents a fresh and innovative approach to cryptocurrency investment. Inspired by Pepecoin and the electrifying soccer player Kylian Mbappé, Mpeppe (MPEPE) combines sports fandom with blockchain technology. This fusion creates a vibrant ecosystem where investors can engage in gaming and sports betting activities while participating in a growing crypto community. For Ethereum (ETH) investors seeking more than just price speculation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers a unique and interactive experience. Engaging Community and Gamified Experience ETH ETFs are primarily financial products that provide exposure to Ethereum (ETH)’s price movements. While they offer a way to invest in ETH indirectly, they do not foster community interaction or engagement. Investors in ETH ETFs are often disconnected from the broader Ethereum (ETH) community, missing out on the social and interactive aspects of the cryptocurrency space. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out by creating a thriving community centered around sports and blockchain innovation. The token leverages blockchain technology to build a platform where users can socialize, trade, and engage in sports-related activities. This gamified approach not only enhances the investment experience but also fosters a sense of belonging among users. For Ethereum (ETH) investors looking to immerse themselves in a more interactive and engaging crypto environment, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers an appealing alternative. Potential for High Returns with Mpeppe (MPEPE) ETH ETFs, while providing a safe and regulated investment vehicle, often come with slower growth potential compared to more dynamic crypto projects. These funds typically follow the price of ETH closely but do not capitalize on the higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities available in the broader cryptocurrency market. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach and its connection to popular culture and sports give it the potential for substantial returns. The token’s unique positioning at the intersection of sports fandom and blockchain technology allows it to tap into a broader and more diverse audience. This, combined with its engaging community and gamified ecosystem, sets the stage for potentially explosive growth. For Ethereum (ETH) investors seeking higher returns and a more exciting investment opportunity, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling option. Conclusion: Embracing the New Era of Crypto Investment Ethereum (ETH) investors are exploring new opportunities in the cryptocurrency space, with Mpeppe (MPEPE) offering a unique blend of sports enthusiasm and blockchain innovation. With a vibrant community, gamified approach, and potential for high returns, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a promising choice for diversifying portfolios and embracing the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation.

The federally chartered custody company will initially allow its customers – ranging from venture capital firms and hedge funds to the treasuries of protocols – to stash a handful of tokens that follow Solana's SPL standard.  Anchorage began adding custody support for Solana (SOL) tokens in 2022 and only added staking support last year. McCauley said the company waited to build out and launch custody support for SPL tokens rather than moving too fast, too soon, for a chain that's taken some lumps.  Even so, ""we're very responsive to what our clients ask for,"" McCauley said.  Many crypto investors tried to write off the Solana ecosystem in early 2023 after FTX imploded and caused significant collateral and reputational damage. But the chain's builders stuck around and users eventually returned to trade, stake and mint new tokens on memecoin launchpads like Pump.fun, one of crypto's revenue-printing machines.  All those memecoins are likely a long way away from getting custody support on Anchorage, despite its expansion for SPL assets.

42417515,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdJd,1722945660,First Mover Americas: Crypto Rebounds From Monday's Chaos,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,782 +8.8%  Bitcoin (BTC): $54,931 +6.4%  Ether (ETC): $2,448 +8.0%  S&P 500: 5,186.33 −3.0%  Gold: $2,455 +2.2%  Nikkei 225: 34,260 +10.2%  Top Stories  Bitcoin regained $56,000 during the Asian morning amid a broader recovery following Monday's rout. The wider crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), is nearly 8% higher than 24 hours ago. Solana's SOL led the gains, adding nearly 13% to trade around $137. XRP and DOGE have risen by around 7.5% and 11.8% respectively. BTC subsequently pulled back to trade around $55,000, some 7% higher on the day. “We might see a corrective rebound in Bitcoin's price,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, told CoinDesk in a Tuesday email. “However, this increase will likely be limited due to the prevailing pessimism in the broader markets.”  Spot ether ETFs saw nearly $49 million of inflows on Monday, even as the ETH price dropped as much as 20%. Ether suffered its biggest single-day drop since 2021, as Jump Crypto moved large amounts of assets to exchanges ahead of potential sales. Professional investors appeared to buy the dip, however, with ETH ETFs trading over $715 million, the highest since July 30. The ETFs remain in the red, however, having recorded net outflows of $460 million since their introduction. Their bitcoin equivalents, in comparison, saw over $1 billion of inflows within their first 12 days.  ARK Invest took advantage of the market slump to buy $17.8 million of Coinbase shares and $11.2 million worth of Robinhood's. The purchases were ARK's first of COIN since June last year and its first of HOOD since February. Coinbase stock lost 7.3% on Monday while HOOD dropped 8.17%. ARK Invest often loads up on shares when their prices slide, usually with a view to offloading them once their prices recover. The company aims to avoid having one particular holding accounting for a weighting of more than 10% of any of its ETFs, which drove much of its COIN sales in recent months.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the daily net inflow of DOGE into wallets tied to centralized exchanges.  On Monday, exchanges recorded a net outflow of $49.11 million worth of DOGE, the highest single-day tally since April 12.  Outflows are usually taken to represent accumulation by investors.  DOGE fell by over 10% Monday, reaching the lowest since February.

32069812,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633361,1722945626,"Bitcoin Rebounds Past $56,000, Ethereum Over $2,500: Key Factors","Bitcoin and crypto markets experienced a robust recovery Tuesday, with Bitcoin surging past the $56,000 mark and Ethereum breaking above $2,500, bouncing back from the “Block Monday.” Yesterday, Bitcoin plummeted over 15%, touching lows near $49,000, while Ethereum dropped by more than 20% to a low of $2,115. The recovery in Bitcoin and crypto paralleled a broader resurgence in global financial markets, driven by several key factors. #1 Nikkei Rebounds, Bitcoin Follows Japan’s primary stock index, the Nikkei 225, experienced a record-breaking recovery following its most significant drop since the 1987 Black Monday crash. The index surged by 10.23%, closing at 34.675,46 points. This rebound came after a sharp 12.4% decline on Monday, spurred by global market instability and looming recession fears in the US, alongside complications arising from the unwinding of the Yen ‘carry trade.’ Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes To $49,000: Key Reasons Explained Popular crypto analyst JACKIS (@i_am_jackis) remarked via X: “I think that crypto right now is reacting to macro conditions but nothing specific IMO is happening to crypto itself. Here is BTC & Nikkei in comparison. When macro conditions settle Bitcoin / crypto should rebound stronger but until then be careful.” #2 ISM Services Data Is Bullish The US Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that its non-manufacturing PMI rose to 51.4 in July from June’s 48.8, which was the lowest since May 2020. This index measures the health of the services sector, which constitutes over two-thirds of the US economy. A PMI above 50 suggests expansion, and the latest data indicates a rebound in service sector activity, easing some concerns over an impending recession. Eric Wallerstein of Yardeni Research expressed relief and cautious optimism about the data: “Woah, maybe the US economy is not crashing? ISM services employment up 5 points to 51.1. Entire PMI in expansion,” he stated via X. Andreas Steno Larsen of Steno Research also commented, highlighting the precariousness of market sentiment: “ISM Services away from the recession zone again. Not sure it is strong enough to convince Markets. We are not trading macro currently. We are trading leveraged stops.” Related Reading: Analyst Warns Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Drop Another 20% Ram Ahluwalia, CEO of Lumida Wealth, added: “ISM Services are *up* reversing the signal from the ISM Manufacturing data last Friday. No recession folks. This is a technical / positioning driven correction. Consider that Earnings are up 12% YOY vs Consensus of 9%. That doesn’t happen at a Recession turning point.” #3 Market Anticipates Aggressive Fed Rate Cuts The financial markets are currently pricing in significant monetary easing by the US Federal Reserve. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there is now a 73.5% probability of a 50 basis points rate cut by September, with a minimal rate cut of 25 basis points now seen as certain. This shift in expectations reflects a drastic change in sentiment compared to just a week ago when the probability of such cuts was much lower. Matt Hougan, CIO at Bitwise, underscored the rapid shift in market dynamics: “One week ago, the market was pricing in an 11% chance of a 50 bps rate cut in September. Today, it’s 100%. Things come at you fast,” he remarked via X. #4 Overblown Reaction The market crash was also exacerbated by what some analysts are calling an overreaction to fears of a US recession. Macro analyst Alex Krüger pointed out the cyclicality of this fear-driven market behavior. “The world suffering from a case of mass hysteria on fears of a US recession. A display of letting price action create a narrative that feeds into price action as everything spirals down in a negative feedback loop. VIX hits 65, third largest spike in history. Then a strong bounce comes this morning on the open while ISM data shows better than expected demand and employment growth,” Krüger remarked. At press time, BTC traded at $56,010.

BoJ's ""Yen-tervention"" led to market complications, the possibility of margin calls, and the unwinding of trades, affecting global markets and creating volatility. With the U.S. Fed moving to cut rates soon, the diverging monetary policies raise questions about global liquidity along with recent weak economic data. However, most of the volatility is expected to be short-term due to the volume of carry-trades unwinding and is expected to put a floor in global markets soon. Global M2 levels and Bitcoin's on-chain metrics see no meaningful change in levels, pointing to a reversal in Bitcoin prices soon. Investment Thesis Markets have lost a lot of ground since my last coverage on Bitcoin ( BTC/USD ), where I was bullish about Bitcoin’s momentum heading into H2. Last month, I explained the positive signs that I observed in the active addresses holding Bitcoin, as well as the cohort balances in these wallets, signaling indications for uptrends in Bitcoin. But within just a week, markets are now in severe turmoil after Japan’s Fed or the BoJ (Bank of Japan) shocked markets with a 25-bp rate hike last week. The implications of that rate hike are now being felt by global markets, with financial institutions looking to cover some of their trades, especially those that have any connection originating from the USD/JPY currency pair. This is definitely going to skew the risk/reward that I originally anticipated for Bitcoin. But I still believe that current market conditions will be felt strongly in the near term, presenting sizable buying opportunities for Bitcoin. I continue to stay bullish on Bitcoin despite the near-term volatility that I expect. Recapping Japan’s “Yen-tervention” & its consequences Two days after I wrote about my previous Bitcoin coverage, the BoJ completely caught markets by surprise hiking rates by 25-bp for the first time in 15 years. In addition, the BoJ also proposed to slow down its gigantic bond buying program which at last count was about ¥6 trillion or $38 billion per month . Exhibit A: Japan's BoJ hikes rates for the first time in 15 years causing concerns of a liquidity crunch. (Reuters) This “Yen-tervention” by the BoJ has complicated matters for the global liquidity system because Japanese financial participants are one of the largest holders , if not the largest holders, of foreign equity and debt in the world. Due to decades of ultra-low interest rates, Japanese financial participants have been allocating their Yen to avenues that offer higher interest rates. Some foreign investors also periodically invest their capital in risk-on modes towards riskier assets such as growth stocks or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The situation becomes riskier if these financial participants borrow Yen, creating liabilities on their books and investing those liabilities in financial assets to take advantage of the interest rate differentials between low-rate environments such as Japan and the rest of the world. This is also called the Yen carry trade, and this is one of the primary scenarios that seem to be unwinding globally as investors are forced to either cover their positions or liquidate them entirely to avoid margin calls. According to J.P. Morgan’s Asia team’s estimates , “around 90 percent of the stocks bought by overseas investors since April 2011 have been dumped over the past few days.” J.P. Morgan's team noted that many market participants saw huge losses as the Japanese Yen accelerated over the weekend and rapidly moved to cut their losses, especially in positions such as “overcrowded momentum trades.” According to J.P. Morgan’s note, until most of the margin trades are cleared out of the system, Japanese markets will lead global markets in searching for a bottom in this market correction cycle. Exhibit B: J.P. Morgan’s Team believes that the current volatility is being led by currency trades cutting losses and unwinding margin trades, impacting risky assets such as Bitcoin. (J.P. Morgan Asia Quant Team via FT) Until markets are globally unable to find any floor in the correction, I would expect volatility in markets, especially risky assets such as Bitcoin and other digital assets. Other Macro Concerns & Their Implications on Bitcoin The other scenario that adds another dimension of complication is that the U.S. Feds are poised to cut rates in the upcoming September meeting next month, especially after Fed Chair Jerome Powell strongly hinted at one possible rate cut next month. This puts the dovish U.S. monetary policy in contrast to the hawkish monetary policy coming from Japan’s BoJ. The contrasting monetary policies will create some more friction for global investors, especially Japanese-originating hedge funds that the Yen carry trade beneficial unless markets recover by that point. To add to the macro concern, the flurry of economic data released last week that fell below expectations has added more concern to the global economic growth engine, including here in the U.S. These developments in these situations in a week have created a rapidly evolving landscape for investors who have moved to quickly trade out of risky assets such as Bitcoin and into risk-off assets such as long bonds, as seen in Exhibit C. Exhibit C: Investors are rotating out of risk-on assets into risk-off assets. (tradingView) My Outlook & Accumulation Plan for Bitcoin Based on the market developments that I highlighted earlier, I expect volatility in Bitcoin to persist in the near term. This volatility may have become even more pronounced after Bitcoin had one of the best starts of its calendar year in 2024, as seen in Exhibit D below, leading to elevated levels of profit-taking and position cuts. Exhibit D: Bitcoin's 2024 YTD Performance Versus Prior Years (Yahoo Finance) The strong start to Bitcoin this year correlates to the point that J.P. Morgan’s Asia team made what I highlighted earlier in this post about momentum trades becoming crowded, chiefly those trades that were propped by margin. Once the markets find a floor after the margin trades unwind, as J.P. Morgan’s team has estimated above, I expect a reversal in Bitcoin’s price. In times like these, I find it crucial to go back to the basics of every asset and review the health of those fundamentals. For example, Bitcoin’s correlation to global M2 is strong. Exhibit E: Recovery in Global M2 will aid the price of Bitcoin (bGeometrics) As long as global M2 continues to recover, I expect Bitcoin’s ascent to regain ground again. I do not see Bitcoin’s notorious volatility changing any fundamentals here, especially as widespread adoption of Bitcoin has been seen recently by crypto ETFs. In fact, I believe that the upcoming interest rate cut from the U.S. Feds will further boost liquidity, helping my case for Bitcoin. Exhibit F: M2 in the U.S. continues to recover, up 0.9% y/y (U.S. Feds) I will keep a close eye on some on-chain metrics, such as address activity and balance cohorts, that I highlighted in my previous coverage last month on Bitcoin. However, so far, there has been no meaningful deterioration in these metrics that I highlighted in my previous post. In fact, the current setup of Bitcoin looks very interesting to me, and I have already allocated some capital at the $52k levels, leaving some more dry powder if Bitcoin moves into the mid-forty thousand levels, as illustrated below. Exhibit G: Bitcoin’s weekly price chart since 2014 (TradingView) Takeaway The notorious volatility that Bitcoin is associated with is currently the risk that is playing out in the markets due to elevated levels of concern arising from a multitude of macro developments. But those risks are not as meaningful, in my opinion, as long as my outlook for liquidity remains strong and Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics look solid. Japan’s BoJ may have shocked market participants enough to revise their valuation levels of risk assets back to earth, and that gets many risk assets, such as Bitcoin, to levels that I deem as buying opportunities. I continue to recommend a Buy on Bitcoin amidst elevated volatility risks. t",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710672-bitcoin-implications-of-japans-yen-tervention-global-liquidity-concerns?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32069790.jpeg

Prominent crypto bridging service Ronin was paused earlier Tuesday after a whitehat hack drained $12 million in tokens from the platform.  ""Earlier today, we were notified by white-hats about a potential exploit on the Ronin bridge. After verifying the reports, the bridge was paused approximately 40 minutes after the first on-chain action was spotted,"" Ronin Network posted on X.  ""Today’s bridge upgrade, after being deployed through the governance process, introduced an issue leading the bridge to misinterpret the required bridge operators vote threshold to withdraw funds.""  A total of 4,000 ether {{ETH}}, worth about $9.8 million at current prices, and $2 million worth of USDC was withdrawn from the bridge. Ronin developers are in talks with the hackers over returning the funds.  ""Whitehat"" typically refers to an individual or entity that attacks or exploits software to identify security vulnerabilities so they can be fixed before being exploited by attackers. Bridges are tools used to transfer tokens between different blockchains where they weren’t originally supported.  In 2022, Ronin Network suffered a $625 million exploit after a hacker “used hacked private keys in order to forge fake withdrawals.” At the time it was one of the largest attacks in decentralized finance (DeFi).  Ronin’s RON tokens, up 6.1% in the past 24 hours amid a broader market rise, were little changed after the announcement.

32066151,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633353,1722940233,"Dogecoin Open Interest Sees Sharp 24% Drop, Where Does Price Go From Here?","The total open interest of any asset can help to narrow down what traders are doing when it comes to a coin, and Dogecoin is no different. As with any metric, a rise or fall within a period of time can be significant as traders choose to take or not take positions in that asset. In Dogecoin’s case, there has been a decline in the open interest over the last week, and this could have some implications for the DOGE price going forward. Dogecoin Open Interest Falls 24% According to data from Coinglass, the Dogecoin open interest has fallen 24% in the last week alone. This figure comes from July 18 when the open interest hit $707 million, going into August, with a total open interest value of $420 million. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Sees Sharp Decline In Major Metric That Threatens To Send XRP Price To $0.2 This decline in the Dogecoin open interest follows the market crash that has rocked cryptocurrencies, eventually sending the DOGE price below $0.09 by Monday. It shows a drastic reduction in the number of open positions, suggesting a reduction in interest. This is not the lowest that the Dogecoin open interest has been this year. However, it is interesting due to the current condition of the market. For example, the Dogecoin price has erased most of its gains from last year, pushing it back toward February 2024 lows. The correlation between the Dogecoin price and the open interest is now more glaring with this crash. In the time that the open interest has fallen 24%, the Dogecoin price has seen around a 40% decrease in price. What Does Historical Data Say? With the correlation between open interest and the Dogecoin price, using historical data could help to narrow down what might be on the horizon for Dogecoin. For example, the last time that the Dogecoin open interest saw a sharp drop, the price also followed. In March 2024, the DOGE open interest peaked at $2.21 billion, and the price saw its highest level so far this year as well. Following this, there was a crash in open interest and the DOGE price went from $0.22 to $0.18 alongside it, all in the month of March. Related Reading: VanEck CEO Compares Bitcoin Adoption To Gold, Reveals Why Price Will Touch $350,000 This suggests that for a recovery to begin for the Dogecoin price, a rise in the open interest would be a good development. If the open interest flattens out from here, then the Dogecoin price could enter a phase of consolidation that could see it tread around $0.08 for a while. Mainly, however, a recovery for the DOGE price would be imminent if the Bitcoin price were to begin rising again. In this case, a market-wide rally would see Dogecoin follow, breaking the current bearish trend.

32066130,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710757-bitcoin-temporary-dip-but-conditions-remain-unfavorable?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1722940218,"Bitcoin: Temporary Dip, But Conditions Remain Unfavorable","Summary Bitcoin's recent drop was likely due to the forced unwinding of leveraged positions, making a short-term rebound likely. Weak employment data in July has also raised concerns about a possible recession, contributing to a decline in risk-on assets. The yen carry trade and ongoing economic risks could continue to pressure asset prices, making caution prudent. While an ongoing deterioration in leading economic indicators has largely been dismissed in recent months, weak employment data in July has placed the spotlight back on the possibility of recession. This has probably contributed to investors souring on risk-assets, but the sharp decline in asset prices at the start of August likely has little to do with fundamentals. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) drop is more likely the result of investors being forced to unwind highly leveraged positions with no regard for price. As a result, a short-term rebound is likely once this process has been completed. Beyond this, Bitcoin's price remains relatively high and is likely to decline significantly if macro conditions continue to weaken. The last time I wrote about Bitcoin , I suggested that based on past halving cycles it could perform well over the next 12 months, but that a sustained upward move would require a supportive macro backdrop and increased demand. While the current dip presented a short-term buying opportunity, I continue to believe that a sustained bull market will likely require a recession followed by a loosening of monetary policy. The Yen Carry Trade The Yen carry trade has probably been an important driver of risk assets over the past few years and is the likely culprit for Bitcoin's recent price drop. The carry trade involves borrowing money at a low interest in Japan, converting it to USD and investing where better yields can be achieved. The widening gap in interest rates between the US and Japan over the past 2 years, has led to a dramatic decline in the value of the Japanese Yen, supporting the returns created by this trade. With Japan recently raising its policy rate, albeit modestly, and the US likely to begin easing in coming months, the value of the Yen has reversed sharply. Highly leveraged traders have likely been forced to exit their positions by this sudden move, with a flow through impact on risk assets caused by indiscriminate selling. While forced selling may be done for the time being, it seems likely that the Yen will continue to appreciate in coming months, putting continuous pressure on traders to unwind the carry trade. Figure 1: USD/JPY Exchange Rate (Created by author using data from The Federal Reserve) Figure 2: US and Japan Central Bank Policy Rates (Created by author using data from The Federal Reserve) Recession Risk A range of labor market indicators show an ongoing slowdown, and this has now moved beyond just a post-COVID normalization. This has largely been ignored in recent months, probably due to the fact that it has had limited impact on many assets so far. With the SAHM rule now having been triggered, the state of the labor market, and the economy more broadly, is the focus of attention. Beyond just headline employment / unemployment numbers, there is a range of indicators showing the weak state of the labor market. For example: Household survey employment numbers have been flat in recent months Private employment growth has been weak Employment is increasingly being driven by part-time employment Temporary employment has been declining sharply Hours worked, and hourly wage growth have been under pressure Job openings and the quit rate continue to decline While data is probably not at a recessionary level yet, this is all very normal in the lead up to a recession. If conditions continue to deteriorate, at some point a negative feedback loop between employment and spending/investment will be created, making a recession unavoidable. Figure 3: Part-Time and Temporary Employment (Created by author using data from The Federal Reserve) Asset Prices While economic risk is currently elevated, this isn't currently reflected in asset prices. In fact, risk-on assets have generally benefited from expectations of looser monetary in recent months, with investors ignoring the possibility of cuts being associated with economic weakness. While I do not believe that the recent drop in equities was driven by economic concerns, the narrative may be in the process of shifting. Second quarter earnings have been underwhelming so far, and rather than reaccelerating, most leading economic indicators suggest an ongoing slowdown. Figure 4: Copper/Gold Ratio and US 10 Year Treasury Yield (Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance and The Federal Reserve) Figure 5: S&P 500 PE Ratio (Created by author) Absence of Volatility The sudden drop in asset prices comes after a period of abnormally low volatility. This low volatility is notable given that asset valuations are generally elevated at the moment and the global economy appears to be stumbling towards a contraction. It has been suggested that low equity volatility is the result of yield enhancement ETFs and mutual funds. These funds sell covered calls or cash secured puts for income, helping to suppress volatility. Total AUM for these funds has risen six-fold since 2019 . While the drop in asset prices on August 5th is unlikely to be repeated, it is reasonable to expect volatility to generally trend higher in coming months, pressuring levered trades and asset prices. Figure 6: VIX and Bitcoin Volatility (source: Created by author using data from The Federal Reserve and Yahoo Finance) Conclusion It is important to note that asset prices are driven by flows, and these flows are often unrelated to fundamentals. For example: Passive inflows from retirement funds Explosion in option volumes and the associated hedging The Yen carry trade Volatility suppression by yield enhancement funds The drop in Bitcoin's price on August 5th was more likely the result of traders exiting highly leveraged positions rather than anything fundamental. As a result, the decline was rapid and excessive, creating a short-term buying opportunity. Investors should be careful buying the dip, though. The Yen carry trade is likely to remain under pressure going forward, and weakening economic conditions could result in increased volatility and lower asset prices going forward. I will probably only become bullish on Bitcoin's prospects if a recession causes a sharp drop in prices and central banks lower interest rates and inject liquidity into the system, creating a more favorable environment for speculative assets.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710757-bitcoin-temporary-dip-but-conditions-remain-unfavorable?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32066130.jpeg

Đà giảm tăng tốc vào ngày 2/8 với mức giảm 6.01% trong ngày, lớn nhất kể từ 2/4, dẫn đến tổng mức giảm 14.52% từ đỉnh đến đáy. Các altcoin, đặc biệt là SOL, còn giảm mạnh hơn nữa . BTC không giữ được ngưỡng hỗ trợ quan trọng $65,580, cho thấy khả năng giảm sâu hơn. Tổng cộng có tới 1.16 tỷ đô bị thanh lý trong 24 giờ qua, chủ yếu là các vị thế long (mua). Dù tâm lý thị trường bi quan và chứng khoán Nhật Bản, Mỹ giảm mạnh, giá được dự đoán sẽ nhích nhẹ lên vùng $55,000. Tuy nhiên, xu hướng chung của thị trường sẽ phụ thuộc vào các yếu tố kinh tế vĩ mô. Sự bất ổn của thị trường nói chung, chịu ảnh hưởng từ các diễn biến kinh tế và chính trị, đang tác động đến cả thị trường tiền điện tử và thị trường tài chính truyền thống. Sự hỗn loạn gần đây trên thị trường chứng khoán Nhật Bản và những tổn thất trên Phố Wall cho thấy sự liên kết chặt chẽ của các thị trường toàn cầu. Mối tương quan của BTC với thị trường tài chính truyền thống đang tăng lên, cho thấy áp lực giảm giá sẽ tiếp tục nếu thị trường chứng khoán tiếp tục suy yếu. Trong khi đó, thị trường lao động Mỹ cho thấy dấu hiệu chậm lại rõ ràng , khi tỷ lệ thất nghiệp tăng lên 4.3%, từ mức thấp kỷ lục 3.4% vào tháng 4 năm 2023. Đây là tỷ lệ thất nghiệp cao nhất kể từ tháng 10 năm 2021. Tăng trưởng việc làm giảm đáng kể, chỉ có 114,000 việc làm mới được tạo ra trong tháng. Mặc dù có những dấu hiệu này, báo cáo về cơ hội việc làm tháng 6 cho thấy sự sụt giảm nhẹ, với dữ liệu của tháng trước được điều chỉnh cho thấy sự chậm lại ổn định nhưng không đáng báo động. Giữa những lo ngại về thị trường lao động này, Ủy ban Thị trường Mở Liên bang (FOMC) đã quyết định giữ nguyên lãi suất quỹ liên bang trong khoảng 5.25 đến 5.5% vào ngày 31 tháng 7, ám chỉ khả năng chuyển sang nới lỏng chính sách tiền tệ thắt chặt của mình. Thêm một điểm tích cực cho bức tranh kinh tế, quý hai đã chứng kiến sự tăng vọt về năng suất lao động, nhấn mạnh sức mạnh và khả năng phục hồi kinh tế liên tục bất chấp những thách thức trên thị trường lao động. Tin tức mới nhất từ thị trường crypto, Genesis Global đã hoàn tất tái cấu trúc và bắt đầu trả khoảng 4 tỷ đô la tài sản kỹ thuật số và đô la Mỹ cho các chủ nợ sau khi phá sản vào tháng 1 năm 2023. Các chủ nợ Bitcoin sẽ thu hồi 51,28%, Ethereum 65,87% và Solana 29,58%, trong khi những người được nợ stablecoin hoặc đô la Mỹ sẽ được hoàn trả đầy đủ. Trong khi đó, MicroStrategy đã mở rộng lượng nắm giữ Bitcoin bằng cách mua thêm 12,222 bitcoin với giá 805,2 triệu đô la trong quý 2 và giới thiệu một KPI mới có tên là BTC yield để đánh giá hiệu quả của chiến lược Bitcoin của mình. Mặc dù tăng trưởng tích cực trong đăng ký phần mềm và việc áp dụng Bitcoin trên toàn cầu, MicroStrategy đã báo cáo khoản lỗ hàng quý đáng kể, không đạt được kỳ vọng về doanh thu và thu nhập. Ngược lại, Tether báo cáo lợi nhuận ròng kỷ lục 5,2 tỷ đô la trong nửa đầu năm 2024, với lợi nhuận hoạt động ròng 1,3 tỷ đô la trong quý 2, nhờ các khoản đầu tư sinh lời và dự trữ. Tính đến ngày 30 tháng 6 năm 2024, tổng dự trữ của Tether cho các token đang lưu hành là 118,4 tỷ đô la, với nợ phải trả là 113,1 tỷ đô la, dẫn đến thặng dư 5,3 tỷ đô la.

42417517,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdHZ,1722936154,Bitcoin's Death Cross Is Looming Again,"The bitcoin price is staring at the death cross, a pattern that trapped bears on the wrong side of the market last September.  BTC's near-term prospects are closely tied to the health of the U.S. economy and volatility in the Japanese yen.  Some indicators are inherently lagging and offer limited predictive power, yet they consistently make headlines in traditional and crypto markets, often resulting in unnecessary panic among inexperienced investors.  One such example is the bitcoin {{BTC}} death cross, which tends to spark heightened fear and impulsive reactions on social media despite its poor record of accurately predicting future price trends. So get ready, because one seems to be on the way.  A death cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of an asset's market price falls below the 200-day SMA. Right now, the bitcoin price's 50-day SMA is at $62,332 and falling, indicating a potential crossover with the 200-day SMA at $61,605.  Latest News: Bitcoin Jumps Above $56K, Solana Leads Recovery From Monday's Rout  The impending crossover indicates that short-term momentum, represented by the 50-day SMA, is underperforming the long-term average.  This development is widely interpreted as a bearish signal and leads to catastrophizing – a cognitive distortion that prompts inexperienced traders to jump to the worst possible conclusion, often with limited information and understanding. Overreaction is typical, especially when sentiment is already sour, as in the BTC market. The cryptocurrency has dropped over 20% to $55,000 in one week, according to CoinDesk data.  In reality, the chart pattern only shows the nature of the price action over the recent 50 days. It doesn't guarantee future moves will follow in the same direction.  The previous death cross confirmed on Sept. 12, 2023, was a major bear trap. BTC bottomed out at $24,900 on the same day and never looked back, eventually reaching new record highs above $70,000 in March this year. Investors who'd positioned for further declines were caught out.  The previous nine death crosses have a mixed record, with only five presaging prolonged downtrends, as CoinDesk discussed last year.  To sum up, the death cross is unreliable as a standalone indicator. Bitcoin's near-term prospects largely depend on the U.S. economic data and the volatility in the Japanese yen. Continued demand for the yen in the foreign exchange markets may further dent carry trades and keep risk assets, including BTC, under pressure.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/06/bitcoins-unreliable-death-cross-is-looming-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db196edf40d7812b062b19433321dc42116f4511-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32062408,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633246,1722934842,"Bitcoin MVRV Lowest Since FTX Crash, Signal To Buy?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has observed a plunge alongside the latest price crash. Bitcoin 30-Day MVRV Ratio Is Now At Lowest Levels Since FTX Collapse As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the 30-day MVRV ratio has just gone through a sharp drop. The “MVRV ratio” refers to a popular on-chain indicator that, in short, tells us about how the value held by the Bitcoin investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the capital put in by them (the realized cap). When the value of this ratio is greater than 1, it means the investors as a whole are carrying an unrealized profit right now. On the other hand, it being under the mark suggests the dominance of loss in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes To $49,000: Key Reasons Explained In the context of the current topic, the MVRV ratio for the entire market isn’t of interest, but that of just a segment of it: the investors who bought their coins within the past 30 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the past couple of years: Note that the 30-day Bitcoin MVRV ratio here is displayed as a percentage, with the zero mark essentially taking the same role as the 1 value in the normal version. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator had shot up to high levels earlier in the year as the asset had witnessed a rapid surge to a new all-time high (ATH). In the consolidation period that had followed this ATH, though, the metric had fallen to oscillation about the zero mark. This sideways trajectory, in the price and the indicator, both, has now finally been broken, as the cryptocurrency has observed a crash. The 30-day MVRV ratio has now slumped to sharp negative values of 17%, meaning that the average investor who bought in the past month is 17% in the red right now. As is apparent in the chart, the last time that the indicator plummeted this low was in November 2022, when the Bitcoin price crashed following the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. “That period marked a bottom and an excellent buying opportunity,” notes the analyst. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Goes Bearish For The First Time Since August 2023, Will It Crash Below $40,000? Generally, when investor profits balloon too much, a top can become likely, as the chances of widespread profit-taking become significant. The price ATH earlier in the year also formed when the indicator had a high value. In times of high losses, though, selling could be assumed to have reached a state of exhaustion, meaning that a rebound could be probable. Bitcoin saw this in effect during the FTX crash, but it only remains to be seen whether a similar fate also lies in store for it this time. BTC Price The early signs of a potential rebound may already be here as the Bitcoin price has made recovery to $54,400 from its low under $50,000.

Meanwhile, some pointed to the resilience of the Ethereum network in the face of the price drop, indicative of strong fundamentals.  U.S.-listed spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded net inflows of nearly $49 million on Monday amid a 20% drop in its price, showcasing demand for the second-largest token by market capitalization.  Ether price cratered as much as 20% on Monday in its biggest one-day price fall since 2021 as prominent crypto trading firm Jump Crypto moved large amounts of the asset to centralized exchanges in preparation for potential sales. A broader crypto market haircut contributed to the selling pressure, with over $340 million in ETH futures liquidations adding to traders' wounds.  Professional investors bought the dip, however. Data tracked by SoSoValue shows ETH ETFs traded over $715 million, the highest since July 30. BlackRock’s ETHA led inflows at $47 million. Fidelity’s FETH and VanEck’s ETHV recorded $16 million in inflows each.  Grayscale’s ETHE was the only product with outflows at $46 million, while the provider’s smaller Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) recorded inflows at $7 million.  However, since they first went live for trading on July 23, the products have recorded net outflows of $460 million, indicating that long-term demand for ETH ETFs has yet to fully appear. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, recorded over $1 billion in net inflows within their first 12 days of trading.  ETF flows help identify market trends and they broadly show where investors are putting their money.  Meanwhile, some market observers pointed out that applications built on the Ethereum network showed resilience amid the steep declines – a sign of strong fundamentals.  “Ether’s disproportionate price drop was largely driven by the Jump Crypto sell-off and liquidation of other whale wallets,” Alice Liu, lead researcher at CoinMarketCap, told CoinDesk in an email. “On a positive note, LSDFi stood up to the stress test: there’s been no major increase in Lido’s withdrawal queue, and no liquid staking depends on different projects.”  LSDFi refers to liquid staking derivatives finance, a colloquial term for staking and derivatives. The process refers to a set of blockchain-based activities that allow users to earn rewards while maintaining liquidity through derivative tokens.  “Another silver lining for ETH is that the recent liquidation seems to have revived the DeFi market, where activities on DeFi started to pick up significantly on the network. Gas fee has also fallen back to a more manageable level of 10-15 Gwei post the 370 Gwei recorded today,” Liu noted, referring to the fees that users pay to use the Ethereum network.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/06/ethereum-etfs-scored-49m-inflows-as-eth-plunged,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/74bb822ec4b2d630f5aeac97d325de793e8fabe0-1371x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The drop in Bitcoin’s value reflects a souring of market sentiment, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index falling significantly. Over $740 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, primarily affecting traders with leveraged exposure to Bitcoin and Ether. Originally published on August 5, 2024 By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices nosedived overnight following excessive selling in the Asian session as market sentiment soured. This was the first Asian session since the US jobs report on Friday, and markets were clearly concerned. The crypto market is often viewed as a good indicator of market sentiment, and Bitcoin’s plunge from $58,000 to $53,000 within two hours revealed a lot. The selloff extended to a range of risk assets, with Bitcoin briefly dipping below the $50,000 mark. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has since recovered and is trading around the $55,000 mark at the time of writing. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is now at 24, which is a sharp drop from the 74 we recorded a week ago. Source: FinancialJuice The sharp downward move in the Asian session led to over $740 million in leveraged positions being wiped out across the crypto market in the last 24 hours, with more than $644 million in leveraged longs being liquidated, according to CoinGlass data. Notably, traders seeking leveraged exposure to Ether were the hardest hit, with over $256 million in ETH longs liquidated, while $231 million in BTC longs were forcibly closed. Source: CoinGlass, Cointelegraph The US session has brought relief to markets, as sentiment appears to have improved. US indices are rising nicely, with the Nasdaq 100 recovering a significant chunk of its pre-market losses. Market participants in some quarters may be eyeing this as a potential ""buy the dip"" opportunity as we have heard in the past. Similar sentiments were echoed by JPMorgan’s head of positioning intelligence, John Schlegel, who said, “Overall, we think we’re getting close to a tactical opportunity to buy-the-dip and our Tactical Positioning Monitor could dip further in the next few days. That said, whether we get a strong bounce or not could depend on future macro data.” Overall, Bitcoin enthusiasts remain bullish over the medium and longer term given that markets are pricing in more aggressive rate cuts. This usually leads to a positive run for crypto, as market participants will have more money in their pocket. Whether the lows are in and the selling is over, that remains to be seen. Technical Analysis BTC/USD From a technical perspective, Bitcoin did not close below the $50,000 mark on the H4 or Daily chart, which is crucial. A candle close below $50,000 is necessary for Bitcoin to test the $45,000 support area. Below this, there’s a key support zone around the $43,000 level, where the rally to all-time highs began back in February. If the $50,000 level holds, Bitcoin could continue to advance, with immediate resistance at the 56,561 and 58,586 levels. A push beyond these levels will shift focus to the 50-, 100-, and 200-day moving averages (MAs), which all lie within a $3,000 range between 61,538 and 64,350.

Particularly, according to the Cardano foundation, the blockchain stands out in July for its notable increase in on-chain activity, despite broader market setbacks. The data provided by the Foundation reveals that the network is not only sustaining but also building momentum, a sign of resilience and growing user engagement. Cardano July Growth Regarding the network’s health, statistics revealed by the foundation show that Cardano saw a modest yet worthy increase in transactions to 94.6 million, up by 1.62% from the previous month. Related Reading: Cardano Goes Toe-To-Toe With Ethereum As Whales Scoop Up 120 Million ADA This uptick is dissected into varied transaction types, showcasing a diverse usage of the blockchain. Among these, 37% were smart contracts, reflecting the network’s strong capabilities beyond simple transactions, which accounted for 38%. Additionally, 25% involved metadata without smart contracts, highlighting the blockchain’s adaptability and the wide array of applications it supports. The foundation’s data also detailed growth in several other key areas of the Cardano network, underlining the technological advancement and deepening user involvement. Plutus scripts, which are essential for running smart contracts on Cardano, saw a rise of 1.88%, totalling 6,659. This increase is a direct reflection of the growing developer activity and the deployment of more complex applications on the platform. Moreover, the ecosystem saw a growth in native tokens, up by 1% to 10.2 million, and an even more significant rise in policies, which surged 7.6% to reach 150,477. Wallet statistics also paint a picture of broadening participation within the Cardano community. The total number of Cardano wallets increased by 0.71% to 4.84 million, with delegated wallets slightly up by 0.02% to 1.35 million. This marginal growth in delegated wallets suggests a stable interest in staking and governance participation among ADA holders. ADA Current Market Performance Regardless of this notable growth in Cardano’s on-chain activities last month, the blockchain’s native token ADA has joined in on the global crypto market downturn. Over the past 24 hours alone, ADA has recorded a roughly 7.1% decrease in its value. Related Reading: Hoskinson Claims Cardano Will Flip Bitcoin As Leading Crypto This decline has brought the asset to currently trade at a price of $0.3202, at the time of writing—a slight increase from the price tag of $0.2789 seen earlier today. Interesting, despite this plunge, ADA’s 24-hour trading volume has surge significantly from below $400,000 as of yesterday to roughly above $1.250 million as at the time of writing.

32057511,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633262,1722927644,Investors Pull Back: $528 Million Vanishes From Crypto Funds Amid Economic Fear,"The global economic market has now so far shown increasing signs of instability which appears to have impacted the overall crypto investment sector negatively. Recent data from CoinShares has revealed a reversal in the flow of funds, with crypto investment products experiencing significant weekly outflows. As reported by CoinShares, this outflow marks the first time in over a month that the net balance has tipped from “accumulation to liquidation,” highlighting investor anxiety amid recession fears in the United States. Deciphering The Crypto Fund Flows: Was There Any Green? Analyzing the geographical distribution of these outflows presents a nuanced view of the current market stance. The report from CoinShares revealed that US-based funds were the hardest hit, recording net outflows of $531 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Potential: Analyst Maps Path To $700,000 And Beyond This figure was heavily influenced by a significant sell-off on Friday, where net outflows totalled $237.4 million, overshadowing any inflows earlier in the week. The bulk of these withdrawals were from Bitcoin-based products, which saw a $400 million exit, ending five weeks of consecutive net inflows. Notably, there was a slight uptick in investments into Short Bitcoin funds, which garnered $1.8 million, marking their first significant inflows since June. Conversely, certain regions displayed resilience or even optimism amidst the downturn. Swiss and Canadian markets bucked the trend by registering net inflows of $28 million and $17 million, respectively. This suggests that some investors are viewing the price declines as buying opportunities, possibly anticipating a market recovery. Ethereum-specific products also mirrored this volatile trend. Globally, Ethereum investment vehicles reported net outflows of $146 million. The US spot Ethereum ETFs were particularly affected, with $169.4 million leaving these funds. However, this was part of a larger narrative where new Ethereum ETFs saw roughly about $433.6 million in net inflows, only to be overshadowed by $603 million in net outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE fund. Behind The Outflows The total of $528 million withdrawn from various crypto asset investment products last week alone comes on the heels of several notable economic pressures. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, particularly attributed this exodus to mounting concerns over what they believe to be “a reaction to fears of a recession in the US, geopolitical concerns and consequent broader market liquidations across most asset classes.” This mass withdrawal, according to Butterfill also coincided with a sharp market correction that erased roughly $10 billion from the total Exchange Traded Products (ETP) Assets Under Management (AUM) at the week’s close.

42417520,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdLh,1722927402,These Two Bitcoin Indicators Offer Light in a Gloomy Market,"BTC's long-term options market indicator continues to signal bullish bias.  Key indicator shows signs of bargain hunting during the price drop.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has had a horrible August, falling over 13% to as low as $50,000 in the first five days due to several factors, including the unwinding of yen carry trades and concerns about the U.S. economy.  Still, market participants can find encouragement in at least two indicators, the first of which is connected to bitcoin options listed on the leading exchange Deribit.  Long-term options skew remains bullish  Despite the market swoon, bitcoin's 180-day call-put skew remains flat-lined above 3, indicating a bias for price strength over six months, data tracked by Amberdata show.  A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a specific price at a later date and represents a bullish bet on the market. A put represents a bearish bet. Options skew measures investors' willingness to pay for an asymmetric bullish or bearish payout. Positive values suggest relatively stronger demand for upside or calls.  The bullish long-term pricing is consistent with some observers' view that once the initial shock from global market volatility dissipates, bitcoin will regain ground.  ""The U.S. slowdown looks clearly underway, and the Fed, behind the curve, will need to cut more aggressively than previously expected. U.S. [Treasury] yields and the dollar are consequently repricing lower, which is hugely bullish for bitcoin. Further, with China ramping up stimulus and liquidity injections, combined with a weaker dollar, global liquidity conditions are set to accelerate,"" the founders of newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said in Monday's edition.  ""Bitcoin, for us, looks the most obvious trade for a Fed that is behind the curve and set to slash rates and ramp up liquidity. Strap in for a volatile few weeks, but don’t lose sight of the big picture,"" founders added.  CVD suggests dip-buying. on U.S. exchanges  The rapid sell-off has been characterized by dip buying on platforms available in the U.S., such as Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, according to cumulative volume delta (CVD) tracked by Paris-based Kaiko.  The CVD is the total difference between the volume of trades executed at the ask price (buying) and trades executed at the bid price (selling) over a specific period. A rising positive CVD indicates that buying volume exceeds selling volume, while a falling and negative CVD indicates otherwise.  The CVD on Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken has mostly held positive since Aug. 1, indicating net buying pressure or bargain hunting during price losses.  ""Interestingly, while offshore exchanges such as Binance and OKX saw strong selling since Friday, BTC’s cumulative volume delta (CVD) on most US platforms remained positive, suggesting that some traders bought the dip,"" Kaiko said in a note published Monday.

42417507,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdAL,1722927339,Binance Challenges $86M  Indian Tax Showcause Notice: Source,"Binance has been issued a tax showcause notice of nearly $86 million in India.  Binance has challenged the notice, which covers the period June 2017-March 2024, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is challenging a nearly $86 million tax showcause notice from India's Directorate General of Goods and Services Tax Intelligence (DGGI), a person directly involved with the matter told CoinDesk.  DGGI's chapter from the western city of Ahmedabad issued the notice – a first formal step taken by the authority when it suspects a violation of tax rules – last week. It alleges Binance collected fees from Indian customers trading on its platform, the person said, and relates to the period July 2017-March 2024.  While DGGI has previously taken action against Indian crypto exchanges, this may be the first time it has issued a showcause notice to an international crypto exchange. The DGGI is entrusted with “collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence relating to evasion of indirect tax” and functions under the purview of the Ministry of Finance.  ""We are currently reviewing the details of the notice and are fully cooperating with the Indian tax authorities,"" a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk via email.  DGGI did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  In June 2024, Binance was fined about $2.2 million for providing services to Indian clients without adhering to the nation's anti-money laundering rules. The process also saw the exchange winning Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) approval as a registered entity. The DGGI's investigation is independent from the FIU.  It's worth noting that showcause notices do not always result in monetary penalties. Earlier this month, the DGGI dropped part of its allegations against Bengaluru, India-based Infosys after the global tech company challenged such a demand.  Read More: The Inside Story of How India’s Crypto Exchanges Were ‘Inspected’ by Tax Agencies  Binance is said to have earned more than $476 million (40 billion rupees) in transaction fees that were transferred to a Binance Group company, the Seychelles-based Nest Services, the Economic Times reported citing a source privy to the development.  ""Binance is, and has always been, committed to adhering to relevant domestic legislations applicable to us,"" the company spokesperson said.  The services provided fall under the category of Online Information and Database Access or Retrieval Services (OIDAR), the person familiar said. These are services provided through the internet and received by the recipient online without having any physical interface with the service supplier. The categorization exists to avoid giving an unfair advantage to overseas service providers over an Indian service provider.

32055052,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633295,1722924049,Analyst Warns Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Drop Another 20%,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw a 20% price drop over the weekend, briefly losing the $50,000 support level. The rest of the market followed the flagship cryptocurrency, crashing around 23% in the last three days. Since then, the crypto market has momentarily reclaimed some key levels, but analysts fear the bleeding isn’t over yet. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Following Bitcoin’s drop below $50,000, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared his thoughts on BTC’s performance. To him, the flagship cryptocurrency hit one of its possible bottoms on Monday morning after reaching the $49,000 support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Goes Bearish For The First Time Since August 2023, Will It Crash Below $40,000? The massive drop to the $49,000-$50,000 area, which represented a 17% fall in less than 24 hours, could be the bottom, said Sherpa. However, he believes lower support levels will likely be tested in the coming days. Per the post, the analyst won’t be “sitting comfortably” until BTC prices test the $40,000-$47,000 area, as these levels “got a lot more support.” Bitcoin’s current price action reminds the analyst of its performance during the 2021 rally. At the time, BTC saw the January consolidation area “be the key focal point for the temporary bottom” during that summer. The summer 2021 violent dump, which resembles the current crash, was followed by a bottom that “formed over several months.” Based on this, Sherpa believes that the January 2024 price range could be the key area to watch. He also reaffirmed his previous forecast for the cycle, which asserted that the market would resume its run during Q4 2024 and continue throughout Q1 2025: What’s going to happen after this dump is anyone’s guess; my personal one is that we chop around for the next several months after this dump is over and then have a great Q4-Q1 of 2025. Survive until then. BTC Sees The Cycle’s Deepest Retrace Yet According to Rekt Capital, the recent Bitcoin crash officially became the deepest retrace of the cycle. BTC saw 23% and 25% drops in May and July, respectively, which have now been surpassed by the 29% drop registered in the last two weeks. Trader and market analyst Crypto Bullet also weighed in on the current BTC performance. To the analyst, Bitcoin’s chart is reminiscent of the COVID-19 crash in 2020, displaying a similar Descending Broadening Wedge pattern. Per the post, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization saw a similar dump in March 2020, followed by a price recovery and breakout from the pattern in the coming months. Similarly, BTC tested the lower support levels within the pattern on Monday morning, which could suggest the price is poised to recover soon. Nonetheless, Crypto Jelle believes that Bitcoin’s price is testing key levels on this weekly opening. To him, BTC is “still holding inside the descending broadening wedge and holding sensible area of support.” Due to this performance, Jelle considers that “the higher the day end, the better.” Related Reading: MATIC: Market Nosedive Leads To 30% Wipe In Value Lastly, renowned analyst Ali Martinez stated that Bitcoin must reclaim the $54,000 support level to prevent dropping to the $40,000 mark. Based on BTC’s MVRV Pricing Bands, the analyst believes the flagship cryptocurrency could soon retest the $67,000 resistance level if it holds the current price. As of this writing, BTC has recovered 8.8% from its fall, trading at $54,320.

Institutional investors sold spot ETFs Monday.  Bitcoin (BTC) zoomed above $56,000 early Tuesday amid a broader market recovery in Asia as bargain hunters stepped in after Monday's steep price slide.  CoinGecko data shows that BTC added 6%, its highest 24-hour price increase since May, triggering a wider market recovery. Ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) added 8%, BNB Chain’s BNB rose 12%, and Solana’s SOL surged as much as 16%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index of the largest tokens by market capitalization minus stablecoins, jumped 7.26% and recorded over $95 million in trading volumes.  Japan's Topix jumped about 10% as the yen weakened against the U.S. dollar, snapping a five-day surge. Futures tracking the S&P 500 rose 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.1%. Renewed hopes for faster Fed rate cuts in the wake of Monday's global market slide seem to have restored risk sentiment.  Read More: Bitcoin's Unreliable Death Cross Is Looming Again  Still, crypto market watchers remain cautious about a continued rally among major tokens.  “We might see a corrective rebound in Bitcoin's price,” Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, told CoinDesk in a Tuesday email. “However, this increase will likely be limited due to the prevailing pessimism in the broader markets.”  “Overall, the recent drop in Bitcoin's price is not significantly worse than the decline in the Nikkei index, indicating that the current sentiment is driven by external factors rather than issues within the crypto market itself,” Ruslan said. “It is unclear if we are entering a bearish market, and much will depend on the performance of the equity markets this month.”  On Monday, the crypto and global stock markets experienced one of their deepest losses in recent years. A strong Japanese yen triggered an unwinding of carry trades, accelerating a sell-off that started last week due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.  Japan’s Topix 100 index posted its most significant drop since 2011.

32026803,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633289,1722920637,BTC vs MPEPE: Top Analysts Compare Profit Potential Between Bitcoin (BTC) & New Cryptocurrency,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, celebrated for its pioneering role in the digital asset space. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) has established itself as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty. Historically, BTC has demonstrated significant volatility, with notable price surges and dips that have shaped its reputation as both a high-risk and high-reward investment. Current Market Challenges Despite its established status, Bitcoin (BTC) faces several challenges.

New Address Tied To Crypto Mogul Justin Sun Purchases 16,000 ETH","The cryptocurrency market has been rocked by a seismic sell-off over the past 24 hours, with the two largest digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), plummeting over 20% in value. At the epicenter of the chaos is one of the industry’s biggest names – Justin Sun, the founder of the TRON blockchain. On-chain data suggests that Sun may have used the pullback to scoop up millions of dollars worth of Ethereum at discounted prices. Market Meltdown Wipes Out $600 Billion According to a Fortune report, this market upheaval unfolded against a backdrop of widespread stock market sell-offs triggered by a disappointing jobs report and perceived inaction by the Federal Reserve (Fed). Despite recent positive developments in the crypto sector, such as the launch of Ethereum ETFs in the US in July, digital assets mirrored the stock market downturn. The total crypto market cap tumbled from over $2.5 trillion on July 28 to approximately $1.9 trillion on Monday, marking the most substantial loss since 2022. Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Goes Bearish For The First Time Since August 2023, Will It Crash Below $40,000? Crypto market maker Wintermute, described the crypto plunge to Fortune as “unexpected,” and attributed it to the US jobs report. The firm noted liquidations surpassing $1 billion in digital asset positions overnight, along with a $57 billion decline in altcoin market capitalization. Noteworthy was a selloff from Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm that had played a significant role in the crypto industry before scaling back amid collapses and regulatory scrutiny. On-chain data by Spot On Chain indicate Jump moving $47 million worth of Ethereum to centralized exchanges (CEXs), though Wintermute cautioned against oversimplifying market movements by attributing them solely to Jump’s actions. Sun’s Ethereum Shopping Spree Amid this market turmoil, attention turned to Justin Sun, the founder of the TRON blockchain. Reports surfaced of a suspicious address linked to Sun buying 16,236 ETH with 37 million USDT stablecoin, as ETH plummeted to $2,112 on Monday, with an average purchase price of $2,279. The address, created three hours prior, allegedly withdrew 38 million USDT from the HTX exchange before acquiring the ETH tokens. It is further alleged that this address belongs to Sun due to its behavior mirroring previous ETH purchases by him. Related Reading: Why Is The Shiba Inu Price Crashing Today? Notably, Sun reportedly holds over 700,000 ETH, with recent data showing a substantial loss of around $280 million as Ethereum’s value dropped by 20%. Since February 8, 2024, Sun allegedly accumulated 377,590 ETH across three wallets, costing an estimated $1.15 billion. Despite Ethereum trading well below his average buying price of $3,051, Sun has denied rumors of liquidation. In a social media post, Sun stated: The rumors about our positions being liquidated are false. We rarely engage in leveraged trading strategies because we believe such trades do not significantly benefit the industry. Instead, we prefer to engage in activities that provide greater support to the industry and entrepreneurs, such as staking, running nodes, working on projects, and helping project teams provide liquidity.

The price is now facing hurdles at $490 and might remain at risk of another decline. BNB price started a recovery wave from the $400 support zone. The price is now trading below $500 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $490 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair could start another decline if it fails to clear the $490-$500 resistance zone. BNB Price Faces Key Hurdles In the past few days, BNB price gained bearish momentum below $500 like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price declined below the $450 and $435 support levels before the bulls emerged. A low was formed at $403 and recently started a recovery wave. The price climbed above the $435 and $440 resistance levels. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $576 swing high to the $403 low. It even cleared the $465 resistance. The price is now trading below $500 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is now consolidating near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $576 swing high to the $403 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $490 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $490 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $500 level. A clear move above the $500 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $515. A close above the $515 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $540 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $550 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $465 level. The next major support is near the $450 level. The main support sits at $435. If there is a downside break below the $435 support, the price could drop toward the $420 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $400 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone.

The market expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 bps in September. Easing conditions should be a tailwind for fiat-hedge assets. August and September are historically weak for Bitcoin seasonality. If you liked Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at $68k, you love it at $55k, right? Maybe. When I covered BTC for Seeking Alpha at the end of July, investors were fresh off the emotional highs of a Bitcoin 2024 conference that had everything from multi-million dollar price targets to lofty US fiscal policy propositions that would put BTC into a production deficit immediately if actually enacted. We are less than a full week from that article, and the emotional read on the market is quite a bit different from it was when that piece was published: Fear and Greed Index (Alternative.me) On July 29th, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index was comfortably in ""greed"" at a 74 reading. As of article submission just six days later , that reading is now near its lowest ""fear"" reading in the last 52 weeks. What Changed? That depends on what your expectations are. If you're a HODLer who wants BTC exposure purely for the dollar debasement angle, nothing changed. If anything, the setup for that thesis may actually be better given the CME FedWatch rate probabilities for September: September Rate Probabilities (CME FedWatch) A week ago, there was just an 11% chance of a 50 bps cut in September. As of 5p on August 5th, the market is assigning an 83% probability of a 50 bps cut, and potentially for good reason. Since my July 29th Bitcoin article, we've seen unemployment trigger the Sahm-rule, the near un-inversion of US 10s and 2's, July employment miss by 71k jobs, and ISM manufacturing disappoint. The equity market reaction to all of this was negative, as the S&P 500 closed the last week of July down over 2%. Thus, the market expects the Federal Reserve to cut. With the S&P 500 just 9% off its highest levels in human history a few weeks ago, there have even been calls from some for the Fed to do an emergency rate cut before the next FOMC meeting. While a cut is by no means a return to ZIRP or stimmy checks, it does theoretically incentivize a rotation out of t-bills and back into risk assets like Bitcoin, equities, or precious metals. However, I suspect rate cuts may actually exacerbate one of the underlying problems; namely, the potential unwinding of the Japanese Yen carry trade. USDJPY Daily Chart (TrendSpider) After topping out at 162 in early July, the Yen has been an absolute wrecking ball and has now gained over 12% against the dollar in just three weeks. For investors who borrow in Yen at virtually no cost and then deploy the cheap capital in Dollar-denominated assets, Yen strength against USD is bad because it can lead to the opposite of the intended carry trade strategy. The Bank of Japan hiking coupled with Yen strength are just one part of what can unravel the capital invested in this strategy. Data by YCharts The Federal Reserve cutting theoretically hurts the carry trade as well because the spread between BOJ rates and Fed rates gets tighter and therefore less attractive. I realize that the spread is still quite large, but BOJ hiking while the US debt yields fall is not what Yen carry traders want to see. What Does This Have To Do With Bitcoin? As is often the case when there is panic in global markets, indiscriminate selling of assets helps traders who are offsides raise capital quickly to cover any potential margin calls they're facing. Given that the $20 trillion carry trade is debt-based, margin calls on such a massive short-term move in the Yen against the Dollar are highly likely to be driving these broad market selloffs. We saw instances of panic selling just about everywhere on August 5th: The S&P fell by 3.0% The Nasdaq shed 3.4% Gold dropped by 1.5% Bitcoin fell by 6% and it was much worse intraday Pearson Correlation (The Block) Only Gold actually had a positive Pearson Correlation with Bitcoin on August 2nd, yet everything went down together on Monday, August 5th. If you believe BTC is 'digital gold,' this selloff was perhaps a 'baby out with the bathwater' kind of session. BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) It's worth noting, Bitcoin recovered over $5k from the intraday low of $49k on Monday, August 5th. In the chart above, I've added the aforementioned Crypto Fear and Greed Index to the chart of Bitcoin. We can observe how closely it has resembled the daily moves in the RSI going back to the approvals of the spot ETFs in mid-January. The last time the index was this low, it preceded a 20+ percent rally over June and July. Weak Seasonality Back in early-July, I highlighted the seasonality for Bitcoin via the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). At that time, I made the case that July was historically a good month for GBTC, and we saw that generally hold up, with BTC gaining 3.1% in the month. It now bears mentioning that the seasonality story is much less rosy for Bitcoin for August and September: BTC Seasonality (TrendSpider) Going back to the last decade, August and September are typically the worst months of the year for BTC, both from a mean change standpoint and a positive period standpoint. August is typically close to flat historically for BTC, but that's largely skewed by two large outliers. The best August return for Bitcoin was 64.7% back in 2017. The next best August performance was 13.6% in 2021. In each of these instances, the Augusts in the years following the Bitcoin halving years have been phenomenal times to own BTC. 2024 is a halving year. Meaning, it would be August 2025 rather than August 2024 that should be the trend outlier, judging from history. Of course, there is certainly the argument that spot ETFs change the supply/demand structure that we've typically seen following Bitcoin halvings. I'm actually of the view that there is something to this, given BTC making a new all-time before the halving this time around. iShares Bitcoin Trust We have long since passed the point of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) offering a full fee waiver on the 0.25% expense ratio. The waiver, which was good for the first $5 billion in AUM, is essentially immaterial at this point since the $21 billion in AUM puts the weighted average expense ratio closer to 0.22%. To be clear, this still makes IBIT among the cheapest ways to get exposure to Bitcoin in the market: Data by YCharts Compared with the other spot BTC ETFs that were approved in January, IBIT ranks closer to the top than the bottom based on total return. That said, with the exception of GBTC, most of these spot funds have a total return within about 50 bps of each other. If one cares deeply about long-term holding, there are cheaper funds than IBIT. However, if trading BTC in a tax-advantaged account is the primary goal, IBIT is arguably the strongest offering of the group given its AUM and liquidity. Spot ETF Volume Share (The Block) It is far and away the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by AUM, after having passed Grayscale's flagship fund earlier this year. But perhaps the most important feature of IBIT is the fund's share of spot BTC ETF market volume. When the funds launched in January, IBIT came strong out of the gate, with 15-20% volume share in a typical trading session. That share of volume has continued to grow as the months of progressed. Now, it's rare to find a session where IBIT doesn't make up more than half of spot BTC ETF volume share. Investor Takeaways While jarring, the recent weakness in BTC has not been an isolated incident. The global financial markets are broadly experiencing stress in what is a bit of a perfect storm of events; a clearly weakening US economy, the Yen carry trade, and recessionary indicators flashing warning signs. In my opinion, it's important to remember what Bitcoin represents to the people who believe in its digital gold narrative. In spite of its downsides, of which there are several , Bitcoin is indeed a decentralized network with a supply capped asset that isn't state-issued or managed. Owning Bitcoin has proven to be a terrific way to express perceived flaws in the fiscal/monetary system as an investment thesis. A market thesis over a business thesis perhaps, but a thesis, nonetheless, just like long or short any commodity. Bitcoin made a new all-time high with t-bill rates at 5.5%. With cuts likely on the way, I suspect we'll see any further weakness in BTC scooped up by the HODLers. I think IBIT is still a buy.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710706-ishares-bitcoin-trust-etf-ibit-carry-trade-casualty?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32051977.jpeg

According to the popular CEO, Bitcoin is set to witness an exponential surge to $350,000, driven by an adoption rate on par with gold. Bitcoin Set To Hit Ambitious $350,000 Target In an exclusive interview with Fox Business on August 2, Van Eck predicted that the price of Bitcoin could surge as high as $350,000. As one of the issuers of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Van Eck is keenly aware of the volatility in the Bitcoin market and the cryptocurrency’s propensity for unexpected price fluctuations. Related Reading: Can XRP Rally 1,000X Despite The Drop Below $0.6? Despite these challenges, the CEO remains highly optimistic about the future value of Bitcoin. He highlights that other crypto bulls have an even more bullish perspective, with some forecasting that the price of one Bitcoin could soar to an astonishing price target of $2.9 million. While a $2.9 million price prediction might seem highly ambitious, Van Eck acknowledges that it could potentially be achieved within a few decades, specifically by 2050. The CEO has rooted his bullish expectations on the rapid adoption rate of Bitcoin in the financial sector. As the first and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth over the years. It reached an all-time high of about $69,000 in 2021 and surpassed this milestone in 2024, surging above $73,000 following the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The cryptocurrency has also had an impressive adoption rate, with the number of BTC wallets reaching hundreds of millions globally. Van Eck has revealed that “Bitcoin is becoming adopted the way gold is.” The CEO projects that Bitcoin is poised to reach 50% of the total market capitalization of gold. According to reports, gold’s current market capitalization is about $16.6 trillion, while Bitcoin’s stands at $1.04 trillion. Based on Van Eck’s predictions, Bitcoin is set to reach a substantial market capitalization of approximately $8.3 trillion. This massive increase in market value would significantly boost the price of the cryptocurrency, allowing it to potentially reach the aforementioned $350,000 price target. BTC Could Be In Its Worst Performing Month This Year Despite witnessing impressive gains earlier in July, Bitcoin has experienced a major pullback in its price. Previously, the cryptocurrency surged as high as $70,000 but experienced a strong rejection before dropping in value. Related Reading: Ethereum Crash A Buying Opportunity? This Whale Thinks So According to CoinMarketCap, BTC has crashed by a whopping 23.95% over the past seven days. The cryptocurrency is still on a significantly downward trend, experiencing another 12.32% decrease in the last 24 hours. In light of this bearish trend, crypto analyst, Ali Martinez revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that historically, Bitcoin’s price tends to witness the worst performance between the months of August and September. With the recent downturn and a price crash to $52,859 this August, it seems history might be repeating itself. However, Martinez has indicated that Bitcoin’s TD sequential is presenting a buy signal, suggesting a potential rebound could be in sight.

32047590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633252,1722913254,Bitcoin Drops Hard: Time To Fade The Trend And Buy BTC?,"Bitcoin is under immense selling pressure at spot rates, crashing below critical multi-month support at around the $53,500 to $56,000 zone. As bears take over, there are concerns that the coin could, after all, slip even lower, plunging towards the $50,000 and even $40,000 level in a bear trend continuation formation. Bitcoin Sellers Testing Resolve Of Determined Active Investors Despite the prevailing doubts, several on-chain indicators point to strength. Notably, one analyst observed that Bitcoin prices have dipped below the “moderate risk lower boundary of 9% from the average purchase price of active investors” for the fifth time in eighteen months. If history guides, prices are likely to bounce from spot rates, peeling back sharp losses posted over the weekend and into early Monday, August 5. Looking at price data, the average purchase price for these active investors (or addresses that bought BTC within the last 155 days) currently stands at $48,000. Related Reading: Chainlink: Market Panic Shaves 23% Off LINK Price – Details Earlier today, August 5, when prices crashed, BTC tumbled to as low as $49,000 before bouncing higher. Therefore, even with the drop, most active investors are not yet in full panic mode. Challenges will emerge once the $48,000 level is breached, testing the resolve of these investors. For now, looking at how intense the dump was and the accompanying trading volume, it is clear that bulls are not out of the woods yet. Should BTC fall again in the coming session, breaching $50,000 and $48,000, weak hands might choose to exit, fueling the sell-off. BTC In A Bearish Formation After Drop: Time To Take A Contrarian Approach And Buy? Technically, Bitcoin is now within a bearish breakout formation after the close below the consolidation. With July gains sharply reversed, losses spilling over throughout this week are highly likely. From this outlook, Bitcoin may slip to $40,000 in a bear trend continuation formation. Currently, from price active, one analyst also noted that the Bitcoin market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio is at levels last seen when FTX collapsed in November 2022. The MVRV ratio gauges whether the coin is available for a discount or not. Related Reading: Ethereum ETFs Struggles To Have a Positive Impact On Price, Whilst Investors Purchase Now Crypto at $0.00107 Though the coin briefly tanked to as low as $15,800, the recovery afterwards anchored the bull run of 2023 through to early 2024.

Bitcoin Has Plunged By More Than 15% During The Last 24 Hours Bitcoin investors have been dealt a shock to open Monday, with the cryptocurrency having crashed by more than 15%, which has taken its price to the $51,500 mark. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price (DOGE) Slips Alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum: Market Analysis The below chart shows how the recent trajectory has looked like for the asset: From the graph, it’s visible that the latest sharp plunge in the BTC price is just an acceleration of the trend that the asset had already been witnessing since the last couple of days of July. On the 29th, the cryptocurrency was floating around the $70,000 mark, meaning that it had come down by more than 26% in only a week. Following this drawdown, Bitcoin is now back to the same level as that just before the late February rally, which went on to culminate in a new price all-time high (ATH). While BTC has had it bad during the past day, altcoins have in general had it even worse. Ethereum (ETH), BNB (BNB), and Solana (SOL), the three largest coins next to the original (excluding the stablecoin Tether), have all seen higher losses of 23%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. With prices across the sector crashing down, it’s not surprising to see that long investors have taken a heavy blow over on the derivatives side of the market. Crypto Liquidations Have Crossed $1 Billion, Majority Are Long Contracts The latest volatility in the various assets has meant the derivatives market has gone through chaos over the past 24 hours, as the data from CoinGlass below shows. As is visible in the table, a whopping $1.1 billion in cryptocurrency derivatives contracts have found liquidation in this period. “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the process any contract undergoes after amassing losses of a certain degree, where its platform forcibly closes it up. An extreme majority of these liquidations, around 85% to be more precise, involved the long holders. This is a natural consequence of the market as a whole going through a crash. Interestingly, though, despite the sharp plummet, $173 million in shorts still managed to get liquidated, which isn’t really a small amount. Thus, it would appear that a large amount of investors only put their bearish bets in when the crash was already finished. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Plunge Deepens: What Could Prevent a Recovery? In terms of the individual symbols, Bitcoin and Ethereum have contributed to the mass liquidation event by nearly the same degrees, witnessing liquidations of $367 million and $350 million, respectively. Clearly, BTC is still ahead, but by only a small amount, which is not usually the case. The reason behind ETH’s high liquidations may be the fact that the recent launch of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had put more attention on the second largest coin by market cap.

42417512,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYdFV,1722907266,SEC Asks NY Court to Deny Coinbase’s ‘Breathtakingly Broad’ Subpoena Request,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complained to a federal judge that Coinbase tried to dig too deep when it went after the records of agency Chair Gary Gensler.  The SEC made the latest filing in the court case in which the regulator is pursuing the U.S. exchange for violating securities laws.  Lawyers for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are pushing back against what they describe as Coinbase’s “breathtakingly broad” subpoena requests searching for “essentially all documents that in any way relate to crypto.”  The court documents, filed Monday, are the latest jab in the ongoing fight between the SEC and Coinbase over the crypto exchange’s attempt to subpoena the agency and its employees, including Chair Gary Gensler, for communications and other records that could potentially be useful for Coinbase’s defense in its upcoming trial against the regulatory agency.  The SEC filed civil charges against Coinbase last year, accusing the crypto exchange of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The SEC also charged Coinbase with the unregistered sale of securities in connection with its staking products.  In April, Coinbase served the SEC with its first request for the production of documents. Two months later, Coinbase told the SEC that it also planned to subpoena Gensler’s personal communications related to crypto over the course of his tenure, plus four years before he was appointed Chairman. Coinbase also served a similar subpoena on Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where Gensler taught a class on blockchain technology before joining the SEC. However, the company recently informed the court that it wouldn't seek records from outside his agency role.  Read More: Coinbase Narrows Demand for SEC Chair Gensler's Crypto Messages  The request for Gensler’s personal communications appears to have been a bridge too far for the SEC, which has described the subpoena as a “blatant impropriety.” In a letter to the court on June 28, the SEC argued that the judge overseeing the case, District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), should reject Coinbase’s request.  Failla called for a pre-trial conference, held by phone on July 11, to discuss the competing requests. From the outset, Failla appeared to be bewildered by Coinbase’s request for Gensler’s personal communications, particularly those predating his appointment as SEC Chairman.  “I was kind of surprised and not in a good way,” Failla said of Coinbase’s motion on July 11. “I found the arguments, at least as articulated in the July 3rd response, to border on the fatuous… I was not moved by basically any of the arguments.”  Failla sent Coinbase back to the drawing board, ordering its lawyers to file a motion to compel as a starting point for the parties to work through the discovery dispute. Following the conference, Coinbase submitted its motion to compel to the court on July 23, slightly narrowing the scope of its request but otherwise sticking to its guns.  ""If the SEC is going to engage in an unprecedented regulation by enforcement campaign, the least they owe to those they – and the public – is transparency,"" said Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal in a X post.

This decline in network activity and several other factors threaten to send the crypto token to new lows soon enough. XRP Records Decline In On-chain Transactions According to the report, on-chain transactions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) declined by 65.6% in the second quarter of 2024. 86.38 million transactions were recorded during this period, compared to 251.39 million in the first quarter of this year. A drop in the network activity is significant as it highlights investors’ sentiment towards the XRP ecosystem. Related Reading: Wondering When To Buy Bitcoin? Here Are The Levels To Watch This decline in network activity can also negatively impact the XRP price, especially if this trend continues in the third quarter of the year. A plausible explanation for the decline in on-chain transactions for the XRPL in the second quarter is XRP’s underperformance in the first quarter of the year. High expectations for XRP heading into the new year may have prompted investors to increase their exposure to the crypto, which led to the highs in network activity recorded in the first quarter. However, these investors may have had a rethink as XRP failed to reach new highs even when Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH), leading to a decline in network activity in the second quarter. The silver lining is that XRP investors have regained their bullish sentiment towards XRP, leading to increased network activity. Bitcoinist recently reported a spike in new addresses and the number of addresses interacting on the XRPL, with these metrics reaching their highest levels since March earlier this year. The revived bullish sentiment among XRP investors is mainly thanks to the belief that the lawsuit between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple could end soon, presenting a bullish outlook for XRP’s price. However, if that doesn’t happen soon enough, XRP is at risk of witnessing a significant price decline as activity on the XRPL drops. Other Factors That Could Contribute To A Crash For The XRP Price The bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market is another factor that could contribute to massive price declines for XRP. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hold above $50,000, and the flagship crypto could send altcoins like XRP crashing if it continues to drop to new lows. XRP is also well-placed to be among the altcoins that will be most affected, seeing how the crypto token has so far reacted to Bitcoin’s recent crash below $60,000. Related Reading: Crypto Market Liquidations Top $197 Million As Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $60,000 The conclusion of the lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple could also negatively impact XRP’s price if the remedies awarded against the crypto firm align with the Commission’s proposed remedies. The SEC has asked Judge Analisa to award a fine of $102.6 million against Ripple, which is way above the $10 million that the crypto firm proposed. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.46, down over 16% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
