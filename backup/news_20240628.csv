He emphasized the Spot Ethereum ETFs, which he believes could spark a significant rally for ETH. A ‘Significant Upside Repricing’ Could Be On The Horizon ForTHEEthereum Duncan mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that he believes that the market is way too bearish at the moment and that there could be a “significant upside repricing” for Ethereum if the Spot Ethereum ETF inflows are “anything but horrible.” He further explained why he thinks the Spot Ethereum ETFs will be a huge success, contrary to what some might think. Related Reading: Telegram-Based Notcoin Burns 210 Million Tokens Amid Positive Recovery First, he noted that asset managers view the crypto ETF space as a “new frontier” that could generate billions in management fees for them over the next ten years. He highlighted how BlackRock has had its most successful product launch ever with its Spot Bitcoin ETF, which he claims is already generating $45 million in fees yearly, just six months after its launch. Based on this, Duncan stated that the Spot Ethereum ETFs provide these asset managers another “massive opportunity” to launch a product that could bring them similar success to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, generating hundreds of millions in fees. Duncan remarked that the Spot Ethereum ETFs are “almost as big as the Bitcoin ETF given the base management fees and the future ability to clip a fee off the staking yield.” Duncan further alluded to an interview Scott Melker (aka Wolf Of All Streets) had with VanEck’s Head of Digital Asset Research, Matthew Sigel, to emphasize how these asset managers feel about the Spot Ethereum ETFs. From what was said during the interview, Duncan noted how VanEck is betting on the Spot Ethereum ETFs to spark a “reflexive rally” in ETH, which Sigel claimed could make them more money. Spot Ethereum ETF Issuers Could Provide A Narrative For ETH Duncan tried to counter the argument made by crypto figures like Andrew Kang, who argued that Ethereum had no narrative and that the Spot Ethereum ETFs might not succeed because of that. Duncan stated that asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck can “literally start the narratives themselves.” He added that this narrative could be about BlackRock’s Real World Assets (RWA) on-chain, VanEck’s new stablecoin, or the asset managers’ “open app store” thesis. Dunan said the market could witness a “massive ETH rally” when these narratives are mixed with some “good flows and ETH’s extremely reflexive characteristics.” Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Today? The crypto trader admitted that this could take time but opined that it is naive to think that these asset managers won’t deploy significant resources to attract inflows to their Spot Ethereum ETFs. Crypto analyst and trader Tyler Durden shared a similar sentiment when he mentioned that Ethereum reaching $10,000 was the “most asymmetric bet” in crypto today. He claimed that Wall Street had put so much effort into ensuring that the Spot Ethereum ETFs were approved, and now, they will make as much money from it while pumping ETH.

Solana Social Volume Has Shot Up Alongside The Rally According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the SOL social volume has observed a sharp increase following the recent recovery of cryptocurrency. The “Social Volume” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the degree of discussion that any given asset receives on the major social media platforms. Related Reading: Retail Losing Interest In Bitcoin? Volume Plunges 30% This metric makes this measurement by counting up the unique number of posts/threads/messages, making at least one mention of the cryptocurrency. The indicator doesn’t simply count up the mentions themselves because sometimes a large number of mentions can crop up within a couple of posts, while at the same time, the discussion could be more or less dead on the rest of social media. The high mentions would suggest a lot of discussion in this case, but in reality, the talk is all contained within niche circles. By measuring the number of posts, the Social Volume can tell us about the trend across social media. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Solana Social Volume over the past week or so: As is visible in the above graph, the Solana Social Volume has registered some rapid growth recently. This would imply that the intensity of discussions related to the asset has suddenly spiked. The driver behind this increase in the indicator is likely to be the rally that the coin’s price has enjoyed recently. In this new surge, SOL has recovered from a low of around $124 to the current $146 mark, meaning it has seen returns of almost 18% in just a few days. The Social Volume spiking alongside a rally isn’t unusual, as social media users find sharp price action exciting, so they participate in more discussions than normal. However, the scale of the spike that the metric has seen this time may be worth noting. Historically, the asset’s price has tended to move against the majority’s expectations, so too much excitement too suddenly can be a bearish sign for the cryptocurrency. In the same chart, Santiment has attached the Social Volume for Avalanche (AVAX) data, which has also witnessed a recovery run. It would appear that, unlike the Solana surge, few are paying attention to Avalanche’s rally, as the indicator’s value has remained relatively low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ‘Euphoria’ Boundary: What Happens After A Breach? Therefore, AVAX’s rally could be more likely to be sustainable than SOL’s, as it has been seeing much less FOMO, at least according to the Social Volume. SOL Price Solana had broken past the $151 level yesterday, but the asset has since seen a minor pullback to $146. It’s currently unclear if this means that the negative effect of FOMO is already kicking in for SOL.

42417863,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa55Z,1719605700,"U.S. Treasury Issues Crypto Tax Regime For 2025, Delays Rules for Non-Custodians","The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Internal Revenue Service will require crypto brokers to file 1099 forms like their traditional investment-firm cousins, but decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and non-hosted wallet providers will have to wait for their own rule later in the year.  The rule released Friday will go into effect for transactions starting in 2025 and will require brokers to keep tabs on cost basis for customers' tokens starting in 2026.  The IRS won't call for reporting on most routine stablecoin sales and is putting a $600 annual threshold on NFT proceeds before they need to be reported.  The U.S. Treasury Department issued its long-awaited tax regime for cryptocurrency transactions, setting up filing rules for digital assets brokers that will begin with transactions happening next year, but it put off some of its most contentious decisions about brokers that never take possession of customers' crypto.  The new Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules for crypto brokers released on Friday call for trading platforms, hosted wallet services and digital assets kiosks to submit disclosures on the movements and gains of customers' assets. Those assets will also include – in very limited circumstances – the stablecoins such as Tether's {{USDT}} and Circle Internet Financial's {{USDC}} and high-value non-fungible tokens (NFTs), though the IRS explicitly refuses to settle the longstanding battle over whether tokens should be considered securities or commodities.  While this rule focuses on the most obvious platforms such as Coinbase Inc. (COIN) and Kraken, non-custodial crypto businesses – such as decentralized exchanges and unhosted wallet providers – are only getting a temporary reprieve from the new filing demands. The popular crypto platforms that handle a ""substantial majority"" of transactions can't wait any longer for rules, the agency contended, but the other issues need more study and they'll get their own rule ""later this year.""  ""The Treasury Department and the IRS do not agree that non-custodial industry participants should not be treated as brokers,"" according to the explanations included with the Friday rule. ""However, the Treasury Department and the IRS would benefit from additional consideration of issues involving non-custodial industry participants.""  The final rule for the more commonly used brokers begins with transactions on Jan. 1, 2025, leaving crypto taxpayers with another filing year in which they're on their own to figure out their 2024 returns in the interim, though crypto firms have already been moving to adapt. The IRS gave an additional year until 2026 for brokers to start having to keep track of the ""cost basis"" for the assets – the amount each was originally purchased for.  Real estate transactions paid for with cryptocurrencies after Jan. 1, 2026 will also need reporting, the regulation said. ""Real estate reporting persons"" will have to file the fair market value of the digital assets used in any such transaction.  A 2021 infrastructure bill in Congress had set the stage for the Treasury's IRS to establish this formal approach to crypto, and since then the industry has been frustrated with a continuously delayed process. The eventual proposal drew 44,000 public comments.  ""Because of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, investors in digital assets and the IRS will have better access to the documentation they need to easily file and review tax  returns,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Aviva Aron-Dine, in a statement. “By implementing the law’s reporting requirements, these final regulations will help taxpayers more easily pay taxes owed under current law, while reducing tax evasion by wealthy investors.”  IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said the final regulations took in the public comments.  ""These regulations are an important part of the larger effort on high-income individual tax compliance. We need to make sure digital assets are not used to hide taxable income, and these final regulations will improve detection of noncompliance in the high-risk space of digital assets,"" he said. ""Our research and experience demonstrate that third-party reporting improves compliance. In addition, these regulations will provide taxpayers with much needed information, which will reduce burden and simplify the process of reporting their digital asset activity.""  Controversial rule  The process of writing this controversial tax rule provoked widespread concern from the industry that the U.S. government would overreach by imposing impossible requirements on miners, online forums, software developers and other entities that aid investors but wouldn't traditionally be considered brokers and don't have the information about customers nor the disclosure infrastructure that would let them comply.  The IRS said it recognizes that crypto brokers shouldn't include those ""providing validation services without providing other functions or services, or persons that are solely engaged in the business of selling certain hardware, or licensing certain software, for which the sole function is to permit persons to control private keys which are used for accessing digital assets on a distributed ledger.""  The U.S. tax regulators estimated about 15 million people will be affected by the new rule, and about 5,000 firms will need to comply.  The IRS said it tried to avoid some burdens on users of stablecoins, especially when used to buy other tokens and in payments. Basically, a normal crypto investor and user who doesn't earn more than $10,000 on stablecoins in a year is exempted from the reporting. Stablecoin sales – the most frequent in the crypto markets – will be tallied collectively in an ""aggregated"" report rather than as individual transactions, the agency said, though more sophisticated and high-volume stablecoin investors won't qualify. The agency said that these tokens ""unambiguously fall within the statutory definition of digital assets as they are digital representations of the value of fiat currency that are recorded on cryptographically secured distributed ledgers,"" so they couldn't be exempted despite their aim to hew to a steady value. The IRS also said that totally ignoring those transactions ""would eliminate a source of information about digital asset transactions that the IRS can use in order to ensure compliance with taxpayers’ reporting obligations.""  But the IRS added that if Congress passes one of its bills that would regulate stablecoin issuers, the tax rules may have to be revised.  The tax agency also faced complex legal arguments in determining how to handle NFTs, according to its extensive notes on that topic, and the agency decided that only taxpayers who makes more than $600 in a year from their NFT sales need their aggregated proceeds reported to the government. The resulting filings will include the taxpayers' identifying information, the number of NFTs sold and what the profits were. ""The IRS intends to monitor NFTs reported under this optional aggregate reporting method to determine whether this reporting hampers its tax enforcement efforts,"" according to the rule text. ""If abuses are detected, the IRS will reconsider these special reporting rules for NFTs.""  As part of its efforts, the IRS published its definition for digital assets and the various activities covered by Friday's regulations.  The IRS also defined a safe harbor for certain reporting requirements ""on which taxpayers may rely to allocate unused basis of digital assets to digital assets held within each wallet or account of the taxpayer as of Jan. 1, 2025,"" it said.  Earlier this year, the U.S. tax agency had released a proposed 1099-DA form to track crypto transactions – the form that millions of crypto investors would receive from their brokers.  Read More: IRS Unveils Form Your Broker May Send Next Year to Report Your Crypto Moves  The IRS clarified Friday that any attempt in this rule to assign buckets to crypto assets isn't meant to reinforce a side in the industry's ongoing battle with regulators – specifically the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – to define whether tokens are securities or commodities. That debate is raging now in several cases before federal judges, and while the SEC is only willing to admit bitcoin {{BTC}} is definitely outside of the agency's reach, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam has said that Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} is also a commodity.

30100964,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626935,1719604836,"Solana ETF Approval Could Skyrocket SOL’s Value 9x Higher, Report Finds","Leading asset manager and Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) issuer VanEck has officially filed a Spot Solana ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), fueling bold growth predictions for the Solana ecosystem. Market-making firm GSR Markets recently released a report shedding light on the potential impact of a Solana ETF and highlighting the platform’s emergence as part of the “Big Three” in the crypto space. Speculation Of A Solana ETF Approval GSR’s report highlights Solana’s rapid rise within the cryptocurrency industry, positioning it as a major player alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. With the Bitcoin ETF market already approved and Ethereum about to launch a spot ETF in the US, GSR predicts that it’s only a matter of time before Solana follows suit, potentially making the biggest impact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Selling Cools Off – Is This The Breakout Moment? GSR’s analysis highlights three key technological advancements that set Solana apart from its competitors. Firstly, Solana’s proof-of-history enables validators to produce blocks efficiently, resulting in remarkable speed and scalability advantages. Second, Solana’s parallel transaction processing enables increased throughput and takes advantage of improvements in computing speed. Finally, the company said Solana’s architecture positions it to solve the “blockchain trilemma” by achieving global state synchronization at “unprecedented speeds” as hardware and bandwidth costs decline. In addition, GSR’s report addresses the likelihood of Solana securing a spot digital asset ETF. While the current regulatory framework requires a federally regulated futures market and a futures-based ETF before a spot product can be considered, GSR believes that the potential for change shouldn’t be underestimated. The company also claims bipartisan support for the crypto industry, and shifting attitudes among lawmakers indicate a more favorable environment for digital assets. A Trump administration and a liberal SEC commissioner could further pave the way for the launch of spot digital asset ETFs, creating opportunities for Solana and other cryptocurrencies, the report said. Projected Impact On SOL’s Price GSR emphasizes the importance of decentralization and potential demand in determining the next spot digital asset ETF. Factors such as permissionless participation, developmental control, token allocation, and stake characteristics contribute to a blockchain’s level of decentralization. Meanwhile, as indicated by metrics like market cap, potential demand serves as a crucial factor for issuers when assessing future inflows. GSR combines decentralization and demand scores to create an ETF Possibility score, which highlights Ethereum and Solana as leading contenders for the next spot in digital asset ETF. Related Reading: Dogecoin To The Moon? Crypto Analyst Predicts 440% Price Increase Drawing parallels to the effect of spot Bitcoin ETFs on Bitcoin’s price, GSR estimates the potential impact of a Solana ETF on SOL. Adjusting for Solana’s smaller market cap relative to Bitcoin, GSR predicts a 1.4x to 8.9x increase in SOL’s price under different scenarios. However, the report acknowledges that the impact could be even higher, considering SOL’s active usage in staking and decentralized applications. In the event of a spot ETF approval, GSR suggests that the potential upside for SOL presents a significant opportunity in the market. As investor excitement over the development became apparent, SOL’s price reached a weekly high of $151 on Thursday, but in the past few hours, SOL has dropped nearly 4% to a current trading price of $143.

42417866,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa56b,1719601768,Ripple’s Big Court Win Nonetheless Muddied Waters on Whether XRP Is a Security Deserving Tougher Regulation,"Ripple’s California victory muddies the waters on whether or not XRP can be considered a security, according to attorneys active in the crypto space.  District court judges are not required to agree with rulings made by their peers in other cases.  Lawyers say the lack of legal certainty for XRP and other digital assets will likely continue until there is a ruling from a higher court or regulatory certainty granted by Congress.  Ripple recently scored an unequivocal victory from a dollars-and-cents standpoint in a class action securities lawsuit, with the judge tossing out most of the case.  But the judge also muddied the waters on a bigger issue, diverging from a high-profile decision last year by hinting that Ripple's XRP might be a security – thus deserving closer regulation. The conflicting rulings from two judges are a symptom of a bigger problem: the lack of legal and regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the U.S. Until that clarity is granted, either by Congress or a ruling from a higher court, there will likely be more confusion for projects like Ripple and beyond.  On June 20, Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California tossed out most of a class action suit Ripple faced. She allowed only one individual state law claim against the crypto firm and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse to proceed to trial.  The remaining claim – that, during a 2017 interview, Garlinghouse made “misleading statements” in connection with the sale of the XRP token, which the plaintiffs say were securities – is only worth $174, small potatoes for a firm estimated to be worth $11 billion.  That outcome is objectively a huge win for Ripple, something celebrated by the company. The two certified classes in the suit included all investors who purchased XRP over a six-year period and either held it or sold it at a loss. In throwing out all the class action claims, the California judge overseeing the case shielded Ripple from potentially paying enormous damages.  But there was the fly in the ointment: in her ruling, Hamilton suggested that XRP might, in fact, be a security – breaking with the opinion of District Judge Analisa Torres of New York’s Southern District, who ruled last year in a separate case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that XRP was only a security when sold to institutional investors.  Torres’ ruling was widely celebrated as a step toward regulatory clarity for the crypto industry, as well as a potential precedent for other crypto securities cases. Hamilton’s ruling doesn’t undo Torres’ ruling – as Ripple executives have pointed out – but she’s the second district judge to more or less disagree with Torres’ assessment of XRP.  In disagreeing with Torres, Hamilton potentially provided ammunition in the form of another alternative precedent for those who believe XRP – and other cryptocurrencies – are securities, crypto lawyers say.  If this all sounds confusing, that’s because it is – even to crypto lawyers.  A partial victory  Hamilton’s decision to toss out the class action claims was based on statute of limitations grounds, and had nothing to do with whether or not Hamilton thinks XRP might be a security.  “The court found that some of those claims were time-barred and others failed to raise a triable issue,” Joseph Castelluccio, a partner at international law firm Mayer Brown and co-leader of the firm’s fintech and blockchain practice groups, said in an email. “In other words, the Ripple-favorable rulings were not based on the view that XRP is not a security, which has been the central argument made by Ripple and two of its executives in the ongoing cases.”  For the single claim she allowed to proceed to trial, Hamilton applied the Howey Test – a pillar of U.S. regulation based on a Supreme Court ruling, used to determine if an asset is a security or not – to XRP and found that it failed on the third prong, writing: ""The [court] cannot find as a matter of law that Ripple’s conduct would not have led a reasonable investor to have an expectation of profit due to the efforts of others.”  What this means, according to crypto lawyers, is that we still don’t definitively know whether XRP is a security or not.  “In sum, the door is not shut on the question of whether XRP may have the status of a security, at least in relation to this ancillary cause of action,” explained Moish Peltz, a partner at New York law firm Falcon, Rappaport and Berkman.  District court disagreements  Ripple executives have said that Hamilton’s ruling doesn’t undo Torres’ 2023 ruling that XRP is not a security under federal law.  “In the SEC’s case, Judge Torres’ ruled that under federal law XRP is not in and of itself a security,” Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty said in an emailed statement. “That ruling stands undisturbed and cannot now be challenged in Judge Hamilton’s courtroom.”  It’s true that Hamilton’s ruling does not, in and of itself, challenge Torres’ ruling – though the SEC is likely to appeal its case against Ripple, and could potentially use Hamilton’s ruling as alternative precedent. Hamilton is not the first judge to break with Torres either. Another SDNY judge, Jed Rakoff, explicitly disagreed with Torres’ ruling in a separate case, SEC vs. Terraform Labs.  But, maybe more importantly, the differing decisions underscore that district courts do not have to agree with each other. Though they are free to take guidance from other courts’ decisions, they are not obligated to, until a decision is made by a higher court, like an appellate court or the Supreme Court.  A continued lack of clarity  Lawyers interviewed for this story agreed that the district court split over whether or not XRP could be a security when sold on exchanges is a symptom of a much greater issue: the general lack of legal and regulatory clarity on whether a given crypto asset constitutes a security.  “It’s actually very difficult to say what the law is in this area,” said Jason Gottlieb, partner at New York law firm Morrison Cohen, and chair of the firm’s digital assets practice.  “In [Ripple’s] case, when we’re looking at various differing district court opinions, they have not just different results, but different ways of getting those results,” Gottlieb added. “I think there’s a lot of uncertainty when you try to take these district court cases and put them against each other.”  Gottlieb added that since judges are coming to different conclusions, it's clear the law is not well-developed when it comes to cryptocurrencies.  “We’re going to have a lot of district courts reaching differing conclusions and, even when they reach the same conclusions, they might get there for different reasons,” he said. “Until all these cases bubble up into the appellate courts and ultimately the Supreme Court, we’re not likely to have a lot of clarity on the law in this area.”  But even if district court rulings aren’t necessarily binding, they can serve as a useful precedent in an industry like crypto, where the law is still being developed.  After Hamilton issued her judgment, lawyers for the SEC filed the decision on the docket as a notice of supplemental authority – a way for lawyers to call attention to relevant legal issues in other cases – in their case against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, in Washington, D.C.  Longo didn’t put much stock in the SEC’s decision to file Hamilton’s decision in the Binance case, but said that it has become a frequent practice in the crypto industry for parties in litigation to put out notices of supplemental authority when there’s a potentially relevant decision in another case.  “It’s part of the reality of the fact that so much of the law here has basically been forged in the context of our trial courts,” said Amy Jane Longo, a partner at international law firm Ropes & Gray and former SEC trial attorney. “That’s where the case law has played out. There hasn't been a new regulation or statute. … I think it’s a symptom of the way the law has evolved here that, oftentimes, any trial court decision on the issue of Howey in the context of a crypto case frequently gets cited around to other courts with decisions on those kinds of issues in front of them.”  Without regulatory clarity from Congress, the crypto industry has no choice but to search for answers in the legal system – a process that Longo and other lawyers noted was expensive and time-consuming.  “The courts are attempting to resolve 'Neuromancer' issues at a 'Bleak House' pace,” Gottlieb joked.  “The case is about an [initial coin offering, or ICO] that happened in 2014. So, 10 years on, we’re dealing with some of these cases,” Gottlieb added. “We’ve got issues going on today that we’re still going to be grappling with in district courts in five, 10 years down the road – and that’s not even counting when we’ll see results from the appellate courts or Supreme Court.”  A slim shot at trial  Lawyers agreed that the chances of Ripple’s California case actually making it to trial are slim-to-none, because the damages the plaintiff can win are very small.  “Very frequently, these cases don’t go on to trial,” Gottlieb said, adding that in cases where the damages are small, both sides are incentivized to settle out of court.  “Neither side is going to want to go to trial and spend a million dollars in attorneys fees over a few hundred dollars,” Gottlieb said. “If there’s an offer of compromise or an offer of settlement, that increases the pressure on the plaintiff to settle. … It’s hard to see this case going any further.”  Lawyers for the plaintiff did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment.

Unsurprisingly, this has led to clashing sentiment in the market, with the bulls and bears engaged in an intense tug of war. But while bulls remains vocal, the bears have come out of the woodwork, leading to speculations that the price might actually be going much lower. Bitcoin To Succumb To Bearish Pressure Despite the 15% crash that has already rocked the Bitcoin price, crypto analyst DonAlt does not believe that the market has seen the worst of it yet. In a YouTube video, the analyst explains that even the best-case scenario for Bitcoin is still lower than its current price of $61,000. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says ‘XRP Is In Trouble,’ Here’s Why DonAlt presents the argument that the Bitcoin price is likely to fall below $60,000, which would mean it has lost a key psychological level. In this case, the downtrend would continue, predicting another double-digit decline in the cryptocurrency’s price. When this happens, the crypto analyst expects the downtrend to go as deep as 30%. Not only that, he expects more sideways movement to follow, predicting that this sideways movement could last as long as 120 days, or four months to be precise. As for the targets, the analyst believes that this could send the price below $50,000. However, in the worst case scenario, he sees the price falling to $40,000, but not lower. In the best case scenario, he sees a decline to $52,000 before the price begins to recover. “I think at the worst is $40,000, that’s the downside maximum I think. I don’t think it’s going to go lower. And the best case if this is all bearish I think would be $52,000 and then like sideways [price action],” he said in the video. BTC Crash Erodes Market Sentiment The Bitcoin price crash has taken the rest of the market down with it and this has caused a massive decline in investor sentiment. According to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, investors are back to being fearful, something that is not ultimately good for the price in the short term. Related Reading: Telegram-Based Notcoin Burns 210 Million Tokens Amid Positive Recovery The index is currently sitting at a neutral 47 after dropping to a fearful 40 on Thursday. While today’s value has increased, it still shows indecisiveness among investors. Thus, sideways movement should be expected from Bitcoin, at least through the weekend.

Related Reading: SOL Price Soars As First-Ever Solana ETF Filing Surfaces In The US Its investment objective is to track the performance of SOL, providing investors with a convenient and cost-effective method to gain exposure to SOL without making a direct investment in the asset.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as the SOL custodian, holding all of the Trust’s SOL on its behalf.

Analyst Spots Bullish Pattern Echoing 2022 Breakout,"Solana (SOL), a cryptocurrency renowned for its fast transaction speeds, might be on the verge of a significant comeback. Technical analysts are drawing parallels between the current price chart and a previous pattern that preceded a substantial price surge in 2022, sparking optimism for a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Don’t Sweat The Dip! Ethereum 15% Price Slump Could Spark Epic Comeback — Analyst Solana: Chart Pattern Suggests Possible Rebound The buzz among analysts centers around a descending triangle pattern visible on SOL’s current chart. This pattern, often observed during a consolidation phase after a downtrend, typically indicates a continuation of the decline. However, when such a pattern forms after a significant price drop, it can also signal a reversal. I’ve seen this movie before.$SOL pic.twitter.com/ByKj3VgSkD — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) June 27, 2024 Jelle, a well-known crypto analyst and investor, has been actively discussing this pattern on social media. “I’ve seen this movie before,” the analyst says, as they draw comparisons between the current chart and the one that led to SOL’s breakout in 2022. Back then, the breakout resulted in a notable price increase, and many analysts are hopeful for a similar outcome this time around. Approaching A Critical Juncture The current price action of SOL mirrors the pre-breakout phase seen in 2022. The price appears to be nearing the bottom of the descending triangle, a critical point where a breakout is anticipated. If history repeats itself, as Jelle suggests, this breakout could propel SOL upwards, potentially reversing its recent slump. However, it’s essential to approach this with a degree of caution. While technical indicators are valuable tools, they are not foolproof predictors of market behavior. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by numerous factors beyond chart patterns, including market sentiment, developments within the Solana ecosystem, and broader economic conditions. Mixed Signals And Market Sentiment Despite the inherent uncertainties, the overall sentiment surrounding SOL appears cautiously optimistic. According to recent analysis, there is a bullish leaning, with predictions suggesting a potential price increase of 16% by July 28, 2024. This forecast aligns with current technical indicators, which show a neutral Fear & Greed Index at 47 and a significant number of green days (43%) in the past month. The coming weeks will be crucial for SOL. A decisive breakout above the upper trendline of the descending triangle would serve as strong confirmation of the bullish reversal thesis, potentially igniting a new wave of investor confidence. Conversely, if SOL fails to break out of this pattern, it could lead to continued consolidation or even a renewed decline. Eyes On The Future Solana’s chart pattern has evoked a sense of déjà vu, reminiscent of the bullish surge in 2022. The big question is whether this pattern will indeed lead to a similar outcome or if it will turn out to be a case of history not quite repeating itself.

42417868,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTa59h,1719593355,"SEC Sues Consensys Over MetaMask Staking, Broker Allegations","The U.S. SEC sued Consensys Friday, alleging MetaMask's Swaps and Staking products violated federal securities laws.  The agency also targeted Ethereum staking services Lido and Rocket Pool, referring to their popular stETH and rETH tokens as unregistered securities.  Consensys previously sued the SEC to try and block the regulator from filing Friday's suit.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ethereum software provider Consensys over its MetaMask service Friday, alleging the wallet tool was an unregistered broker that ""engaged in the offer and sale of securities."" The SEC suit also targeted Ethereum staking services Lido (LDO) and Rocket Pool (RPL), the third-party platforms MetaMask uses to power its staking feature.  The enforcement action represents the SEC's latest attempt to categorize a broad swath of the crypto market as securities. After the surprise Ether ETF approval last month, the suit also confirmed lingering suspicion that the SEC might still attempt to place liquid staking derivatives of ETH, like Lido's stETH token, under its regulatory remit. The agency has already forced settlements tied to staking services, including with Kraken, while Coinbase ended its staking services in some states after making a deal with state securities regulators.  MetaMask is the most-used wallet for Ethereum and a host of other blockchains. In addition to offering users the ability to store cryptocurrency bought on other platforms, MetaMask lets users buy and sell digital assets directly in-app via its ""Swaps"" service – one of the key features at issue in the SEC's lawsuit, which it filed Friday in the U.S. courthouse in the Eastern District of New York.  Consensys collects a fee for providing this service and, according to the SEC's suit, facilitated more than 36 million crypto transactions over the past four years. The SEC said that ""at least 5 million"" of these transactions involved ""crypto asset securities.""  The SEC said these securities include Polygon (MATIC), Mana (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), the Sandbox (SAND) and Luna (LUNA), though it suggested other digital assets might also be securities. Many of the cryptocurrencies named in Friday's suit have already been named in previous SEC suits as unregistered securities, though at least some of the issuing entities have disputed this characterization.  The SEC also scrutinized MetaMask's ""staking"" feature, which lets users deposit assets to secure the Ethereum blockchain in exchange for interest. That feature is powered by Lido and Rocket Pool – two of the biggest names in decentralized finance. MetaMask users can deposit into those third-party staking services and earn a tradeable receipt on their deposit, called a liquid staking token, in exchange.  The SEC said MetaMask's Lido and Rocket Pool integrations amounted to ""investment contracts,"" suggesting the agency views their popular stETH and rETH liquid staking tokens as unregistered securities.  ""Since at least January 2023, Consensys has offered and sold tens of thousands of unregistered securities on behalf of liquid staking program providers Lido and Rocket Pool, who create and issue liquid staking tokens (called stETH and rETH) in exchange for staked assets,"" the SEC said. ""While staked tokens are generally locked up and cannot be traded or used while they are staked, liquid staking tokens, as the name implies, can be bought and sold freely.""  A representative for Consensys told CoinDesk on Friday that the company “fully expected the SEC to follow through on its threat to claim our MetaMask software interface must register as a securities broker.""  ""The SEC has been pursuing an anti-crypto agenda led by ad hoc enforcement action,"" the representative said. ""This is just the latest example of its regulatory overreach - a transparent attempt to redefine well-established legal standards and expand the SEC’s jurisdiction via lawsuit.""  Friday's lawsuit comes just weeks after Consensys announced the regulator had ended investigations into the company tied to Ethereum, citing two letters the SEC sent it.  Those letters from June 18 did caution that the SEC might still bring enforcement actions tied to other issues. Neither letter mentioned MetaMask.  Consensys, which is led by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, previously sued the SEC in April looking for judicial relief against the SEC possibly calling MetaMask a broker or saying that its staking service violated federal securities laws. That lawsuit, filed in Texas, also sought a court order declaring ether (ETH) to be not a security and to end the SEC's investigation into Consensys.  ""We are confident in our position that the SEC has not been granted authority to regulate software interfaces like MetaMask,"" said the Consensys representative. ""We will continue to vigorously pursue our case in Texas for ruling on these issues because it matters not only to our company but the future success of web3.”  UPDATE (June 28, 2024, 17:10 UTC): Adds additional detail throughout.

42407924,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8C8R,1719593158,"Solana ETF Applications Look Like Bets on Trump Retaking White House, Making U.S. Friendlier to Crypto","Two asset managers, VanEck and 21Shares, filed to launch solana ETFs this week.  They appear to be dead-on-arrival under Joe Biden, but a key deadline in the approval process would be next year, when Donald Trump, if he retakes the presidency, would be in office.  Given Trump's recent embrace of crypto, that increases the odds solana ETFs will get approved.  Asset manager VanEck wasted no time expanding its crypto exchange-traded fund journey, this week becoming the first firm to apply to create one tied to solana {{SOL}}. Another firm, 21Shares, put in a request a day later.  Given how long the approval process will take, their decisions look like a wager that newly crypto-friendly Donald Trump will win the U.S. presidency in November and take office in January.  Although only bitcoin ETFs have been approved so far in the U.S. and funds – from VanEck and others – that seek to hold Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} aren't even fully approved yet, solana is a natural next step given it's one of the largest cryptocurrencies.  But it hasn't cleared a prerequisite for the Biden administration's Securities and Exchange Commission: a well-established regulated derivatives market. Both bitcoin and ether have had that in the form of CME Group's cryptocurrency futures contracts.  Now that Trump has warmed to digital assets and he's even accepting crypto donations for his campaign, that and any other potential objections may be moot.  “I think VanEck’s filing is a sort of call option on the November election,” James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said during an interview conducted before 21Shares became the second solana applicant. “Under the current SEC administration – based on years of prior approval and denial orders for crypto ETFs – a solana ETF should be denied because there is no federally regulated futures market. But a new admin in the White House and a new SEC admin that’s more amenable to crypto policies could change that calculus.”  An ether ETF is awaiting final SEC approval, which could happen any day now, according to reports. But New York-based asset manager VanEck made its next move.  Timing plays a central role. VanEck submitted an S-1 filing for a potential SOL ETF on Thursday. That is needed when an entity is looking to offer a new security on the market. But the filing is meaningless if a second one, a 19b-4 form, isn’t submitted.  While a decision on an S-1 filing isn’t subject to a certain timeline, the SEC is forced to respond to a 19b-4 within 240 days. If VanEck were to file a 19b-4 for its solana ETF today, that deadline would be Feb. 25, 2025, a month into a potential Trump administration.  Current bets on Polymarket suggest that former Trump has a 67% chance of winning the presidential election in November against current President Joe Biden. The SEC under Biden has visibly been hard to convince to approve any crypto-related products; those that have been have taken years.  But a Trump administration would almost certainly replace current SEC Chair Gary Gensler and shake up its priorities.  “Given that CME-traded solana futures don’t currently exist, it seems the only viable path for spot solana ETF approval would be the implementation of a legitimate crypto regulatory framework that clearly defines which crypto assets are securities versus commodities – or for the SEC to agree with solana being designated as a non-security commodity,"" said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an investment advisory firm.  ""In either case, the agency would also need comfortability around surveillance sharing agreements with currently unregulated spot crypto exchanges. All of that appears highly unlikely to happen under the current administration, which makes the VanEck and 21Shares filings likely bets on a more crypto-friendly government,” he said.  VanEck declined to comment on whether its filing for a SOL ETF was a bet on Trump or not.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/06/28/solana-etf-applications-look-like-bets-on-trump-retaking-white-house-making-us-friendlier-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/517fe059c74f329a469621e1e9f2ded43b4f209b-3000x1688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407934,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8CcC,1719589671,"Supreme Court Rules to Overturn the Chevron Doctrine, Curbing Federal Agencies’ Power","The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned a 40-year-old case that allowed federal regulators to enforce their interpretation of ambiguous laws.  Without the so-called Chevron doctrine, the SEC could have a harder time pursuing an enforcement agenda in the near-vacuum of legal and regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.  The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 on Friday to drastically curb the authority of federal regulators, overturning a 40-year-old legal precedent that gave regulatory agencies leeway to interpret the laws they are tasked with enforcing.  The 1984 case, Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council, established that courts should defer to the decisions and expertise of regulators when the language of statutes is ambiguous, essentially giving federal regulators authority to enforce their interpretations of the law.  Since the original ruling was handed down, the so-called “Chevron deference” has allowed regulators to take action on time-sensitive issues while they wait for Congress to pass new laws. The rationale behind the decision was that agencies are more likely to have the knowledge and expertise required to interpret the laws they enforce than courts would.  In his majority opinion on Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts called the Chevron doctrine “unworkable,” adding that it “allows agencies to change course even when Congress has given them no power to do so. By its sheer breadth, Chevron fosters unwarranted instability in the law, leaving those attempting to plan around agency action in an eternal fog of uncertainty.”  “Chevron is overruled,” Roberts concluded. “Courts must exercise their independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, as the [Administrative Procedure Act] requires. Careful attention to the judgment of the Executive Branch may help inform that inquiry. And when a particular statute delegates authority to an agency consistent with constitutional limits, courts must respect the delegation, while ensuring that the agency acts within it. But courts need not and under the APA may not defer to an agency interpretation of the law simply because a statute is ambiguous.”  Too much power  The case has long been a target for conservative activists, who have argued that the Chevron deference gives too much power to unelected federal regulators, and doesn’t hold Congress accountable for writing clearer laws.  Associate Justice Elena Kagen dissented, writing: ""In every sphere of current or future federal regulation, expect courts from now on to play a commanding role. It is not a role Congress has given to them, in the APA or any other statute. It is a role this Court has now claimed for itself, as well as for other judges.”  “Given Chevron’s pervasiveness, the decision to do so is likely to produce large-scale disruption. All that backs today’s decision is the majority’s belief that Chevron was wrong—that it gave agencies too much power and courts not enough,” Kagen added. “But shifting views about the worth of regulatory actors and their work do not justify overhauling a cornerstone of administrative law. In that sense too, today’s majority has lost sight of its proper role.""  SEC tackles crypto  Overturning Chevron could have immediate impacts on federal regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which, under Chairman Gary Gensler, has pursued an aggressive and expansive enforcement agenda in the near-vacuum of legal and regulatory clarity for the crypto industry. The SEC filed suit against a number of crypto companies, asserting they violated federal securities laws by offering purchase and trading services for cryptocurrencies the regulator believes are unregistered securities.  These crypto companies, which include Coinbase, Ripple, Binance and Kraken, among others, have said in their various defenses that the digital assets in question are not securities, and that the SEC is overstepping its authority by alleging that the assets do meet those requirements.  The decision comes just a day after the Supreme Court dealt another blow to the powers of federal regulators. On Thursday, the court ruled 6-3 to curtail the SEC’s use of in-house administrative judges to settle civil fraud lawsuits, arguing that such proceedings are a violation of the constitutional right to a jury trial.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/28/supreme-court-rules-to-overturn-the-chevron-doctrine-curbing-federal-agencies-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd02a6ab424c0b61b8e75b57bc1cd36830694782-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407921,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8C1p,1719589584,Bitcoin and Crypto Closing Out Lame Quarter and One Analyst Believes More Pain Could Be in Store,"A powerful start to 2024 had the bulls predicting $100,000 bitcoin {{BTC}} at some point this year, but relentless selling pressure during April and June (interrupted by a May bounce) has the price struggling not to drop below $60,000 as the quarter draws to a close.  Entering the second quarter, bitcoin was trading just shy of the $71,000 level and at press time (about 60 hours before Q2 officially closes) was changing hands at $60,800, a decline of more than 14%. Helped by the tailwind of what now appears to be certain spot ETF approval, ether {{ETH}} outperformed, but was still in the red in the second quarter with about a 5% drop.  Dragged down by even larger declines in many altcoins, the broader CoinDesk Index fell more than 21% during the last three months. Among the movers, Solana {{SOL}} tumbled 30%, Ripple's {{XRP}} dropped 23% and Dogecoin {{DOGE}} plunged 42%. The index's best performer was the above-mentioned ether with its 5% slide.  Positive catalysts vanish  Bitcoin's disappointing second quarter price action, for now, can possibly be thought of as a correction within a larger bull move that saw the token rise nearly five-fold from January 2023 lows to a new all-time record above $73,500 in mid-March of this year.  Anticipation of the spot bitcoin ETF approval, then the approval, and then the massive inflows into the new funds were surely major catalysts for the rise. Also in play were macro factors – namely the anticipation of a sizable series of interest rate cuts in 2024 from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation, however, has failed to cooperate, and to date there has been no easing of monetary policy in the U.S., with more than one member of the central bank now not expecting to cut rates even once this year.  With ETF inflows old news and even on occasion reversing to outflows, and hopes for lower interest rates diminishing daily, buyers appear to have taken to the sidelines until a new catalyst arises.  More pain in store in Q3?  Bitcoin entered a downtrend on June 20, writes Markus Thielen at 10X Research, laying out ten reasons why the price could decline to $55,000 in the near term. Thielen noted that many trend-following funds are looking at the same signals and might be inclined to pile into short positions.  In addition, while some bulls may have been excited that the presidential debate seemed to favor Donald Trump – who has recently come out as notably pro-crypto and pro-bitcoin – Thielen suggested President Biden's poor performance heightened the chance of a replacement Democratic nominee who might end up as a far more formidable opponent in the November election.  Thielen also reminded about seasonality. The third quarter has historically been the weakest one, with an average return of just 5% over the past 13 years. This compares to average returns above 60% in both the second and fourth quarters.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | DOGE | FIAT | TRADING | ZRX,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/28/bitcoin-and-crypto-closing-out-lame-quarter-and-one-analyst-believes-more-pain-could-be-in-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/151e3ce6165f8a99f1be8fccec1b180ddf441086-1278x719.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30091410,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626903,1719588658,"Will Bitcoin Continue Dumping? This Analyst Thinks So, Here’s Why","Bitcoin is consolidating, struggling for gains, and looking at price action in the daily chart. Even with the rejection of lower prices, the coin has yet to follow through, decisively reversing losses of June 24. Should Bitcoin Traders Brace For More Losses? In light of this, one analyst on X thinks there could be more losses in the coming days. Posting on X, the on-chain analyst highlighted a worrying trend: Even amid the Bitcoin trading community’s optimism, sellers are relentlessly stacking up more short orders. According to the Bitcoin Net Taker Oscillator indicator, the reading is -1.5%. At this level, it is at the same point observed when prices rocketed to as high as $70,000 in November 2021 before dumping sharply throughout 2022. Bitcoin is trending at a near all-time high, roughly 20% from $73,800 printed in mid-March 2024. Although the uptrend of Q1 2024 defines the current formation, prices are retesting key support levels stacked between $56,500 and $60,000. If there are deeper losses, as the analyst projects, BTC could crash, reaching $50,000. This development would automatically disqualify the short-squeeze narrative in some quarters. Related Reading: WIF Heading For Rock Bottom? $2.2 Rejection Fuels Further Decline Compounding the bearish pressure, the analyst also picked out an uptick in long liquidations, rising to 13% as of June 27. The upswing in long liquidations means that leveraged traders across leading exchanges like Binance and OKX are now exiting at a loss. The analyst added that what’s happening regarding liquidation is similar to events in the 2019-2020 correction. Then, more long traders were liquidated, and within five months, BTC crashed by 46%. If the past guides, then it is likely that the same could unfold in the coming months. However, the analyst notes that if whales buy over 500,000 BTC, prices will stabilize and shoot higher. Bearish Sentiment Building Up: Time To Buy Bitcoin? Santiment data also reinforces this bearish narrative. In recent weeks, the number of users and traders expecting BTC to edge higher has been plunging across multiple social media platforms. Of note, bearish sentiment has been building up since the Bitcoin halving event and the sideways movement of prices since April 2024. Though traders were optimistic ahead of the Halving event on April 20, the failure of prices to breach $74,000 eroded confidence. Even so, the current bearish sentiment could be a contrarian indicator, especially considering the general resilience of bulls. Prices remain above $60,000, rejecting attempts for lower lows.

42407927,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8CLf,1719588278,Elections Across Europe Won't Hinder Bloc's Crypto Ambitions,"Upcoming elections in Europe are not going to hinder the European Union's regulatory framework – the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation taking effect this year – crypto advocates said.  The European Parliament elections that just wrapped up could point to possible local election results, which are unlikely to affect crypto legislation at the national level.  Elections happening across Europe are not likely to affect the European Union's crypto legislation and incoming policies, industry advocates say.  The European Union had its bloc-wide election earlier this month, resulting in a substantial shift in power over the next five years. In the wake of that election, EU member nations France, Austria, Germany and others announced their own elections for the coming months, with additional elections expected to occur by next year.  Already this year has seen elections in Croatia, Finland, Lithuania and Portugal, while a new president was elected in Hungary.  The European Parliament (EP) election wrapped up on June 9. Parliament ended up leaning slightly more towards the right after votes in the 27 different member nations were tallied. This shift could make room for more innovation-friendly policies and is partly thanks to appointments from France and Austria, said Mark Foster, the EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation. Officials like Stefan Berger, Ondrej Kovarik and Irene Tingali, who played a key role in the EU's crypto journey, were re-elected to their posts.  Read more: EU Vote See Reelection of Some Officials With Key Roles in Bloc's Crypto Journey  The EU's wide-ranging package for crypto, the Markets in Crypto Assets legislation (MiCA), was passed into law last year and will begin taking effect this year. Stablecoin measures from this bundle of rules will enter into force on June 30, while the rest of the legislation will take effect in December.  ""The elections do not have any bearing whatsoever on MiCA in its current form,"" said Jonathan Galea, CEO of BCAS, a regulatory consultancy firm, in a statement which said the package was already finalized.  While the European elections won't directly affect MiCA, each individual nation is responsible for providing crypto firms with licensing regimes to fulfill the bloc's requirements for companies. Most countries already feel prepared for MiCA implementation, regulators previously told CoinDesk.  ""The national/EP elections won't really impact implementation which passes to the EU authorities … as well as national competent authorities,"" Foster said in his statement, which referred to the European Banking Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority.  Read more: Here’s How EU Nations Are Preparing to Enforce MiCA  What is next?  More general elections are expected to occur this year. France's president Emmanuel Macron called a surprise parliamentary election (separate from the country's presidential election) after his ruling Renaissance party secured only about half the seats that the right-wing Marine Le Pen's National Rally received in the European Parliament election.  France is due to have two rounds of voting on June 30 and July 7, and the result is unlikely to undo the legislation passed around crypto so far. Seventy-four companies have already registered in France, and local officials expect that number to jump to 100 this year as regulators look to attract more digital asset firms.  Austria is also expected to hold a general election this year on Sept. 29, where a new National Council – which proposes and passes laws – will be chosen (again different from the presidential election). Polls suggest that the far-right Freedom Party is currently leading over its rivals.  Next year, Germany, one of the EU's biggest nations with the most EU parliament seats, will also be heading to the polls. The country will be hosting its national German Bundestag election, where citizens cast votes on the country's legislative body.  In the European Parliament elections, the controversial far-right Alternative for Germany came in second place in the country by securing 15.9% of the 96 seats on offer for the nation, even defeating the country's coalition parties – the Greens, the Social Democrat Party and Free Democratic Party.  “Whilst I’d expect the broader trend of right and far-right parties to be replicated domestically, particularly in France, Austria and also Germany, in due course, I do not believe the far right parties will achieve the same level of support as they did in the EP elections,” Foster said.  The Republic of Ireland, which has awarded a license to the Coinbase exchange, registered crypto infrastructure firm Ramp Network and exchange Crypto.com and more is also due to have a general election either late this year or in early 2025.  Sinn Féin has lost some of its popularity in the country. In the 2022 Assembly elections, Sinn Féin became the first nationalist party to win the most seats in the election and the Democratic Unionist Party came in second place. However, Sinn Féin came in fourth place at the recent EP elections while the right-wing Fine Gael came first and right-wing Fianna Fáil came second.  Meanwhile, Ukraine was expected to have an election this year as its current President Volodymyr Zelensky's term has expired, but the nation wants the war against Russia to end before hosting another election, the BBC reported in May.  The Czech Republic, Republic of Cyprus, Estonia, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Spain held elections last year. Denmark, Hungary, Slovenia, Latvia and Sweden should have elections in 2026. Malta and Italy are meant to have their elections in 2027, when France will hold its next presidential election.  Commissioners  Following the recent elections, each head of state – represented in the European Council – designates their Commission candidate and the European Parliament has a final say on this.  The crypto community in Europe is looking for blockchain rules to be put in place. However, the role of creating new legislation falls on the EU Commission, the bloc's executive body and no changes will be made until commissioners set out their priorities later this year.  Blockchain for Europe Secretary General Robert Kopitsch believes that the current president – Ursula von der Leyen – is likely to be re-elected, he said during CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 conference. EU leaders have already endorsed von der Leyen to run for a second term. The EU Parliament will vote on the body's president next month.  It's unclear what effect her re-appointment would have on crypto, Kopitsch noted that crypto ""is not a tier one issue"" in the region.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/06/28/elections-across-europe-wont-hinder-blocs-crypto-ambitions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0d8ab384f5877d76e947ba285f6555f344289b47-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30088249,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626912,1719583203,Spot Solana ETFs: Analyst Says Don’t Get Too Excited About The Market Recovery,"Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has warned the crypto community not to get too excited about the recent market recovery trigger by Spot Solana ETFs filing. Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market witnessed a relief bounce following recent bullish developments, but the analyst highlighted what could send the market into a downtrend again. Why The Crypto Community Should Not Get “Too Excited” After Solana ETFs Rally Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the crypto community should not get too excited because $22 million will be liquidated from the crypto market if Bitcoin drops to $60,700. A significant amount in liquidations could lead to further decline in the crypto market, especially with other traders and investors looking to close their positions for fear of being liquidated. Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin Price Down Today? Martinez issued this warning following the market rebound made by Bitcoin and altcoins. This rebound followed news that asset manager VanEck had filed for a Spot Solana ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Solana, in particular, saw a price gain of over 8% and rallied to as high as $150 following the news. The crypto market was also buoyed in anticipation of the US presidential debate. The crypto community had anticipated crypto being a major talking point during the discussion, although that didn’t happen. Regardless, there is still enough reason for the crypto market to be excited, as VanEck’s filing for the first-ever Spot Solana ETF marks a significant milestone not just for the Solana ecosystem but the crypto ecosystem in general. Other asset managers can be expected to file for a Spot Solana ETF in due time, and the potential approval of these funds could usher in more crypto ETFs just as the approval of a Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF motivated VanEck to file for this Spot Solana ETF. Meanwhile, the Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to begin trading soon, providing more bullish momentum for the crypto market. Technical Indicators Also Point To More Rallies For Bitcoin Martinez recently highlighted an Adam and Eve bottoming pattern, which he claimed seems to be forming on Bitcoin’s chart. He stated that this signals a potential 6% rise towards $66,000 if Bitcoin can maintain a candlestick close above $62,000. Additionally, Martinez recently noted that the crypto market sentiment has turned into fear, which suggests that crypto prices are currently undervalued and that a market rebound is imminent. According to Martinez, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) also shows that this is a good time to buy the Bitcoin dip. Historical trends suggest that a parabolic rally is already on the cards for the flagship crypto. Once Bitcoin makes its move to the upside, the broader crypto market is expected to enjoy a massive bounce. Related Reading: Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52% Crypto analyst Javon Marks also alluded to Bitcoin’s RSI and highlighted a bullish divergence pattern that had formed on Bitcoin’s chart which he claimed validates a bullish outlook for the crypto token.

42407932,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8CVa,1719583131,DePIN Can Rebuild the Grid From the Bottom Up,"From Thomas Edison’s invention of the lightbulb to Thomas Savery’s invention of the steam engine, innovation in energy has been a core contributor to American success. But, while energy innovation is alive and well, preservation has fallen by the wayside.  The U.S. grid is as old as it’s ever been, with 70% of power lines now over the age of 25 years. Today the United States has more outages than any other country in the world, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. The 2021 power surges in Texas alone cost between $80bn and $130bn.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's new DePIN Vertical, covering the emerging industry of decentralized physical infrastructure.  Still, reinvestment in electrical hardware hasn’t been one of the government’s priorities, as the U.S. instead spends trillions insourcing chip production in the face of a rising China.  With the government prioritizing spending on computational rather than electrical infrastructure, organizations have emerged that optimize existing energy capacity through demand-response programs and issuance of behavior-linked credits (like carbon credits). Demand responses programs are immediately deployed whenever the grid is under too much stress. They incentivize customers to shift electricity usage to times when electricity demand is lower and more plentiful. Typically, demand-response has been a manual process, coordinated through mailers and automated phone calls driving people to act.  However, while demand-response programs have strong potential, their implementation to date has been insignificant. According to the U.S. EIA, demand-response programs save ~29 GwH a year, equivalent to ~$150mm in energy costs, or <1/1,000,000 of total US energy consumption. The U.S. government has previously subsidized solutions to this problem of poor demand-response.  Opower, with the government as its only client, sold to Oracle for ~$600m in 2016 after using mail slips to drive home-owners to use less energy and saved >$3bn in energy costs. Opower was a manual solution, teaching people about their usage habits and encouraging changes, but it didn’t solve the underlying issues with the grid that made demand-response a nightmare to organize. The difficulty comes down to two factors: lack of data availability, and lack of control to remotely modify energy usage.  Demand-response is constrained by available data and by the rate at which people respond to physical incentives. Energy data exists in silos maintained by the 3000+ energy utilities in the U.S. As these companies generally operate on Excel spreadsheets, it is extremely difficult to establish metrics around real-time energy consumption, and therefore challenging to respond quickly. In addition, a response would require active engagement on the part of the household to respond to the call and optimize their energy use. If nobody is home, no action is taken.  To the problem of data availability, blockchains present a perfect solution. Distributed ledgers can unify energy data across utilities to create a baseline health map for the U.S. energy grid. This would allow utilities to securely store their own data, but also share that data with other utilities and the government without revealing private information. However, it’s unlikely these sleepy monoliths will drive this improvement themselves: utilities earn an annual fixed 10% return on equity from the government annually and aren’t well incentivized to innovate.  Thankfully, a large-scale transformation is afoot on the hardware side: rapid growth of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) like solar panels and charging stations has created the opportunity to rebuild the U.S. energy grid and incorporate powerful new technology. Alongside DERs, new interconnected networks of energy resources are emerging using blockchain and crypto to increase data availability and coordination. Examples include networks like Srcful, Daylight, and dClimate, and Glow: they use sensors to directly integrate with solar panels/batteries and create a real-time data layer mapping usage of energy nationwide. For some like Glow, they can use that data layer to let people create their own carbon credits: for others like dClimate, that data layer powers powerful prediction models enabling extremely accurate forecasts.  Others like Srcful and Daylight use the data layer to introduce programmability – in addition to sensors reporting on energy usage, they can also regulate it. Smart home applications today let users control energy usage remotely, allowing them to control their home lights from the office as an example. This new infrastructure will facilitate multiple new products that create unique economic value. With a real-time data layer and virtual control of appliances in place, companies like Srcful can build automated demand-response functions that activate instantaneously, rewarding users in stablecoins or cryptocurrency for their delegating control. Because the data layer verifies energy saving/optimization in real time, it is monetizable through municipal governments: Srcful as an example is the first in this category to receive a grant from the Swedish Energy Authority.  With smart home applications proliferating alongside a blockchain-managed data layer, all the pieces are in place to create large-scale demand-response programs. These decentralized generative energy networks (DeGEN) create a programmable, mappable grid that benefits from broad data availability and automated response. It surfaces grid issues in real time and solves them instantaneously through delegated software, which will dramatically reduce the incidence of outages in the U.S., and optimize regional energy pricing.  Utilities and energy have historically been over-regulated because the financial costs of the power grid are socialized, but the profits generally accrue to a small number of companies and traders. Without data availability to understand and solve issues that consistently arise, arbitrage opportunities in energy markets persist driving energy costs higher and profits into the hands of the motivated few.  DeGENs, in contrast, collaboratively create economic value, and return that value to participants have the potential to usher in an era of collaborative capitalism where inclusion, rather than the exploitation of suppliers drives big profits.

42407936,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga8CfV,1719579600,Europe's MiCA Is Finally Here. How Will the U.S. Respond?,"On Sunday, the first wave of the European Union's landmark, comprehensive law governing digital assets will take effect. With the Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation framework, Europe has succeeded in doing what other jurisdictions, including the U.S., are still avoiding: provide legal and regulatory clarity for not one piece of the digital asset market, but all of it.  Catalyzed by the specter of Big Tech, like Meta's Diem (formerly Libra) initiative, entering financial markets, or because of fears of unchecked cryptocurrency, the last five years have been marked by concerted policy development in Europe. MiCA will have a profound effect of permanently bridging digital assets and the real economy and doing so in a characteristically European way.  Dante Disparte is the chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle.  The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  In crypto’s first decade, much of the industry was characterized by an eye-watering and recurring boom-bust cycle that in many ways made this a uniquely American market. As a result, the U.S. dollar is not only the pricing benchmark for digital assets (courtesy of the steady rise of stablecoins, which now exceed more than $150 billion), but also the reserve currency of internet finance, as much as it plays that role in the real world. MiCA aims to address this by giving euro-denominated stablecoins, which will be classified as e-money tokens under the EU’s new rules, a chance at success and a 441 million-strong consumer market.  While some aspects of MiCA are protectionist in nature, anchored on shielding European consumers and investors from the fraud and risks that have plagued fast-moving crypto markets, there is also a degree of economic and technological sovereignty at play. This is most evident in how offshore stablecoins – diplomatically referred to as global stablecoins – are impermissible under MiCA. Stablecoins pegged to other currencies must primarily comply with e-money licensing requirements in Europe, which would entail abiding by prudential, financial-crime compliance and other rules. If the stablecoin issuer offers other crypto asset services, it must obtain a second license – either as a digital asset service provider (DASP), virtual asset service provider (VASP) or crypto asset service provider (CASP), depending on the jurisdiction. This requirement is a base level of compliance for digital asset safekeeping. In addition to these licensing requirements, gone are the days of amorphous crypto companies with no substantial presence in the EU.  Indeed, MiCA is as much about job development and economic competitiveness as it is about consumer and market protection. Licensed entities must have accountable “mind and management” in an EU jurisdiction through which they can then passport their operations across the federation thanks to pan-European regulatory harmonization – although there is still some distance to travel for national-level regulators to ensure MiCA comes into force smoothly across the common market.  For the crypto industry and its existential coupling with the banking sector, MiCA marks profound change, which only the most serious players are ready for. For example, in the resurgent stablecoin category, in which the dollar is the currency of reference, MiCA marks a proverbial fiscal cliff where unregulated or non-compliant tokens will ultimately be delisted or their access greatly restricted by crypto exchanges. The reason is simple. Rather than treating stablecoins like a fringe financial product or merely a poker chip in a crypto casino, MiCA brings stablecoins in line with longstanding electronic money rules. Therefore, all stablecoins offered by EU crypto exchanges must comply with rules for e-money tokens. This confers to the token holder a right of redemption at par for the underlying currency directly from the issuer, a way of reinforcing collective accountability and consumer protection in the interlinked digital asset value chain – from the wallet, to the exchange and, ultimately, to the issuer. Contrast this model to the amorphous standards or lack of prudential protections guarding against the run on the stable-in-name-only coin Terra Luna. If Terra Luna had abided by the e-money equivalent in the U.S., which are state money transmission laws, consumers could have been better protected from the crash.  In the prevailing EU model, all regulated stablecoins will now have a common regulatory floor, which will not only encourage competition, but eventually lead to broader fungibility and interoperability in the EU market. Like all novel rules or comprehensive regulations, MiCA is imperfect, and in places overly prescriptive, so much so that EU policymakers are already contemplating MiCA 2.0, which would potentially fill certain gaps in the regime such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance and other areas. While MiCA has now given European crypto market participants clear rules, on the U.S. side of the Atlantic, imperfect rules or a lack of federal regulations have enabled an industry to flourish. Should a trans-Atlantic technological rift widen – or should the U.S. and critical EU partners aspire to shared digital commons?  If U.S. policymakers take a competitive posture toward the EU in digital assets, a veritable ""NAFTA for digital assets"" can be contemplated across North America. A lasting alternative, however, would be to form a transcontinental Western alliance for digital assets that would enshrine shared democratic values in these emerging markets and with how exponential technologies shape the future.  Now that the world has MiCA, it's time for the U.S. to act and reassert its place as the global leader in financial services regulation and innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Dante Disparte,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/27/europes-mica-is-finally-here-how-will-the-us-respond,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2974b9d55171928d8d6030ab017b3d91485ba1d9-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin consolidated above $61,000, lacking a clear directional bias before the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). Economists expect the PCE to show the annualized inflation rate slowed to 2.6% in May from 2.8%, according to Bloomberg. While that would be the lowest reading in over two years, it is still above the Fed's 2% goal. ""A lower-than-expected figure would suggest a continued inflation decline and potentially boost cryptocurrencies in the coming months,"" Valentin Fournier, digital assets analyst at advisory firm brn, said.  Solana's SOL token has outperformed Ethereum's ETH token this week after New York-based investment management firm VanEck filed an S-1 registration statement for its VanEck Solana Trust. ""We believe the native token, SOL, functions similarly to other digital commodities such as bitcoin and ETH,"" VanEck's head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, wrote in a post on X arguing that SOL is a commodity, not a security. The consensus is that CME futures are a prerequisite for ETF approval, which SOL currently does not have. Meanwhile, ether futures have been trading on the CME for some time and spot ether ETFs are likely to begin trading in the U.S. in July. For now, the path of least resistance for the SOL/ETH ratio appears to be on the higher side. The SOL/ETH ratio has risen 12% this week, more than reversing the past week's decline in a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern.  Blockchain bettors were skeptical of President Joe Biden's performance in the first debate of the 2024 presidential election, pushing former President Donald Trump's odds of winning the November vote to as high as 67%. A contract asking bettors to declare the outcome of the election currently has close to $188 million on the line, with around $23 million on Trump and $21 million on Biden. A Trump victory in November could signal a shift toward more favorable regulatory conditions for the crypto industry, according to analysts at Bitfinex. “A Trump administration might prioritize creating a clear and supportive regulatory framework, encouraging innovation and investment in the crypto sector. This could lead to increased adoption of digital assets and a more robust integration of cryptocurrencies into the financial system, potentially spurring further growth in the industry,” analysts at Bitfinex said in an email.  Chart of the Day  Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge general or retail investors' interest in trending topics, shows that the value of the search query ""NVDA"" over the past five years is nearing the peak value of 100.  A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for the query during a given time frame.  The tool may be a good indicator to watch as the masses are often driven by emotions and frequently the last to enter a bull market and exit a bear market. In other words, NVDA and other AI-related assets might have peaked for the time being.

30085153,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626890,1719577847,Bitcoin Miner Selling Cools Off – Is This The Breakout Moment?,"In an analysis provided by CryptoQuant, a significant change in Bitcoin miner behavior has been noted, potentially indicating a turning point. CryptoQuant analyst, known as Crypto Dan, outlined a reduction in miners’ selling pressure, which has historically been a pivotal factor affecting Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Bitcoin Mining Selling Pressure Decreases According to Crypto Dan, “Miners’ selling pressure decreases. One of the whales that have caused the cryptocurrency market to fall recently have been miners.” He explained that the BTC halving, which halved mining rewards, led to a decrease in the use of older, less efficient mining rigs, subsequently reducing overall mining activity. This change forced miners to sell Bitcoin in over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to sustain their operations. The analysis suggests that the market is currently absorbing the sell-off, with a notable decline in the volume and frequency of Bitcoin being transferred out of miners’ wallets. “The current market can be seen as being in the process of digesting this sell-off, and fortunately, the quantity and number of Bitcoins miners are sending out of their wallets has been rapidly decreasing recently,” Crypto Dan stated. Related Reading: BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Reveals Major Bitcoin ETF Stake With 43,000 Shares The implications of this shift are significant. Crypto Dan added, “In other words, the selling pressure of miners is weakening, and if all of their selling volume is absorbed, a situation may be created where the upward rally can continue again.” He projected optimism for the market, predicting positive movements in the third quarter of 2024. Historical data from CryptoQuant corroborates the analysis. BTC has previously shown a similar pattern where miner selling activity exerted a strong influence on market prices, particularly noted from May to September 2023 and from December 2023 to January 2024. During these periods, prolonged sideways movement in BTC prices was observed, aligning with peaks in miner selling. Notably, when these selling activities diminished, Bitcoin prices resumed an upward trend. This pattern suggests that the recent decrease in miner selling could be the precursor to another significant bullish phase for Bitcoin, as market conditions appear ripe for a similar reversal of fortunes. Key Price Level For A Bullish Breakout Further insights from technical analysts at alpha dōjō provide a granular view of the market conditions. Their daily update on Bitcoin through X underscores the current market indecision, characterized by Bitcoin “chopping around” without clear directional movement. However, the analysts have identified critical price levels which could indicate future market movements: “If BTC reclaims the $63.5k area, it would be bullish; if it loses the $60k level, it would be bearish.” Related Reading: Fears Of Bitcoin Sales By US And German Govts Are FUD, Even Bullish: Experts The technical analysis also reveals that the liquidity in the Bitcoin market is currently dispersed, with few substantial clusters of orders. The most notable concentration of orders is around the $63.5k level, suggesting that this price point is pivotal for market sentiment and potential bullish momentum. The order book data provided by alpha dōjō highlights a current dominance of sell orders, indicating a bearish sentiment among traders. Conversely, the bid side is described as weak, with fewer buy orders supporting upward price movements. This imbalance suggests that the market is currently cautious, potentially awaiting more definitive signals before committing to more substantial positions. At press time, BTC traded at $61,704.

30082095,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626867,1719572449,WIF Heading For Rock Bottom? $2.2 Rejection Fuels Further Decline,"Dogwifhat (WIF) is experiencing increased bearish pressure after facing a significant rejection at the $2.13 resistance level. This rejection marks a pivotal moment, pushing the price downward and signaling potential continued losses for the cryptocurrency. Market analysts and investors are closely watching this development, as the inability to break through the $2.13 barrier underscores prevailing selling pressure. As WIF navigates this challenging phase, the focus shifts to identifying the next support levels and understanding the broader market implications of this downward trend. The main objective of this study is to determine whether WIF’s current price action will stabilize at significant resistance levels or continue to decline. Presently, the market capitalization of WIF is over $2 billion, with a trading volume of over $556 million. The cryptocurrency price is currently down by 3.45%, trading at roughly $2.04, while its market cap and trading volume are currently up by 0.44% and 30.66% respectively. Market Analysis: The Impact Of $2.2 Rejection On the 4-hour chart, the price of WIF started a bearish move below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after the rejection at $2,2. It can be seen that after the rejection, the price started building momentum before dropping. The 4-hour chart Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals a bearish move for WIF as the signal line of the indicator has started dropping towards the 50% level. Also, WIF’s price on the 1-day chart is currently bearish trading below the 100-SMA. This bearish move, as observed from the chart, started immediately after the price experienced a rejection at $2.2, which is now a resistance level. Furthermore, the 1-day RSI for the price of WIF signals extended bearishness. Since the signal line in this case is still active below 50%, the crypto asset’s price may decline even further. It should be noted that with the formation of WIF’s price actions and that of the RSI indicator, the price of WIF may continue declining toward the $1.47 support level. Where Will WIF Find Stability? As the price of WIF prepares for further decline, there are key support levels it may want to stabilize. If the coin finds stability at the $1.47 support level, it will start to move upward again toward the $2.25 resistance level. A break above this level may trigger WIF to move higher to test the $3.58 resistance level and might move on to test other higher levels. However, if WIF fails to find stability at $1.47 support and breaks below, it will continue to decline towards the $0.71 support level. The crypto asset may pose a further decline toward the $0.26 support if the above-mentioned level is breached.

The price rally was accompanied by an even-bigger surge in futures open interest.  There is always action in some pocket of the crypto market even when the headline numbers don't show much going on, just as the still surface of a pond can mask the extent of the dynamic ecosystem below.  That's been the case recently. Since last Friday, the negative price action in bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} has pulled the total market value of digital assets lower by 3.4% to $2.22 trillion, painting a dour picture of the crypto market.  That decline, however, obscures the 26% surge in the Kaspa blockchain's KAS token. The token, ranked 27th in market value, has topped 18 cents and is nearing the record high of $0.196 reached early this month, according to data source CoinGecko. That makes KAS the best-performing coin among the top 100 digital assets in terms of market value.  The outperformance follows bitcoin miner Marathon Digital (MARA)'s decision to diversify its revenue stream by adding KAS mining. The company said it has mined 93 million KAS tokens since September.  Kaspa's proof-of-work blockchain utilizes the GHOSTDAG (Greedy Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree Directed Acyclic Graph) protocol to enhance its performance and scalability.  GHOSTDAG prioritizes not just the longest chain but also additional blocks referenced by other blocks in the network, thereby making the blockchain more secure and resilient. Traditional blockchains tend to select the longest chain to achieve final consistency, which slows down the network's transaction throughput.  KAS' weekly gain is accompanied by a 58% surge in futures open interest to $65 million, with funding rates holding positive, according to data source Coinglass. That shows an influx of new money on the bullish side and validates the rally in price.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/28/kaspas-kas-token-bucks-broader-market-surges-26-in-a-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c82a3675ed65b8d95f0609eaebbb3aa06e4a304-2543x1430.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

30079028,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626855,1719567324,Don’t Sweat The Dip! Ethereum 15% Price Slump Could Spark Epic Comeback — Analyst,"Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a significant decline in value recently. Over the past month, its price has dropped by 15%, leading to concerns among investors about the future of this digital asset. The current situation raises questions about whether this downturn signals a prolonged decline or if it is merely a temporary setback before a potential recovery. Related Reading: Can Terra Classic Rise From The Ashes? Analyst Foresees 1,500% Price Increase Despite the price decrease, some analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s prospects. Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Yodhha has identified technical patterns that may indicate a forthcoming reversal in Ethereum’s fortunes. Ethereum: Signs Of Potential Reversal? Yodhha’s analysis highlights two key chart formations: the Inverse Head & Shoulders and the Falling Wedge (also known as a Bull Flag). The Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern, a common indicator of a market reversal, suggests that a downtrend may be shifting towards an uptrend. The Falling Wedge pattern, which occurs when the price is temporarily confined within a narrowing range, often precedes a breakout and continuation of an uptrend. $ETH Anytime now… pic.twitter.com/qF4uiWquFI — Yoddha (@CryptoYoddha) June 26, 2024 These technical indicators, along with other markers, suggest that Ethereum may already be on the verge of entering bullish territory. Yodhha’s analysis also identifies specific price levels that, if surpassed, could lead to a significant price increase for Ethereum. Impact Of Regulatory Developments In addition to technical analysis, regulatory developments play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most anticipated events is the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Industry experts speculate that this approval could come as early as July 4th, a date that could mark a significant milestone for Ethereum. Financial services firm StoneX predicts that the approval of an Ethereum ETF could lead to a substantial increase in the cryptocurrency’s price. According to StoneX, Ethereum could see a price rise of up to 40% within two months following the ETF’s launch. This surge in investor interest could help Ethereum recover from its recent slump and reach new price highs. StoneX’s projections suggest that Ethereum’s price could range from $2,140 to as high as $12,620 over the next two years, even under more conservative scenarios.

30076241,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626844,1719562531,Dogecoin To The Moon? Crypto Analyst Predicts 440% Price Increase,"In a recent technical analysis by popular crypto analyst Big Mike (@Michael_EWpro), the likelihood of a substantial rise in Dogecoin (DOGE) has been spotlighted. Employing a blend of Elliott Wave theory, Fibonacci retracement levels, and crucial indicators such as the RSI and MACD, the analysis presents a bullish scenario that could greatly influence Dogecoin’s market stance. Why Dogecoin Could Skyrocket By 440% The three-day chart for Dogecoin, as traded on Binance, exhibits a complex structure that suggests the application of Elliott Wave theory, which is essential in predicting price movements based on investor psychology and momentum. The chart indicates the end of a corrective phase and the start of a potential strong bullish trend. The Elliott Wave pattern on the chart pinpoints several crucial phases. Wave 1 began at a base level below $0.08, marking the onset of bullish momentum and peaked at $0.2196. Related Reading: Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52% Following this, the chart shows a corrective phase characterized by an A-B-C pattern. This pattern is key in Elliott Wave theory, representing a market correction after an initial price surge. Here, Wave A starts the correction with a downturn to $0.1189, followed by a slight upward retracement in Wave B to $0.17, and then a more significant decline in Wave C, setting the stage for the completion of Wave 2. This corrective phase is vital as it sets up the foundation for the anticipated bullish Wave 3. However, Big Mike predicts wave 2 could push the Dogecoin price down to $0.1032 (which represents the peak of a superior wave 1) before the onset of wave 3. The Fibonacci retracement tool is employed to identify potential future support or resistance levels. In this analysis, the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.2196 is particularly significant as it marks the peak of wave 1 and a strong resistance point that could influence future price reversals. Related Reading: Accumulation Amid Price Crash, Whale Transactions Soar The analysis also identifies potential long-term resistance levels at 1, 1.414, and 1.618 Fibonacci extensions, priced at $0.3208, $0.4839, and $0.5925 respectively. These levels could play crucial roles if the bullish Wave 3 unfolds as anticipated. Historically, the third wave in Elliott Wave theory is often the most dynamic and extensive, indicating substantial bullish potential for DOGE. This wave aims to challenge and possibly surpass long-term resistance levels. Big Mike speculates that wave 3 could reach near the 1.414 Fibonacci extension level. A potential Wave 4 might see a pullback to $0.3208 (1.0 Fibonacci level), while Wave 5 could drive the Dogecoin price to $0.6723, representing a 440% increase from current levels. Notably, this is also the peak for the superior wave 3. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently below 50, suggests a neutral stance for DOGE, indicating potential for upward movement as market sentiment shifts towards buying. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is nearing a bullish crossover, often signaling increased bullish momentum.

Ether is expected to hit $6,500 later this year due to strong ETF inflows and other positive factors, the report said.  Galaxy Research estimates $5 billion of net inflows to spot ether ETFs in the first five months, Bitwise expects $15 billion of inflows in the initial 18 months.  The crypto market is being overly pessimistic about the imminent launch of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and net inflows could hit $20 billion in the first year as the cryptocurrency has qualities that appeal to Wall Street, Steno Research said in a report on Thursday.  “We continue to forecast a net inflow between $15 billion and $20 billion in the first 12 months, even considering the outflow from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE),” senior analyst Mads Eberhardt wrote, adding that this should drive the value of ether higher, in dollar terms and also relative to bitcoin {{BTC}}.  Ether is predicted to reach at least $6,500 later this year due to these expected inflows to spot ETFs, plus additional tailwinds, the report said.  Spot ether ETFs are on the cusp of becoming available for trading in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted filings from issuers last month. Once the S-1 filings are approved the new products will start trading, and this could happen as soon as next week according to reports.  If the estimated spot ether ETF inflows are correct, the ether/bitcoin ratio should strengthen to 0.065 later this year, Steno said.  “A smaller inflow into ether ETFs compared to bitcoin ETFs will have a greater impact on ether due to its lower market capitalization and substantially poorer liquidity,” and as a result of this inflows into ETH spot ETFS are more likely to surprise to the upside than the downside, the report added.  Steno is more bullish on the outlook for spot ether ETFs flows than others. Galaxy (GLXY) Research said spot ether ETFs could see $5 billion of net inflows in the first five months. Asset Manager Bitwise predicted $15 billion of net inflows in the first 18 months.

30069275,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626792,1719550845,"BlackRock Global Allocation Fund Reveals Major Bitcoin ETF Stake With 43,000 Shares","In a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund disclosed its ownership of 43,000 shares of the asset manager’s Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust, as of April 30. This announcement follows two previous filings by BlackRock on May 28, which disclosed the fund’s exposure to Bitcoin in its Strategic Global Bond Fund and Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Investment Plan The investment giant’s move towards Bitcoin integration became evident in March when it submitted a filing to the SEC, expressing its intention to include Bitcoin ETFs in its Global Allocation Fund. BlackRock’s objective is to invest in Bitcoin ETFs that directly hold BTC, aiming to mirror the performance of the digital currency market. The company’s filing specified that the Global Allocation Fund may acquire shares in exchange-traded products (ETPs) that seek to reflect the price of Bitcoin by directly holding the cryptocurrency. However, it clarified that investments in Bitcoin ETPs will be limited to those listed and traded on recognized national securities exchanges. Related Reading: Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52% This initiative aligns with BlackRock’s broader investment strategy for its Global Allocation Fund, a mutual fund designed to diversify investors through a wide range of assets, including equities, bonds, and potentially Bitcoin ETPs. With $17.8 billion in assets under management (AUM) and a year-to-date return of 4.61% as of March 2024, the fund aims to capitalize on global investment opportunities while effectively managing risk and pursuing long-term capital growth and income. This marks the third internal BlackRock fund to invest in Bitcoin through the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF. The Strategic Global Bond Fund, Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio, and now the Global Allocation Fund have all recognized the potential of Bitcoin as an investment asset. Bitcoin Price Analysis In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has shown resilience by reclaiming the $61,780 level after experiencing a dip to as low as $58,000 on Monday. This recovery suggests that the leading cryptocurrency is withstanding the selling pressure it has encountered over the past week, indicating a potential continuation of its halted uptrend. According to technical analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin is forming an Adam & Eve bottoming pattern, which could lead to a projected 6% increase towards $66,000 if BTC maintains a candlestick close above the $62,200 level. Furthermore, historical data indicates that July has historically been favorable for Bitcoin’s price growth, particularly in years of Halving. Analyzing the image above, 7 out of the previous 11 July months resulted in positive gains. The green months, in particular, generated an impressive upside of 16.52%, while the red months experienced a downside of 6.99%. Examining the performance of Bitcoin in the third quarter (Q3), the data presents a more balanced picture. Out of the previous 11 Q3 periods, 5 were positive. Green Q3s, on average, produced a significant upside of 33.52%, while red Q3s generated an average downside of 16.023%. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) To Hit New Highs? Analysts Predict $25 Target Whether historical price performance will repeat itself, leading to price gains for BTC, remains to be answered.

There's a growing market sentiment on the platform that President Biden will either not be the Democratic nominee or drop out of the race.  Blockchain bettors were skeptical of President Biden's performance in the first debate of the 2024 election cycle, pushing up former President Trump's odds of winning the November election to as high as 67%.  A contract asking bettors to declare the outcome of the 2024 election currently has close to $188 million on the line, with around $23 million on Trump and $21 million on Biden. Bets on Polymarket are placed in smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain and settled in the USDC stablecoin.  Polymarket said it suffered a brief downtime as the debate started because of a large wave of traffic.  A growing skepticism about Biden's chances of going the distance to election day has been reinforced by looking at market sentiment.  According to Polymarket, there's a less than 70% chance that Biden will be the Democrat's nominee, with California governor Gavin Newsom hitting a high of 17% and Michelle Obama up to 7%.  Another contract asking if Biden would drop out of the presidential race surged during the debate to 43%.  Meanwhile, PoliFi token traders pushed both major tokens representing Trump and Biden well into the red.  According to CoinGecko data, the MAGA token, which trades under the ticker TRUMP, is down 12.5%, while the BODEN token is down 34%. TREMP is also down 10%. The DJT token, in the headlines recently for its apparent connection to Barron Trump, is down 5%.  Crypto was not mentioned during this debate despite it becoming a Republican campaign issue. A Polymarket contract asking if Trump will mention crypto or bitcoin pegged it as unlikely, topping out at 6%.  Independent candidate Robert F.

30067137,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626762,1719547240,Is Ethereum About To Take Off? Analysts Weigh In Amid ETF Approval Date Rumors,"Ethereum (ETH)’s struggles to regain the last cycle’s heights have brewed a bearish sentiment among some sectors of the crypto community. Its performance during Q2 has seemingly continued to fuel the sentiment. However, with rumors of an ETH ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) approval being around the corner, analysts believe the ‘King of Altcoins’ is about to hit the “ETH season.” Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Expects $15 Billion To Flow Into Spot Ethereum ETFs, How Will ETH React? Will Ethereum Spot ETF Come Next Week? On Wednesday, Reuters revealed sources close to some investment firms believe that Ethereum ETFs will be approved next week. The rumors follow the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Gary Gensler, comments regarding the investment products’ approval. Earlier this week, Gensler spoke at the Bloomberg Invest Summit, revealing that the approval process is “working smoothly.” The launch of the highly anticipated products is expected to come this summer and could be as early as July. According to Reuters, industry executives and lawyers involved with the applicants believe the Ethereum ETF could be approved within the next two weeks. Per the report, the ETH approval could come as soon as July 4. A month ago, ETH’s price soared by over 30% in anticipation of an SEC’s approval, going from the $3,000 mark to the $3,900 price range. Since then, the second-largest cryptocurrency has retraced to the $3,200 support zone. Nonetheless, the ‘King of Altcoins’ saw a positive impact from the recent ETF rumors. Ethereum rose by 2.5% following the news, recovering the $3,400 support zone it lost at the beginning of the week. Is ‘ETH Season’ Around The Corner? Crypto analyst Jelle believes that ETH might be ready for take-off despite the expectations of “an underwhelming ETF launch.” To the analyst, ETH “looks ready for a massive push higher” as it tests key levels the week before the alleged approval. Per his chart, the cryptocurrency is testing the support of a downtrend within the accumulation range. Jelle considers that if ETH pushes into $4,000 again, it might not “stop anytime soon.” To him, the “nearly three years in the making breakout” into the expansion zone will kickstart the “ETH season.” Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that Ethereum is still consolidating against a “massive 2-year-long downtrend line.” Per the trader, the May pump highs are the place to break. A “higher high above 0.0575” would “flip the market structure to bullish.” Moreover, Crypto Yoddha highlighted the falling wedge pattern in the ETHBTC chart. The trader suggested that a breakout will come “anytime now.” This analysis was also shared by trader Miky Bull, who considers Ethereum “fully ripe for a rally from the retest of fib .618 level.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Roadblocks: What’s Hindering A Fresh Increase? Despite being down by over 10% from the May pump, ETH has seen a 3.6% increase in the last 24 hours. As of this writing, the ‘King of Altcoins’ is exchanging hands at $3,450.

Particularly, prominent crypto analyst Willy Woo voiced earlier that the minor surge was primarily a “technical” response to oversold conditions and did not indicate underlying market strengths. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit New Heights? Analyst Predicts 10x Growth In Few Years — Here’s How Bitcoin Bears Are Still In Control Diving into Woo’s analysis shared on Elon Musk’s X platform, Woo remarked that although Bitcoin recently rebounded from a significant dip below $60,000, fundamental market indicators remain weak, signifying that the recent price action is not a reliable indicator of sustained recovery. According to Woo, the bounce back is driven by technical factors such as the TD9 reversal and a hidden bullish divergence rather than genuine market recovery. “The markets would correct for overselling,” Woo explained, highlighting that current trading activities do not reflect a shift in the basic supply and demand dynamics essential for a genuine bullish market turnaround. He further emphasized that spot buying needs to be substantially increased for a true bullish sentiment to take hold, which remains lackluster. Nice to see some of the speculation getting purged the last few days. Still a bit heavy, still too much speculation. Bears still in control, but #Bitcoin got so oversold in the liquidations that it’s really hard to go lower without an uptick. pic.twitter.com/EJeqmaLe0Z — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 26, 2024 Woo further points out that speculative pressures are still rampant, with an excess of synthetic coins in circulation yet to be replaced by genuine market purchases. This imbalance underscores a market dominated by speculation rather than investment, with long-term sustainability in question. The analyst suggests the market might experience a few more weeks of stagnation or minimal gains, reminding of the anticipated bounce from hash rate. Woo noted: And we are still waiting on hash rate to bounce which is a leading sign that miners have stopped selling to fund hardware upgrades. So be prepared for very boring price action for many more weeks. It’s not moon boy time. It’s time for speculators to liquidate themselves, or until they get bored and close positions. Then we can move on. Best path here is to stack spot and let degens die. BTC’s Volatile Journey And Potential 40% Drop The leading cryptocurrency by market cap has endured a tumultuous few months, marked by a significant downturn. After reaching a new high above $73,000 in March, Bitcoin has since retreated by nearly 20%, recently rebounding to just over $61,000 after briefly dipping to a 24-hour low of $60,606. This volatility aligns with analyst comments suggesting that bearish trends may continue to dominate. An analyst recently noted on X that Bitcoin holders might face further declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Correction Is Not Done: $54K Could Be On The Horizon, Says Top Analyst The analyst pointed to the selling patterns of long-term holders (LTHs) during previous cycles, predicting a potential 40% drop from all-time highs.

This first debate between current President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump – each their parties' presumptive nominee – was held Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia by CNN, hosted by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. The 90-minute debate began with the economy but also touched on issues like abortion, immigration and foreign policy. The economic section was brief, and the debate barely approached technology policy, let alone the digital assets industry.  Crypto has been a talking point for candidates and lawmakers through this election cycle, but emerged in a big way after Trump began discussing crypto issues on the campaign trail, promising to commute the sentence of Silk Road's Ross Ulbricht and making statements about regulation. For his part, Biden's campaign has not made any public statements about crypto, though his administration recently said he wants to work with Congress on legislation addressing crypto.  Biden, who took office in January 2021, sounded raspy and was soft-spoken throughout the evening, reportedly due to a cold. Trump was louder and clearer, though fact-checkers dinged his assertions throughout the debate more than Biden's.  For its part, the crypto industry is hoping for a Congress and administration that may pass legislation friendlier to digital asset businesses. To that end, participants are looking to repeat the massive spending on elections from 2022, with companies like Coinbase, Ripple and Andresseen Horowitz donating close to $50 million apiece to political action committees like Fairshake to support candidates.

Ethereum ETFs On The Horizon According to a recent Reuters report, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve Ethereum ETFs as soon as July 4, as discussions between asset managers and regulators enter the final stages. Industry executives and other participants who requested anonymity due to the confidential nature of the talks revealed that the process of amending the offering documents has progressed to resolving only “minor” issues, and approval is “probably not more than a week or two away.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Battling Bearish Headwinds: Is The Sell-Off Over? According to Morningstar Direct data, the launch of Bitcoin-based ETFs in the US in January was a major success, drawing around $8 billion in assets. By late June, these nine new products had nearly $38 billion in assets, although the holdings of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust – which converted its $27 billion BTC trust into an ETF simultaneously – dipped to $17.8 billion. However, experts believe the launch of the new spot Ethereum ETFs may not be as impressive as the Bitcoin ETF debut. James Butterfill, head of research at Coinshares, noted that “Ethereum is not the same size in terms of market cap, nor does it have the same volumes” as BTC. Given the differences in market size and nature of the two cryptocurrencies, Bryan Armour, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, believes inflows may be much more muted when the Ethereum ETFs launch. “With Bitcoin, there had been pent-up demand for a decade, and investor interest was off the charts,” Armour said. “This just isn’t going to command the same excitement.” However, not everyone shares the same cautious outlook. ETH Eyes Potential Rally Toward $7,500 Quinn Thompson, the founder and CIO of Lekker Capital, has recently stated that the market is in the middle of “one of the most obvious and attractive crypto buying opportunities of recent memory.” Thompson further claimed that it was “cool” to be bullish in the past, but now, it appears that “Twitter has become a contest to see who can have the most negative ETH ETF take.” Thompson further noted: Personally, I think ETH will reach $7,000 and BTC will make its first attempt at $100,000 by the election in November. The Glassnode co-founders also shared a bullish price analysis for Ether, stating that if investors look at Ether’s history, similar patterns are developing as in the early stages of the 2021 bull market. They believe the current structure gives a target of around $7,500 as a final high for Ether, mirroring the Fibonacci extension seen in 2021 and implying a strong rally in Ether “soon!” Related Reading: Dogecoin Profitability Rises To 75% As Shiba Inu Plunges To 52% While caution remains regarding the possibility of further price declines, experts argue that such a scenario would require a new exogenous event to occur.

30060770,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=626684,1719536428,Retail Losing Interest In Bitcoin? Volume Plunges 30%,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin transfer volume of retail investors has seen a sharp decline recently, a sign that this group may be losing interest. Bitcoin Volume For Retail-Sized Transactions Has Plunged Recently As explained by CrypoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the total BTC transfer volume for transactions valued between $1,000 and $10,000 has gone down recently. The “transfer volume” here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin (in USD) that addresses on the network are moving around daily. This metric isn’t confused with the “trading volume,” which typically keeps track of only the volume involved in trades on spot exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ‘Euphoria’ Boundary: What Happens After A Breach? When the value of the transfer volume is high, it means the users are moving around large amounts on the blockchain right now. Such a trend implies that investors are actively interested in trading the asset. On the other hand, the low metric suggests that holders may not pay attention to the cryptocurrency as they aren’t participating in much activity on the network. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin transfer volume specifically for the transactions involving the movement of coins worth at least $1,000 and at most $10,000: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin transfer volume for transactions of this size spiked to relatively high levels during the rally earlier in the year. The $1,000 to $10,000-sized transfers are considered relatively small, so their volume would reflect the level of activity of the smallest of investors in the market: retail. The increase in this metric from earlier in the year would suggest the price surge ignited interest in the asset from these investors. The chart shows that a similar trend was also observed during the previous bull run. Sharp price action is generally exciting to retail investors, so it’s not surprising that they tend to become more active during rallies. This increased interest is what makes any surge sustainable for extended periods. As such, only rallies that can attract retail interest can hope to last. As the chart shows, the Bitcoin transfer volume for retail-sized moves peaked in May and has since seen a sharp drawdown of 30%. This would mean that the bearish price action has made these investors disappear. Interestingly, the downtrend in the indicator persisted even when Bitcoin had made a recovery back above $70,000 a few weeks ago, which could have been a potential foreshadowing that this rally would never stay.
