42404877,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdlTW4,1595790000,The Future for Unregulated Bitcoin Exchanges,"To KYC or not to KYC? In this episode, CoinDesk’s Anna Baydakova talks to Hodl Hodl and Bisq, two non-custodial, no-KYC bitcoin exchanges.      For daily insights and unique perspectives listen or subscribe to the CoinDesk Podcast Network with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.      This episode is sponsored by Bitstamp and Crypto.com.      One year ago, the Financial Action Task Force, the global anti-money laundering watchdog, ruled that crypto transactions data should be controllable, and ever since the question has been not if you know your customers (KYC) but how you do it.      But not all bitcoiners have surrendered to this norm. Hodl Hodl and Bisq don't provide centralized custody and don't check user identity. They also don't employ the blockchain tracing tools to block the ""tainted"" coins (blacklisted as coming from illicit activities), which has become a must for major bitcoin exchanges these days.      What comes with this? A chance to buy and sell bitcoin without revealing your identity, as well as much more responsibility over how you buy and store your crypto. Max Keidun, the CEO of Hodl Hodl, and Steve Jain, contributor to Bisq, dig into why, in the times of crypto compliance, people still might need (or maybe just lawfully want) to keep their bitcoin deals to themselves.      See also: P2P Exchange Hodl Hodl Takes First Step in Bringing Private Bitcoin Trades to BlueWallet Users      There are more questions to arise from such old-school cypherpunk thinking: how can you make sure you don't get scammed at these p2p platforms? What do you do if you buy ""tainted"" coins blacklisted by the FATF-abiding exchanges and vendors?      Max and Steve share their takes on this, and the main explanation is probably: ""everything has a price."" Including freedom from surveillance and data leaks.      We also touch the matter of decentralization that is important to both Hodl Hodl and Bisq. Hodl Hodl is planning to open source itself, so everyone can clone and run their own p2p bitcoin exchange in case the regulators go after Keidun and his team. And Bisq fully decentralized last year, when it turned all its decision making over to a DAO.

However, it still lags Ethereum's ether token, which recently traded at 13-month highs.    Bitcoin rose to $10,135 at 10:05 UTC – a level last seen on June 2.  The biggest cryptocurrency by market value is trading near $9,970 at press time, representing a 4% gain on a 24-hour basis and 8% gains on a week-to-date basis.  ""The DeFi-led surge in Ethereum’s ether token, the second-largest cryptocurrency, seems to have spilled over into the bitcoin market,"" said John Ng Pangilinan, managing partner at Singapore-based Signum Capital.  Ether’s price rose to a 13-month high of $319 early Friday and is currently trading at $310 – up over 9% on a 24-hour basis and 30% this week alone.  The token, which powers Ethereum’s blockchain, has gained 140% this year, leaving bitcoin, up 40% on a year-to-date basis, far behind.  Bitcoin is outshining gold, which has appreciated by 25% this year.  However, gold is trading close to its record high of $1,920 reached in 2011, while bitcoin is still down 50% from its lifetime high of $20,000 hit in December 2017.  The U.S. Federal Reserve's massive liquidity injections and the negative yield on the inflation-adjusted US bonds look to have powered gains in gold, an inflation-hedge.  Bitcoin, however, struggled to draw hedging bids over the past two months and was locked in the narrow range of $9,000 to $10,000.
