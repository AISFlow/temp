The country's top banks - Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank and Kasikornbank - will all participate in the initiative, which utilizes the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric as a technology platform.  ""With this infrastructure sharing, banks do not need to invest on their own,"" Veerathai Santiprabhob, the governor of the Bank of Thailand, said at a press conference according to Nikkei. ""Interoperability enhances efficiency, reduces costs in our financial sector and addresses the needs of the consumer and the business sector.""  The group's blockchain platform was first launched by Kasikornbank in collaboration with IBM in July of 2017.  In Thailand, administering letters of guarantee – which are documents issued by banks to guarantee their clients' payment obligations – can take days. Digitizing the documents and shifting them to the blockchain can reduce the turnover time to just thirty minutes, according to Nikkei.  ""For the business sector, the Thailand Blockchain Community Initiative will reduce the complexity of connecting to the same financial services provided by different banks, facilitate data verification on the same blockchain network, mitigate risks of counterfeiting and increase timeliness as well as security,"" Thai newspaper The Nation quoted Santiprabhob as saying.  The system will initially be tested in the Thai central bank's ""sandbox"" and used to issue letters of guarantee to state-owned enterprise auctions and other domestic trading operations.  The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, a state-owned energy company, and Siam Cement Group, the second largest company in Thailand, are both poised to participate as well.

42401306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzH2,1521490533,Israeli Regulator Outlines What Makes A Token a Security (Or Not),"The Israel Securities Authority is recommending lenient regulations for initial coin offerings, including a clear definition of what separates a so-called ""utility token"" from a security.  In a report released last week, the regulator even proposed a temporary sandbox, where regulators would allow entrepreneurs to experiment under supervision as the cryptocurrency market evolves.  According to the ISA report, a utility token that ""confers usage rights in a product or service offered by a specific venture"" shouldn't necessarily be deemed a security. Neither should tokens that are used solely for clearing, exchange or payments for a specific project, the report said.  Many blockchain advocates welcomed the Israeli regulator's stance. Amitay Molko, co-founder of the Jerusalem-based networking group Blockchain JLM, told CoinDesk:  ""The Israeli regulators are showing that they are taking this very seriously and fairly. This is the first step in the right direction.""  However, a utility token might be a security if the cryptocurrency isn’t controlled by a cohesive party, such as the startup itself, and if it can be used for payments beyond the initial venture.  For example, if someone tried to fundraise for a private company by issuing a new general-purpose cryptocurrency similar to bitcoin, that might be a security token, in the agency's view.  Case by case  The report recommends evaluating new tokens on a case-by-case basis, saying:  ""A cryptocurrency shall be considered a security according to the array of circumstances and characteristics of each case, taking into consideration the purpose of the law. Cryptocurrencies conferring rights similar to those of conventional securities, such as shares, bonds, or participation units, shall be considered securities.""  In the meantime, the ISA report defined a security or investment token as a cryptocurrency entitling the holder to the future cash flow or ""ownership rights, participation, or membership in a specific venture,” according to a translation by the Israeli outlet Globes.  The clearest distinction between a utility token and a security, according to the report, is whether there are options to trade it in a secondary market. Another crucial factor is whether there is an existing platform where people can actually use the tokens. Promising a future platform doesn't guarantee the token was purchased for its utility.  If there’s no working platform or use case, despite trading options, Israeli regulators believe the token was probably purchased as an investment.  The report is now in the hands of ISA chair Anat Guetta, who will decide how to proceed with unique securities regulations for the cryptocurrency space.  The Israeli agency's stance stands in contrast to other regulators, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, whose chairman, Jay Clayton, recently said every ICO he's seen was a security.

In a report published at the beginning of March, the Bank of France proposes to ban insurance companies, banks and trust companies from ""taking part in deposits and loans in crypto-assets."" It also advocates prohibiting all marketing of ""crypto-asset"" savings products to the public, save for the ""most informed investors.""  The report, which provides an overview of the technology and suggests strict regulatory provisions, claims that cryptocurrencies do not constitute money and emphasizes that they are not legal tender.  The document labels them instead as a medium of cyberattacks, money laundering and terrorism financing.  ""Very little value is expressed in these crypto-assets,"" the authors claim. They remark further:  ""The anonymity that characterizes the means of production and transfer of the majority of crypto-assets favors above all a risk of them being used to criminal ends (sold on the internet for illicit services or goods) or used to the end of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.""  Echoing other critics, the report also dismisses the recent run up in ""the price of crypto-assets"" as a ""speculative bubble"" akin to the ""tulip mania"" period in the Netherlands from 1634 to 1637.  As for the central bank's suggested regulatory framework, it writes that its priority is to institute anti-money-laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) measures, which would be achieved by expanding the European Union's Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.  Public protection  It also expressed concerns about investor protection and ""cyber-risks,"" and cautioned that the crypto industry's ""boom in activity"" could potentially destabilize financial markets.  The report's first recommendation is to ""regulate the services offered at the interface between the real economy and crypto-assets"" – meaning primarily that crypto exchanges should be considered payment services providers and should be subject to corresponding legal requirements.  The bank goes on to suggest strict supervision of crypto-asset investments, including the aforementioned prohibition of banks, insurance companies and trust companies from dealing in crypto deposits and loans, and marketing prohibitions associated with savings products.  It also writes that it agrees with the suggestion of France's stock market regulator, the Autorite des Marches Financiers (AMF), that cryptocurrency derivatives should not be marketed to the public.  The bank closes its report with an appeal to global regulators to enact ""international-level"" measures to oversee crypto-assets, arguing that a lack of coordination could undermine the efficacy of any national-level actions.  ""Considering the immaterial nature of crypto-assets and the use of internet related technologies that facilitate cross border services,"" the document concludes, ""the heterogeneity of national regulations could prevent a comprehensive supervision of the risks at hand.""

According to a Reuters report, the minister said:  “In our upcoming fintech strategy, the government will announce further work with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England to consider these issues in more detail. ... The UK is the best place in the world for fintech and my mandate is to ensure it remains such.”  Speaking at the Innovate Finance conference in London, Glen specifically cited concerns about the repercussions arising from the ""explosive growth” of cryptocurrencies. At the same time, he said he aims to safeguard London’s position as a leading global hub for fintech experimentation and blockchain technologies.  Glen added that 2017 was a record-breaking year for the U.K.'s fintech sector, attracting investments worth £1.3 billion (roughly $1.8 billion). More than half of those funds reportedly came from abroad, a clear motivation for British regulators to continue welcoming blockchain projects.  Beyond the private sector, the Bank of England (BoE) is perhaps one of the world’s most bullish central banks when it comes to cryptocurrency.  In December 2017, the central bank's chief, Mark Carney, said in December 2017 that bitcoin's price moves don’t appear to threaten global economic stability.  And, last April, the BoE – which also runs a fintech accelerator that welcomes blockchain firms – said it planned to build the next version of its settlement system with distributed ledger tech in mind.

The U.S. president was previously said to be preparing to sign an executive order imposing additional sanctions on the South American nation for its attempt to bypass existing economic restrictions, McClatchy DC reported on Friday. On Monday, Trump signed an order blocking any U.S. transactions in the petro, the White House announced.  Specifically, the executive orderhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-taking-additional-steps-address-situation-venezuela/ states:  ""All transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018, are prohibited as of the effective date of this order.""  The sanctions represent the most notable development to date since Venezuela launched the petro in February. As stated at the time by government officials, Venezuela is seeking to use the cryptocurrency as a way to circumvent international sanctions.  That the Trump administration would make such a move is perhaps unsurprising; several U.S. lawmakers have sharply criticized the petro, with Senators Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio – and, later, Bill Nelson – writing letters to the Treasury Department asking how it would protect American investors and prevent Venezuela from raising money.  The Treasury Department has yet to respond directly to the letters' contents but did confirm that sanctions risks would apply to Americans purchasing the token. Menendez's office later confirmed to CoinDesk that he was continuing to press the department for a response.  The controversial token has received pushback from within Venezuela’s borders as well. The nation’s Congress denounced it as ""illegal"" and unconstitutional.  And while Maduro has claimed to have already garnered as much as $5 billionhttps://hacked.com/venezuelas-petro-cryptocurrency-brings-in-5-billion-according-to-president-maduro/ through the token's pre-sale, no evidence has yet been presented to back up this claim.

Making strides on an ambitious roadmap released earlier this year, the non-profit behind the cryptocurrency Stellar has released a formal specification describing how and when it plans to adopt the transaction tech originally invented for bitcoin, in the process providing the latest sign Lightning is spreading as a pressing priority across blockchains.  Overall, the specification describes how Stellar plans to adopt the technology, marking a milestone for a project that's been in-progress since Stellar Development Foundation co-founder and CTO Jed McCaleb first floated the idea back in 2015.  McCaleb told CoinDesk:  ""Scalability is one of our primary focuses over the next year. Hype tends to exceed reality in blockchain space – visions are big. The thing is, the tech can't actually realize what people want today.""  Most pressing of all, though, according to McCaleb, is that Stellar's partners are pushing for this kind of scale.  When ethereum experienced growing pains, mobile messaging app Kik ditched the platform for the more scalable Stellar. But, if Kik really starts wants to move all of its transactions over to Stellar, the platform simply can't handle that size, McCaleb conceded.  In addition, partners tech giant IBM has ""ambitious plans for banks to use the network,"" which would require Stellar to scale, while micropayment startup SatoshiPay and others ""in the pipeline"" have also expressed their interest in greater transaction scalability.  ""We know if they used Stellar as much as they want to, Stellar would max out,"" McCaleb said. ""Prior to these people using the platform, it needs to be ready. We want it to be more real.""  Next steps  And there are signs that Lightning could help here.  The announcement comes days after the first Lightning software for real bitcoin transactions was released by startup Lightning Labs. Though it took years for bitcoin to get to that point, McCaleb believes Stellar will be able to deliver the technology faster than bitcoin was able to.  ""Now that it works in bitcoinland, that will make things move faster for us,"" he said.  That's not to say integrating Lightning on Stellar is an easy feat. Stellar developers can't simply port over the code working on bitcoin today. Rather, they've developed their own unique version. To that end, they enlisted developer Jeremy Rubin, who's contributed actively to bitcoin's most popular node implementation over the years.  Another – admittedly further down the line – advantage McCaleb pointed to is that Lightning makes it easier to make payments across blockchains.  But, as far as the near-term, the specification outlines a roadmap. By April 1, Stellar plans to launch the first elements the technology on a test network, with ambitious plans to release an implementation for real payments by autumn.  McCaleb stressed that the tech team is seeking feedback from developers and researchers in the community so they're not ""throwing the tech over the wall.""  What comes next is another story.  Bitcoin companies are raining down Lightning announcements, and McCaleb hopes that Stellar won't be far behind.

The group will aim to ""build on FTC staff expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology through resource sharing and by hosting outside experts."" It will also strive to improve coordination and communication of enforcement actions both within the agency and externally.  The creation of the group coincided with an FTC announcement that it is pursuing a lawsuit against four individuals associated with Bitcoin Funding Team and related operations My7Network and Jetcoin, who allegedly used bitcoin in fraudulent ""chain referral schemes"" – the first case of its kind for the agency.  ""It is no surprise that fraudsters might use cryptocurrencies in their scams,"" Chilson wrote of the case in Friday's blog post, continuing:  ""As the primary federal general consumer protection agency, the FTC has seen this pattern before.

In a statement released Monday, the SFC said that marketplace startup Black Cell Technology Limited, which sells the ""krop"" token as a means of connecting buyers with crop and livestock producers, had effectively launched a Collective Investment Scheme (CIS), which under local regulations must be preregistered and authorized.  Black Cell had not registered its scheme, despite selling tokens to fund the development of its mobile platform, according to the announcement.  The SFC said:  “Black Cell Technology Limited has … agreed to unwind ICO transactions for Hong Kong investors by returning them the relevant tokens following regulatory action by the Securities and Futures Commission over concerns that Black Cell had engaged in potential unauthorized promotional activities and unlicensed regulated activities.”  The SFC’s action comes some two months after the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission filed a similar cease-and-desist against Black Cell for selling unregistered securities. At the time, the regulator identified three other affiliated registered companies and local resident Joseph Calata as being associated with the ICO.  While Black Cell appealed the order, a hearing confirmed that krop tokens are unregistered securities as defined in the Philippines. As a result, the cease-and-desist is now permanent.

42401317,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzPt,1521464409,"Northern Trust, PwC Launch 'Instant' Blockchain Audits","Northern Trust, a major U.S. custody bank, is laying the foundations for large-scale adoption of its blockchain-based platform for private equity funds.  In partnership with ""Big Four"" accounting firm PwC, the bank introduced new tools Monday to give private equity fund auditors fast access to data stored on its private blockchain. Rather than waiting for periodic reports about actions taken by a fund manager, auditors will get the information almost immediately.  ""We've taken and updated a process that was manual and happens periodically, and we've enabled that to be done on a daily basis in an automated manner,"" said Northern Trust president of corporate and institutional services, Pete Cherecwich, in an interview with CoinDesk.  While only one Northern Trust client, the Swiss investment manager Unigestion, is currently using the blockchain platform that went live last year, Cherecwich positioned the new capabilities as a way to attract more users.  “Our strategy was to continue with the one customer and to continue to build out from a minimum viable product to a more robust application,"" Cherecwich said, adding:  ""What we’re doing now is finishing off the complete application, then we’ll start rolling out to our existing clients and new clients to the start of next year, or middle of this year.”  The potential user base for the blockchain platform is formidable, as Northern Trust administershttps://www.evestment.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2017-evestment-alternative-fund-administrator-survey.pdf $78 billion in private equity assets. Its clients in this line of business have included major players such as Blackstone and the Carlyle Group.  The private equities blockchain platform is now running the first enterprise-grade version of Hyperledger Fabric, and protected using hardware security modules enabled by the IBM Blockchain Platform.  Blockchain auditor  The Northern Trust blockchain audit tools start off by giving auditors access to a specially designed node on the bank's permissioned blockchain.  By using the software, auditors of a private equity fund will be able to see read-only files in near real-time when shares are bought and sold between general partners and limited partners, when investment firms call for capital promised by investors, and when capital gains are distributed.  The auditors can either transfer the required data into their own applications to complete the audit process or develop their own tools to audit directly from the blockchain. Permission to audit the various funds will be controlled by smart contract technology for which Northern Trust says it has a patent pending.  In addition to the work with PwC, Northern Trust says another audit firm based in the British Crown dependency of Guernsey, where 20 percent of the bank's private equity assets are domiciled, helped ensure that all the data an auditor would require from such transactions was adequately captured.  Currently, that data is only disclosed periodically throughout the year to auditors, who then have to go through the manual process of auditing the various events. Going forward, Cherecwich says the cost for these services can be trimmed, as the role human auditors play is reduced.  ""We as an industry need to keep our margins and keep going forward,"" said Cherecwich, continuing:  ""While this may look scary because it makes an audit go forward more efficiently, I think that audit firms should embrace this because it lets them do their jobs cheaper.""  The future of audits?  The immutability and transparency of blockchain have long proven tempting attributes to innovation-minded accountants.  Each of the Big Four accounting firms, Deloitte, EY, KPMG , and PwC has released a report on the role blockchain will play in the future of auditing.  An early mover to actually adopting blockchain in accounting is New York-based Libra, which partnered with PwC to launch its own enterprise blockchain auditing software in 2016. Most recently, PwC itself has announced a new auditing tool reportedly being used by an unnamed stock exchange and a digital wallet provider.  A representative of PwC told CoinDesk the auditing tool created with Northern Trust was custom-built with the bank and is separate from the technology revealed last week, with potential opportunities for them to ""interface"" in the future.  Further explaining how the Northern Trust platform fits into PwC's larger plans, a partner at the firm, based in Guernsey, Nick Vermeulen, said in a statement:  “Our ability to directly access distributed ledgers such as the one within the Northern Trust system will allow us to build upon our own blockchain investments.""

The world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which traded around $740 a week ago, fell to $460 on Sunday – its lowest level since Dec. 11. The 37.8 percent fall looks to be associated with ether-specific news flow and broad-based risk aversion in the crypto markets.  Last week, an official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the agency is investigating ""dozens"" of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – news that seems to have weighed over ether, given the ethereum blockchain serves as a platform for token creation via its ERC-20 standard.  Further, ETH's drop below $500 yesterday coincided with reports that the EOS team is releasing about 400,000 ETH tokens on the market. While the EOS token is built on ethereum, it is widely considered a crypto competitor.  Currently, ETH is trading at $535, having clocked a high of $556 earlier today, according to CoinMarketCap. The retreat from the intraday high suggests the rally from $460 was likely a ""dead cat bounce"" – a correction in a bearish trend.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows that the head-and-shoulders breakdown seen last week confirmed a longer-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  However, the oversold conditions, as highlighted by the relative strength index (RSI) and the previous's day long-tailed candle (signals bearish exhaustion) indicate ether will likely trade in the sideways manner for the next couple of days.  The upside could be capped around the descending (bearish) 10-day moving average (MA), while the previous day's low of $452 could act as a strong support, given the oversold conditions.  View  Ether could consolidate in the range of $630–$550 over the next 48 hours.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) above the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance (former support) of $640 would abort the bearish view.  Bearish scenario: Repeated failure to beat resistance at $565 (Feb. 6 low) could yield a bigger sell-off to $385 (Nov. 30 low).

42401307,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzJ0,1521460820,A Stablecoin for HODLers? 'Pizza CEO' Raises $3 Million for New Crypto,"A fixed price coin whose value increases over time? Only in crypto.  Coming out of stealth mode Monday, crypto project Fragments is revealing that it has raised a $3 million venture round led by True Ventures, with additional participation by Pantera, FBG Capital, Founder Collective and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.  Co-founded by Pythagoras Pizza founder Evan Kuo, the project was originally designed as a gig economy token but has since pivoted from that vision to one that addresses a fundamental problem in crypto: the need for a token that can easily trade in and out of government-backed currencies. Kuo's co-founder on the project is Brandon Iles, who previously worked as an engineer at Uber and on Google's search team.  The big idea behind the project, as described in its documentation, is this: ""At a high level, the Fragments protocol stabilizes price by moving volatility from unit price to unit count.""  But while that may sound complex, the idea is simple at heart.  When the price goes up, the protocol will automatically issue a new cryptocurrency called ""fragments."" Some of those fragments will go to the wallets of existing users. So, a holder who bought one token and never sold would find more tokens in the wallet over time, even if they never made later purchases.  It's worth noting that emissions won't go solely to wallet holders, though. They will also go into two reserves, one that funds future development and another that buys ether, ethereum's blockchain token, to have ready when supply needs to contract because prices are falling.  It's natural to think that inflation and deflation tend to occur in equal measure, but Kuo noted that there's no theoretical limit to how much a currency can be worth, but the value can't go below zero.  And every time deflation gets triggered, holders come out ahead.  Venture interest  And because of this built-in incentive scheme, investors see the idea as one that could last.  Kuo explained that Fragments wanted a venture fund to lead its round in order to signal that the project is oriented around long-term thinking.  He told CoinDesk:  ""In the crypto world, things tend to move faster. With a venture fund, they are really looking to be involved in a project for five to 10 years, ideally""  True Ventures partner Adam D’Augelli also spoke to this long-term vision, telling CoinDesk that he believes the project will open up new business opportunities in crypto over time.  ""Evan brings a unique perspective to this problem, which is to be fair to all participants in the market and focus on long-term usability,"" D’Augelli said.  It's worth noting here that Kuo resists the stablecoin category, preferring to describe fragments as a ""low-volatility cryptocurrency,"" but it's hard to imagine the market won't think of it alongside the other similar efforts, such as Tether, MakerDao and Basecoin.  ""Not that this won't be stable, but more that it is a holdable token as well as a spendable token,"" Kuo said.  Pantera partner Paul Veradittakit told CoinDesk in an email that the firm likes the approach of ""utilizing a reserve to help stabilization. The stablecoin segment is going to evolve quite a bit but this team should be able to navigate the waters well.""  Complementing crypto  It's worth noting that Kuo came around to the idea after he first considered building the aforementioned project for the gig economy. So, like many entrepreneurs before him, he pivoted to solving the first problem in front of him and held off on his original idea.  But to be able to work at scale, the company will need enough clout to register in the crypto economy. That will take capital if, for nothing else, stocking its reserve. (Kuo declined to say how much he thinks Fragments will need or how it would be raised in any token sale.)  ""I don't see us raising an enormous amount,"" Kuo said.  The most he would say is that it should be about six months until the project runs a testnet. ""Since we're not going to be launching a token in advance ... it's just all about getting it functional,"" Kuo said.  The first token will be a U.S. dollar-pegged fragment, which doesn't necessarily mean that future coins will be pegged to other fiat currencies.  Kuo concluded:  ""Ideally, we'd like to be a stabilization service for utility tokens, because I think that would be the ultimate stablecoin.""

In an letter sent Monday to IT services firm Enjoyor, the bourse raised concerns over an article published via the company's WeChat channel on Friday, March 16, that touted a successful trial of a blockchain solution by a company in which Enjoyor holds a stake.  Following the publishing of the article, the letter states, Enjoyor stock surged 10 percent, reaching a daily limit imposed by trading policies in the country.  Shenzhen Stock Exchange, founded in 1990, while itself not a securities regulator in China, is nonetheless a government-led organization that self-regulates listed public companies to ensure they comply with securities laws in the country.  According to the exchange, although the Enjover article has since been removed, the firm had boasted that the blockchain trial, completed by Chinese startup Numbullhttp://www.numbull.com/about/company, is the world's first blockchain application that can authenticate certificates in the field of forensic science.  The authenticity of this claim appears to have drawn immediate attention from the SZSE, which has now ordered the firm to submit substantial evidence to prove its claim.  In essence, the stock exchange is seeking to determine whether the firm's report was intentionally misleading, and meant to take advantage of blockchain hype to drive up its stock price.  SZSE is demanding a formal response from the firm to disclose details of its ownership stake in Numbull, including the time, amount and nature of its investment, and whether Enjoyor has a major influence over the firm's operations.  Furthermore, the exchange is requiring the firm to provide details of blockchain application, including how it's operated, details of the trial and how it would generate revenue, as well as whether the solution is entitled to the claim of being a ""world first.""

42401322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzXl,1521456046,"Bitcoin Returns Above $8K, But Sell-Off Risk Remains","Bitcoin's (BTC) corrective rally could soon see prices climb back to $9,000, however, the longer-term outlook stills remain bearish, according to the technical charts.  Bitcoin fell to a 5.5-week low of $7,335 on the BPI yesterday, a drop linked to reports that Twitter is planning to ban cryptocurrency ads. In recent weeks, both Facebook and Google have announced similar bans on advertising content related to crypto exchanges and token sales.  However, the drop to a multi-week low was short-lived and the cryptocurrency quickly regained poise – possibly due to a bullish relative strength index (RSI) divergence – clocking a high of $8,435 earlier today.  Further, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the G20 economies, yesterday rejected calls for stricter regulation of cryptocurrencies, according to a Reuters report – news that may have played a part in boosting BTC prices.  Looking ahead to later in the day, BTC could well extend the corrective rally towards the $9,000 mark.  As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $8,154, as per CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The global average price, as calculated by CoinMarketCap, is seen at $8,219 – up 6.5 percent on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour chart  A high volume upside break of the falling wedge (bullish reversal pattern) would add credence to the bullish price-RSI divergence and open the doors for a rally to $9,000 (prices as per Bitfinex).  On the other hand, a repeated failure to hold above the resistance at $8,342 (marked by a circle) would shift attention back to $7,800.  Daily chart  The erratic rise from $7,240 (yesterday's low) to $8,467 (today's high) suggests that a temporary low is in place. However, only a close today (as per UTC) above the 10-day moving average (currently seen at $8,566) could yield a sideways to positive action for a couple of days.  'Death cross' on the way?  The daily chart also shows the 50-day MA is likely to cut the 200-day MA from above in the next few days. The bearish crossover is popularly known as a ""death cross"" and according to a few strategists, it could end up pushing bitcoin down to as low as $2,800.  However, it is worth noting that long-term moving average crossovers are not very reliable indicators, as a major chunk of the sell-off has already run its course by the time the crossover actually occurs. Hence, a death cross tends to work as a contrary indicator in the short-run.  That said, the long-term view remains bearish as long as bitcoin trades below $11,700.  Weekly chart  Last week's sell-off marked a negative follow-through to previous week's bearish ""outside-week"" candle, meaning the bears are in control and could take prices as low as $6,456 (weekly 50-MA).  View  A minor rally to $9,000 cannot be ruled out in the near-term, but gains are likely to be capped around the descending (biased bearish) 10-week MA of $9,710.  Looking further ahead, bitcoin looks set for a drop to at least the weekly 50-MA, currently seen at $6,456. Further sell-off appears unlikely as a ""death cross"" (lagging indicator) would be confirmed by then, indicating a short-term bottom has been made.  Only a weekly close above $11,700 would signal the beginning of a fresh bull run towards record highs.

Sky News  reported Sunday that the U.S.-based social networking giant is looking to roll out a policy in the next two weeks that will block ads associated with cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges and initial coin offerings, with limited exceptions.  In an email response to CoinDesk, a Twitter representative said the company would not comment for now, but also did not deny the report.  The move is notable as Twitter has come a popular forum for, not only blockchain industry enthusiasts and firms, but also celebrities promoting crypto token offerings that have been frowned upon by regulators, as well as scammers impersonating real accounts in order to hoax investors.  It also follows a comment earlier this month from Jack Dorsey, CEO and founder of Twitter, indicating that the firm would double down on its efforts to tackle the scourge of crypto scammers on the platform.  Meanwhile, Google and Facebook have both recently implemented policy changes to remove cryptocurrency-related ad content.  Facebook said in a blog post in late January that it would block ""ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency.""

Gox cryptocurrency exchange has denied being the cause of the decline in bitcoin prices since December 2017.  In a Q&A report with creditors released on Mar. 17, Nobuaki Kobayashi discussed the recent sale of some $400 million-worth of bitcoin and bitcoin cash belonging to the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate.  ""Following consultation with cryptocurrency experts, I sold BTC and BCC, not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the [greatest] extent possible,"" Kobayashi said, using the alternate ticker symbol BCC for bitcoin cash, which is more normally assigned the symbol BCH.  However, Kobayashi refrained from disclosing precise details of how the funds were sold.  The comments come as a rebuttal to recent speculation linking the sale to the losses seen in both bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.  As reported by CoinDesk, Kobayashi announced in a document on Mar. 7 that 35,841 BTC and 34,008 BCH had been sold between December 2017 and February 2018, with some 18,000 BTC having been moved from a wallet owned by the estate on Feb. 5 – a day that saw a notable dip in the price of bitcoin.  While that could be coincidence, the time span of the ongoing sale also coincides more generally with the slump in bitcoin prices, which dropped from an all-time-high of nearly $20,000 in December to a recent low below $6,000 on Feb. 7, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Kobayashi stated in the Q&A:  ""Please retrain from analyzing the correlation between the sale of BTC and BCC by us and the market prices of BTC and BCC based on the assumption that the sale was made at the time the BTC and BCC were transferred from BTC/BCC addresses that I manage, as such assumption is incorrect.""  In addition, the trustee also indicated that process for the further sale of the estate's remaining holding of two cryptocurrencies has not yet been determined. The trustee was still in possession of 166,344.35827254 BTC as of Mar. 5 – worth around $1.3 billion at press time.  The sale marks a milestone in the slow process of resolving the years-long bankruptcy case, following the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2014, when over 700,000 BTC were alleged stolen in a hack, worth around $340 million at the time.

42401320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzVn,1521439294,Plattsburgh's Crypto Mining Ban Could End Earlier Than Expected,"The city of Plattsburgh, New York, has chosen to temporarily ban all new commercial cryptocurrency mining operations for the next 18 months – but local officials have suggested that the prohibition could end earlier.  Last Thursday, Plattsburgh's City Council adopted a local law prohibiting any new mining operations from setting up shop, effective immediately. The city intends to use this time to establish rules for commercial miners, with an eye toward protecting residents from having to pay for increased electricity costs.  However, during a discussion of the then-proposed law on March 15, councilors indicated that the ban could be lifted much sooner, once protections are put in place.  Councilor Rachelle Armstrong said the time period may be too long, and that she was concerned the ban would cost the city business amid the uncertainty.  To that end, the council would have to establish rules for any companies hoping to launch crypto-mining facilities, and these rules would focus on who pays for the elevated electricity usage.  Councilor Patrick McFarlin agreed that 18 months was too long a period of time, but added that immediate action was needed to ""stop the bleeding.""  He remarked, according to a recording:  ""Our public doesn’t deserve 18 months, our public doesn’t deserve waiting even six months for us to get our act together and manage this, but something needs to be done right now and right now 18 months is what we've got. But the clearly the law says we as a council can act, and if we do act, the moratorium won’t last anywhere near 18 months.""  The bill began after Plattsburgh exceeded its monthly electricity allotment earlier this year, according to Gizmodo. As a result, every resident in the city saw increased power bills for the month of January. Two cryptocurrency mining facilities in the city are allegedly responsible for the spike in usage.  During the meeting  , one resident said that the higher bills were an unfair burden, saying: ""The electrical ratepayers should be compensated for this. We shouldn’t be taxed, we shouldn’t be burdened by this.""  Another argued that without the moratorium, companies would continue to try and set up shop in Plattsburgh, adding that they would ""try to use our electricity … so we need some time to look into that.""

42401309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcXzKy,1521432073,ICOs Iced: A 12-Month Freeze on US Token Trading May Just Be Beginning,"""The market is being chilled.""  Issued by Mike Lempres, chief legal and risk officer at Coinbase, the statement captures the mood of the moment for crypto innovators in the U.S. as regulatory uncertainty and months of wanton market growth appear to be finally coming to a head.  Spurring the shift is that the SEC finally confirmed last week what had been long rumored, that it's investigating companies and startups associated with initial coin offerings (ICOs). In response, entrepreneurs are largely surrendering on the idea new cryptocurrencies created and sold to investors could be considered so-called ""utility tokens,"" a term denoting a digital commodity meant to represent the share of a blockchain protocol.  Still, U.S. companies preparing to issue tokens as securities may not have an easier time reaching buyers. There's no registered broker-dealer capable of trading security tokens in the U.S. yet. And as multiple founders pointed out to CoinDesk, as issuers shift to issuing these tokens under a Regulation D exemption, most are still under the 12-month lock-up required by the rules.  At the MIT Bitcoin Expo this weekend, the issue was on display in a panel that struck a sour note on the state of ICOs. There, Nick Ayton, CEO of blockchain funding platform Chainstarter, went so far as to predict U.S. regulators will view every token as a security.  ""Most exchanges are listing coins that are securities, and our view is a large number of these exchanges are going to be closed,"" he told the crowd.  Even a panel on regulation more generally saw talk of the concern, with former CFTC chair and MIT professor Gary Genseler indicating his belief action on exchanges could be ahead.  ""I think it is without a doubt that numerous exchanges will have to seek exemptions under alternative trading system [rules] because many of the exchanges, not all, have tokens that are securities trading on them,"" he explained.  But it's not just existing exchanges, businesses seeking to fill the market need may be held up.  As Gensler and others have put forward, participants in this new market think they might know what's forbidden, but no one can be sure until regulators address cryptocurrency more specifically.  Joshua Ashley Klayman, counsel at Morrison Foerster, told CoinDesk:  ""People who want to comply and don't want to do something wrong are left trying to find the rules.""  Death of utility tokens  Stepping back, the market disarray perhaps shouldn't be surprising.  The SEC's decree on a little-known ICO called Munchee in December should have landed like a bomb, but it has rather had a delayed reaction, its shockwave not really hitting the industry until rumors began circulating that the SEC had issued a wave of subpoenas earlier this month.  With Munchee, ""what the federal regulators think of as a utility token and not a security token is so small, and the eye of the needle got even smaller,"" Klayman explained.  For a while there, companies seemed to think that even if utility tokens couldn't be sold to the general public, they could still be given away (in what's usually called an airdrop). However, we recently reported on how that's probably an SEC violation there, as well.  Earn.com has been facilitating airdrops of tokens to its pool of verified users, and, Dave Bean, of the company's sales team, told CoinDesk that ""geo-filtering has become a very popular feature"" for issuers that want to avoid the U.S.  Other new issuers are just abandoning retail investors.  ""I have perceived a trend in the market wherein legitimate projects seeking to issue a native token for functional networks are steering toward relying on the Reg D exemption within the U.S.,"" Tekin Salimi, a project manager at Polychain Capital, told CoinDesk.  As reported  , the rule requires purchasers to be accredited investors, which means they must have a minimum net worth of $1 million, or have earned $200,000 annually for the last two years.  That said, there have been plenty of market participants that never believed unregistered tokens could work under SEC laws, and have factored such options into their models. Long-time entrepreneurs have moved in, offering platforms built specifically with different regulatory regimes in mind, such as TokenSoft.  But it's still hard to imagine how a product that, say, creates a tokenized VPN, one that both pays people for broadband and lets them buy it back with the same token, works if those tokens are securities.  Caitlin Long, an industry veteran who helped move legislation on utility tokens through the Wyoming legislature, has even asked whether federal securities rules could be applied in ways where they may harm the user experience of more popular projects to the point where they're no longer even feasible.  For example, she raised the idea that, should utility tokens be outlawed entirely, users of filecoin, a distributed online storage system, might need to use a brokerage to hold the tokens they need just to back up files.  Liquidity and trading  But even if an exchange goes live, the final issue for ICO projects in the U.S. is liquidity.  The trouble is that there's no unified place to trade tokens that's registered with the SEC now. As several founders have pointed out, that doesn't mean that trading is impossible, it's just not as easy.  CoinDesk has reported on several forthcoming attempts to launch an ATS, including Templum and tZERO. An existing alternative trading platform has also recently launched the OpenFinance Network, with its token trading platform opening in April, a spokesperson said.  But no real trading is going on using these platforms yet, other than one security available in Templum's private beta and the sale of Overstock shares on its platform.  Chris Pallotta, CEO and co-founder of Templum, told CoinDesk that he expects to open the platform up in a matter of months, however. With most security tokens still in their 12-month holding period, he said, ""I think the timing will work out pretty nicely.""  Even if Templum were to go live soon though, it may find it doesn't have much product for its order books, as it will take a while for tokens created in the boom to get through that holding period.  That's also assuming there are no additional holdups, and if the ICO space has shown anything, that might be a big if.  As Lempres put it to members of Congress:  ""If the U.S. does not provide a clear, thoughtful regulatory environment, the investment can move very quickly to other countries.""

In a letter published on March 18, Financial Stability Board chairman Mark Carney, who also leads the Bank of England, said that the organization doesn't see the tech as a threat – at least at this juncture.  Carney wrote:  ""The FSB’s initial assessment is that crypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time. This is in part because they are small relative to the financial system.""  ""Even at their recent peak, their (cryptocurrencies) combined global market value was less than 1% of global GDP,"" he continued. ""In comparison, just prior to the global financial crisis (in 2008), the notional value of credit default swaps was 100% of global GDP.  Their small size, and the fact that they are not substitutes for currency and with very limited use for real economy and financial transactions, has meant the linkages to the rest of the financial system are limited.""  While the note is mostly in line with Carney's previous comments on the limited impact of cryptocurrencies on the global financial system, the letter offers a window into where the discussions around this area may head to at the G20 meeting this week. As previously reported, government officials will meet Monday and Tuesday in part to talk cryptocurrencies, an agenda item that has been deemed ""important"" in a bid to reach a ""common response"" to regulation.  As acknowledged in Carney's letter, a number of major countries – France, Japan and the U.S. among them – have called for a unified response to speculation around cryptocurrencies. Most recently, Japanese officials reportedly expressed interest in joint efforts around money laundering.  Indeed, some of those calling for action seem to share Carney's assessment as well. As previously reported, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin – who supports an international approach to regulation – has said in the past that he doesn't view cryptocurrencies as a threat to financial stability.

Both caucuses within the Senate have also given their approval, according to data from LegiScan, which tracks legislative developments in the U.S.  While it's not exactly clear when the final vote will take place, the bill passed the state's House of Representatives just days after similar endorsements were made in February. The measure previously passed the House with a vote of 55 to 4, with one representative abstaining, on February 20.  The bill would protect users running blockchain nodes from being subjected to any form of local regulation, stating that ""a city or town may not prohibit or otherwise restrict an individual from running a node on blockchain technology in a residence."" Similar language puts in place a prohibition on county-level regulations.  As previously reported, it is unclear whether the measure would be restricted to cryptocurrency miners, but if signed into law, though the text suggests that the protections are aimed at covering the energy-intensive process.

42380466,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8e4Yr,1521417914,Intel Thinks Blockchain Could Power a Next-Gen Media Rights Manager,"Tech giant Intel is joining the growing list of enterprise firms that see blockchain as a way to reimagine digital rights management.  In a patent application released March 8 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Silicon Valley tech company described a method for using a blockchain for downloading the rights to digital images, one it believes is unique enough to be a protected invention.  The patent application states:  “Blockchain technology is used to document and verify attributes of digital content that are relevant to copyright protection. Such attributes may include, for instance, an identifier for the author of the content, a timestamp to indicate when the content was created, and a measurement that can subsequently be used to detect copying or modification of the content.”  As described, the proposed platform uses several types of software to automatically assess copyright policy settings for each image, even if the picture was taken from external sources. Then, it creates a unique identity for both the original content and any modified versions. The patent calls these identities “shadow images.”  Intel’s patent goes on to mentions video and other types of content aside from images, offering a more comprehensive rights system with additional features.  For example, Intel's system seeks to allow users to maintain works in progress, including “unstructured” pieces such as literature with multiple editors. In this way, content can only be modified in accordance with copyright policy settings.  Still, Intel is far from alone in pursuing the idea.
