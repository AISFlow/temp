42411267,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMa6H,1673797500,"President Herbert Hoover Saves the Day for a Crypto Bank? Yeah, That‚Äôs Weird","Silvergate Bank (SI) started in San Diego in 1988 as a savings and loan association (S&L) when that was all the rage. It‚Äôs a bank now ‚Äì for ‚Ä¶ uh ‚Ä¶ reasons ‚Äì that markets itself as a ‚Äúleading provider of innovative financial infrastructure solutions and services for the growing digital currency industry.‚Äù  Basically, Silvergate is the bank for a lot of crypto businesses (1,300+, according to the company website, if you include ‚Äúfintechs‚Äù), which tend to have problems maintaining banking relationships. As such, it‚Äôs probably not surprising to learn that Silvergate‚Äôs assets under management (AUM) has grown quickly the last few years. Its stock price did, too, by more than 1,500% between November 2019 and November 2021.  You‚Äôre reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  But once FTX collapsed, Silvergate customers fled (withdrawing $8.1 billion in the fourth quarter, aka roughly 70% of total deposits) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent it a scathing letter. The stock price tanked, down more than 40% in the past month.  Now I‚Äôm not here to spread fear that Silvergate is insolvent. After all, Silvergate satisfied the customer withdrawals and has started leaning into cost cuts by way of laying off 40% of its staff and abandoning expensive ideas like the Diem project it bought from Meta Platforms (META) early last year.  What is worth highlighting here, though, is how Silvergate satisfied those customer withdrawals.  Silvergate used something meant for housing as a lifeline  In November, I wrote that the crypto credit contagion was ‚Äúunlikely to spread to other markets,‚Äù but Silvergate just proved me wrong. To satisfy the spike in withdrawals, Silvergate received billions of dollars in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of San Francisco, ending 2022 with $4.3 billion of FHLB money on its balance sheet. For context, Silvergate held just $700 million of these advances at the end of September 2022.  To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt (and am still not really) intimately familiar with the FHLB when I first read about this ‚Äì but if the name of the organization wasn‚Äôt a dead giveaway that this was strange, then its mission statement stating that the FHLB provides ‚Äúmembers with a reliable source of funding for housing finance‚Äù should.  (As everyone says, you can‚Äôt live on the blockchain.)  The FHLBank System was created under President Herbert Hoover through the Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932 with one big goal: lower the cost of home ownership. It empowered FHLB banks to provide liquidity to its smaller member banks, of which Silvergate is one. So, yes, part of the crypto industry was effectively bailed out by a government-sponsored institution whose stated goal is to curtail housing costs.  Of course, this isn‚Äôt illegal ‚Äì else you‚Äôd be hearing about it from literally everyone but me. The FHLB is also tasked with providing ‚Äúliquidity for members‚Äô short-term needs‚Äù ‚Äì and the 70% withdrawal I mentioned above sure seems like a time when liquidity might be needed! Plus, FHLB supports members who support housing finance and community investment (whatever that means).  Enough ambiguity to not be illegal.  But just because it‚Äôs not illegal doesn‚Äôt mean that we should be happy with it. Sure, I‚Äôm glad Silvergate didn‚Äôt go under, but isn‚Äôt this just another bailout? Crypto supporters would be hard-pressed to convince investors that crypto is legitimate if there‚Äôs a government program propping up part of it.  Does crypto need propping up because, well, if so, maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be up in the first place?  Seriously, if someone, like a bank, doesn‚Äôt want to bear the downside risk of investing in crypto then maybe an entire depositor cohort and loan book shouldn‚Äôt be made up almost exclusively of crypto companies. Perhaps banking institutions should do risk management through either stricter collateralization rules or broad diversification across many other industries.  Not to mention, FHLB advances work such that in the event of a bank failure, it is senior even to the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation‚Äôs (FDIC) claims. Why is that important? As John Heltman wrote in American Banker, hypothetically ‚Äúif regulators were to shut down Silvergate or a similar bank that facilitates crypto and owes a Home Loan bank money, the failure could prove more costly to the [FDIC‚Äôs] Deposit Insurance Fund.‚Äù Such a scenario wouldn‚Äôt be catastrophic for the agency whose stickers appear on the door of every bank in America, but it would underscore that crypto is no longer just an island.  So, yeah, crypto contagion did in fact seep a bit into the ‚Äúreal‚Äù economy, contrary to what the Federal Reserve suggested in its Dec. 13-14 minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Sure, it‚Äôs still small potatoes: Bank deposits in the U.S. number in the tens of trillions of dollars, dwarfing Silvergate. But we should expect more from the banking institutions that service crypto companies. If crypto was born to be separate from the legacy institutions, then it shouldn‚Äôt depend on those institutions in times of need.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/15/president-herbert-hoover-saves-the-day-for-a-crypto-bank-yeah-thats-weird,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8f4f428a258bd53e51e996356250c20d6ef54ef-1119x839.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the last few days, several assets have recorded significant profits and are starting to pull through the crypto winter. Most notably, Bitcoin, the market leader and the world‚Äôs biggest digital asset, has been one of the top-performing coins this year. In the last seven days, BTC gained by more than 17%, allowing the coin to surpass the $20,000 price mark for the first time since the start of the FTX crisis. Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive price rally has generated much excitement among the crypto community, along with a significant rise in the positive sentiment around the entire crypto market. However, it appears there might be a need for alertness among investors in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Touches $20,000 For First Time Post-FTX Collapse Bitcoin Records Highest Funding Rates In Over A Year According to a post by Maartun, a top analyst on the crypto analytics platform Crypto Quant, Bitcoin funding rates have attained their highest values in 14 months. The Crypto Quant contributor further stated that the occurrence of high funding rates such as these usually resulted in Bitcoin experiencing a price pullback. Funding rates are recurring payments made to either traders in a long or short position, depending on the difference between perpetual contract markets and spot prices. In essence, these payments serve as a method of maintaining the price of perpetual contracts close to the spot price of an asset ‚Äì in this case, Bitcoin. That said, when there are highly positive funding rates on crypto exchanges, it indicates that traders are betting on the BTC/USD market to attain higher prices and are paying to go really long on BTC. Trading positions such as these can be quite risky, as any slight price drop might lead to high levels of liquidation or force these traders to close their positions. Therefore, these funding rates are definitely something that all BTC investors should keep their eyes on in the coming days. For now, Bitcoin is holding its ground, having gained by 1.83% in the last 24 hours, according to data by CoinMarketCap. At press time, the premier cryptocurrency is trading at $20,722.66, with a market cap value of $399.23 billion. BTC Trading at $20,716 | Source: BTCUSD Chart on Tradingview.com.
