42425188,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv8Ph,1386420014,Lamborghini Dealership Sells Cars for Bitcoins,"Not only can you buy an electric vehicle with bitcoin, but you can also charge one with the distributed virtual currency.  Newport Beach Lamborghini has taken bitcoin as payment for a Tesla Model S sedan. It also plans to continue accepting it for payment for its stock of performance vehicles.  And electric vehicle (EV) owners can now recharge their car's battery using a Miami station that will only take BTC.  ""We have a Tesla Model S and charging station purchased from bitcoin investments and only accept bitcoin,"" said Michael Sholl, a network security engineer by trade and the owner of the charging station at his home in Miami, Florida. ""There were zero chargers within several miles of my home and thought it would be fun to set this up as an experiment.""  ""Bitcoin paid for the car and charger and it seems appropriate to support the bitcoin economy that paid for these benefits,"" he said.  According to Sholl's information on Recargo, which maps out EV charging locations, the price per charge is $10. Sholl told CoinDesk that the process works like this:  Customer calls to make a reservation  They accept or reject the reservation based on availability  Customer arrives and is greeted  Customer sends payment to either randomly generated code for the specific transaction, or general code posted by the charger if nobody is physically available to take payment  Customer plugs in the 100-amp connection and charges their vehicle    The charging station's BTC payment system uses Coinbase. In fact, when the bitcoin payment processor realized that it would be used to refuel EVs, it tweeted out this message.  Sholl believes bitcoin provides better peace of mind than other methods of payment for EV recharging. This is especially true with cash, whereby ""folks might assume we have cash on-site. This assumption is not good for the security of my fiancee and two-year-old,"" he said.  He also said that the payment process is so simple and doesn't require any human interfacing while he is away from his home for work.  ""It's easier to take payments while I travel for work [since the] QR code is posted on the side of the house near the charger.""  Sholl was quite an early adopter and believer in bitcoin.  ""I realized the potential of bitcoin in October of 2012 after reading the whitepaper and purchased several thousand BTC at that point in time. No regrets since then despite the perceived volatility of bitcoin,"" he said.

42425165,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHv7vh,1386414957,Need a New Knee? This Lithuanian Clinic Will Give You One for Bitcoin,"Need a hip replacement? Got some bitcoins burning a hole in your wallet? Well, why not hop on a plane to Lithuania, where a local orthopaedic clinic has recently announced it will provide treatments in exchange for bitcoin.  Nordorthopaedics  , an orthopaedic surgery in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital city, began accepting bitcoin payments earlier this month. However, it hasn't yet received a client willing to pay with the currency.  The clinic employs 50 medical staff, including five surgeons. It serves a largely foreign clientele, with customers from Sweden, Russia, the UK and the US. Jekaterina Kirpa, a spokesperson for the clinic, said:  ""Transactions in bitcoin are sent easily via the Internet, and there is no need to rely on any third party. Also, there are little to no transaction fees.""  The clinic offers various different medical procedures. These range from open surgeries (like knee, hip and shoulder replacements) to arthroscopic surgeries (including Achilles tendon repairs).  According to Kirpa, many customers make the journey to Vilnius because the clinic charges lower fees than the facilities in their home country.  ""The cost of the procedure may be two or three times lower,"" Kirpa said. However, she cited that the cost savings for the customer would vary depending on the procedure.  ""Actually, our surgeons have more experience than many other doctors in Western clinics,"" she added.  Medical tourism  A knee replacement in the UK conducted through the NHS (National Health Service) requires an average wait of 39 weeks, while private treatment will set you back nearly £4,000 ($6,540).  In the US, the same procedure will amount to a whopping $35,000, although the final cost to the patient could be significantly less, depending on his or her health insurance plan.  More than half of Nordorthopaedics' patients are foreign visitors, Kirpa said.  The clinic is part of a larger trend for 'medical tourism', where patients seek treatment in locations overseas that offer cheaper procedures than their home countries.  In Lithuania, a government-supported lobby group has been set up to promote medical tourism, with an emphasis on cosmetic surgery, heart surgery and dentistry.  In this context, it makes sense for healthcare providers to accept payments in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is easily transferred and incurs minimal to no transaction fees.  Finally, for users hoping to save extra money – will Nordorthopaedics offer a bitcoin discount for that niggling rotator cuff injury?  ""Currently we don't provide a discount for customers paying in bitcoin,"" Kirpa said.
