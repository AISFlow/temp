42383670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9y4kF,1589236690,The Brooklyn Nets' Spencer Dinwiddie Makes the Bull Case for Tokenizing Entertainers,"Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie knows how to get to the point when he talks about using cryptocurrency to tokenize his basketball contract.      ""When you democratize ownership of a contract, or cash flows, there's two ways that an entertainer really derives his value, you know, he maximizes talent but also the fan engagement is another way,"" he said during CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference on Monday.      Since late 2019, Dinwiddie has been looking to offer a piece of his future cash flows via a crypto token. The deal he's looking to set up is not finalized yet.      ""It's ongoing and it's something I'm really excited about, actually,"" he said.      His peers in basketball are starting to ask him questions about his approach as well, especially now that COVID-19 has left them idle.      ""I can't speak for anyone specifically, especially not my teammates – don't want them to kill me when I get in the locker room,"" Dinwiddie quipped, but he did acknowledge a lot of them are curious about what he's doing.      During the crisis, he said, he sees athletes and other entertainers asking themselves ""are there more exotic ways to maximize my earning potential especially while I'm sitting at home? The entrepreneurial mind of a lot of these guys is really starting to flourish during the crisis.""    Tokenize upon a star            It was not simple for Dinwiddie to get to the point where he could experiment with his contract in this way, he explained. The NBA itself was reluctant to let him.      ""I think when you're dealing with legacy systems, they covet control, quite frankly,"" Dinwiddie said, explaining the reluctance of the NBA to allow him to tokenize his contract, largely because league officials didn't really understand it. ""They're kind of allowing me to do like this pilot, in a sense, and so that's why some of the more fun things we wanted to do aren't included.""      He filed his token sale as a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation D offering to put his team ""in a position of power"" when others began looking into the sale.      ""By going with accredited investors first it really lets us focus on the meet of the offering and not worry about if there's a kid down the street who might get ripped off or, yada yada, big bad basketball player type of thing,"" he said.      He sees a larger potential beyond sports.      ""Anyone with semi-public to public cash flows and has a fan base can participate,"" he said.      For sports, he sees it potentially almost making fantasy sports real, but there's no way it needs to stop there.      ""I envision a world where a Kevin Hart token can trade for a LeBron James token can trade for a Serena Williams token, and because we are all our own business, each token will have its own perks attached to it,"" Dinwiddie said. ""You know there might be a 5% dividend, there might be future value where it could have a truly asymmetrical yield curve. There could be a utility value, maybe Lebron James offering an exclusive camp only for his token holders.""    I envision a world where a Kevin Hart token can trade for a LeBron James token can trade for a Serena Williams token.  How he got here        With a Twitter bio now that reads, ""Just a tech guy with a jumper,"" Dinwiddie did not immediately convert to crypto enthusiasm when he first learned about it.      ""When I got into the NBA in 2014, one of my friends in finance told me to start looking at bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I was definitely too scared. I just got into the NBA I wasn't going to be one of those horror stories,"" he said. ""Fast forward to 2017, I actually got a little more solidified in the league, had the very same conversation, he showed me the price difference, so naturally I was curious. I put in small amounts of money and I was fortunate to ride the 2017 wave, and also the crash in 2018. And that pretty much led to an education process.""      He started getting curious about how other technologies beyond bitcoin could lead to new and interesting business models.      ""Now we're here and I've been an evangelist for both sides of the tree ever since,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/the-brooklyn-nets-spencer-dinwiddie-makes-the-bull-case-for-tokenizing-entertainers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ac93693e632a30843cef38083840065bf530295-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431922,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7ZHh,1589235790,"Blockchain Bites: Making Sense of the Halving, Consensus Distributed's First Day","We’re not even halfway through the first full day of Consensus: Distributed and the world may never be the same.      The most ambitious conference of its kind kicked off with CoinDesk TV, a full 24 hours of programming featuring European central bankers, former CFTC chairmen and celebrity guests including Akon and Michelle Phan.      You're reading Blockchain Bites: Consensus Edition a twice daily roundup of all the notable news out of Consensuse Distributed. You can sign up for this, and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here.      History is being made elsewhere, too, with the Bitcoin network’s third programmable halving going off without a hitch.    Bitcoin halved: Here's what that means    CoinDesk’s Wolfie Zhao breaks it down:      Miners racing on the network to compete for freshly minted bitcoin produced the 630,000th block at 19:23 UTC on May 11, which triggered the programmed halving event, marking the currency's third halving in its 11-year history.      The first block in the new 6.25-bitcoin-per-block mining cycle was mined and relayed by China-based Antpool, the fourth-largest mining pool by total computing power.      In an homage to Satoshi Nakamoto's iconic ""brink of a second bailout"" message in the 2009 genesis block, f2pool, which mined the 629,999th block (the last before the halving), embedded a reference to the current financial crisis: ""NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue.”      The immediate implication after the third halving is that the newly minted bitcoin in a day will fall from 1,800 to 900 units. That would also mean mining operators will see their daily total revenue – at bitcoin's current price of $8600 – reduced from $15 million to $8 million.      As such, it has been expected the computing power connected to the Bitcoin network will fall significantly after the halving as the revenue decrease will squeeze out those miner operators who lack efficient resources to cut their electricity costs.    Three halving-related events worth knowing about    A once-in-four-years event deserves a celebration:    Two Bit Idiot’s Halving Happy Hours: “I will have a full six pack of IPAs in hand to celebrate in style,” Messari founder and crypto OG Ryan Selkis said.

On Tuesday from 10:30-11:30 a.m., Santiment CEO Maksim Balashevich and Bitstorio Consoritio Group Travin Keith come online for a workshop called What Am I Looking At? Understanding Block Explorers and How To Use Them to Make Investment Decisions. These crypto experts will teach people how to understand block explorers and use them to make investment decisions.  The keynote    This morning we heard from influential economist Carlota Perez, who broke down her theory of tech revolutions driven by boom and bust cycles.      She was joined by Placeholder’s Chris Burniske and they discussed automating administrative infrastructure as a way to modernize the state.      Competing sides: The privacy of money    European Central Bank executive Yves Mersch said Europe’s central bank is looking into CBDCs. “A retail CBDC, accessible to all, would be a game changer,” and is now a primary area of research.      Mersch said a eurozone CBDC could be based on a digital token circulated ""in a decentralized manner,"" without a central ledger.      Other economic leaders aren’t so attracted by the possibility of taking all cash digital through the central bank. Avanti’s Caitlyn Long said CBDCs could be turned into a surveillance tool and as a way to exert undue economic pressure on citizens.      Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers isn’t worried about a privacy-corroding CBDC proposal. He thinks there may be “too much privacy” associated with government-issued cash already.      “In a world of inordinate tax evasion, trillions of dollars of laundered money around corruption and the drug trade, the last objective of government policy should be the promotion of anonymity with respect to large financial transactions,” Summers said.    Inside Consensus: Distributed    Joon Wong was one of the heavy lifters that made today such a success. One of the first CoinDesk employees, back when the company was still London-based, Joon knows the crypto industry inside and out. He’s now running programming for our events. Here’s what he has to say about the first day of Consensus: Distributed:    Consensus has always been about convening the disparate fields that make up the cryptocurrency industry. The first edition of Consensus, which I started in 2015, was the first time a major global bank – Citi – got publicly involved with blockchain technologies. This sixth edition of Consensus, held virtually, was no different. We saw a member of the European Central Bank's executive board announce that the institution would investigate retail digital currencies; we watched our own conference inside a virtual conference center within Decentraland; and we heard from the influential economist of technology Carlota Perez about her views on blockchain technologies for the first time. And that's not to mention the slew of figures from the mainstream who have been increasingly drawn to our world: beauty mogul and YouTube pioneer Michelle Phan; NBA star Spencer Dinwiddie; electronic music sensations The Chainsmokers. Consensus can only convene this breadth of speakers because of the underlying robustness of this industry. And if this year's speaker lineup is any indication, the business is in rude health.

42431921,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Z9h,1589234245,Hut 8 Mining Revenue Continues Decline in Q1,"Hut 8 Mining, one of Canada’s largest mining operations, reported less-than-stellar first-quarter 2020 earnings Monday, the same day as the bitcoin halving.      Earnings lowlights included falling revenue, decreased adjusted EBITDA margin and increased collateral requirements on debt.      For the third consecutive quarter, revenues declined; this time by 14% sequentially to C$12.7 million (US$9.1 million). This was caused by a 32% decrease in the number of bitcoin mined during the quarter as the network hashrate continued to rise. This was partially offset by a 27% increase in the average price per bitcoin mined.      Site operating costs came in slightly elevated compared to the previous quarter (C$11.1 million in 4Q19 vs. C$12.6 million in 1Q20), possibly caused by a seasonal increase in electricity prices during cold weather.      Read more:The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin Mining      With revenue down and site operating costs up, reported adjusted EBITDA margin came in at negative 4%, down from the positive 19% margin reported in 4Q19.      Management noted that bitcoin’s price plunge on March 12 caused adjusted EBTIDA to come in at negative C$822,000 for the month of March, more than offsetting the C$264,000 worth of gains recognized in the first two months of the quarter.    Liquid assets almost entirely locked behind collateralized debt    The amount of bitcoin retained on the balance sheet remained relatively flat sequentially as the vast majority (94%) of the bitcoin mined during the quarter was sold off to pay operating expenses. As of the end of March, Hut 8 held just shy of 3,000 bitcoin worth approximately C$35 million (US$25 million) using current market prices.      During the quarter, an unsecured loan from Bitfury was refinanced with a C$7 million extension loan from Genesis Capital. According to company filings, the terms of the extension loan were similar to those of its existing C$21 million loan with Genesis. However, the new extension loan came with a shorter payment period and a higher collateral requirement.      As a result of the refinancing, the amount of bitcoin locked in collateralized loans increased from 58% (1,700 bitcoin) of Hut 8’s total bitcoin holdings in 4Q19 to 94% (2,823 bitcoin) in 1Q20.    Plan to upgrade equipment still in the works    With Hut 8’s existing mining equipment quickly aging, management continues to consider upgrading to more efficient ASICs from Chinese manufacturers. Few new details were disclosed on the earnings call. However, the company did mention that it would likely finance any purchases primarily from a combination of self-financing debt and equity.    Looking ahead    The halving continues to be a major headwind for miners like Hut 8 as the block reward gets reduced. On the earnings call, Interim CEO Jimmy Vaiopoulos said the halving could cause the company to shut off part of its operations. However, Hut 8 remains hopeful that bitcoin prices will rise in the near future, boosting the company’s profitability and the value of its assets.      See also: Bitcoin Halving Arrives: Mining Rewards Drop for Third Time in History      The company’s plan to upgrade its equipment should increase operating efficiency.

42431925,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7ZFh,1589229792,Market Wrap: Where Does Bitcoin Go After the Halving?,"Bitcoin’s long-anticipated halving event took place Monday afternoon New York time. Now what?      At the time it took place (19:23 UTC or 3:30 p.m. ET), bitcoin was trading below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, bearish technical indicators after a huge 10% drop in price on May 10 at 00:00 UTC. This was triggered by an outage striking San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase. At press time, bitcoin (BTC) was trading down less than a percent over 24 hours at $8,677.      The bitcoin halving, which reduced the new supply of bitcoin generated by cryptocurrency miners from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC per block (a reduction from roughly 1,800 BTC down to 900 BTC per day), arrived amid economic unpredictability due to the coronavirus pandemic.“The international scenario is quite different than in 2016, and bitcoin has never been tested during a global economic crisis. So we can expect anything to happen,” said Sebastian Serrano, CEO of Argentina-based cryptocurrency exchange Ripio.      Traders are anticipating unpredictability in bitcoin’s price for the short term, and therefore volatility is expected, says Katie Stockton, managing partner of Fairfield Strategies. “We don’t have a big sample size of past halvings, but they generally have a positive impact on sentiment after a short-term period of volatility.”      Read more: As Bitcoin’s Halving Finally Arrives, a Price Retreat Deflates the Hype      “I think the anticipation of the halving has contributed to the outperformance by bitcoin over the past few weeks, and that a breakout greater than $10,055 is likely to unfold after a few weeks of choppiness triggered by today’s gap,” Stockton added.      Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, wrote in his daily note that the halving may not mean much immediately, but agrees this event will be a meaningful one over a long time horizon. “It is likely to have an impact in the price over the long term, as the reduced daily issuance makes the asset more scarce,” Greenspan wrote.      ""Bitcoin mining pools have actually been accumulating ahead of the halving,"" Philip Gradwell, chief economist at analytics firm Chainalysis, said Monday on a CoinDesk Consensus:Distributed panel. ""Because of the halving, we could have a bit of a liquidity crunch.""      Despite higher volumes on Coinbase prior to bitcoin’s halving, it doesn’t mean volume will continue to rise in the short term, said Christopher Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. “I think we’re now in the zone where no significant retail money will come in this week and I think we’ll trade between $8,000-$9,000 for the next week or so, with a reasonable possibility of a drop to $7,300.”      Read more: CME Says Volume Surge Shows Strong Institutional Interest      At press time, mining hashpower has yet to see a significant drop. Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, is taking a wait-and-see approach. “Until we see a stabilization in mining activity, for which I'd like to see the proof in the pudding, I'm in no hurry to be buying bitcoin.”      Besides looking at how miners prepared for the event, Shah is also keeping an eye on what the miners will do next, including keeping track of how much mining power will now need to be shut off, and how much selling will happen over the next month. Thus, miner incentives are important. “My view has been that reduced rewards are likely to impact miner incentives more than the pedestrian speculator,” he added.    Other markets    Digital assets on CoinDesk’s big board are mixed on Monday. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), gained 1.3% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. EDT).

42431910,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Yph,1589225184,Bitcoin Halving Arrives: Mining Rewards Drop for Third Time in History,"Bitcoin's third halving, the network's quadrennial landmark and the most anticipated event this year in the cryptocurrency industry, has finally happened.      Miners racing on the network to compete for freshly minted bitcoin produced the 630,000th block at 19:23 UTC on May 11, which triggered the programmed halving event, marking another milestone in the currency's 11-year history.      The first block in the new 6.25-bitcoin-per-block mining cycle was mined and relayed by China-based Antpool, the fourth-largest mining pool by total computing power.      In an homage to Satoshi Nakamoto's iconic ""brink of a second bailout"" message in the 2009 genesis block, f2pool, which mined the 629,999th block (the last before the halving), embedded a reference to the current financial crisis: ""NYTimes 09/Apr/2020 With $2.3T Injection, Fed’s Plan Far Exceeds 2008 Rescue.”      Bitcoin, the world's first and largest blockchain network by market capitalization, was designed by its pseudonymous creator Nakamoto to reduce the rewards for mining each block by half every 210,000 blocks in order to slow down the injection of new supply to the network as time goes by.      The mining reward is an economic incentive for those who contribute computing power to securing the network, as well as processing transactions on the network since no single entity functions as a central bookkeeper.      The 2020 halving, the third in the network's history, means the mining reward has now been reduced from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25 units. It went down to 25 from 50 bitcoin per block in November 2012 and further decreased to 12.5 units in July 2016.      Read more: Bitcoin Halving, Explained      The immediate implication after halving is that the newly minted bitcoin in a day will fall from 1,800 to 900 units. That would also mean mining operators will see their daily total revenue – at bitcoin's current price of $8600 – reduced from $15 million to $8 million.      As such, it has been expected the computing power connected to the Bitcoin network will fall significantly after the halving as the revenue decrease will squeeze out those miner operators who lack efficient resources to cut their electricity costs.      However, it remains to be seen how that will play out after the halving. Currently, the average Bitcoin total computing power over the last seven days since the previous mining difficulty adjustment has hit a new all-time high of 121 exahashes per second (EH/s), beating the previous record of 118 EH/s, according to data from Chinese mining pool PoolIn.

The donation project makes use of quadratic funding, the fundraising model developed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Harvard researcher Zoë Hitzig. The method uses a simple mathematical formula that rewards matching grants to causes that attract the broadest spread of contributions across the largest number of participants — essentially enabling small donations to count just as much as large ones.      CoinDesk is partnering with Ethereal Summit, Gitcoin and The Giving Block to match donations, aiming to raise $100,000 during Consensus, which is part of New York Blockchain Week. The campaign is using the hashtag #NYBWgives.      Follow this link to donate or click the big button below.      In addition, New York-based abstract artist Mr. Star City created an original piece of artwork, shown above, as a part of Consensus: Distributed. The art, inspired by love, unity and technology, will be up for auction this week. Follow @coindesk on Twitter to find out how to bid — the proceeds will go to the same cause.      Buterin and Glen Weyl, founder of the RadicalxChange Foundation think tank, stopped by Consensus: Distributed to talk more about quadratic funding and the importance that the cryptocurrency community give back in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.      ""So many of the artists and cultural leaders depend on in-person performances to earn a living, and in this period that's not possible,"" Weyl said. ""Yet, we need cultural production more than we've ever needed it.... Quadratic funding provides a really powerful mechanism for smaller individuals to support the community organizations they need.""      The charities in the fundraising drive include: Operation Masks, Action Against Hunger, Save the Children, Meals on Wheels, Médecins Sans Frontières, SOS Children's, Villages, The Water Project, International Medical Corps, United Way, Team Rubicon, No Kid Hungry, and International Rescue Committee.

42431912,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Yth,1589216414,US Banking Regulator Suggests Federal Licensing Framework for Crypto Firms,"A key bank regulator in the U.S. may be open to allowing crypto companies to be licensed as financial institutions on a national, rather than state-by-state, level.      Brian Brooks, chief operating officer of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the nation's national bank overseer, said Monday he believes crypto companies could fall under a federal licensing regime – if they provide what can be described as payment services.      Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference, the former Coinbase chief legal officer said many crypto companies are payments companies, and it therefore might make sense to treat these startups – and other fintech firms like Stripe – the same way as banks are treated federally.      ""Crypto is one of those areas where we have to ask ourselves, does it make more sense to think of crypto projects as local projects or global projects. If they're global, then the rational for a single national license makes more sense,"" he said. ""Increasingly, it looks a lot like crypto is banking for the 21st century.""      This would give these startups an alternative to the state-level money transmitter licenses when building operations.      He pointed to stablecoins, some tokens and remittances as examples of where crypto startups might look more like banking services.      The charter is different from the OCC's fintech charter in that it doesn't just apply to lending.      The fintech charter is based on the idea that banks took deposits, made loans and were involved in payments, but some institutions might provide only one or two of these services. These institutions can still be treated as banks under the OCC's fintech charter.      ""I come back to the idea of things that are inherently borderless, like crypto, probably makes sense as a licensed structure,"" he said.    Too big to bank?    Brooks also addressed the issues some crypto startups have tapping banking services, saying any company that is compliant with applicable laws should be able to tap these services.      ""As crypto matures, there are increasingly many companies that have perfectly robust risk management systems and do have an ability to comply with those laws, and they shouldn't have trouble finding bank relationships,"" he said. ""Again, one of my messages in my new role is going to be to remind my colleagues at the OCC that banks not only have the ability, they have an obligation to serve all lawful businesses. They shouldn't be discriminating because something's a new technology.""      More provocatively, he suggested that crypto startups can potentially even replace the existing banking infrastructure, though he stopped short of saying that outright.      ""There are technologies that exist that can decentralize and reduce the single points of failure that our economy is mostly built on,"" he said. ""If you think back to the lessons of the financial crisis, it's that there are a small number of financial crisis, it's that there are a small number of institutions in our society that are really so big and so connected with so many people's lives that in the words of 2008, they were thought to be 'too big to fail.'""      Decentralizing the risk could, if not outright replace this issue, at least help provide some solutions, he said. Banks would have to learn from crypto startups as they continue operations.      ""I think that crypto is going to feed the banking system and change our view of what the bank charter is about,"" he said.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/us-banking-regulator-suggests-federal-licensing-framework-for-crypto-firms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21aad3e4da93c10808bc786aeb18dfb9dd091d68-1378x688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Electric Coin Company (ECC) announced Monday the launch of the Zcash Developers Alliance (ZDA), an invite-only working group that includes the Lightning Network startup Bolt Labs, the cross-chain technology startup Thesis, the Ethereum conglomerate ConsenSys and two leading startups working on the Cosmos project, Agoric and Iqlusion, just to name a few.      “The ZDA is an attempt to introduce a way to collaborate with the ECC, and the Zcash ecosystem, which focuses around other people’s priorities,” Iqlusion founder Zaki Manian said. “Product-market fit is other people [beyond fans and founders] actually caring about it.”      Manian said the “Zcash anonymity set” is a “valuable public good,” describing how the privacy coin allows shielded transactions and the construct that allows individual transactions to get lost in the metaphorical crowd.      “It feels like it’s time for a Zcash-Ethereum bridge,” ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin said in a press statement.      See also: Vitalik Buterin Says Much-Delayed Ethereum 2.0 Still on Track for July Launch      Basically, other blockchains can connect to the Zcash ecosystem to enable, say, Cosmos users to enter and exit the staking system without revealing personally identifying information, just like Zcash users can shield their information while making payments. The more people tapping into this shared anonymity set, the more effective it is at anonymizing data.      Zcash Foundation researcher Henry de Valence said his team is helping bring the Zcash shielded pool to Cosmos, although the nonprofit hasn’t been invited to the ZDA.      “If you think privacy is important in order to have fungibility, then networks should have a privacy layer. So we’re going to add a privacy layer to Cosmos in such a way that the anonymity set from Cosmos users is joined up with the anonymity set of all the Zcash users,” de Valence said.      The Ethereum Foundation is already researching ways to use these privacy options for Eth 2.0, the network’s overhaul to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Bolt Labs founder Ayo Akinyele has been working to enable some of Zcash’s privacy features on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network since 2019. And yet, the alliance is about more than formalizing the work startups were already doing. It’s about ECC shouldering the organizational burden, Akinyele said, so that other companies can focus on building tools related to the Zcash protocol.      “It’s not just about having the best anonymous crypto,” Manian added. “You have to have enough users of the anonymous crypto so that your anonymity set is sufficiently large that it can provide meaningful privacy.”    Cypherpunk model    Agoric CEO Dean Tribble, an original member of cypherpunk mailing lists and community groups in decades past, said the ZDA is more like those hacker groups than it is like the Libra Association or JavaScript Foundation, or even Microsoft industry alliances.      The ZDA is invite-only, with the requirement being that members need to actively build privacy technology. This isn’t a group for promoting token “adoption” or formalizing standards for specific products or services. Members are building wildly different tools, hoping to use the same privacy solution. As such, Akinyele said the ZDA has bi-annual meetings and private communication channels so projects can leverage resources across the group.      “We’re not building different solutions. We want to build one solution that can be adapted to multiple chains,” Akinyele said. His startup launched a Zcash-inspired testnet for bitcoin in April called zkChannels. It works like the Lightning Network, in that it offers an additional layer for more complex features. While Lightning channels offer speed and reduced transaction fees, the Zcash-inspired channels offer privacy.      “It’s a way for a customer to establish a zkChannel with a merchant or a service and the merchant won’t be able to link transactions on that channel to the identity of the customer,” Akinyele said. “In the case of [wallets], the provider just knows that two users paid each other.”      He aims to have a beta version live this year, but it won’t be connected to the Lightning Network quite yet. That will come in 2021, Akinyele said, when additional work enables both layers to be used at the same time. For now, imagine that people must choose between chocolate or vanilla frozen yogurt, privacy or speed. In the future, bitcoiners will be able to choose a chocolate-vanilla swirl swirl without diluting either feature.      See also: How to Protect Your Crypto From Cyber Attacks During COVID      “The anonymity set is going to be tied to the number of channels the provider you’ve communicated with already has,” Akinyele said, offering an example of a merchant with 10,000 channels. A customer using zkChannels is anonymized because the merchant can’t see which of the 10,000 customer channels is the buyer.      Akinyele’s startup is working on a Lightning-inspired scaling layer for Zcash as well. But tokens require different techniques than bitcoin, especially when it comes to privacy. This is why such different crypto companies joined ZDA.      “We all have independent reasons to start that interoperability,” said Tribble, whose team is focused more on smart contracts than payments. Agoric also plans to eventually launch its own token.      “We don’t believe there’s going to be one ‘winning chain,’ so getting the mainstream world online with added privacy requires … the cooperation of a lot of chains,” Tribble said.    Privacy perks    Despite the ZDA’s cypherpunk roots, this is still an industry alliance focused on business, not rebels.      There’s often an inaccurate conflation of such privacy features with criminal intent. But a Rand Corporation survey commissioned by the ECC found only 1% of illicit darknet operations accepted zcash (the publicly auditable bitcoinis still the dominant cryptocurrency on the darkweb). Someday, consumers may choose ZDA member services to shop online at regular websites, without being constantly tracked for affiliate marketing profiles they have no control over.      “We have to look at technology as a neutral, that it could be used for a wide variety of applications,” Rand Europe analyst Erik Silfversten told Forbes.      Likewise, the ZDA aims to identify business needs and shift resources to making the Zcash protocol useful for companies that may not transact directly with the namesake privacy coin.      Other organizations may join the alliance in the future, like the Zcash Foundation or Interchain Foundation, if they get involved in industry projects, not research.      “For me, the future state is in a year or two to be able to use zcash, or wrapped zcash, on Cosmos or Ethereum,” said ECC CTO Nathan Wilcox. “We’re certainly thinking about folks that didn’t make it in the first batch.”      Over at the foundation, de Valence said the nonprofit’s goal is less token-centric and more focused on infrastructure, a “privacy layer for the entire cross-chain ecosystem.”      “Our goal is to leverage the unique properties of Zcash – particularly the strong network effects of its anonymity set – to provide privacy to all of these projects,” de Valence said.      One goal the nonprofit shares with the new alliance, ZDA, is both of them see diversifying Zcash stakeholders and developers as the top priority.      “The focus for this year is interoperability,” Nathan Wilcox said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/11/zcash-alliance-aims-to-bring-privacy-tech-to-bitcoin-cosmos-and-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fbf11a9b17731eb5fb0464853448e9542c95e2a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read his full statement here.      Vitalik Buterin said the Ethereum 2.0 protocol upgrade, which will change the consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS), is well on its way to launching sometime in July.      Kicking off the Consensus: Distributed event Monday, the founder of Ethereum told CoinDesk's Michael Casey and Zack Seward the testnet for Ethereum 2.0 was already live and the first phases of implementation began about a week ago.      The Ethereum community started talking about replacing its proof-of-work (PoW) system – which is based on ""work"" done by miners and is also employed by the Bitcoin protocol – with PoS almost as soon as the network launched back in 2015.      Sometimes known as Serenity, Ethereum 2.0 has long been subject to delays. Although originally slated for January 2020, it was pushed back to Q2, and then again to Q3 2020. July has been a target date for developers since the beginning of the year. Many appear to be eyeing a debut for July 30 to coincide with Ethereum's fifth anniversary.      See also: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling      At Consensus: Distributed, Buterin also said many Ethereum developer teams were busy working on a series of scaling initiatives that could be implemented soon after PoS had successfully launched.      These include well-known techniques like sharding, which effectively divides consensus into small groups to speed up verification times, as well as new scaling solutions currently in testing. One is a layer-2 solution, Optimistic Rollup, that could ""theoretically scale to over 1,000 transactions per second,"" even in Ethereum's existing iteration, according to Buterin.      Speaking at Consensus: Distributed earlier on Monday, Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood, who is now the founder of Parity Technologies, criticized his former project for its poor governance structure, which he said makes it next to impossible for Ethereum to act on behalf of the stakeholder community.      See also: Ethereum Now Matches Bitcoin on One Key Metric      Other figures within the Ethereum community have also commented that Ethereum 2.0 could go live around July, as expected.

""I think the problems we have now with money involve too much privacy,"" Summers said in an appearance at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference on Monday. “In a world of inordinate tax evasion, trillions of dollars of laundered money around corruption and the drug trade, the last objective of government policy should be the promotion of anonymity with respect to large financial transactions.""      While many people in the cryptocurrency community and elsewhere are concerned that the digitization of money and elimination of physical cash would result in an Orwellian surveillance state, Summers was blunt in contending that traceability would be a feature, not a bug.      If there is a case for central banks to issue digital currencies, he said, ""it’s the opposite. Leveling the playing field between large and small players and making it more difficult for anonymous forms of finance to flourish. Of all the important freedoms, the ability to do multi-million dollar transactions anonymously is one of the least important freedoms.""

""Some argue that a token-based digital currency might not guarantee complete anonymity. If that proved to be the case, it would inevitably raise social, political and legal issues,"" Mersch said in his presentation.      But to Summers, anonymous digital cash with a government imprimatur would undermine the progress made by governments in combating financial crime since the 1970s.      “One of the financial community’s accomplishments has been some progress with respect to issues around bank secrecy, and I would think it tragic if we were to turn backwards in some jurisdictions in an effort to get some sovereignty revenue, were to go into competition by offering anonymous stores of value,” he said.      Watch the Summers segment here:      Inflation? Meh    On another subject, Summers said it would ""not be sensible"" to assume rampant inflation will result from the trillions of dollars of money injections that central banks have pumped into global financial markets as part of the coronavirus relief efforts.      Economists warned following the 2008 financial crisis that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet ""assured major inflation down the road,"" Summers said. That didn't transpire.      To assume that ""this growth in the balance sheet necessarily points to an inflationary period would not be a sensible judgment,"" Summers said.

42431913,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Yxh,1589205600,Crypto.com Lands Record $360M Insurance Cover for Offline Bitcoin Vaults,"Crypto.com has gathered a record-breaking $360 million worth of insurance to cover the potential loss of coins stored in special offline vaults.      Announced Monday, the crypto finance platform accessed the cover through institutional custody provider Ledger Vault, which offers $150 million of pooled insurance cover to clients via insurance broker Marsh, and Lloyd’s of London underwriter Arch Insurance.      Crypto.com, which reports two million users on its platform, has topped up the Ledger Vault cover with a $100 million direct policy, and also availed itself of $110 million worth of digital asset custody insurance from BitGo under a pooled and direct policy.      Snagging crypto insurance has been notoriously difficult over the past few years, even for the large blue-chip exchanges. Things appear to be changing, however, with Lloyd’s, the 300-year-old specialist insurance market, recently putting its name to a product covering losses from so-called “hot wallets,” or accounts that remain connected to the internet.      There has been some rivalry among crypto custodians touting big-figure insurance cover, with Seattle-based exchange Bittrex recently trumpeting some $300 million of cover for cold storage, or offline accounts. Coinbase and Gemini have also announced insurance coverage of $200 million and above to assuage potential concerns of deep-pocketed institutional clients.    ‘An arm and a leg’    Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said the multi-month process of attaining insurance cover was like working with Visa to issue a crypto credit card, which took the startup a year and a half to complete.      “These types of big firms and institutions take their sweet time of course, and boy, oh boy, do they charge an arm and a leg for this,” said Marszalek. “It’s us paying for the big insurance guys’ education in this space. Over time, as the industry gets bigger and maybe some competitors come in, we will have slightly more leverage to negotiate,” he added.      Firms that are part of Ledger Vault’s $150 million insurance program can buy additional coverage on top. This involves more tire-kicking from the team of crypto specialists at Marsh and Arch, one of the few underwriters at Lloyd’s that fully understands cryptocurrency.      “A complete and detailed understanding of the custodial process is one of the most critical, and time-consuming, stages in the underwriting of any digital asset risk,” James Croome, head of specie for Arch Underwriting, told CoinDesk via email.      “By choosing to partner with Ledger Vault, a known service provider to insurers, Crypto.com was not only able to provide underwriters with the necessary confidence in their custodial security, but they were also able to obtain a policy in a much shorter time frame than is ordinarily the case,” said Croome.    Flawed concept?    Crypto.com has taken a multi-vendor approach towards insurance, involving both Ledger Vault and BitGo in its collective cover. Marszalek said this was less to do with amassing a big dollar amount and more about having a regulated presence in different regions and jurisdictions. (BitGo received regulatory approval from the South Dakota Division of Banking to operate as a qualified custodian for storing digital assets, for example.)      Cold-storage cover of the sort Crypto.com has purchased covers loss or destruction of private cryptographic keys by natural disasters like earthquakes and the like, as well as insider theft and collusion among employees. It does not cover remote, third-party hacks; the system must be infiltrated in such a way that the attacker physically accesses the storage medium.      Big players in the exchange space like Binance and Kraken have called out crypto insurance as a flawed concept, taking the view that firms simply have to self-insure at the end of the day.      Marszalek was philosophical about this.      “Is it a panacea for the security issues the industry faces? I don’t think so,” he said. “Am I a fan of the insurance industry in general? Probably not. But our customers care. They know that before the insurer gives their stamp of approval, they are going to go in and check everything.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | WALLET | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/11/cryptocom-lands-record-360m-insurance-cover-for-offline-bitcoin-vaults,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06e147b77d6b692e3611fed623591949dc86bd16-1500x1008.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Wood, the founder of Parity Technologies, said Ethereum lacks governance and ability to easily carry out upgrades during a talk aired at CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed virtual conference.      Ethereum is on the cusp of upgrading to its next version, Ethereum 2.0, also called Eth2. The transition will change the consensus mechanism to a system of staking (proof-of-stake) as a way of processing transactions, as well as sharding (splitting) of chains to scale up the number of transactions per second the blockchain can achieve.      “Agency, and only agency, allows an economy to act as a whole on behalf of stakeholders,” said Wood. “If you don’t have agency, you can’t do this. In the same way, Eth1 doesn’t have agency over itself; so there is no way Eth1 could agree to some other network’s minting process – even if it’s Eth2.”      Wood also took the opportunity to compare Ethereum’s current transactions per second upper limit with that of Polkadot, the blockchain system built by his team at Parity.      See also: ‘Game-Changer’ Retail Digital Currency Now European Central Bank’s Focus, Board Member Says      “Ethereum can do 25 transactions per second (TPS), but, of course, the more you use it the worse it gets,” said Wood. “Polkadot uses parachains [parallel processing chains] and can go from 100K TPS to up to 1 million TPS.”      Polkadot operates “pockets of transaction processing logic,” which does not specify types of transactions leaving that entirely open to the underlying developers or projects.      “This gives an unprecedented level of flexibility,” Wood said, “much more so than the sort of dynamic resource metering model that Ethereum gives – although Ethereum was of course incredibly important at the time.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | FIAT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/11/paritys-gavin-wood-takes-a-swipe-at-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2060ae311fba4e9139e8a5974fe44105e4a731bb-1280x876.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While a simple act of arithmetic, when the network will automatically reduce its mining subsidy by half, the halving will have repercussions across the crypto industry. Miners, of course, will be directly impacted. But speculators and traders, based on data from previous halvings, have also been eying this moment.      Consensus: Distributed will feature a number of programs and special events tied to the 2020 halving. Here’s a rundown for all those that want to stay in the know, before and after the historic happening.    The halving    While not exclusively focused on the halving, Monday’s 1:00 p.m. session Bitcoin 101: Why You Should (Maybe) Buy Bitcoin and How, will examine some of the arguments surrounding the post-halved bull run theory.      See also: Bitcoin Halving 2020, Explained      Whenever the block is mined that will trigger the automatic reduction, PwC’s Alex de Vries, Bison Trail’s Joe Lallouz and Bitfarm’s Wes Fulford are sitting ready to break down this quadrennial event.

42431909,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN7Ynh,1589198400,"Global Trust in Crypto Potential Grows to 48%, Edelman Survey Finds","China, already well positioned to dominate government-run blockchain services and central bank-issued digital currency, has another advantage in the race to mass adoption: its citizens overwhelmingly trust in cryptocurrency.      According to the 2020 Edelman Trust Barometer, a 34,000-person online survey of 26 markets with 1,150 respondents each, just 48% of respondents worldwide trust crypto and an even smaller slice – only 35% – think it will bring about good. The data casts China as the most bullish place for crypto and its associated innovations among the 26 polled markets: 81% of Chinese market respondents indicated they trust crypto and blockchain and 62% percent believed the technologies will have a positive impact on the world.      Trust in crypto has surged year over year – not just in China. Mexico and Argentina leaped 20% or more from 2019, 17 countries grew by at least 10% and five countries notched 5%-plus gains. Only three countries – Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and the U.K. – saw falling trust in crypto and blockchain from 2019. Overall, global trust is up 11%.      Gathered before COVID-19 rocked financial markets and cryptocurrency with it, the Edelman data indicates crypto enjoyed a growing global base of positive sentiment that has only come into sharper focus in the run-up to the halving and in the era of infinite money printing, said Deidre Campbell, global chair of the Financial Services Sector for Edelman.      “This research I think really shows that crypto is very much increasingly in the consideration set as an alternative currency, but I think in this [COVID-19] environment we're starting to really see people start to look at crypto, particularly Bitcoin, like a hedge on inflation,” Campbell said.      Even so, the pre-COVID-19 data captured glaring spots where crypto and blockchain has plenty of room to grow.      U.S. respondents approached the industry with statistically significant disdain. A mere 26% believe crypto and blockchain will have any positive impact on the world (Edelman posed this question on a five-point sliding scale). Canadians and British respondents led the doubters with only 17% positivity rates each.      Global tech skepticism also manifested in legal views: 84% of distrusers and 48% of “trusters” said the space needed tighter regulation. A majority of respondents said more regulation of crypto and blockchain is necessary.      A slight majority of Chinese market respondents called for stronger government controls. Eighty-one percent of those surveyed for Hong Kong, 67% for the U.S, 55% for South Korea and 34% for India said the same.      Other figures indicate the technologies bitcoin spawned in 2008 still have a ways to go before they appeal beyond their informational echo chamber. Those who claimed they were very well informed about crypto and blockchain also had the most positive sentiments toward them, at 71%. That figure dropped as the familiarity levels declined – it bottomed out at 19% among those who said they knew nothing.      The Edelman report identified four “imperatives” to improving global trust in cryptocurrency based on the survey results. At least 40 percent of all respondents said that communicating the tech’s downsides, the benefits, increasing education and committing the industry to a code of ethics, respectively, will help them build more trust.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/global-trust-in-crypto-potential-grows-to-48-edelman-survey-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd9b867fb3a54f778ffe1231091b16b34f573f1a-1400x933.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The $3 million seed round with Phan and Ashton Kutcher’s VC firm, Sound Ventures, marks roughly $5.4 million in total capital raised by Lolli so far. Pathfinder, the early-stage investment arm of Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, led this recent round with participation from Bain Capital Ventures, Craft Ventures and Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.      “We have an incredible syndicate of strategic investors that will help drive the adoption of Lolli and bitcoin forward,” Lolli CEO Alex Adelman said in a press statement.      As of this week, Phan’s fans can use Lolli to earn bitcoin rewards when shopping directly on her Em Cosmetics website. Adelman said the funding will be used to launch Lolli’s mobile app this summer and expand the company internationally throughout 2020.      The e-commerce landscape has shifted dramatically since Lolli launched in 2018. In short, people are shopping more online and managing their money through apps. For example, Shopify revenues reportedly jumped 47% in Q1 2020 and Square, a fintech app that also offers bitcoin, is participating in mainstream programs like the U.S. government’s emergency Paycheck Protection Program. This means it’s easier than ever for people to earn and spend a variety of currencies from home.      Read more: Bitcoin Revenue in Square’s Cash App Tops Fiat Revenue for First Time in Q1      From Adelman’s perspective, Square’s patent for converting fiat-to-crypto is a “game-changer” for the retail industry.      “It’s arguably the most important patent in the payments space that will affect cryptocurrency over the next 10 years,” Adelman said. “It’s an air-swap where someone can pay with whatever currency they want and also the merchant can accept whatever currency they want.”      This relates to Lolli because the startup’s primary business partners are retailers and merchants looking for shoppers to come directly to homepages instead of Amazon. For example, Em Cosmetics fans can earn bitcoin by shopping on the homepage and learn about it through the brand’s social media channels. People looking to liquidate those earnings can easily do so with mainstream apps like Cash App or Strike, even if they’re not interested in using an exchange account.      “Bitcoin is going to have a huge impact on everything,” Phan said. “I’m thrilled to work with Lolli to help educate and bring Bitcoin to the masses.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/05/11/ashton-kutcher-and-michelle-phan-invest-in-lollis-3m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d1a3efcef55ff2fc640d4eeb153ed8fdab4085c-2044x1362.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383650,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwfX,1589198110,Bitcoin's 8% Drop Triggers Largest Liquidation on BitMEX in 2 Months,"Bitcoin fell sharply on Sunday, triggering the highest long-short liquidations on crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX for the past two months.      The top crypto by market cap fell by over 8.5% – its biggest single-day drop since March 12, when prices crashed nearly 40%, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The decline could have been much bigger had prices remained at the session low of $8,100, hit in the early Asian trading day, instead of recovering to $8,731 by UTC close.      The cryptocurrency fell from $9,560 to $8,100 between 00:00 and 01:00 UTC, catching most traders off guard and forcing as much as $278 million worth of futures liquidations on BitMEX. That's the highest amount since March 13, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew, when the daily total value of long-short positions hit well over $700 million.      The vast majority of Sunday's closures were for sell liquidations – when the price drops beneath a predetermined limit (the liquidation price) and forces traders to close their long positions.      The massive amount of sell liquidations indicate leverage was skewed to the bullish side.      That's not surprising as the bullish narrative surrounding the impending mining reward halving has dominated market sentiment since bitcoin bottomed out at $3,867 in mid-March. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency decoupled from traditional markets in the last week of April and moved into five figures last week, bolstering the bullish price expectations.    Pullback comes early    Bitcoin was already overdue for a pullback. Technical indicators began signaling that the asset was overbought last Friday when as many as 85% of all wallet addresses holding bitcoin having already made a return on their investments ahead of the halving event.      However, most observers were optimistic a temporary price drop, if any, would be seen after the halving. Also, traders were hedged against the risk of potential price pullback, as evidenced by the uptick in demand for put options over the past few weeks.      The pullback, however, has come early and could be extended further to $7,000, according to James Richman, chief executive and chief investment officer at private asset management firm JJ Richman.      That possibility cannot be ruled out, as technical studies have rolled over in favor of the bears. The MACD histogram, which identifies trend changes and trend strength, has crossed below zero for the first time since March 20, suggesting a bearish reversal. Last week’s spinning top candle is reporting buyer exhaustion – when investors are no longer supporting the sustained price increase.      See also: CME Says Volume Surge Shows Strong Institutional Interest Before Bitcoin Halving      That said, sellers are yet to penetrate the all-important 200-day average support at $8,040. A close lower could bring in additional selling pressure, opening the doors to $7,000.      While Richman is expecting a deeper drop to $7,000, his long-run outlook is still constructive: “A drop to $7,000 would be a good opportunity to buy and load up before it takes strength to develop and push towards $10,000 again.""      Meanwhile, Henrik Anderrson, chief investment officer at Australia-based Apollo Capital, is of the opinion that the price dip seen over the last three days could still be short-lived.      “There is room for prices to go higher as leverage seems to have come out of the market,” he told CoinDesk, “in the short term we believe US$10,000 is a psychologically important level for Bitcoin. If we can sustain a price over 10,000, we will see increased confidence in the market.”      Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, echoed similar sentiments: “Because of the significantly deep capitulation in mid-March [an asset-wide mass selling of positions], further downside is de-risked from here.”      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,558. The bounce from Sunday’s low of $8,100 ran out of steam above $8,800 during the overnight trade.

42383647,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwbl,1589198015,"'Game-Changer' Retail Digital Currency Now European Central Bank's Focus, Board Member Says","The European Central Bank (ECB) is looking into what a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) form of the euro might look like, executive member Yves Mersch said.      The ECB set up a task force earlier this year to look into what its potential CBDC could look like, and the group expects to publish a preliminary report in the coming weeks, said Mersch, an executive board member at the ECB. He spoke during CoinDesk's Consensus: Distributed conference Monday on central banks and their approach to the digital currency.      ""A wholesale CBDC, restricted to a limited group of financial counterparties, would be largely business as usual,"" Mersch said. ""However, a retail CBDC, accessible to all, would be a game changer, so a retail CBDC is now our main focus.""      A retail CBDC could be based on a digital token circulated ""in a decentralized manner,"" without a central ledger, Mersch said, though he stopped short of saying the words ""blockchain"" or ""distributed ledger.""      He acknowledged that the traceability of digital transactions would raise privacy concerns among a population used to paying for some things with paper notes.      ""Some argue that a token-based digital currency might not guarantee complete anonymity. If that proved to be the case, it would inevitably raise social, political and legal issues,"" he said. ""We are currently looking into the legal questions raised by the potential use of intermediaries to facilitate the circulation of a CBDC and also the processing of transactions in a CBDC.""      Some of these legal questions include whether the ECB can outsource public tasks to private entities, and what sort of supervision these entities would need.    Cashless economy    One consideration for the creation of a CBDC is whether cash use is starting to decline, Mersch said. This decline, if any, is modest at best in the euro area – in March, the latest month he had data for, banknote circulation reached a peak of nearly 19 billion euros.      ""While electronic payments are already crowding out the use of cash in some countries, whose currencies seem less attractive than the euro, there is no such trend away from cash in the euro area,"" he said. ""Some 76% of all transactions in the euro area are carried out in cash, amounting to more than half of the total value of all payments.""      While the ECB is considering a digitized euro, there are a number of downsides it would also have to mitigate, including whether the use of a CBDC would crowd out bank deposits and other intermediaries.      Should this happen, it might amplify the effects of financial crises.      ""If households were able to convert commercial bank deposits into a CBDC at a rate of one-to-one, they may find it far more attractive to hold a risk-free CBDC rather than bank deposits,"" he said. ""During a systemic banking crisis, this could trigger digital bank runs of unprecedented speed and scale, magnifying the effects of such a crisis.""      See also: How the COVID-19 Crisis Revived the Digital Dollar Debate      Mersch, who has been with the ECB since 2012, has long been outspoken about the crypto space, arguing that bitcoin was a risky alternative payment system as far back as 2014.

Michelle Phan: The Beauty of Bitcoin YouTube famous Michelle Phan has gone all-in on Bitcoin. She also thinks her 8.9 million subscribers are ready for Bitcoin. ""They want to know how to protect their purchasing power,” she said in a profile by CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen.    Catching up at Consensus    Kristin Smith is director of external affairs for the Blockchain Association and a speaker at Consensus: Distributed. We reached out to her over Zoom to talk about what it's like being a blockchain lobbyist during corona, her views on the Digital Dollar and what she's going to be talking about today at noon.      What is like lobbying people on Zoom? It’s really hard. First of all, lawmakers aren’t used to working on Zoom, it’s primarily phone calls when you’re interacting with anyone in government. The ability to get to know new people is almost nonexistent. Normally, we would be trying to expand our circles through introductory meetings. Given the crisis, all the attention and focus is on the immediate response to the coronavirus. So, at the moment, we don’t really have the luxury of setting up these get-to-know you phone calls. The everyday groundwork, relationship building, and basic education work is really difficult to do right now.      You mentioned that most legislative efforts are directed towards the pandemic. Are there any cryptocurrency plays that are moving on this agenda? Strangely, I think, if you had asked me at the beginning of the year if any pro-crypto legislation would happen this year I would have said it’s a near-zero chance: It’s an election year, there’s an impeachment going on, there’s not a whole lot moving through Congress. But this crisis has been so sudden and widespread, that Congress is now open to ideas that would have faced big hurdles in the past, or at least lacked a serious audience. So, I think, once we transition to more recovery-focused legislation, there will be opportunities to promote innovations from the crypto industry. It certainly doesn’t guarantee that we’ll get anything passed, but there will be big legislative vehicles moving that we can attach our policy ideas to.      What do you think the larger impact of China’s digital currency will be? That is definitely something lawmakers are paying attention to. They are very concerned about what China is doing, and want to ensure the U.S. remains competitive. I think this is going to be a huge factor in the discussion around what a digital dollar should look like. It shows how much further ahead China is compared to the U.S. in adopting blockchain technology as part of a solution for many different sectors of their economy.      Could you give a preview of what you hope to discuss at Consensus: Distributed? I’m going to host along with Chris Brummer from Georgetown University and Aaron Stanley. We have several themes we hope to touch on. One of them is the digital dollar. Also, the role of China and their digital currency coming online and what that means for the United States. We’ll also have an interview with Brian Brooks, the number two at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and former chief legal officer at Coinbase.    Crypto Long & Short    When Paul Tudor Jones says he’s long bitcoin, investors pay attention. Even if they don’t agree with his stance, he’s a well-known hedge fund investor, one of the great commodity inventors of all time, an iconic name in the “smart money” set, writes CoinDesk's Director of Research Noelle Acheson, in the latest Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets.      According to reports, Tudor is buying bitcoin “as a hedge.” This is very different from funds speculating on bitcoin’s price going up. This is a hedge position, which is more fundamental and long-term.      This isn’t an institutional investor pontificating about the need for real assets in the face of unlimited money issuance and economic strain. This is hedge fund royalty publicly acknowledging that he is betting on bitcoin as a hedge. This is different.

42383658,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwn5,1589196348,"First Mover: As Bitcoin's Halving Finally Arrives, a Price Retreat Deflates the Hype","A pullback in the bitcoin market over the past few days has rattled traders on the eve of the blockchain network's third halving, which had been tabbed by some bullish investors as a catalyst for higher prices.      The cryptocurrency fell for a third straight day to about $8,500 as of late Sunday, off 15% from the May 7 price of $10,000. The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase suffered a temporary outage on Saturday, too, as prices tumbled 10% in a span of just 30 minutes.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The sell-off threatened to damp trader spirits ahead of the halving, an occurrence that takes place roughly once every four years, when the pace of new bitcoins produced by the blockchain network automatically gets cut in half.      Open bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago-based exchange CME rose to record highs last week, and market enthusiasm swelled after the hedge-fund magnate Paul Tudor Jones II disclosed plans to nose into the market.      ""While the bulls finally managed to push bitcoin above the $10k level, yet again there was a distinct lack of follow-through action, which suggests hesitation and market nervousness ahead of a key risk event,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at BeQuant, a cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage, said in emailed remarks.      Some analysts and investors say the halving could help send prices soaring to $100,000 or higher. Others say the halving is so clearly understood and anticipated that any impact is probably already baked into the market price.      The rallies that followed the 11-year-old cryptocurrency's two prior halvings played out over years and may have had more to do with the cryptocurrency's increasing popularity and adoption, or simply speculation.      And it's possible the growing belief among some investors that bitcoin could serve as an inflation hedge – ""digital gold"" – may play a far greater role in determining the cryptocurrency's price. That's especially the case now that the Federal Reserve and other central banks are injecting trillions of dollars into the global financial system as part of their emergency response to the coronavirus-induced recession.      Bitcoin is still up 19.5% in 2020, contrasting with a 9.3% loss for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.      Officially, the halvings occur every time the Bitcoin blockchain clears 210,000 data blocks. With block times of roughly 10 minutes, the halvings were originally supposed to be spaced four years apart. But occasional accelerations in the network's speed since its launch in 2009 has shortened the time interval.      That's why the third halving, at block 630,000, is happening now, about two months shy of four years since the last such event in July 2016. As of Monday at 09:45 UTC, the halving was an estimated 9 hours and 44 minutes away — putting it soon after 19:30 UTC tonight.      The reality is that past halvings have proven to be somewhat anticlimactic affairs, in stark contrast to the hype that has built up within the cryptocurrency community over the past few weeks.      One apt comparison might be to the obsessive scramble that preceded ""Y2K"" at turn of the new millennium, when governments and businesses worried that computer clocks might not be able to handle the date rollover. New Year's Eve 2000 came and went with lots of fanfare, reflection and predictions about the future, but little actual disruption.      Indeed, prior bitcoin halvings have had little immediate impact on the market price. When the first halving took place, on Nov. 28, 2012, bitcoin's price slid by 0.5%. And on July 9, 2016, the second halving, prices fell by 2.3%.      According to the data firm Messari, a bull market that saw prices increase more than 80-fold followed the 2012 halving, but it took about a year. After the 2016 halving, prices rose 30-fold over the next 1.5 years to an all-time-high around $20,000 in December 2017.      Even at the current price level, bitcoin is changing hands at roughly 13 times what it did at the time of the 2016 halving, around $648.      ""Each of the past two halvings were followed by bull runs that saw price rise thousands of percentage points,"" Messari wrote this month in a report. ""Although the data to support this relationship is limited given bitcoin has only undergone two halvings, it has been enough to convince some people that halvings are a leading cause of bitcoin bull runs.""      At the current issuance rate, the blockchain produces about 1,800 bitcoin a day as a reward to computer operators for securing the network, worth about $5.6 billion a year at current prices. Post-halving, the issuance rate will drop to 900 bitcoins a day, so annual demand – ostensibly from new investors – would simply have to exceed $2.8 billion to keep the price on an upward trajectory.      ""Assuming constant buy pressure, this reduction in selling should lead to at least a marginal rise in price,"" according to the Messari report.      Industry executives say the impact will likely be felt more immediately on bitcoin miners, as computer operators on the network are known.      The miners will see their daily revenue cut in half – that is, until those with higher electricity costs or slower, less-efficient, older-generation machines begin to operate at a loss, and they drop off the network. When that happens, an automatic adjustment mechanism known as ""difficulty"" should theoretically kick in, helping to restore some of the industry's profitability.      John Rim, chief financial officer of publicly traded Canadian bitcoin-mining company BitFarms, said in a phone interview that bitcoin's coronavirus-fueled 38% price plunge on March 12 offered a glimpse of how the network might respond following the halving. The reasoning is that the price plunge that day was tantamount to a revenue reduction on a scale similar to the halving.      The so-called ""hashrate"" – a gauge of the speed at which operators are sending computations known as ""hashes"" to the network – had climbed on March 7 to a record 123 exahashes, or quintillion hashes, per second, based on the seven-day average. But as prices fell over the next two weeks, the seven-day average fell by about 24% to 94 exahashes on March 21.      The hashrate has since crept back up toward the record as bitcoin prices recovered from the mid-March crash.      All things being equal, Rim estimates the halving could lead to a roughly 15% reduction the network's total hash rate.      The first indication miners are dropping off the blockchain network en masse might come from looking at the time it takes to mine the first few blocks after No. 630,000. Since block times are supposed to average 10 minutes apiece, an unusually drawn-out span between them could signal a sudden drop in the number of miners working to confirm transactions.      That might represent the extent of the drama on halving eve – aside from the ersatz thrill of counting down and maybe a few bitcoiners popping a cork or two.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $8,554 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $8,866 | 24-Hr Low: $8,284      Trend: Bitcoin is on the defensive Monday, having declined by over 8% Sunday to register its biggest single-day loss since the March 12 ""Black Thursday"" crash.      While a pullback was overdue, it was widely expected to unfold following the mining reward halving scheduled to happen this evening (as per UTC). However, contrary to expectations, the cryptocurrency witnessed a solid correction in the three days leading up to the supply-altering event.      Prices topped out above $10,000 on Friday and fell as low as $8,300 on Sunday. The sharp turn lower from five figures suggests the rally from the March 13 low of $3,867 has made an interim top and the bears have regained control.      Backing the bearish reversal is the 14-day relative strength index's violation of a trendline rising from the low seen in March. The MACD histogram, too, has crossed below zero, indicating a bullish-to-bearish trend change.      As a result, the bounce from $8,300 to $8,600 seen in the last 15 hours may soon be reversed. The cryptocurrency remains on track to test and possibly break below the 200-day average $8,041. A close lower (UTC time) could prompt a greater selloff, potentially leading to a drop to $7,469 (April 7 high).      On the higher side, a move above the hourly chart hurdle of $8,912 would open the doors to re-test of $9,400. That said, a close above the recent high of $10,074 is needed to restore the bullish trend.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/first-mover-as-bitcoins-halving-finally-arrives-a-price-retreat-deflates-the-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/90d9154ee434bea657f91484cc4500299d08c96f-1500x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383641,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwUD,1589195941,CoinDesk 50: How the People’s Bank of China Became a CBDC Leader,"China leads the world in the development of national digital currencies. While other central banks are talking about central bank digital currencies (CBDC), the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is already trialling its toolkit. Just recently, screenshots emerged of a “digital yuan” interface being piloted at the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), one of four state-owned banking giants.      That PBoC is first to the CBDC starting line is not surprising. It has been working on the project for six years. Meanwhile, China’s government has made blockchain a national priority in several directions, including the recently launched Blockchain Services Network (BSN), which is now being piloted in Chinese cities and along its “Digital Silk Road” trade routes.    This post is part of the CoinDesk 50, an annual selection of the most innovative and consequential projects in the blockchain industry. See the full list here.    Between the CBDC and the BSN, blockchain technology has huge implications both for China’s economy and perhaps international politics. China hopes to increase efficiency in its payments system and in how trade with its international partners is orchestrated.      “China is a nation of early adopters from the grassroot level and through a concerted effort by the leadership to embrace technology,” said Omer Ozden, chairman of RockTree Capital, a merchant bank specializing in cross-border investments between China and the U.S.      “We already have China transformed into a cashless society before everyone else,” Ozden said. “The national digital currency project started from 2014 is iterations of the same process, and we will have a digital currency this time instead of an interface for fiat transactions.”      The PBoC sees the digital yuan, or Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP), replacing cash and making peer-to-peer transactions more secure and efficient, its white paper released in 2019 said      It also sees a national digital currency as a preemptive measure to maintain its monetary sovereignty, Changchun Mu, director of the Research Institute on Digital Currency, has said. Facebook’s Libra, and other possible private money projects, could threaten China’s ability to control its economic system.      “If one of the foundations for monetary policy is that the central bank is able to control supply and demand of its local currency by adjusting the interest rate, Libra would be a destabilizing force,” Mu said in one of his lectures about DCEP last year. “Effective monetary policies are crucial for a country’s economy, Libra would chip away that power.”      The PBOC central bank released its whitepaper last summer for the digital yuan soon after Facebook unveiled its plan to launch a stablecoin backed by a basket of fiat currencies not including yuan. (although Facebook decided to back Libra later changed course as a concession to regulators, and now wants to back its money through other stablecoins.)      The race to create the future of money is already on, and according to Facebook, China is currently winning it. Facebook’s top executive on the Libra project warned China will win if the U.S. does not have a good answer to the China national digital currency in five years.      China has been ahead of the curve in the CBDC race.      Six major economies including Japan and the UK are forming a working group to explore potential use cases for digital currencies and some of the U.S. legislators are pushing hard for a digital dollar. But they are still in initial stages and have not gone through the tranches of regulatory red tape.      Ironically, the PBoC is ahead of the game because of its centralized authority. It has more executive power than any other central banks, including the Federal Reserve.       Founded in 1948, the PBoC has been instrumental in every step of modern China’s economic reform. For the first two decades, it managed both monetary policy and commercial banking services.      The Chinese central bank has long heavy-handedly managed China’s economy and the digital yuan is just the latest highly consequential intervention it has made. How well the DCEP succeeds will have a lot to say about the future of money, monetary policy and international trade.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/05/11/coindesk-50-how-the-peoples-bank-of-china-became-a-cbdc-leader,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47fca9b14358fbc935db358864b7f10f5685f5f8-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383645,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwXz,1589195096,Crypto Native SEBA Bank Offers Asset Tokenization Service With TokenSoft Tie-Up,"A Swiss bank is planning to offer asset tokenization services later this year after partnering with TokenSoft's new European distributor.      SEBA Bank AG, a regulated and licensed crypto-first bank in Switzerland started by former UBS employees, is partnering with Tokensoft International AG to offer a bespoke tokenization process for entities looking to issue their own security tokens. Essentially, SEBA will design and issue a token to the specific needs of an institution or individual, and manage the token once it's live.      Matthew Alexander, head of asset tokenization at SEBA, told CoinDesk the bank offers custody and storage solutions, and is looking to build trading liquidity for digital assets as part of a broader goal between bridging the traditional and new financial ecosystems. Its first move is to work with Tokensoft International, a customer of the U.S.-based TokenSoft Inc. that is acting as the distributor for the latter's technology.      SEBA launched in November after raising over $100 million in 2018, offering clients both fiat storage and crypto custody services, as well as other financial services.      ""The bank was established really to become a bridge between the fiat banks and the digital economy and digital banking so our perspective [is] that really what could be missing globally is an enterprise-grade regulated safe storage and custody [service],"" Alexander said.      This service is easily scalable, said Mason Borda, TokenSoft's CEO (Borda is not a director or board member for the European entity). The software stack is capable of handling north of 30,000 investors over a few days, which should enable it to handle SEBA's integration.      ""The custody integration is designed to be done in a scalable way,"" he said. ""There's not really many throughput limitations, and so as new customers come in this technology should be able to scale up ... it's designed to handle a large number of issuers and investors.""      Eva Oberholzer, SEBA's marketing and communications chief, told CoinDesk there is still a lot of insecurity and knowledge gaps around the crypto space.      ""We can also create products, structured products or investment products that you actually already know but they're now focused on the cryptocurrency industry, So we allow them to get familiar with this entire template of cryptocurrencies in the hope that they also get familiar with the entire topic of tokenization and digital assets, and we believe that's going to become the future,"" she said.    Transition phase    SEBA is hoping to help facilitate a transition from the traditional finance and banking system to a more digital ideal, Oberholzer said. To that end, the bank believes that serving a widespread enterprise need ""is crucial.""      Scalability, then, is one concern the companies wanted to focus on.      ""SEBA has very scalable systems,"" Borda said. ""Obviously, they're built like traditional banking systems [but] the blockchain technologies are integrated with that and is designed to be able to handle the load that will come in.""      At the moment, SEBA and Tokensoft are planning to launch the service by the end of the year, and initially will only serve Switzerland and a handful of other European markets. Next year, the bank hopes to expand services to the middle East and Asia, Alexander said, though this is dependent on regulatory approvals and licensing.      The service is almost ready to be launched, he said.      ""I think it's it's really just finalizing those last few weeks, the tests on some parts of the of the platform itself and then we already of course have been working in various [jurisdictions] where this could be immediately deployed,"" he said. ""So I think it's just a matter of us, you know, pushing forward to to find solutions for the the overall tokenization product or service that we're working on with counterparts and I think by by the end of this year, we'll see this really working in action.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/crypto-native-seba-bank-offers-asset-tokenization-service-with-tokensoft-tie-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f48b9d885b55dc5f18ccd6367980c3a0d50d2cb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383640,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwRh,1589194051,CME Says Volume Surge Shows Strong Institutional Interest Before Bitcoin Halving,"Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) says record trading activity for its bitcoin derivatives reflects a strong institutional interest in the imminent halving event.      In a note sent out late on Sunday, the derivatives exchange said a strong ""ramp up"" in volumes over the past week showed institutional investors were getting exposure to bitcoin, most likely in preparation ahead of the supply-cutting event.      Primarily used by institutional and professional investors, CME said 844 unique accounts have begun trading bitcoin derivatives since the start of 2020 – more than double the number of new market entrants compared to the same period last year.      Average daily volume (ADV) for its bitcoin futures came in at 8,456 contracts year-to-date, more than 43% above the same time period in 2019, the firm added. Total volumes for bitcoin options contracts, which only launched in mid-January, are up to 2,250 contracts, with a record 216 contracts exchanged on May 6.      Open interest – contracts that haven't settled – in both futures and options came in at just under 9,800 (around $423 million-worth of bitcoin) and 555 contracts (roughly $4.8 million) respectively on May 7. Average daily open interest is up 33 percent from where it was this time last year, CME's note said.      ""With bitcoin halving set to take place on this week, CME Bitcoin futures and options have seen a ramp-up in trading activity ahead of this major event,"" the exchange said. ""Large open interest holders in Bitcoin futures reached a record of 62 during the week of April 14, reflecting strong institutional interest.""      See also: Bitcoin Breaches $9.2K as Open Positions on CME Futures Hit 10-Month High      Ross Middleton, co-founder and CFO of decentralized exchange DeversiFI, said: ""Soaring CME bitcoin futures volumes and [open interest are] evidence of the growing Institutional interest in bitcoin both ahead of the halving and as a broader macro hedge.""      It comes as no surprise CME's volume for bitcoin futures is up because it was ""one of the easiest way for legacy firms to gain exposure to Bitcoin,"" Middleton added.      Brian Wong, co-founder, and chief product officer at futures exchange BTSE, said funds who would not otherwise have invested in bitcoin may have had a ""flagpole"" moment when celebrity hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones expressed his intention to allocate a part of his portfolio into the asset class.      Of course, CME remains a cash-settled derivatives platform, meaning that while institutional investors are gaining exposure to bitcoin, they aren't physically holding it. Institutions are excited by the halving but are still only ""trading paper,"" said Mati Greenspan, founder of crypto analytics site Quantum Economics. As such, they're limiting their exposure to the asset class.      See also: 3 Straight Record Days Drive CME Bitcoin Futures Open Interest to All-Time High      At the time of writing, bitcoin's halving event – which will take block rewards down from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC – was expected to take place in just under 10 hours. While the previous two halvings have caused big volatility spikes followed by extended rallies, there is some uncertainty on how bitcoin's price will be affected this time around.      In a blog post published Friday, CME highlighted this will be the first halving to feature a robust and liquid derivatives market. Market participants can now create far more sophisticated market positions and miners can now lock-in and hedge their positions ahead of the halving, the firm said.

Cybersecurity experts, as cited in the Daily NK on Monday, said the group – widely believed to be sponsored by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – is making a concerted effort to target South Korean crypto holders amid the coronavirus pandemic. It's also looking further afield and launching attacks in other nations such as the U.S.      ESTsecurity, a cybersecurity firm, warned Lazarus has been increasingly launching what are called adaptive persistent threats (APTs) – prolonged and targeted cyberattacks, whereby an intruder seeks to gain access to a network while remaining undetected.      The firm detailed in a press release that one way hackers gain access to a network or exchange account is by sending emails with malicious attachments, claiming to be from legitimate services or entities. The hackers disguised some of these attachments as ""blockchain software development contracts"" and enticed victims to open them.      ""When it comes to attacking foreign institutions and companies, Lazarus is consistent in conducting attacks by email disguised as a job offer or job description,"" ESTsecurity said in a statement.      ""As such, the organization has been attacking cryptocurrency traders in Korea until recently,"" the firm added.      See also: US Agencies Publish List of North Korea’s Alleged Crypto Crimes      Lazarus is best known in the crypto world for making off with $571 million in stolen funds in 2018 from various exchanges located around South Korea and Asia.      Pressure from economic sanctions against North Korea has increased by the United Nations, the European Union and the U.S. over nuclear arms and military concerns against the backdrop of fresh coronavirus cases being reported on the peninsula.      The increased attempts of theft in cryptocurrencies come as fresh news reports of a potential ""second wave"" in South Korea on Monday. There have been 34 new cases of the deadly virus, its highest daily number in a month as reported by Seven News Australia.      Figures remain unclear in highly secretive North Korea. However, the total number of cases in the south has reached over 10,900, with 256 deaths in total, according to Worldometer, a COVID-19 tracking website.

42383659,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwoL,1589158065,"Crypto Long & Short: Bitcoin Markets Are Growing Up. Bitcoin Mining Is, Too","When Paul Tudor Jones II says he’s long bitcoin, investors pay attention. Even if they don’t agree with his stance, he’s a well-known hedge fund investor, one of the great commodity inventors of all time, an iconic name in the “smart money” set. Most investors tend to follow the “smart money” – perhaps not right away, but the external validation from someone paid to be skeptical of hype will most likely act as a trigger for many. On the whole, investors tend to move as a herd.      Even more interesting are the reasons given: According to reports, he is buying bitcoin “as a hedge.” This is very different from funds speculating on bitcoin’s price going up. This is a hedge position, which is more fundamental and long-term.      You're reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk's head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor's point of view. You can subscribe here.      It also indicates an understanding of bitcoin’s value proposition. Crypto investors got excited when it was revealed a few weeks ago that Renaissance Technologies was contemplating trading bitcoin futures. Reniassance’s Medallion fund is a quant fund, interested in discrepancies in volatilities and other relatively obscure metrics. It doesn't really care about the underlying asset. Tudor Investment Corp., however, has studied bitcoin enough to understand its monetary properties and technological resilience.      This isn’t an institutional investor pontificating about the need for real assets in the face of unlimited money issuance and economic strain. This is hedge fund royalty publicly acknowledging that he is betting on bitcoin as a hedge. This is different.    Coming of age    Back in 2015, in what feels like a lifetime ago but is only slightly more than the average age of your standard laptop, I read an article in CoinDesk about a conference held in Hong Kong. It featured a photo of a panel session that had generated a lot of excitement. For the first time, approximately 90% of Bitcoin mining hashpower (the computational capacity of network processing) was on the same stage. To many of us back then, Bitcoin mining had the allure of secrecy and power – it was the motor of the industry, and yet we knew so little about it: the who, the where, the with what.      Fast forward to today, and bitcoin mining is still dominated by large mining pools based in China. But the sector has changed so much.      First, the balance is shifting, with the growth of mining business in Europe, North America and elsewhere. Earlier this week, the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance launched an interactive chart of hashpower distribution, which shows a notable drop in China’s concentration. (Tune in to our show on Consensus: Distributed TV tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. ET to hear Christine Kim talk to some of the principals leading this shift).      Second, the sector is much less secretive. A few days ago, mining pool Poolin released a report with detailed information on hashrate distribution and the energy costs of different machines, an unusual trove of information from a key industry operator.      Miners appear to be more willing to talk: my CoinDesk Research colleague Christine Kim hosted a series of podcasts talking to miners about their businesses, and many contributed comments to our Bitcoin Halving Report. There are even miner-centric newsletters and podcasts.      What’s more, some key miners are now listed companies, complying with the requisite disclosures which lend insight into how mining businesses are run.      There is also a notable shift in the style and profile of bitcoin miners, towards more sophisticated structures and financial engineering. I’ve written before about how bitcoin markets are growing up. Bitcoin mining is, too.      Some leading derivatives exchanges are offering increasingly flexible products. Rather than the quarterly maturities most common in traditional options, bitcoin options are now available for a range of settlement dates, which gives producers more flexibility.      Going even further, some infrastructure participants are designing tools specifically for miners. Late last year, crypto liquidity provider GSR announced a partnership to develop a “tailored risk management solution.” Some lenders have talked about structuring collateralized loans specifically for miners.      And earlier this week, crypto data provider Coin Metrics unveiled a new type of hashrate index, which could remove some of the subjectivity of the traditional hashrate measure and serve as a basis for hashrate derivatives, allowing miners to hedge one of their main sources of uncertainty.      Outside of financial products, the business itself becoming more investable. Cloud mining removes the need to deal with hardware issues, and some unrelated businesses are entering the mining game.      With all this going on, it’s not hard to see why the third Bitcoin halving (in which the number of bitcoins issued to miners for their processing work gets halved), expected tomorrow, is so different from the previous two.      The sector’s resilience no longer lies at the mercy of bitcoin issuance and market price. These are significant, yes, but there is a growing array of tools to mitigate their impact, and the profile of the participants in the mining industry is becoming more diverse. This adds resilience.      The financialization of mining may dilute some of the original ethos of bitcoin as a decentralized, hard form of money; but the flexibility and relative stability it could add should make the market more resistant to protocol adjustments and price swings.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    U.S. job losses announced this week broke all records (20.5 million for April, 10 times the previous record decline in 1945), but that didn’t stop the S&P’s perplexing rise, which makes me wonder where investors think the earnings boost will come from. It’s not like companies will be buying back their own shares in bulk in this environment. Maybe the market thinks the Fed will start buying shares?      Also disconcerting are indications that the futures market is pricing in negative rates. But is that enough to spook the market? Not yet. Momentum investing seems to be the ruling strategy.      Speaking of momentum, bitcoin breaking $10,000 did not attract the fanfare it would have a few weeks ago. Just as well, since it was fleeting. (The chart below was compiled before an almost 20% drop, to just over $8,200 at time of writing on Sunday evening.)    Chain links    Crypto asset manager Bitwise has published a report that shows even a small allocation of bitcoin to multi-asset portfolios would have boosted cumulative returns, even if it was bought at the December 2017 high and rebalanced. TAKEAWAY: The advantages of a low correlation.      Given the hype around the potential price impact of the upcoming bitcoin block subsidy halving, many believe the price will continue to go up afterwards. History shows that is not necessarily the case. TAKEAWAY: One of the reasons could be profit taking (“buy the rumor, sell the news”). Another could be an uptick in selling pressure as miners liquidate inventory to compensate the cut in income. Some investors probably fear weakened network resilience as a sell-off could push even more miners out of the market. Tomorrow’s halving has the added overlay of heightened general market risk. So, the bitcoin price might continue its upward trend post-halving … or, it might see a correction.      Crypto data site Coin Metrics has created a hashrate index, intended to serve as the base for derivative products that could help miners and investors hedge their positions. TAKEAWAY: Miners can control their own hashrate, but they have no way of knowing how much of the total processing power of the sector their share accounts for – the hashrate index is based on an estimate derived from the time it takes to mine recent blocks. The new “observed work” metric aims to remove some of the subjectivity around hashrate observations, and could form the basis of hashrate derivatives. As I stressed in THE BRIEFING above, the crypto mining sector is maturing at a breathtaking pace.  Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain have reached their highest level since the summer of 2019. TAKEAWAY: This is likely due to the strong growth in stablecoin transactions and supply – most stablecoins run on Ethereum. It could also be partially due to the impending network shift to proof-of-stake, as the number of addresses holding 32 or more ETH – the minimum required to become a network validator – has increased sharply.      Tether is easily the leader in the stablecoin pack in terms of market cap and growth – yet that growth is not evenly distributed amongst its various forms. Supply on Omni, the first tether blockchain, is declining, while that on Ethereum and Tron is growing fast. TAKEAWAY: This discrepancy shows why it’s important to look into the nuts and bolts of the blockchain on which your stablecoin of choice runs. Omni, based on the Bitcoin blockchain, is more robust than other blockchains, and has multisig capabilities (which allow for more complex transaction configurations). However, it also suffers sudden transaction fee spikes and longer confirmation times. The decline in its use shows what stablecoin characteristics users value more.      Every day, around mid-morning New York time, the average bitcoin transaction fee spikes for up to an hour, then returns to normal. A recent paper claims that this is due to crypto derivative exchange BitMEX’s policy of transmitting thousands of transactions at once, at the same time every day. TAKEAWAY: Bitcoin transaction fees are not obligatory, but are usually estimated by wallet software according to the network congestion at the time. Users tend to accept whatever is proposed, since insisting on paying lower fees implies a potentially longer processing wait. What’s interesting here is that exchanges can influence the fees that users pay miners, even without being at all involved in the transaction.  Nearly 85% of bitcoin addresses are “in the money,” having accumulated their bitcoin at a lower average price than the current market price. TAKEAWAY: Some investors believe this implies potential selling pressure, as investors start to take profits.      Crypto data provider CryptoCompare has released its April 2020 Exchange Review, which shows that derivatives volumes fell by 25% over the month, while spot volumes were down only 13%. TAKEAWAY: Part of the derivatives decline may be the fallout from the March crash, as high-risk traders retreated to lick their wounds. BitMEX, traditionally the largest crypto derivatives exchange by volume and one of the protagonists behind the Black Thursday slump, has lost its throne, slipping to fourth place, behind Huobi, OKEx and Binance. It seems that network effects aren’t everything when it comes to market infrastructure totem poles.  Volumes on most derivative exchanges may be down (see above), but open interest on the CME is at an all-time high. TAKEAWAY: The CME’s volume is negligible in comparison to offshore exchanges such as OKEx and Binance, but it is the derivatives platform that regulated U.S.-based financial institutions must use. Renaissance Technologies recently disclosed that it was contemplating trading crypto derivatives on the CME; and Paul Tudor Jones' revelation earlier this week has led many to speculate he’s behind a large part of the open interest growth. Whoever is accumulating positions, the OI growth on the CME is a sign that institutions are coming back into the market after the risk-averse retreat following Black Thursday in March. And the fact that the OI growth is outstripping volume growth shows that these accumulators are not short-term traders.      The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance has launched a new interactive Bitcoin mining map, which visualizes the average monthly share of Bitcoin’s hashrate by country for the first time, and provides an exclusive visualisation of China’s hashrate distribution at the provincial level. TAKEAWAY: China has 65% of bitcoin hashrate. This is lower than in the past, and is likely to continue to shift as hardware technology advances and business models become more financialized. My colleague Christine Kim is hosting a talk on Monday, May 11 as part of our Crypto Long & Short show at Consensus: Distributed, in which she’ll be speaking to representatives from some of the large North American crypto mining groups that are emerging.      Digital Assets Research has produced a review of notable institutional interest in blockchain projects and crypto assets. TAKEAWAY: This was a fun read, I confess I’d lost sight of many of these projects. The report shows that, while the initial hype has been subdued under a barrage of delays and corporate shifts, there is still a significant amount of work going on in so many different areas of capital markets. Even if most of the projects do not end up in production, this will further our collective knowledge of the limitations and the potential.      Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade has granted a cryptocurrency mining license to Turkey-based iMiner, which plans to operate up to 6,000 mining rigs in the city of Semnan. TAKEAWAY: Without going into the utility of the potential use case in nations hit by sanctions and the punitive effect on individuals and businesses of a lack of dollars, one aspect investors should keep an eye on is broadening adoption. This is an example, and given Iran’s famously low average energy cost, could end up becoming a robust industry in the country. (Also, keep an eye out for Leigh Cuen's series looking at cryptocurrency adoption in emerging markets.)      Crypto exchange Bitfinex has launched a derivative (BTCDOM) that allows investors to take a position on bitcoin's overall share of the cryptocurrency market. TAKEAWAY: The relatively light oversight on some offshore exchanges allows for rapid creativity when it comes to crypto derivative products. Greater choice for investors and traders is not a bad thing, if the risks are identified and monitored.      Swiss fintech firm Amun has launched a daily inverse token, BTCSHORT (BTCS), which returns gains based on inverse price movements of bitcoin in a given 24-hour period. The product complements a recent bitcoin inverse exchange-traded product (ETP) released by Amun in January. TAKEAWAY: Hedging has long been a part of advanced crypto portfolios, the emergence of tokens such as these should make more sophisticated portfolio structures available to a wider audience, as they don’t require complicated margin provisioning, and they can be used for hedging but also as a speculation tool.      Eris Clearing, the clearing and settlement arm of crypto platform ErisX, has been granted a BitLicense from New York's Department of Financial Services. TAKEAWAY: Not an easy thing to get, given the procedural hurdles and the cost – since the requirement went into effect in 2015, fewer than 30 firms have been awarded the license. This places another institutional-grade exchange within reach of Wall Street firms (that aren’t based in New Jersey).",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/crypto-long-short-bitcoin-markets-are-growing-up-bitcoin-mining-is-too,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/579e9f1512b3b863c9563825d36058e64e1dd02a-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383637,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9xwQR,1589155260,"Bitcoin Dominance Is Making Investors Rich, Thanks to Crypto Hedge Funds","National economies are sinking into a recession but the bitcoin economy remains healthy and is still growing throughout the coronavirus crisis, even surging to $10,000 on May 7.      Crypto hedge funds, in particular, are reaping the benefits of volatility. For example, Eric Ervin, co-founder of Blockforce Capital in San Diego, said his fund’s returns are up 18% so far in 2020.      “In these wild months, we’re capturing half of the upside,” Ervin said, referring to the economic rollercoaster that took off in March. “Bitcoin’s really taken a lot of market share back from Ethereum … really dominated as Ethereum tries to figure itself out.”      It’s important to note bitcoin’s market dominance during a global crisis is a cause of correlation, not causation. The godfather cryptocurrency was already surging in 2019. According to the annual report released Monday by Elwood Asset Management and the consulting company PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the value of assets under management at crypto hedge funds more than doubled in 2019 to reach $2 billion.      According to PwC partner Henri Arslanian, co-author of the report that surveyed over 50 funds, more crypto hedge funds trade ether (ETH), 67%, than any type of crypto derivatives (56%), although bitcoin still reigned supreme in 2019 (97%).      Read more: Crypto M&A and Fundraising Dropped Sharply in 2019: PwC Report      Arslanian said the coronavirus crisis inspired more investors to adamantly ask how hedge fund managers reduce counterparty risks, for example, not leaving too much money on any single exchange. If these concerns are quelled, more investors appear eager to enter the market, he said.      ""One macro trend we’ve seen since the coronavirus is more general interest in cryptocurrencies,” Arslanian told CoinDesk in an interview.      The vast majority of these funds serve family offices and high-net-worth individuals, an average of 28 individuals per fund, suggesting the technology’s leading use case isn’t “financial inclusion” quite yet. (Many of these funds alone represent more global market share than the known peer-to-peer bitcoin trading volumes of some countries.)      This is why bitcoin appears to be correlated to traditional assets like stocks. When the same small groups own significant chunks of multiple markets, their behavior influences those markets in similar ways. Diversifying ownership is the only way to decorrelate an asset class. In the meantime, traders and investors are making a killing.      The PwC report found the percentage of crypto hedge funds with more than $20 million under management jumped up from 19% to 35% of surveyed funds – shocking growth considering the median starting point for these funds was $2 million.      “We’re starting to notice people are taking our calls a little bit more. There’s a little more interest,” Blockforce Capital’s Ervin said.    Volatility veterans    Plus, the market shocks in March didn’t feel like an emergency to veteran bitcoin traders.      Paul Veradittakit, co-founder of crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, agreed, saying his fund spent a lot of time so far in 2020 educating nervous investors.      “We wanted to make sure the investors knew what was going on in the market,” Veradittakit said. “We’re rebalancing a bit more into bitcoin to focus on what we think will be the rallying point for crypto during this time.”      Read more: ‘Black Thursday’ Distortion Makes Bitcoin Options Look Cheaper      Although the venture arm of Pantera is now focused on fewer startups and ensuring those investments have at least 18 months of runway, Veradittakit said overall 2020 has seen the fund’s largest amount of deployed capital to date. A few funds, including Scalar Capital and Polychain Capital, declined to offer comment on their updated strategies by press time.      “[Black Thursday] wasn’t that uncharacteristic of bitcoin, historically,” Ervin said, adding the same concept applies to ETH, which outperformed bitcoin in some previous years.      “[Big business] has embraced Ethereum, and that’s meaningful,” Ervin said. “There’s a significant amount of resources dedicated to Ethereum.”      That’s why the competition is more crowded than ever before. The PwC report tallied at least 150 active crypto hedge funds, more than 63% of which were launched in the past two years. All things considered, PwC’s Arslanian said he expects investors to learn about the market through institutions and eventually bring some of that trading activity in-house.      ""We’re in the early stages of the crypto hedge fund industry. The crypto hedge fund industry today is where the traditional hedge fund industry was in the 1990s,"" Arslanian said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/11/bitcoin-dominance-is-making-investors-rich-thanks-to-crypto-hedge-funds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d89a512e3a26f8f5a2834873fcb99d27fb4235ed-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
