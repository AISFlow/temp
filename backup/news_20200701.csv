42404832,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkn2F,1593635411,"Market Wrap: As Traditional Markets Rally, Bitcoin Gets Boring","Bitcoin broke above $9,250 for the first time since Friday as the leading cryptocurrency continues to trade in a tight range just above $9,000 for several weeks. But cryptocurrency markets have stayed quiet as traders expect a big move. Bitcoin was trading hands around $9,250 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET).    Bitcoin at $9,250 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), up 1.2% over 24 hours  BTC trading range (past 24 hours): $9,000-$9,300  Ether up 3% in trading, at around $232  Bitcoin 30-day volatility continues to drop  Decentralized exchange volume grows 70% in June    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, gained 3%, trading around $232 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), according to Bitstamp.      Despite trading above $9,250, bitcoin is still stuck within a tight range of a few hundred dollars above $9,000. As a result, 30-day volatility continues to decline. In fact, bitcoin’s volatility reached its lowest mark since Feb. 23, according to Coin Metrics.      As bitcoin stagnates, traditional markets soar. Tesla made an all-time high Wednesday, climbing $1,134, up more than 6% from its daily open. Zoom also bounced back toward its all-time high of $262 after dropping Friday through Monday, up 3.6% from its Wednesday open.      Why is bitcoin so quiet? There are simply “more eyeballs away from the crypto market and more towards traditional financial markets,” said Eliézer Ndinga, research associate at digital asset manager 21Shares. Many retail traders are using the popular retail equities trading platform Robinhood to speculate as traditional markets rally amid the on-going coronavirus pandemic.      “Despite various efforts to boost institutional adoption, retail traders account for 96% of all exchanges' transfers,” Ndinga added. For many of these traders, the stock market may be more interesting than cryptocurrency markets.      Despite retail investors’ temporarily waning interest, institutional investors continue to develop the cryptocurrency market’s infrastructure. New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) raised $190 million from 24 investors for a new bitcoin fund, CoinDesk reported Wednesday. The New York-based asset manager, which has held a New York BitLicense since 2018, raised $140 million in May for a similar investment vehicle, the Bitcoin Yield Enhancement Fund.      Meanwhile, loyal cryptocurrency traders are increasingly keen to use decentralized exchanges. In June, aggregate volumes for these platforms grew 70% to a record high of over $1.5 billion.      This rapid growth carries some security concerns, however. Decentralized finance analyst Jack Purdy told CoinDesk the spike in trading volumes on these nascent platforms is “starting to become a bit worrisome” due to the fact that a variety of complex attack vectors still exist.    Other markets  S&P 500 up 0.6% trading at $3,123  FTSE 100 down 0.1% after recovering from a 1.7% afternoon dip  Nikkei 225 down 1.25%  Gold down 0.7% trading at $1,770    Stablecoin markets showed strength as USDC’s total circulating supply passed 1 billion tokens. Tether, the largest stablecoin, grew to $10.3 billion, according to data from Messari.      Exchange tokens were mostly up Tuesday as the entire sector gained 2.4%, according to Messari. Some of the biggest gainers were kyber network (KNC) up 11.4% and binance coin (BNB) up 2.5%.

If the amendment is passed the GAO, a congressional watchdog agency, would have one year to report on how virtual currencies might be facilitating human- and drug-trafficking industries across online marketplaces.  The office would study how virtual currency acts as a vehicle for laundering illicit funds into the U.S. banking system, as well as what, if anything, the federal government is doing to stop it.  Whether the “immutability and traceability of virtual currencies” can help prosecute criminals would also be on GAO’s list of concerns.

42404827,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkmzI,1593626098,'I Failed Terribly at Keeping My Identity Secret': Scott Alexander on the Value of Pseudonymity,"What's in a name? The power to render someone mute.      Last week, Scott Alexander, the author of the influential rationalist blog Slate Star Codex (SSC), abruptly shut down (perhaps temporarily) his blog in advance of a New York Times (NYT) story on him and SSC that would include his real name. “Scott Alexander” is the pseudonym he has written under for years. As a practicing psychiatrist, he said, what amounts to “doxxing” him would damage his livelihood. In addition to professional repercussions, Alexander said in his final blog post explaining the situation that:      “..[S]ome people want to kill me or ruin my life, and I would prefer not to make it too easy. I’ve received various death threats. I had someone on an anti-psychiatry subreddit put out a bounty for any information that could take me down..”      The NYT decision was based on a strict ""real name"" policy, Alexander wrote.      The situation angered the blog’s fans, but also raises larger questions as to whether and when journalists should respect pseudonyms, who qualifies as a public figure and the impact reporting has on those who do not.      See also: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity: A Stand Against Doxxing      Perhaps the most recent high-profile example of this was in a Washington Post article describing what happened when a woman, not a public figure, showed up at a 2018 Halloween party thrown by a Washington Post cartoonist. She was dressed as journalist Megyn Kelly, but in blackface. When the woman told her employer about the upcoming article, she was fired. The decision to even proceed with an article, much less publish it, was controversial. People questioned the news value, including current and former Washington Post journalists, according to Ben Smith’s reporting in the New York Times.      Back to Scott Alexander: His post prompted CoinDesk Executive Editor Marc Hochstein to make our editorial policy clear: We will respect pseudonymity.      As Hochstein writes, “We will respect the identity that has a reputation in our community unless there is an overwhelming public interest in unmasking it”.      Following that post, CoinDesk’s Alyssa Hertig published an article on the many members of the cryptocurrency community who use pseudonyms, and use them for good reason. Engineer Kee Hinckley, one of those Hertig interviewed, put it best:      “Here lies the huge irony in this discussion. Persistent pseudonyms aren’t ways to hide who you are. They provide a way to be who you are. You can finally talk about what you really believe; your real politics, your real problems, your real sexuality, your real family, your real self.”      See also: Many Bitcoin Developers Are Choosing to Use Pseudonyms – For Good Reason      I spoke with Scott Alexander via email about his experience, when it might be appropriate to unmask somebody, and whether writing under a pseudonym allowed him to explore ideas in more depth and candor. We respected his pseudonym.      Give me some background on Slate Star Codex, and why you started it?      I started Slate Star Codex seven years ago. I previously had another blog under my real name, but I had a few bad job interviews where the interviewers hinted that I might not get the job because I was blogging. So I decided to delete it and start over with an anonymous blog.      What advice would you give to people writing on the internet today about operational security? How do you keep your identity private while also sharing your writing and thoughts?      I failed terribly at keeping my identity secret, because everyone who read my last blog knew I was the same person writing the new one. I survived this long because most people had goodwill and never translated this tacit knowledge into Google-able results.      Are there circumstances under which you believe it would be appropriate to unmask an online persona?      This is a tough question, but I place it in the same realm as other tough questions like, ""Are there times when violence is appropriate?"" or ""Are there times when the government should suppress speech?"" There might be, but it needs a higher burden of proof than just ""I don't like this person.""      Have you heard from the NYT since the conversation with [reporter] Cade [Metz] described in the farewell post?      No, but I know Cade is still interviewing people for the article, which I take to mean he's still expecting to publish it.      How do you respond to the people who say, ""Your real name is already out there""? I know the blog post addresses it but it'd be helpful for you to lay out for our audience.      There are a lot of people who have had naked pictures of them leaked online who would still be entirely justified not wanting those pictures in the New York Times. I admit my security has been bad. But so far most people who google my real name don't find my blog. People who do the opposite can find my real name with a little Internet savviness and a minute or two, and maybe the extra difficulty just makes me feel more secure without really keeping me any safer. But that extra feeling of security is still important to me.      How has the ability to write under a pseudonym influenced your writing? Has it allowed you to explore ideas in more depth or candor?      I think so. In particular, I've written some frank things about psychiatry and about my experience in psychiatric residency that I wouldn't have written if I knew my residency director could google my name and find it.      You're known for enjoying pushing the Overton Window and questioning the wisdom of the mainstream. Some argue this leads some marginal folks to dangerous places or gives them permission to dig deeper into the internet's darker corners. Is that a fair critique or how do you conceptualize/consider that portion of your audience? On the other hand, could you share some experiences of readers who were positively influenced by your work, such as how you've encouraged people to engage in Effective Altruism?      I try to avoid edginess for edginess' sake, but sometimes I genuinely believe people are wrong about something. A couple of those times, time has proven me right. In general, I'm nervous about demanding people consider the effect their writing could have on the worst possible reader. I'm remembering someone who warned me that talking too much about the negatives of AI could lead people to assassinate AI researchers. By those standards, you can never talk about the negatives of anything. I think the duty of a writer is to tell the truth as they understand it, while being appropriately careful, and trying to urge consideration and multilateral action instead of violence. If you try any harder than that to optimize for having the exact right effect on terrible people, you're writing propaganda.      Did you see an opportunity here to ""Streisand Effect"" your blog? I believe you have said in the past that traffic is down but that you'd also like to pivot out from your day job and do SSC-style work full time. So is there any fairness to a cynical view of your blog takedown as a way to relight the spark in the SSC community?      No, I didn't do this, and would lose respect for anyone who did. I'm not sure what kind of evidence you want me to give. But if you want, you can confirm with Cade that I begged him, at great length, many times, over the course of days, not to use my real name in the article. I gave him a warning that I would delete the blog if he used my real name, in order to pressure him to reconsider, and I only deleted the blog after he refused.      ""We do not comment on what we may or may not publish in the future,"" said Danielle Rhoades Ha, vice president of Communications at the New York Times, in a statement sent to CoinDesk.

42404819,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkmrQ,1593623722,"US Appeals Court Allows Warrantless Search of Blockchain, Exchange Data","A federal appeals court on Tuesday affirmed a lower court’s denial of a motion to suppress evidence in a case that hinged on whether the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects Bitcoin blockchain records from warrantless search and seizure.    The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans rejected defendant Richard Gratkowski’s claims his blockchain and Coinbase-held bitcoin transaction records could not be used as evidence against him. Gratkowski, who was convicted and sentenced last year on child pornography charges, had paid for the material in bitcoin.  Gratkowski based his motion to suppress that evidence on the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. He argued the government had violated his reasonable expectation of privacy in analyzing his Coinbase and on-chain transactions because it was done without a warrant.  But the court effectively found that agents did not need a warrant to search those records. The court said the public nature of bitcoin's permissionless blockchain undercuts any user's claims to a reasonable expectation of privacy.  “Granted, they enjoy a greater degree of privacy than those who use other money-transfer means, but it is well known that each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a publicly available blockchain,” the Fifth Circuit held.  The court was skeptical of Gratkowski's claims to privacy for his Coinbase records. He had compared those records to protected cell phone metadata, but the court said Gratkowski's Coinbase records (and the blockchain records) are ""more akin to bank records,"" which are not protected under the Fourth Amendment.  “Coinbase deals with virtual currency while traditional banks deal with physical currency. But both are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act as regulated financial institutions,” the Fifth Circuit held.  That's because of the ""third-party doctrine,"" said Drew Hinkes, a lawyer with Carlton Fields.  ""If a person voluntarily gives information to a third party, makes no effort to protect that information and the third party has a legitimate reason to retain that information” then the party providing that information has no legitimate expectation of privacy over that information, and that information may be obtained from that third party without a warrant, said Hinkes.

42404828,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkn0H,1593622910,"Decentralized Exchange Volumes Up 70% in June, Pass $1.5B","June trading volume on decentralized exchanges set a record high of $1.52 billion, up 70% from May, according to data from Dune Analytics. This double-digit percentage growth is simply “the continuation of a trend dating back to the end of [2019],” Jack Purdy, decentralized finance analyst at Messari, told CoinDesk.      Curve and Uniswap control the largest amount of traded volume, recording $350 million and $446 million, respectively, in June. Both protocols are automated market makers that can also function as decentralized exchanges. Balancer, a similar platform, recorded $93 million in traded volume, up 2,460% from $3.6 million in May.      Significant growth can be partially attributed to the “proliferation of automated market makers,” according to Purdy. As a result, these markets offer greater liquidity for “the tail end of crypto assets” and even occasionally less order slippage than centralized exchanges, Purdy said.      In June, automated market makers grew by more than 170% while pure decentralized exchange platforms grew by only 10%.      Too much growth too quickly could be cause for concern, however, as decentralized exchanges still need time for continued development and stress testing. Recent increases in trading volume are “starting to become a bit worrisome,” Purdy said, adding that an “unnatural rush to deposit assets” into these exchanges is fueled, in part, by the “liquidity mining phenomenon.”      Since January, aggregate decentralized exchange volumes, including automated market makers, have more than quadrupled from $276 million to $1.52 billion.      See also: Bitcoin’s Mining Difficulty Has Rarely Been This Static in a Decade      Even though popular decentralized finance protocols may be “highly audited and deemed safe,” plenty of potential attack vectors still exist, Purdy said.

42404817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkmqR,1593620846,The New US-Mexico-Canada Trade Pact Holds Opportunity for Distributed Tech,"James Cooper is a professor of law at California Western School of Law in San Diego where he teaches International Business Transactions and International Law. He has consulted for Los Pinos, Mexico’s executive branch, and the U.S. Department of State.      The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) goes into force today. The trade pact replaces the much-maligned North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which went into effect on Jan. 1, 1994 and laid the foundation for a vertically integrated marketplace on our continent. By reducing tariffs on many goods and services, North American companies were able to develop transnational vertical supply chains and better compete in the global marketplace.      Negotiated as the European Union was being formed and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum was starting, NAFTA successfully integrated the U.S. economy with two hemispheric partner countries and created economies of scale. There was some social dislocation and trade distortion as not all boats rose with the higher tide. But the pact succeeded in creating a North American marketplace, only for Donald J. Trump to campaign on withdrawing from the pact, calling it a “the worst trade deal ever made.”      See also: UK Trade Negotiators Eye Blockchain Provisions in Coming US Trade Talks      Enter the USMCA, which provides opportunities for blockchain technology to be deployed and showcased for use cases and eventual scalability.      Before the advent of COVID-19, some $1.4 billion worth of goods crossed the U.S.-Mexico border every day. In 2018, 80% of Mexico’s exports went to the United States. Freight forwarders, customs brokers and international finance agents will greatly benefit from making their arrangements via smart contracts. There will be less need for expensive transnational litigation, investor-state dispute settlement procedures or even private commercial arbitration if transactions are placed on the blockchain, ready for instant enforcement.      Also, the USMCA provides for the harmonization of standards across all three partner countries concerning the sharing of consumer data and prohibits all three nations from discriminating against foreign fintech companies and ensuring national treatment across the free trade area.      The biggest opportunity for blockchain technology is in origin provision rules the USMCA requires of automobile production. Under NAFTA, 62.5% of a car had to be built within North America to qualify for preferential tariff treatment. But under the USMCA, 75% of a car must be made in the free trade area. U.S., Canadian and Mexican suppliers need to verify and validate the source of the products they use – a perfect place for blockchain technology to be deployed.    U.S., Canadian and Mexican suppliers need to verify and validate the source of the products they use – a perfect place for blockchain technology to be deployed.    Distributed ledgers can assist sales departments in completing the arduous paperwork for rules of origin certifications, be they under USMCA or any other bilateral (U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement) or multilateral free trade U.S.-Central America Agreement (CAFTA) agreements. This will make the inspections by U.S. and Border Protection (CBP) authorities that much more fluid. CBP is also working with advanced digital technologies, having piloted a blockchain solution to verify certificates of origin on important goods under NAFTA and CAFTA.    The remittance market also stands to benefit by integrating blockchain technology. It is quite a market: In February, the Central Bank of Mexico confirmedhttps://www.americanexpress.com/us/foreign-exchange/articles/blockchain-based-mobile-payments-boost-international-remittances/ that Mexican migrants working overseas sent home a record high $36 billion in remittances in 2019, a 7% increase from 2018. There is huge value in reducing costs of more expensive money transfer and money order services. There are some companies trying to scale up; now that the USMCA is going into force, this sector is ripe for blockchain development. The CEO of Bitso, a Mexican cryptocurrency exchange, saidhttps://www.entrepreneur.com/article/343125 some 5% of remittances sent from the United States to Mexico were processed in cryptocurrencies last year.    See also: Michael Sung - China’s National Blockchain Will Change the World      While much else in the USMCA is like the previous trade deal, there are some improvements on intellectual property. NAFTA was the first trade agreement in the world to include intellectual property rights protection within its provisions, and Mexico had to change its laws to abide by the trade pact’s more onerous details. Likewise, the USMCA forces many changes in Mexican law to protect U.S. rights holders south of the border. The USMCA extends the terms of copyright to 70 years after the life of the author, an increase from the previous 50-year term, and provides for a more robust regional digital economy by prohibiting duties on music and electronic books and protecting Internet companies so they are not liable for content that their users produce.      No wonder President Trump touted the USMCA as a great success during his last State of the Union Address. The reality is not so stark: Non-partisan watchdogs have concluded it will take years for U.S. workers and companies to truly gain from the new trade pact. The government’s own United States International Trade Commission reported the USMCA would create minimal economic gains for the United States in the near term. By the sixth year of the new agreement, the USITC predicts a rise in Gross Domestic Product of only $62.8 billion, or 0.35%.      This means that apart from some gains in digital trade and biologics, it may be a net wash compared to the old agreement. Bilateral trade under NAFTA has expanded over 600 percent since 1994, so continuing growth of any kind is a good thing, especially in this era of beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies. NAFTA has grown to a more than $20 trillion a year regional market over the last quarter century – no small feat. By taking advantage of the efficiencies of blockchain technology, the economies of all three countries under the USMCA can only grow and consumers in North America enjoy the benefits.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,James Cooper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/01/the-new-us-mexico-canada-trade-pact-holds-opportunity-for-distributed-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1165e4e5a59ca1af7b794fb117d9bc3c5d841598-1295x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Techemy plans to roll it out next week, and the yield farming feature is to come later in the year; neither is available yet. The article has also been updated to include additional details.      New Zealand-based investment firm Techemy Capital is preparing to launch a Compound investment portfolio, which would be comprised of proxies of stablecoins dai and USDC.    The product, slated for launch next week, would allow holders to earn interest on decentralized lender Compound and, eventually, gain exposure to ""yield farming.""  The portfolio would begin to ""yield farm"" – borrow against itself to release free COMP tokens on users' behalf, later this year  Yield farming has turned into such a feeding frenzy that Compound changed the distribution model Tuesday to stop traders from gaming the system.  At press time, COMP tokens traded at $214 after peaking at $350 just over a week ago, according to CoinGecko.  Ahead of the Compound vehicle, Techemy already launched bitcoin- and ether-based investment portfolios.  All three portfolios are built on Ethereum and are self-custodial, only available to accredited investors.  Fran Strajnar, Techemy Capital's executive chairman, told CoinDesk: ""These initial products can maybe be viewed as a 'mini ETF' for now.""  Techemy's proprietary trading desk will actively manage the bitcoin and ether portfolios.  Strajnar said Techemy was working with Japanese banks and asset managers to roll out a fully-fledged ETFs sometime in Q1 2021.  Nexus Mutual is offering optional insurance against smart contract failure to investors in the portfolios, which are hosted on the TokenSets platform.  Nexus' business has been mushrooming lately, and it paid its first claim, demonstrating its wherewithal as an insurer against smart contract failures.

42404820,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdkmsP,1593619817,Cryptography Startup Brings Private Payment Channels to Tezos Blockchain,"Cryptography firm Bolt Labs has launched a private payment solution, zkChannels, on Tezos.      The startup is now working with Tezos developer groups Nomadic Labs and Metastate to implement the tech in the next network update.      Similar to the Lightning Network, zkChannels is a payment channel for blockchains but with zero-knowledge proofs attached. A current problem with Lightning – a payment solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain – is that in certain settings, you can see other people’s de facto bank accounts, called funding channels. zkChannel hides that information from merchants.      “zkChannels is a chain-agnostic anonymous off-chain protocol that enables cheap and private value transfer between a customer and merchant,” Bolt Labs said in a blog post.      Lightning developers are working on similar concepts through different means with projects such as multi-part payments.    Bolt Labs    Bolt Labs was founded in 2018 by J. Ayo Akinyele with Zcash co-founders Ian Miers and Matthew Green. The privacy project raised $1.5 million in an April 2019 seed round joined by Lemniscap, Xpring and others in addition to numerous angel investors such as Zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox.      Read more: Bolt Labs Raises $1.5 Million Seed Round to Boost Lightning Privacy      Akinyele said the team built on top of Tezos to act as a testing ground of sorts for other blockchains.      According to the firm’s announcement post:    We are also interested in building a cross-chain bridge via zkChannels for connecting Zcash or Bitcoin to Tezos, and provides censorship-resistance to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.  Why Tezos?    Tezos raised $232 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), marketing itself as the “self-amending” ledger. That means the blockchain can conduct periodic code updates due to its hands-on governance procedures. For example, academic work detailing a possible selfish mining scheme led to a code patch mere weeks after the paper’s publication.      zkChannels is Bolt Labs’ first account-model implementation of its tech, Akinyele told CoinDesk. (Blockchains come in two flavors: the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model used by Bitcoin and the account model employed by Ethereum.) The firm also has private channel implementations for both Bitcoin and Zcash, with the latter still in development.      Read more: Why Harvard Research on a Low-Profit Tezos Attack Matters for Proof-of-Stake      The use of a payment channel on a blockchain that barely breaks $100 in average daily fees – compared to the hundreds of thousands of dollars processed by Bitcoin and Ethereum daily – seems questionable.      Indeed, as CoinDesk reported, 76% of Tezos transactions can be tied back to network validation, called “Baking,” or a coin “faucet” that spouts free XTZ.      Akinyele said Bolt Labs built zkChannels on Tezos over other candidates due to the blockchain’s malleable governance. Moreover, zkChannels is easier to implement on a more “pairing friendly” curve called BLS12-381 that Tezos is currently adding. Ethereum operates on another older elliptic curve model and will not support BLS until a network overhaul called Eth 2.0 is completed.      “We’re looking at the fact that Tezos is a new blockchain, but that has a lot of promise based on the building blocks it’s making available to developers,” Akinyele said.",POSITIVE,XTZ,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | XTZ | ZEC | TOKEN SALE,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/01/cryptography-startup-brings-private-payment-channels-to-tezos-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2f6731511c468648ae94fe05f6331efb1318c2f-1500x1071.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, the Bitcoin network experienced its lowest difficulty adjustment in 10 years, clocking a negligible change in mining difficulty today, while a novel legal strategy is bringing an initial coin offering project to court. Here's the story:      You’re reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they’re significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.    Top shelf    Breaking Down DeFi Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are growing due to a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity. “Compound sparked the beginning of a new agricultural revolution where so-called yield farmers are siphoning volume through [automated market makers] instead of centralized exchanges. This isn’t ideological behavior – it’s the same CeFi users now shifting to DeFi because it’s more efficient and profit-maximizing,” said Ben Forman of Parafi Capital. That's as the daily distribution of the Compound protocol’s COMP governance token is set to change, following a vote on a new proposal. The 2,880 COMP distributed to users every day will now be based on the dollar value of assets they have put in or borrowed from the system. Finally, DeFi protocol bXz announced a proposal to update its governance token, which would enable users to participate in the yield farming trend.

Meanwhile, Curv, a crypto security firm, has closed a $23 million Series A funding round from CommerzVentures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent), among others.      Ethereum & Bitcoin Non-Developments Ethereum Core developers decided Friday to postpone work on the protocol’s next hard fork, Berlin, until at least August in an effort to let people transition off Geth, a client or programming language used by an overwhelming majority of Ethereum coders. Elsewhere, Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin said ZK-rollups may become “the dominant scaling paradigm for at least a couple of years,” or the main method by which Ethereum processes transactions, while developers work on building Eth 2.0, Decrypt reports. Finally, the Bitcoin network barely adjusted its difficulty level down 0.0033%, a percentage change small enough that it rounds down to zero. The negligible adjustment might be tied to the lack of new mining devices plugging in or any newly added computing power being offset by those that are squeezed out after Bitcoin’s halving.      Legal Precedents? 20,000 claimants are pursuing a class-action lawsuit against the micro-mobility platform Helbiz, after the company’s 2018 ICO.

42383993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zzeV,1593608722,Coinbase Ventures Joins $23M Funding Round for Crypto Custody Firm,"Curv, a company that provides increased secrecy when it comes to holding crypto assets, has closed a $23 million Series A funding round.      Announced Wednesday, the crypto custody tech provider, which uses a technique called multi-party computation (MPC), received investment from CommerzVentures, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (DCG), Team8 and Digital Garage Lab Fund.      Curv closed a $6.5 million seed round in February of last year, which makes the total raised so far almost $30 million. Backing from the likes of CommerzVentures (the venture arm of German banking powerhouse Commerzbank and the main investor in the Series A) and Coinbase Ventures suggests MPC is popular with both the traditional and crypto space.      “We are now one of the highest-funded custody technology companies, and have the largest funding to date for MPC,” said Curv CEO Itay Malinger. “It’s a strong signal that the market is looking at MPC, and that there’s still a lot of innovation to be made in the custody and security space.”      Read more: Custody Startup Curv Follows Crypto Demand Into Asia With New Hong Kong Office      Stepping back, blockchains are based on public key infrastructure (PKI), which means your identity is determined by a set of digits called a public key that allows you to receive funds. That public key is a mathematical function of another set of digits, a private key, which must be known in order to send funds.      Instead of a single private key, MPC involves several parties each with different strings of numbers that interact using a protocol. The process creates a public key to receive funds, and a way to sign transactions in order to send funds. This latter part is kept distributed and separate at all times.      “There is not any point in time or space where there will actually be a private key,” said Malinger. “MPC breaks that paradigm, so you don’t have additional layers of security like guards or cameras or World War II bunkers that can take 24 hours to get at.”      Curv is not alone in employing MPC. Other firms specializing in digital asset custody and using some form of the technology include GK8 out of Israel and Libra Association member Anchorage.      Malinger pointed out some other MPC custody firms in the market make use of hardware security modules (HSMs), while Curv would rather trust mathematics.      “Our approach is that trusting math is better than trusting an engineered piece of hardware,” Malinger said. “Math is the foundation of cryptography; hardware is an engineering effort, not a mathematical effort.”    Two models    Onerous service level agreements (SLAs) that come with some cold storage solutions may not be ideal for the fast-paced trading world. Curv has two models, explained Malinger, one in which the MPC secrets are online, and one where they are offline. This means the customer can decide how difficult it should be to move assets around.      “You can say there must be 15 employees to approve a transaction, or you can say I want this hot wallet machine to approve transactions of up to $10,000. So you get much more flexibility and the ability to dictate how difficult it should be to move assets around,” Malinger said.      New York-based Curv, which has about 30 staff and an office in Tel Aviv, said the funding will partly go towards tX, an elite group of cryptographers and engineers who will use Curv’s keyless technology to push international growth.      Read more: Munich Re Insures Curv’s Crypto Wallet To the Tune of $50 Million      “Few areas within fintech are as exciting as digital assets. Tokens and coins are increasingly finding their way into asset managers’ books,” CommerzVentures managing partner Stefan Tirtey said in a statement. “Curv is unlocking this market with [its] industry-leading technology and we are happy and excited to partner with Itay, Dan [Yadlin] and their impressive team.”      Existing Curv customers include investment firm Franklin Templeton, trading platform eToro and Genesis Trading, owned by CoinDesk parent DCG. Asked if Coinbase might be the next exchange to start using Curv’s MPC tech, Malinger politely declined to comment.      “We are speaking to exchanges, and are also in advanced conversations with players on Wall Street and across the globe,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/01/coinbase-ventures-joins-23m-funding-round-for-crypto-custody-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1772c90207016927b253e30561f4afefe7ee8406-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The CRO token's gains made it the top performer during the month among digital assets with a market value of at least $1 billion, according to the data provider Messari.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      The second-best performer, Unus Sed Leo (LEO), rose 6.4% in June, followed by Chainlink (LINK) with a 4.6% price increase. The worst performer was bitcoin SV (BSV), which tumbled 21%.      Crypto.com has raised its profile partly through a ""tremendous wave of marketing over the past several months,"" John Todaro, head of currency research at the digital-asset firm TradeBlock, told First Mover in an email.      Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value, fell 10% during the month, shaving its year-to-date return to 27%, as price volatility narrowed amid ongoing uncertainty about the future of the coronavirus and related stimulus packages.      Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, slid 9.3%, while XRP from Ripple lost 17%.      For the second quarter of 2020, bitcoin rose 42%, more than double the 18% gain during the period for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was the stock index's best performance in more than three decades.      Hong Kong-based Crypto.com raised $26.7 million in 2017 through a sale of its MCO tokens, which are paid out as rewards to credit-card customers.    The CRO tokens, airdropped to MCO holders starting in December 2018https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/2543259-cro-airdrop-initial-distribution and now traded on more than 20 exchanges, can be used for ""cross-asset intermediary currency settlement for the native Crypto.com Chain,"" according to the company's website.    Of course, smaller digital assets like CRO can be volatile. The token has a market capitalization of $2.2 billion, compared with bitcoin's $169 billion and ethereum's $25 billion, according to Messari.      Crypto.com press officials didn't comment for this story.      Headed by CEO Kris Marszalek, the company launched a beta version of its own cryptocurrency exchange in November, following the shipping of the MCO Visa cards earlier in 2019. Crypto.com announced in May 2020 that it had started shipping credit cards in Europe.      The company also has a payments app and cryptocurrency wallet (launched last month), and customers can earn interest-like rewards by staking bitcoin and other digital assets on its platform.      ""The company has aggressively pursued various lines of business which have attracted users, which then bleeds into its token,"" Todaro wrote.      Last month, Crypto.com sponsored a portion of CoinDesk's Consensus 2020 virtual conference. And on Tuesday, the company's website was advertising a ""BTC Anniversary Special,"" featuring bitcoin ""at 50% off, with $2 million allocation!"" (The promotion was due to end early Wednesday.)      Earlier in June, the company announced it had obtained its own emoji on Twitter, which appears automatically when the #CRO hashtag is inserted into a tweet. The publication CoinTelegraph noted at the time that such branded hashtag services have reportedly cost upwards of $1 million.      ""The official Twitter handle does frequent giveaways, which draws in more followers and retail traders of its token,"" Todaro said.

42384000,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zznJ,1593604845,'Money Printer Go Brrr' Is How the Dollar Retains Reserve Status,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      Fiat currency always fails. The Federal Reserve’s ever-increasing balance sheet is a sign we are in the end times for the U.S. dollar. Eventually, all that money printing will cause runaway inflation. The dollar will go up in flames, and with it, the U.S. economy.      I have heard this line of argument many times over the last decade. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, it was usually advanced by people who wanted the return of the gold standard – “goldbugs,” as they are often known. More recently, Bitcoin hardliners have joined the chorus. Now, in these extraordinary times, even some conventional money managers are predicting hyperinflation. “Money printer go brrr,” they say, and mutter about wheelbarrows and currency wars.      See also: Frances Coppola - How to Get Money to People in an Emergency, Fast      Are they right? Is the Fed’s enormous money creation going to cause runaway inflation and the loss of the dollar’s reserve currency status?      When the monetary base mainly consists of physical currency, a massive expansion of it can indeed cause runaway inflation. Weimer’s wheelbarrows contained banknotes. And they went to ordinary citizens, not into the vaults of banks.      But the Fed’s QE doesn’t increase physical currency. It inflates bank reserves. Some argue that banks will eventually have to “lend out” these reserves, and that this will cause high inflation. But so far, the evidence is that banks don’t “lend out” the money thrown at them by the Fed. For 10 years now, the problem has been too little bank lending, not too much. Small businesses, particularly, have suffered a lending drought.    So let the Fed continue pouring dollars into international financial markets. That’s how to ensure that the dollar remains king    The idea that expanding bank reserves will cause high inflation comes from a mistaken understanding of how fractional reserve banking works. The conventional view of bank lending, as described in a thousand economic textbooks, is that when banks receive a deposit, they keep 10% of it “in reserve” and “lend out” the rest. But the reality, as described in this paper from the Bank of England, is that banks create both loans and deposits through the act of lending. They don’t “lend out” either deposits or reserves.      Until recently, U.S. banks were required to hold reserves equating to 10% of their eligible deposits – reserves, in this case, meaning money they keep on deposit at the Fed. This reserve requirement was intended to ensure they always had enough ready cash to meet customer demand for deposit withdrawals. Of course, banks could always hold more reserves than their statutory requirement. And since, collectively, banks must hold all bank reserves issued by the Fed, they have done so ever since the Fed started doing QE.      But since banks don’t “lend out” reserves, giving banks more reserves doesn’t force banks to lend. Indeed, since the Fed pays banks to hold reserves in excess of their reserve requirement, it could be argued that having too many reserves in the system actually discourages banks from lending. And since nearly all money circulating on Main Street is created by banks when they lend, if banks don’t want to lend, there is no possibility of inflation. If anything, inflation will fall – as indeed we have seen since 2008:      Those who thought the Fed’s expansion of the monetary base would cause runaway inflation because banks would lend out the money have been proved wrong. So now there’s a different argument doing the rounds. Instead of runaway bank lending and consumer price inflation, Fed intervention is manipulating markets and driving up asset prices in an unsustainable way. Asset price rises are the new hyperinflation.      Here, for example, is investment writer Preston Pysh explaining why expansion of the dollar monetary base from $0.8 trillion to $7.1 trillion since 2008 hasn’t caused price inflation:    Why haven't we seen CPI ""inflation""? Easy, because they buy financial assets with that freshly printed money. Bonds are purchased off the open market and freshly printed cash is supplied into the ""free and open economy"". The problem - the money goes straight into the hands of the people holding assets & only a trickle comes down into the lower income sections of the economy where a majority of the population (percentage-wise) exists. As the wealthy portion of the population continues to benefit from this process of inserting freshly printed cash into the system, their net worth continues to grow & they get first access to allocate the capital to even more advantageous assets that make more money. This is NOT free and open. This is manipulated. You won't find CPI inflation because the freshly printed money is nesting itself into financial assets by bidding the market capitalization higher and higher.    Sadly, this is not true. Here’s the S&P 500 charted against bank reserves since 2008:      Stock prices did indeed rise while the Fed was doing QE. But they rose even faster from 2016 onwards, even though the Fed had stopped doing QE and (from 2018) was actually reducing the monetary base. Currently, of course, both the monetary base and stock prices are rising.      Is one causing the other? It’s hard to say. But there isn’t much evidence that the expansion of the monetary base since 2008 has inflated asset prices in the way that Pysh claims.      Pysh goes on to argue that because asset price inflation raises inequality, it distorts consumer prices:    When years and decades of a deeply manipulated inflationary fiat money expansion has occurred, it actually creates deflationary prices for some goods and services. Remember, the newly printed money is bidding asset prices, this means the gap between wealthy and poor will expand. If a majority of the population can't afford goods and services (because the percentage of poor are becoming larger each day), then the demand for goods and services go down. If demand for goods and services go down, the price must follow it. But the opposite is true for good and services that are absolute essentials to life. I.e. Health care, Food, Education…. So, we are seeing price deflation of non-essential goods and services. We are seeing price inflation of essential goods and services. We are seeing hyperish inflation of bonds and stocks due to the government unapologetically manipulating those markets.    He goes on to argue the absence of CPI inflation is because people are getting poorer, so can’t afford consumer goods. And he then alleges that the U.S. government is now giving money directly to people to stave off civil unrest.      I agree the U.S. has a huge inequality problem, and this is fueling recent episodes of civil unrest. But it’s a bit of a stretch to blame it all on Fed money creation. Do U.S. government policies that benefit the rich at the expense of ordinary people count for nothing?      For me, the most convincing explanation for the mysterious absence of inflation since 2008 lies not in U.S. inequality, but beyond U.S. shores. Here’s the U.S. dollar’s trade-weighted exchange rate since 2008:      Note that this measure started to rise even while the Fed was doing QE, and rose considerably more since the Fed stopped. Far from the world rejecting the dollar after the financial crisis, the dollar has actually become even more dominant. And the exchange rate spike in 2020 is caused by international flight to the dollar, just as in 2008. The dollar is still the world’s “safe haven” asset of choice.      See also: What Happens When Currencies Fail? Feat. Preston Pysh      The rising dollar exchange rate suggests the Fed’s monetary expansion has been insufficient to slake international thirst for dollars. The world wants more dollars. Lots more. The only obstacle to their creation is the fears of Americans who do not understand just how many dollars the world needs to keep trade flowing.      It is, of course, possible some stupid action by the U.S. government, such as returning to a strict gold standard, might force the world off its de facto dollar standard. But until that day dawns, fears of hyperinflation and the loss of dollar dominance are massively overblown.      So let the Fed continue pouring dollars into international financial markets. That’s how to ensure the dollar remains king, and the U.S. economy remains the richest in the world.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/01/money-printer-go-brrr-is-how-the-dollar-retains-reserve-status,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/619d7483963b2df850d4cd577900783689e6de6f-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Bitcoin network adjusted its difficulty level at 01:18 UTC on July 1 to 15.7842 trillion – down a mere 0.0033% from the previous level of 15.7847 trillion set June 17. The percentage change is small enough that it is rounded up to a zero, data from BTC.com shows.      Bitcoin mining difficulty measures how hard it is to compete for block rewards on the network. The measure is designed to adjust every 2,016 blocks, roughly every two weeks, based on the total computing power that's participating in the mining game.      The negligible adjustment on Wednesday means the total average computing power connected to Bitcoin over the past 14 days has barely changed, either due to the lack of new mining devices plugging in or any newly added computing power being offset by those that are squeezed out after Bitcoin's halving.      Historically, difficulty remaining steady at the initial level of 1 for a year after the genesis block was mined, before starting to rise in early 2010. The last time the measure posted a 0% change was in March 2010.      Since then, there have been only eight instances where the difficulty change, both negative and positive, was below 0.1%, with today's being the smallest adjustment.

The latest difficulty adjustment also comes amid recent news of shipment issues regarding the latest equipment from major bitcoin miner manufacturers.      An internal power struggle between the two co-founders at Beijing-based Bitmain, the world's largest bitcoin miner maker, has affected the company's shipment logistics as well as its mining chip supply chain.

42383984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zzUR,1593590407,Swiss Government Makes Moves to Encourage Crypto Businesses,"The Swiss government is encouraging blockchain startups to set up shop with new laws that lower legal barriers to such businesses while leaving favorable tax laws untouched.      The National Council, Switzerland’s equivalent of the U.S. House of Representatives, unanimously passed a legislative package changing about a dozen financial laws on June 17. The changes, proposed by the Swiss Federal Council, are intended to remove legal barriers to applications of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.      On June 19, the Federal Council acknowledged a report prepared by the Federal Department of Finance that concluded there was no need to make special amendments to existing tax laws with regard to blockchain. The report was commissioned by the Federal Council in 2018 when the government decided to examine existing tax laws and assess any need for amendments.      Switzerland has long been a blockchain startup magnet. The city of Zug, in particular, was a popular location for token-funded projects during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017, earning it the nickname Crypto Valley.      While ICOs have faded, Switzerland’s enthusiasm for blockchain technology has not.      “It’s known that Switzerland is very much trying to encourage blockchain business. It’s a political objective,” said Rolf H. Weber, professor of financial market law and chair of the working group for regulatory issues at the Swiss Blockchain Federation.      The changes were largely based on a Federal Council proposal filed last year, and will now be passed on to the upper chamber, the Council of States, for a final vote this fall.      Through communications specialist Joel Weibel, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration said Swiss laws must guarantee legal certainty and the openness of authorities to new technologies.    The new laws    As it exists now, Swiss law is cumbersome, particularly when applied to the transfer of security tokens, Weber said. All transfers must be done in writing, like the traditional exchange of a bond. But the new legislation will make the transfer of security tokens easier, Weber said.      “In my opinion, the most important changes are in company and securities law,” Weber said.      Unlike any digital asset before it, a token has the same characteristics of a piece of paper, or written agreement, said Christian Meisser, CEO of Swiss blockchain legal consultancy fim LEXR AG.      “Why not give it the same properties as a piece of paper? If you transfer a token, you also transfer any right of ownership linked to it. That is the revolutionary aspect of the new Swiss law,” Meisser said.      According to Weber, as soon as the law is enacted, owners will be able to freely register and transfer their security tokens within distributed electronic ledgers, and providers of ledger technology will be allowed to offer those services without legal ramifications.      New provisions made to bankruptcy laws would allow owners to appeal to authorities to reclaim their assets.      “This is not possible today with digital tokens because with tokens you don't have proof of ownership. It’s similar to cash. You can never extract or withdraw cash from a bankrupt estate,” Weber said.      The new laws also contain eight provisions describing how providers of digital ledger technology and trading platforms can obtain a license from the financial authority.      Even though the legislative package passed without opposition, according to Meisser, left-leaning politicians raised concerns the new laws failed to address the environmental impact of bitcoin mining, a process that requires large quantities of energy and resources.    The broader framework    Instead of proactively regulating new financial instruments, lawmakers in Switzerland typically try first to apply existing laws, said Luzius Meisser, founder of Bitcoin Association Switzerland      “Once that doesn't work anymore, then we create a new law,” Luzius said.      In his view, Switzerland does not look at blockchain technology or crypto assets as unique entities, but as extensions of existing instruments.      According to Weber, the new laws would change the broader framework to improve conditions for owners and providers of crypto assets.      “You may say this is a ‘blockchain law’ because all changes relate to blockchain business models. But in contrast to a few other countries like Malta or the Principality of Liechtenstein, Switzerland is not going to implement blockchain law in a narrow sense,” Weber said.    Reducing taxes    Two days after the National Council vote on June 17, the Federal Council decided prevailing Swiss tax laws will not need to be amended to include special considerations for blockchain technology.      As things stand in Switzerland, bitcoin mining is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) while some security tokens are exempt from withholding tax, and there is no capital gains tax on investments.      According to Luzius, Switzerland has a withholding tax placed on dividends earned from traditional securities such as bonds or shares. Weibel from the tax authority said this tax also applies to “shares in tokenized form” to ensure all investors are treated equally.      “But current Swiss law also allows participation in the company’s profit without levying the withholding tax on the income related to this profit. This option is now also available in the attractive form of tradable participation tokens,” Weibel said.      In simpler terms, there are certain special taxes in Switzerland that do not apply to security tokens but apply for securities, Luzius said.      “Lawmakers say they are okay with not filling this gap for now because the market for security tokens is still very small,” Luzius said.      To encourage earnings through investment, the country does not tax capital gains on any investment, and the Department of Finance report assessing the need for new tax laws concluded there was no need to start with crypto.      “This is very good news for the crypto space because it means less taxes at least for now,” Luzius said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/01/swiss-government-makes-moves-to-encourage-crypto-businesses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8db9b5c903c8e0be02d8ecba17bb94bd49bb517-1500x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""The listing on Xetra not only strengthens our current position in Germany but also opens up institutional-grade crypto products to the wider European and international markets,"" said Laurent Kssis, 21Shares' managing director, in a statement.      Deutsche Boerse Group has two trading venues: Xetra, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Together, they count as the third-largest trading platform in Europe, just behind the London Stock Exchange and Euronext.      Deutsche Boerse's data shows more than €150 billion (US$168.6 billion) worth of equities and derivative products changed hands at Xetra in May. In December last year, the exchange handled approximately €300 billion in volume.      The London-based investment firm ETC Group listed a bitcoin-backed security on Xetra, earlier this month.      Bitcoin ETPs provide exposure to bitcoin in a regulated asset class. In contrast to the U.S., where regulators have been loathe to sign off on bitcoin ETF applications, there are already three to four entities offering crypto-backed products across Europe.      21Shares launched its first Bitcoin ETP at the end of 2018 on the SIX Swiss Exchange, the largest in Switzerland. The company has since launched products that track other cryptos, and some track multiple digital assets. It released a ""Short Bitcoin"" ETP that inversely tracks bitcoin's price in February.

42383996,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9zziH,1593561622,Senate Banking Committee Remains Open to Idea of Digital Dollar in Tuesday's Hearing,"Not every U.S. lawmaker is on board with the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital dollar, but no one explicitly rejected it during a hearing of the powerful Senate Banking Committee.      That’s probably the biggest takeaway from Tuesday’s hearing, where the panel heard from former regulator turned CBDC evangelist Chris Giancarlo, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla and Duke Law professor Nakita Cuttino as expert witnesses.      The lawmakers present asked questions about financial inclusion, including what potential regulations or laws might make digitization easier and more accessible to the unbanked.      “The U.S. needs a digital dollar,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “The U.S. dollar has to keep earning that place in the global payments system. It has to be better than bitcoin ... it has to be better than a digital yuan.”      Other highlights of the hearing:    Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) noted some traditional financial systems may be limited in how accessible they are, citing the need for pre-existing bank accounts. Fintech solutions such as stablecoins can provide an alternative, Crapo said, though there are concerns around the oversight of some of these coins, which unlike most cryptocurrencies are designed to hold their value relative to fiat.  Ranking Member Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) warned that tech companies have made large promises about disrupting existing industries. He pointed to ride-sharing and social media services, saying they promised to “build a more just and equal country” but instead the companies essentially found ways to “pay themselves.”  While only eight senators asked questions out of 25on the committee, every question was relevant to the topic of digitizing payments, which you can’t always count on (recall last year’s off-the-rails Facebook grillings).  Cuttino called for open access to real-time payments: “In the absence of public policy addressing open access payments and real-time payments, low-income and moderate-income Americans will continue to have limited resources needed, whether by traditional fringe services like payday loans or some novel fringe service.”  The current accounts-based payment architecture in use today is “slow and exclusionary,” Giancarlo said. While a token-based architecture is not a “panacea,” it can help provide broader access.  Cascarilla said a federal framework toward regulating crypto companies could be beneficial, though he noted that his company operates nationwide despite operating under the New York Department of Financial Services’ limited-purpose trust charter.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/01/senate-banking-committee-remains-open-to-idea-of-digital-dollar-in-tuesdays-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c8383774d89e6e8286427160431310eec26338ec-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
