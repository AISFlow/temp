42378426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCXb,1449010236,Goldman Sachs Seeking Crypto Trade Settlement Patent,"Goldman Sachs filed a patent application last month for a securities settlement system based on a new cryptocurrency called ""SETLcoin"".  In a US Patent & Trademark Office application, dated 19th November, Goldman Sachs outlines a ""Cryptographic Currency For Securities Settlement"" that allows peer-to-peer participants to exchange cryptographic tokens representing securities with instant settlement.  The application states:  ""Traders using the described technology exchange securities by presenting an open transaction on the associated funds in their respective wallets. SETLcoin ownership is immediately transferred to a new owner after authentication and verification, which are based on network ledgers within a peer-to-peer network, guaranteeing nearly instantaneous execution and settlement.""  The exchange of SETLcoin takes place within a wallet software implementation, according to the application, and utilizes a system of marking SETLcoins to represent particular securities, using shares in IBM and Google shares as examples:  ""An SETLcoin wallet or transaction can house a single security, as described above, or multiple denominations of the same security (eg, 1 IBM-S SETLcoin valued at 100 IBM shares). SETLcoin wallets or transactions may also house multiple securities (eg, 1 IBM-S SETLcoin and 2 GOOG-S SETLcoins).""  ""In some embodiments, PICS are issued (and destroyed) by highly authoritative entities,"" the application goes on to explain. ""For example, dollars available on the SETLcoin network represented by, eg, PIC 'USD' may be authoritatively issued by, for example, the US Treasury.""  The application goes into further detail on other ways in which the cryptographic tokens can be marked and exchanged.  ""However, the described technology can issue PICS based on various other techniques (eg, network node agreement, exchange regulation, lease or purchase, auction, etc) and can be named based on, eg, a company's name, its market symbol, its branding, its security name, availability, or a preferred format (eg, length, abbreviation, etc.""  The application outlines the exchange of SETLcoins for other cryptocurrencies, naming bitcoin and litecoin specifically.  ""SETLcoins are exchangeable for, eg, other SETLcoins and/or other cryptographic currencies (eg, peercoins). For example, a single IBM-S SETLcoin may be exchangeable for one or more 'GOOG' SETLcoins (i.e., Google shares), for 13,000 USD SETLcoins, 100 litecoins, and/or for 5 bitcoins,"" the application reads.  The bank is an investor in bitcoin payments startup Circle, having taken part in its $50m funding round earlier this year.  The full patent application can be found here.

42378428,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCV5,1448993456,SEC Charges GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza With Securities Fraud,"UPDATE 2 (1st December 22:00 BST): This article has been updated with comment from Josh Garza's lawyer, Marjorie Peerce.      The US Securities and Exchange Commission has charged former GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza with the fraudulent sale of unlicensed securities and the operation of a Ponzi scheme.  The complaint, filed today in the US District Court for the District of Connecticut, focuses largely on the sale of Hashlets, the “virtual miners” sold by GAW Miners through its cloud mining site, ZenCloud.  The SEC said that Garza and GAW earned roughly $19 million in revenue from the scheme, which evolved from hardware hosting to cloud mining to the eventual launch of an alternative cryptocurrency and has as many as 10,000 customers and investors.  According to the SEC, Garza and GAW Miners knowingly misrepresented the nature of Hashlets, their proclaimed profitability and the manner in which mining income was sourced.  The agency, which sued Garza’s brother Carlos after he refused to testify during its investigation, wrote in the indictment:  “Defendants used the lure of quick riches from a twenty-first century payment system known as virtual currency to defraud investors. Though cloaked in technological sophistication and jargon, defendants’ fraud was simple at its core – defendants sold what they did not own, and misrepresented the nature of what they were selling.”  According to the SEC, GAW Miners’ sale of Hashlets was fraudulent at its core due to vastly insufficient mining power owned by the company and operated at its data centers. Emails leaked earlier this year show discussions among GAW staff, including Garza, regarding mining power shortfalls and efforts to expand capacity amid continuing Hashlet sales.  The SEC wrote:  “Defendants’ Hashlet sales had many of the hallmarks of a Ponzi scheme. Because defendants sold far more computing power than they owned and dedicated to virtual currency mining, they owed investors a daily return that was larger than any actual return they were making on their limited mining operations.""  Elsewhere in the complaint, the SEC drew attention to the false nature of GAW’s controlling stake in ZenMiner, the latter of which at the time was represented as a separate entity.  Reiterating prior claims by former GAW employee Eric Capuano, the SEC said that “this statement was false; no such transaction occurred because Garza had always owned and controlled ZenMiner.”  As part of the alleged misrepresentation, Thomas Fraser, a relative of Cantor Fitzgerald vice chairman and GAW investor Stuart Fraser, was asked to tell CryptoCoinsNews that the firm was his rather than Garza's. Fraser was not directly named in the SEC's filing.  The indictment comes months after GAW Miners crumbled amid growing controversy over its mining operations and failed promises that it would honor a $20 price for its alternative cryptocurrency, paycoin.  Subsequent staff exits and email leaks accelerated the collapse of GAW, which in the months since has been the target of civil lawsuits that seek to recoup losses.  A former utility provider for the firm, Mississippi Power Company, won a default judgment in August and recently told CoinDesk that it is ""using all available remedies to collect the monies owed by GAW Miners"".  Paycoin and Hashstakers, the latter of which were online wallets that generated revenue for users that held their paycoins within GAW's service, were also addressed in the SEC's filing.  ""In offering HashStakers to Hashlet investors, GAW Miners and Garza attempted to prolong their scheme and prevent the collapse of GAW Miners,"" the SEC said.  The agency has asked the court for disgorgement of GAW-related gains from Garza as well as interest and civil damages.  When reached for comment, Garza's lawyer, New York-based defense attorney Marjorie Peerce, told CoinDesk:  ""Josh Garza is disappointed that the SEC has filed a lawsuit against him. Any further comments will be through the court process.""  The SEC is seeking a jury trial.

42378425,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iCWL,1448985617,Bitcoin's Winning Shoppers in Taiwan With This Retail Giant's Help,"Convenience store chain FamilyMart is now accepting bitcoin at its nearly 3,000 locations in Taiwan after striking a deal in October with local wallet provider BitoEX.  Since the news, FamilyMart has been allowing customers to use bitcoin, through a BitoEX wallet, to buy cash coupons accepted at its stores. The coupons are dispensed by its FamiPort terminals, which are a common payment channel used for everything from paying parking ticket fines or utility bills to buying train or movie tickets.  The move is aimed at visitors to Taiwan and a growing domestic user base, FamilyMart's public relations manager Chen Chia-Chi told the Taiwanese news agency United Daily News.  Growing user base  According to BitoEX, more than 500 transactions have already been made at FamilyMart stores since the feature was launched on 24th October. The firm also claims that it now has 40,000 web wallet users and a 30% annual growth rate.  ""There are more and more users of our bitcoin wallet now, but the market in Taiwan is still small, and it's still growing,"" said Rica Chiang, deputy general manager at BitoEX.  This isn't the startup's first deal with FamilyMart. Last October it launched a bitcoin-buying service with the convenience store chain, allowing customers to purchase the digital currency over the counter.  The startup says the success of the bitcoin buying service put the digital currency on FamilyMart's radar, leading it to consider accepting bitcoin for goods. According to BitoEX, the number of bitcoin purchases at FamilyMart has more than doubled year-on-year.  ""Since last year [FamilyMart] saw a growing number of bitcoin sales. That's why they were cautiously thinking about accepting bitcoin to see if it there's a bigger market out there,"" BitoEX's Chiang said.  Convenience store chains in Taiwan have been at the forefront of experimentation with e-commerce. They were among the first retailers in Asia to become collection points for goods purchased online, for example.  FamilyMart is Taiwan's second-largest convenience store chain by number of outlets, coming in behind 7-Eleven, which has about twice the number of stores. Taiwan is one of six international markets that the chain, headquartered in Tokyo, serves.  Gamers flocking to bitcoin  A key segment of BitoEX's user base is gamers, Chiang said, accounting for 40% of the startup's customers. They're buying games or making in-game purchases on international platforms like Steam, Big Fish and PokerStart, Chiang said.  Some gamers don't have access to a credit card or simply find Taiwan's ubiquitous convenience stores and their payment terminals to be an easier way to obtain the credit they need. Indeed, payment for games in Taiwan is a subject of discussion on gaming forums.  It's the gamers who are showing up at FamilyMarts across Taiwan – usually in the middle of the night – to make a quick run for soft drinks or snacks before returning to another marathon session. Sometimes they avail themselves of over-the-counter bitcoin as well, desperate for credit to advance in a game.  ""We noticed a lot of transactions taking place in the middle of the night, so we were curious. We found out they were gamers. Sometimes they say, 'Please give me bitcoin, I'm in a hurry – I'm in the middle of a game!',"" Chiang said.  BitoEX says the next biggest group of its customers are those using bitcoin for remittances, followed by investors and speculators.  The startup uses the mainland China-based exchange OKCoin for its bitcoin rates and liquidity.
