42378220,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1F9,1436306036,Leak Reveals Hacking Team Created Bitcoin Wallet Tracker,"Unknown hackers have released a large cache of files stolen from notorious Italy-based spyware firm Hacking Team, revealing that the company enabled its clients to hack computers and monitor cryptocurrency activity on those machines.  According to a report by security news provider CSO, the trove of data included internal emails, payment invoices and product descriptions. Among the products listed in a slideshow prepared by CSO are computer monitoring programs that, among other capabilities, can view “cryptocurrency transactions”, naming bitcoin and litecoin specifically.  The three products, which offer surveillance tools for the Mac OSX, Linux and Windows systems, enable licensees to monitor activity on a computer affected by the spyware. Users can capture files and email, record sound using the microphone and track the position of the device, among other functionalities.  Hacking Team’s reputation stems largely from its association with repressive governments, to which it provides technology that enables hacking, mass surveillance and data collection.  The leaked files show that the company counts US agencies among its clientele – the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense and the Drug Enforcement Agency, in particular – as well as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Sudan and other regimes.  Employee Christian Pozzi later took to Twitter to denounce the hack, accusing those behind the release of lying and stating that the firm was working with law enforcement officials. Pozzi later deleted his account.  Reports indicate  that cybersecurity researchers analyzing the released files have already identified several significant exploits developed by Hacking Team.

42378224,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1Iv,1436304091,New Genesis Mining Tool Seeks Industrial Bitcoin Mining Efficiency,"Genesis Mining has launched a new web interface that will enable digital currency miners to gain greater control of their bitcoin and altcoin mining operations.  Initially built for internal use, Genesis Hive is currently being offered to large-scale miners at a rate that varies based on the number of mining units connected to the service each month. The new software is also expected to be made available to medium and small-sized firms at a later, to-be-determined date.  CEO and co-founder Marco Streng indicated that the project aims to reduce the rising complexities associated with industrial-scale bitcoin mining.  Streng told CoinDesk:  ""While this has improved efficiency it has also lead to new problems in the mining space. A couple of years ago, no one could have dreamed of thousands of devices mining bitcoin in a single location, and there was no software to handle a setup of this size.""  Genesis Mining envisions Hive as a solution to these issues, one that joins the ranks of other enterprise-level bitcoin mining offerings such as HashRabbit that have come to market in recent months.  Streng, however, suggested that Genesis Hive will be competitive as it allows for more flexibility than offerings geared for smaller mining entities.  ""Hive does not require you to install any software on your individual rigs and will adapt to whatever network and hardware setup you deem most appropriate,"" he continued.  New controls  The new tool aims to ease the process to install a mining farm, by automatically detecting, configuring and updating mining units.  Additional control is provided over units in disparate geographies. Users will also be able to ""constantly control"" their mining rigs through Genesis Hive's dashboard, obtaining hashrate, temperature, rig statuses and power consumption calculations.  ""Switching or adding pools, upgrading firmware, rebooting etc is done in a matter of a few clicks on any number of devices simultaneously,"" the company explained.  Genesis Hive also enables users to perform bulk updates, pool changes or establish automatic tasks depending on individual environmental needs.  Arms race  The launch comes at a time when efficiency is of increasing concern to industrial-scale bitcoin miners, many of whom are competing as the bitcoin price continues to be depressed relative to market highs last year.  Some bitcoin mining firms – such as CEX.io – have pivoted to other economically viable operations, citing the lack of profit as a result of bitcoin's declining price as the decisive factor behind their shift in focus.  However, as some mining outlets struggle, those that control the full lifecycle of hardware development – from the design of new machines to their eventual use – have emerged as market leaders, with BitFury and 21 Inc parlaying their successes into new and more experimental consumer products.

42378214,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N155,1436298658,California Bill Update Eases Burden for Bitcoin Startups,"A proposed digital currency bill has been amended in the California Senate to include a provisional application process for early-stage industry services.  AB-1326  , if passed, would require individuals and companies offering services that involve bitcoin or other digital currencies to first obtain a license. A new draft version of the bill, was amended and re-referred to the California Senate Committee on Banking and Finance on 6th July after it passed with a 55-22 vote in the State Assembly last month.  Notably, a new change to the draft text enables small-scale business concepts to receive conditional approval from the state’s Commission of Business Oversight under the state’s Money Transmission Act.  The text reads:  “The bill would authorize a person or entity conducting virtual currency business with less than $1,000,000 in outstanding obligations and whose business model, as determined by the commissioner, represents low or no risk to consumers to register with a $500 license fee and, if approved, receive a provisional license to conduct virtual currency business.”  Under the proposed law, those seeking licensure would be required to register with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Additionally, provisional approval would be subject to a process that would consider anticipated transaction volume, existing risk mitigation strategies and the overall nature of the business.  The provisional licenses carry a two-year duration, and entities that no longer qualify would have 15 days to contact state regulators, and an additional 30 days to seek full licensure.  Step forward  The inclusion of a provisional process marks a potential victory for developers and startups in California looking to work on bitcoin and blockchain-related projects, enabling development that, under existing law, might run afoul of financial regulation. A similar provision was included in New York’s BitLicense framework, which officially became law late last month, allowing for the provisional approval of digital currency startups.  The updated text also redefines what constitutes ""virtual currency business"", reducing its scope from a previous definition that would have captured any entity that maintained “full custody or control of virtual currency in this state on behalf of others” or offered exchange services to Californian citizens.  Under the new definition, exchanges would not be required to seek licensure.  Language governing the hiring of agents was also removed. Initially, those individuals would have been subject to a state background check, and would also have been required to to sign a contract governing the scope of their work and confirming their compliance with the law.  The new version also adds provisions for transaction receipts and license conversions.

42378217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N18r,1436296257,Blockchain Offers Alpha Users First Look at New Bitcoin Wallet,"Blockchain has officially opened a closed alpha for its new bitcoin wallet.  The launch precedes a formal debut that is likely to be the bitcoin wallet and block explorer provider's biggest announcement since it raised a then-record $30.5m Series A in October 2014. Nearly 3.8 million Blockchain wallet accounts have been opened since launch in 2011, according to its own statistics.  Following its most recent fundraising, Blockchain has been relatively quiet with new announcements, experiencing heavy user backlash amid security issues in December as well as an under-the-radar CEO change.  Alpha users, the company said, were carefully selected with the goal of providing feedback that could improve the product. As such, these users are currently able to get a first look at the service's new security center, improved account management and simplified interface, among other updates.  Blockchain co-founder Nic Cary indicated that the goal of the alpha was to allow the company to iterate the project based on the feedback of influential users.  Cary told CoinDesk:  ""We've set up the alpha program to be a community driven development project. We've been soliciting feedback on what users want out of a future wallet in a live environment.""  The company said it expects to update the alpha version of the product weekly ahead of its formal launch.

42378229,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1Nx,1436282423,Event Challenges Lack of Bitcoin Awareness in Post-Gox Japan,"Despite the dramatic and prolonged demise of Mt Gox, digital currencies are still relatively unknown in the bitcoin exchange's birthplace, Japan.  This week, one of the country's pioneering VC firms aims to change that, with a Tokyo event gathering the sector's brightest minds to discuss how businesses can harness the emerging technology.  Over 400 attendees arrived in the Toranomon Hills skyscraper yesterday for a day of demos, briefings and Q&A sessions led by Digital Garage co-founder and MIT Media Lab director Joichi Ito.  The aim was to provide a formal introduction to bitcoin technology in order to help quash misinformation and guide discussion around its future.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a Digital Garage spokesperson said large-scale events like this had been ""almost nonexistent"" in Japan until now, however, the tide is turning. He added:  ""We hope that this event will catalyse the Japan business and investment community to strive to more fully understand digital currencies – attracting more human, financial and political capital to this area.""  New Context  The New Context Conference, founded over a decade ago by Digital Garage, aims to foster a technological and cultural exchange between East and West. Previous speakers, drawn from Ito's expansive US network, include LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone.  A 'sister' event is planned for San Francisco this November, where the firm now has a presence, alongside Hong Kong.  Besides digital currencies, the two-day affair – which comes to a close today – also shone a light on virtual reality (VR) technology. While the latter has been legitimised in Japan's public imagination by ventures like Project Morpheus, according to the Digital Garage spokesperson, bitcoin still has a long way to go to escape its association with illicit activities.  The event's emphasis on ""leadership"" aims to challenge this, with the spokesperson adding:  ""We will be focusing heavily on inviting financial industry players to join and learn about how digital currency businesses are affecting their counterpart businesses in the West so that they may better understand how these changes will ultimately affect them in the years to come.""  Jimmy Homma, director of the Japan Digital Money Association, which helps international firms find their first employees in the country, told CoinDesk he remains optimistic that thought leadership events like this will have a trickle-down effect to the general population.  While many people believe bitcoin was over with Mt Gox, both Ito and the MIT Media Lab are a ""strong brand"" for the country's educated elite, he said, adding: ""[With] big companies like DoCoMo, GMO and J-Trust joining or investing in bitcoin related startups, the situation is slightly improving.""  Digital Garage's spokesperson says his firm has made a ""number of small investments"" in the country, but would not expand on further details. He described Japan's bitcoin startup community as ""very tight-knit"", going on to say:  ""Given the very open and collaborative nature of the digital currency ecosystem, companies outside of Silicon Valley benefit from advances that are made by their Silicon Valley-based peers that are blazing the trail (at a much higher cost to investors).""  For this reason, Japan has so far seen a ""derisking"" approach towards digital currency businesses, Digital Garage said. Meaning business models have been proved to fail or succeed in other geographies before they reach the island.  ""Having said all this, we're still in the first inning of the digital currency ballgame in Japan,"" the company spokesperson added.  Internet history  Digital Garage's history dovetails with that of the early Internet in Japan. The firm helped establish the country’s first commercial ISP, PSINet, and subsequent layers of Internet infrastructure in the areas of e-commerce and search.  Ito heads up MIT's Media Lab, which now houses three of bitcoin's core developers, Gavin Andresen, Cory Fields and Wladimir van der Laan, as part of its digital currency initiative.  The investor has written at length on the similarities and differences between bitcoin and the early days of the Internet. He believes the blockchain has the potential to disrupt the professions of banking, law and accountancy in the same way the Internet impacted media and advertising. It will also lower costs, disintermediate many layers of business and reduce friction, he said. ""As we know, one person’s friction is another person’s revenue.""  For Digital Garage, bitcoin's application as money – just like email for the Internet – is the first in a string of use cases, including privacy, security and authentication.  ""Looking at bitcoin solely through the lens of the Internet is also potentially limiting, as the digital currency ecosystem will almost certainly develop in a manner different from that by which the Internet did.""

Having avoided a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, Bryan Micon, who ran the now-defunct Seals with Clubs, will have to pay a $25,000 fine and serve a probation term, VegasInc reports.  If he completes his probation, Micon will instead be able to plead guilty to one gross misdemeanour count of conspiracy for running an unlicensed gambling site. The duration of his probation is yet to be determined.  Micoin will also have to give up property seized during a raid in his house carried out by the Nevada Gaming Commission, including $900 cash, some 3 BTC and electronic equipment.  According to VegasInc, back in April Attorney General Adam Laxalt said he believed the charges against Micoin were the first of their kind in the state of Nevada.

42378258,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7N1Mh,1436248846,BitX Launches Bitcoin Services in Nigeria,"BitX has launched services in Nigeria, a move that will enable local users to access the company's bitcoin wallet, exchange and API services.  The announcement comes roughly six months after the emerging markets-focused bitcoin services provider launched in Indonesia. Both countries had been on BitX's list of planned markets since April 2014.  BitX CEO Marcus Swanepoel expressed his optimism that Nigeria would soon become one of the company's leading markets due to its ""fast-growing"" and ""highly entrepreneurial economy"".  Swanepoel said:  ""We’ve been inundated with requests for bitcoin products and services from consumers, developers and Nigerian businesses. The business aspect is particularly interesting and we’re currently working with a number of these businesses to bring some exciting new products to the market.""  Nigeria notably became the largest economy in Africa in April 2013, surpassing South Africa with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $509.9bn compared to South Africa's $350.6bn. However, with a population of 170 million (compared to South Africa's 52.98 million), economists have argued the country's economy is still underperforming.  One factor that may hold back the utility of bitcoin, though, is the relative lack of smartphone penetration, which mobile operator interest group the GSM Association estimates at just 10-15% of mobile subscribers.  The announcement will nonetheless find BitX joining ICE3x as the latest exchange to try and galvanize bitcoin user interest in the Nigerian market.  ICE3x launched its services in January and now offers an order-book exchange that allows Nigerian naira to be exchanged for digital currencies such as bitcoin and litecoin.
