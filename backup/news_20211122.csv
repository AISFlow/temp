13221976,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=477050,1637625585,DAO To Make Jodorowsky’s Dune Manuscript Public: Member Won $3M Bid,"Following Constitution DAO&apos;s lead, a group called Dune DAO went for a copy of the mythological Frank Herbert and Alejandro Jodorowsky&apos;s Dune manuscript, wanted by many and seen by few. A plot almost as interesting as the saga took over Christie&apos;s auction, where the DAO won the final bid, but with a twist. Just a few days after ConstitutionDAO made history crowd-raising over $46M in an attempt to buy a rare printing of the U.S. constitutions, other groups are following their steps to purchase valuable objects in hopes to make them accessible to the public. This time, DuneDAO aimed to bid for a copy of Alejandro Jodorowsky&apos;s Dune manuscript at a Christie&apos;s auction. They hoped for a total of $500,000 in contributions and actually hit $700,000. Although the final price was way higher, they still managed to secure it. Christie&apos;s had valued the manuscript&apos;s copy between €25,000 ($28,100) and €35,000 ($39,345), but it sold for over $3 million. They admitted to failing at recognizing the interest that the newest film based on Dune raised, reported The Guardian.

42375812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBVdr,1637623845,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Drops to $56.5K After Brief Rally; Ether Also Falls,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market moves: Bitcoin rallied in early trading on U.S. markets before dropping.  Technician’s take: Short-term downside is likely into the Asia trading day.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $56,452 -4.6%  Ether (ETH): $4,107 -5.1%  Market moves  After picking up slightly earlier in the day, bitcoin continued its recent downward trend. At the time of publication, the cryptocurrency was trading above $56,500, down more than 4% over the past 24 hours. Ether followed a similar pattern, rallying before dropping to about $4,100.  The cryptocurrencies and equities markets initially rose after the news that U.S. President Joe Biden had renominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for another four-year term as head of the country’s central bank. Speculation had been that Biden would reappoint Powell or choose Fed Governor Lael Brainard.  Some market observers see bitcoin’s price support holding at $55,000.  “The downward pressure on major crypto assets like bitcoin and ether is to be expected,” BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s price increased more than 50% in the last 45 days to its all-time high. We expect the week to consolidate around $55K before rising again to $60K before the end of the month. We’ve repeatedly seen profit-taking in crypto when there are these quick run-ups.”  DiPasquale added: “The news of Biden’s appointment of Powell is strong for crypto, as the U.S. has shown no signs of quantitative tightening; rather, just tapering the quantitative easing.”  Technician’s take  Bitcoin Struggled at $60K Resistance; Support Above $53K  Bitcoin (BTC) buyers remained active over the weekend, although upside was limited around the $60,000 resistance level.  The cryptocurrency continues to consolidate, with pullbacks limited toward $53,000 support.  Intraday chart signals are neutral, suggesting the current loss of momentum could continue into the Asian trading session. Buyers will need to defend immediate support around $55,000 and decisively break above the short-term downtrend in order to yield further upside targets.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching oversold levels, which could support a price recovery similar to what took place in late September. However, previous failed attempts at sustaining an all-time price high near $69,000 is a concern.

But could the recent weakness in the cryptocurrency market be more a factor of a strong dollar? TD Sequential Triggers Anti-Correlated Signals On BTCUSD, DXY Weeks ago, we posed the question if or not the Dollar Currency Index making new highs in 2021 was a dangerous situation for Bitcoin. After more than $10,000 per coin was wiped off the price of BTC, the answer was a resounding yes. But much like the cryptocurrency uptrend in late 2020 and early 2021 came to an abrupt halt, even the dollar&apos;s short-term destruction must at some point come to a full stop.

However, the 8th candle before the 9 can also yield such results, and truly the tides can change at any point - the tool just highlights when that is most likely to occur.

42375813,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwBVgN,1637617031,Market Wrap: Cryptocurrencies Fade on News That Powell Will Be Renominated as Fed Chairman,"Bitcoin traded lower on Monday after buyers failed to sustain a weekend rally toward $60,000. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $56,000 at press time and is down about 5% over the past 24 hours.  Equities and cryptocurrencies initially ticked higher earlier during New York trading hours after U.S. President Joe Biden said he will renominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, following some speculation that Fed Governor Lael Brainard could replace Powell to lead the central bank for the next four years.  For now, some analysts view the current pullback in cryptocurrencies as a normal occurrence after a strong rally over the past month.  “With bitcoin and other crypto assets having reached fresh all-time highs, there was always likely to be a measure of profit-taking from investors, which then translates into price weakness,” Simon Peters, an analyst at eToro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $55,898, -6.17%  Ether (ETH): $4,065, -7.19%  S&P 500: $4,682, -0.32%  Gold: $1,804, -2.14%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.62%  As bitcoin buyers take some profits, equities appear to be holding up. The S&P 500 is up about 4% over the past month, compared with a 7% decline in BTC over the same period.  The chart below shows the recent decline in the 60-day correlation between bitcoin and the S&P 500. The short-term disconnect between the cryptocurrency and the stock index suggests that investors still have an appetite for risk even as some have reduced exposure to crypto.  Bitcoin funds attract fresh capital  Digital asset investment products saw inflows of $154 million last week despite the recent sell-off across cryptocurrencies. The rise in fund inflows reflects strong investor appetite for crypto exposure.  The recent futures-based bitcoin exchange-traded fund launches in the U.S. accounted for 90% of inflows into bitcoin products last week, according to a report by CoinShares.

42424245,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2m5Xh,1637614175,"Rare ‘Dune’ Manuscript Bought on DAO’s Behalf for $3M, but It Only Raised $700K","Last week, a crypto collective called ConstitutionDAO raised over $40 million in ether (ETH) to buy an original copy of the U.S. constitution at auction; it failed, outbid by the hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin.  But the idea of raising $40 million in a week on the strength of a meme has proven enticing, and copycats have emerged.  So far, the most interesting of those is DuneDAOhttps://dune.foundation/, a similar crypto crowdfunding effort that raised over $700,000 to purchase a copy of the manuscript for Alejandro Jodorowsky’s notorious, unfinished film adaptation of the classic sci-fi novel “Dune.” This morning, when the hammer fell at Christie’s, DuneDAO actually succeeded.  The twist is that the final price was around $3 million: $2.3 million more than was raised in the crowdfund.  It was an investor named Soban “Soby” Saqib who put up the cash and bid on the group’s behalf. He’s a member of the “multisig” – the collectively controlled crypto wallet that serves as DuneDAO’s treasury – and a co-founder of the project.  “Hi handsome king,” Soby wrote to CoinDesk via Twitter. “I have the money already but I want the public in.” Because he entered and won the auction personally, from his home in Colorado, the manuscript belongs to him, not DuneDAO. The rest of DuneDAO is now attempting to raise the money to pay him back.  Jodorowsky’s “Dune” manuscript is essentially a massive storyboard for one of the most famous movies never made. The Chilean auteur spent the mid-70s casting and writing his adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel (Mick Jagger, Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, H.R. Giger, and Pink Floyd were among the collaborators on board), but ran well over budget, and never completed it. A 2013 documentary, “Jodorowsky’s Dune,” chronicled the development process and offered a few tantalizing glimpses of the manuscript itself. David Lynch ended up directing the first film adaptation of “Dune” in 1984; a new version directed by Denis Villeneuve was released last month.  As with ConstitutionDAO, donating money to the crowdfund only gets you a certain amount of governance tokens ($SPICE, in this case), apportioned according to what you put in. $SPICE tokens don’t represent fractional ownership of the manuscript; instead, you’re getting a say in what the group does with the money.  Also involved in DuneDAO are a few members of the crypto art collective Remiliahttps://ilongfornetworkspirituality.net/, which is responsible for a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Milady Maker. “The Constitution is something you can read any time,” said Remilia affiliate @YOJIMBO_KING. “[Jodorowsky’s ‘Dune’] has never been seen; it’s like the bounty of the Andrea Doria.” Only a few copies of the “Dune” manuscript were ever produced.  In a mission statement, DuneDAO said it’s looking to “collectively explore options to digitally preserve the manuscript and make it accessible to the public for the very first time, such as through public viewings and digital lending (to the extent permitted by law).”  Another, much better financed crypto collective called PleasrDAO attempted something similar last month, with its purchase of the Wu-Tang Clan’s “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin” – an album that only exists offline, in a one-of-one CD edition.  “He who controls $SPICE controls the DAO,” wrote one member on the group’s Discord server. “We’re excited to see what we do together.”",NEGATIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/22/rare-dune-manuscript-bought-on-daos-behalf-for-3m-but-it-only-raised-700k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2d820011255afe3d482f79c92142aba06e7c073b-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bloomberg Law first reported the news in a story earlier in the day that Mercado Libre co-founder and CEO Marcos Galperin retweeted.  In a written statement, Mercado Libre said that it was entering the cryptocurrency environment in Brazil together with “a world-class custodian,” although it didn’t specify with whom it would partner for this service. The company added that it is “analyzing all financial and regulatory aspects surrounding this technology.”  Mercado Libre has been hinting for months about bolstering its crypto services. In August, Osvaldo Gimenez, Mercado Pago president, said in an interview with Bloomberg Linea that bitcoin and ethereum “could be a revolution in finance.”  Galperin said on Twitter that users of both Mercado Livre, the Brazilian branch of the company, as well as Mercado Pago, its fintech arm, will be able to “buy, store and sell crypto” starting this week.  The company made the feature available to a small group of Brazilian users in November and plans to launch it more widely in the coming weeks, according to Tulio Oliveira, vice president of Mercado Pago, Bloomberg Law reported on Monday.  In May, the company, which trades on Nasdaq as MELI, disclosed a $7.8 million bitcoin purchase that was part of its treasury strategy. One month earlier, its Argentine real estate platform launched a special section for the sale and purchase of properties with bitcoin.

42411645,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glPM8t,1637613467,Ethereum’s Fees Are Too Damn High,"This past weekend, a crypto investor named Zhu Su fired off a series of tweets about the state of the Ethereum blockchain.  “Yes I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past,” he wrote. “Yes Ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past. The idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burn and concocting purity tests, while zero newcomers can afford the chain, is gross.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Something worth considering before evaluating this claim is that Su’s investment firm, Three Arrows Capital, is betting big on an Ethereum competitor called Avalanche. The value of $AVAX, the network’s native cryptocurrency, recently surged to an all-time high, so it’s possible Su was just riding high in the moment.  That said, he may be right – at least about Ethereum’s barrier to entry.  It goes without saying that accessing Web 3 is already somewhat arcane. It’s not enough to just buy crypto on Coinbase’s exchange. If you want to use dapps (decentralized applications), explore DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols, or get in on the NFT (non-fungible token) craze, you are going to need to master the ins and outs of unhosted wallets and token swaps. But even once you know all that, Ethereum still asks for fees, which – at this point in the development of the blockchain – can be shockingly high.  Minting an NFT on Ethereum will generally cost between $60 and $250, depending on the time of day and the stress on the network. The more users are competing to get their transactions in the chain’s next “block,” the worse the fees.  Fees can be way, way higher, too. I remember my shock, this past May, when I tried to swap about six cents’ worth of ETH for 50 Pisscoin – an Ethereum-based token I was researching for a story – and was told I would need to pay an additional $616.10 for a transaction that might clear in about 40 minutes. If the transaction failed, as can happen often on crypto networks, the fee would be permanently lost.  And because every single “on-chain” transaction needs to be verified in the same way, with the same fee system, you’re always at the mercy of the market. When you’re working directly with the blockchain, you’re losing money every step of the way.  Traders who donated to ConstitutionDAO – last week’s crowdfund to purchase an original copy of the U.S. constitution at auction – collectively paid nearly 200 ETH in fees, according to on-chain data. That’s around $850,000.  Read more: TIME Magazine to Hold ETH on Balance Sheet as Part of Galaxy Digital Metaverse Deal  In the real world, people aren’t used to paying that much for everyday transactions. Only a tiny fraction of the population, with the requisite tech knowledge and money to burn, can even begin to explore Ethereum.  Crypto venture capitalist Chris Dixon – whose company, Andreessen Horowitz, is heavily invested in the Ethereum ecosystem – responded to Su by suggesting that the network is still in its infancy, and that infrastructure may eventually make things cheaper and easier to use (at the expense of security).  Sure. But for now, infrastructure is minimal. Polygon, a so-called “layer 2″ scaling product built on top of Ethereum, is designed to make fees a little cheaper. But even “bridging” Ethereum-based tokens over to the Polygon network can be prohibitively expensive. Other networks, like Solana, are betting that users may just ditch Ethereum altogether.  As it’s now set up, Ethereum is like a poker table with a high buy-in. The rich, with their ETH stashes, have the opportunity to get richer, capitalizing on the crypto gold rush and becoming familiar with these systems as early adopters.  Everyone else will have to wait for a cheaper option.",NEGATIVE,AVAX | ETH,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/22/ethereums-fees-are-too-damn-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/29b465d406ee67b32f5f1b8ec6f568bb7f178a3f-2048x1536.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Central Exchanges Observe Inflow Of 200k ETH As pointed out by a CryptoQuant post, more than 200k ETH entered exchange wallets yesterday. At the current rate, this amount is worth about $839 million. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the Ethereum netflow, which shows the net amount of the crypto entering or exiting central exchanges. Its value is calculated by taking the difference between the inflows and the outflows. When the metric has negative values, it means outflows are dominating the inflows. That is, investors are withdrawing more ETH than they are depositing. Such a trend is usually bullish for the crypto. On the other hand, positive netflows imply exchanges are receiving a higher amount of Ethereum compared to what&apos;s being taken off. As investors usually transfer their coins to exchanges either for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins, prolonged positive values of the indicator can be bearish.

The company announced the sale Monday, which was led by ParaFi Capital and Arrington Capital and included investment from Benson Oak Ventures, GCW Capital and Blocbits.  As NFTs find their footing on blockchains not named Ethereum, their historical home, various projects are looking to replicate the success of on-chain marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible and Nifty Gateway.  Similar races are shaping up between marketplaces like Solanart and Magic Eden on Solana, and Talis is going head-to-head with Random Earth, another Terra NFT hub.  Talis will use the funds to move its marketplace from minimal viable product (MVP) status to version 1, which is expected to launch sometime in the second quarter of 2022.  The upgrade will turn the company’s marketplace into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), integrating a governance system with a network of printing businesses for artists to use in the meatspace, according to a press release. A DAO is a group of people on the internet using various tools to exercise governance decisions relating to blockchain protocols, pooled investments or any number of other experiments.  “The launch of Talis comes at a prescient time,” Arrington Capital partner Ninor Mansor told CoinDesk. “NFTs on Terra are starting to come to life through art and gaming, and the Talis marketplace is positioned to capitalize on this trend.”  Read more: LUNA Hits All-Time High as Terra Community Passes Popular Burn Proposal  Talis cited the lack of equitable print-on-demand (PoD) services as a barrier for many artists to capture adequate revenue for their work. The company hopes that its DAO can eventually acquire the means of production for its own printing business, a representative told CoinDesk.  The marketplace also hopes to offer DeFi lending services for its TALIS token, which the company said can be staked for an 18% interest rate, according to a press release.

The benchmark crypto might have reacted to the potential re-appointment of the U.S. FED Chair Jerome Powell to his position for a second term.

42424248,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2m5dh,1637603120,Junk-Rated El Salvador’s ‘Bitcoin Bonds’ Look Explosive (Think Volcano),"While El Salvador’s new bitcoin-linked bond may be one of the highest-yielding fixed-income instruments globally, it might turn out to be riskier than the country’s outstanding government bonds, which are already categorized as junk-grade.  Some experts said the new offering might struggle to attract investors, especially because the bond appears to pay interest at a lower rate than the country’s conventional dollar-denominated bonds.  El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced the plans on Saturday to issue a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” with a 10-year maturity on the Liquid Network. Half of the money raised will be used to purchase bitcoin, and the rest will fund construction of a new ”Bitcoin City” along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano.  The bond – developed by Blockstream and processed by Bitfinex – will offer a 6.5% coupon, or the rate of annual interest payments. In addition, investors will receive dividends generated by staggered liquidation of bitcoin holdings, which will begin from the sixth year. The annualized yield back to investors could reach 146% in the 10th year, according to Blockstream projections.  Compare that with the benchmark 10-year yield on El Salvador’s outstanding government bonds, currently around 13%, according to Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International (ADMISI).  For further context, the U.S. 10-year Treasury, considered by many global authorities and bond investors to have pristine creditworthiness, yields about 1.5%.  Will the bitcoin price go to $1 million?  But the new El Salvador bond’s projected performance is based on Blockstream models suggesting that bitcoin will rally to $1 million in the next five years – an aggressive target given that the cryptocurrency is currently trading around $58,000.  Some investors might be betting that the lockup period – wherein $500 million of bitcoin would be out of circulation – might itself contribute to a fresh bull run.  “Anyone buying this bitcoin-backed bond is betting on the cryptocurrency in a very big way, ignoring the credit market currently signaling that El Salvador is very much facing a distressed-debt situation,” Ostwald told CoinDesk in an email.  Prices for the country’s outstanding government bonds due in 2032 traded above 110 cents on the dollar in April – well above the par value – and have been declining ever since. Recently, they were changing hands below 75 cents on the dollar, providing a very relevant example of just how volatile emerging-market bonds can be.  El Salvador’s bonds considered junk-grade  Credit-rating firms have already cast the Central American country’s bitcoin foray as a negative.  El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in June. A month later, Moody’s downgraded the country’s long-term, foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Caa1 from B3, citing the decision to adopt bitcoin as a sign of weak governance. Obligations rated Caa1 are judged to be junk-grade – of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.  The latest announcement to issue bitcoin-backed bonds may draw further ire from rating agencies and international partners.  “I suspect that El Salvador bonds are sufficiently risky, and adding bitcoin on top of that precludes most retail investors and more institutional investors,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, told CoinDesk in an email.  Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree Asset Management, said issuing bonds linked to bitcoin could further isolate El Salvador.  “That is dangerous because if the plan goes wrong, who will save the day?” Morris said, adding that Blockstream’s million-dollar forecast for bitcoin (BTC) is extremely optimistic.  Are El Salvador’s bitcoin bonds a gimmick?  According to Bannockburn’s Chandler, the country’s new bitcoin bonds appear to be a gimmick to achieve lower interest rates.  Borrowing costs tend to be higher in indebted nations with weak economic growth such as El Salvador, Greece, Sri Lanka and Mozambique. Each of these nations offers a double-digit yield on their benchmark 10-year bond.  However, by allocating half of the proceeds from the debt sale to bitcoin, the El Salvador government is giving investors a share of the cryptocurrency’s possible price upside. That might help explain why investors would be willing to buy the country’s new bitcoin bonds at a lower yield than what they would get from El Salvador’s conventional outstanding bonds.  According to Chandler, “the desperate attempt” could work but would require getting lucky on bitcoin, whose intrinsic value, or lack thereof, continues to be debated. Chandler says that other countries should follow El Salvador’s lead but probably won’t.  “I doubt that as I doubted many corporate treasurers would buy bitcoins as Tesla did,” he said.  Would it be less risky to ... just buy bitcoin?  Crypto investors may also think twice before taking the gambit because they likely already have experience buying bitcoin directly.  “While crypto enthusiasts will doubtless be buyers, the simple question is would they rather own the underlying or be happy to take the encumbrance of a clearly distressed sovereign debt, let alone any geological risk of ‘Bitcoin City’ being located next to a volcano,” ADMISI’s Ostwald said. “I guess that brings a whole new meaning to ‘explosive.’”  Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund expert and director of CEC Capital, said the bitcoin-backed bonds might be a good deal for investors who are already motivated to buy emerging market debt – government bonds of Russia, Mexico, India, Brazil and other less-developed nations. The benchmark bonds in these nations yield between 6% to 9%.  However, for more risk-averse crypto traders, holding bitcoin might be a better option – as outlandish as that might sound to some investors used to lower volatility in traditional markets.  “It is safer and may appreciate more than the bond,” Kssis said. “Bear in mind that the bond could/may default and may be classified as junk status so many investors may not be able to invest.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/22/junk-rated-el-salvadors-bitcoin-bonds-look-explosive-think-volcano,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe25aaa1b7e7cd7bf1a2adf2b6c26c8c64054e92-1400x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

C3′s ambitious plan to allow decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity to flow across blockchains was also backed by Golden Tree Asset Management, Cumberland, ParaFi Capital, Mechanism Capital, Borderless Capital, Node Capital and Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk).  Cryptocurrency trading grew out of retail exchanges and developer-led blockchain projects, in contrast to legacy finance, which started with institutions building infrastructure that suited their needs. As such, the concept of prime brokerage in traditional finance – a bundle of services often offered by investment banks that includes lending, cash management and netting – is gradually being replicated in the cryptocurrency world.  Algorand builders  Founded by the Rand Labs team that built Algorand staples My Algo Wallet and AlgoExplorer, C3 is focused on creating a new layer for using collateral and margin across different blockchains, starting out by connecting collateral management Algorand and Ethereum, with the same cross-chain functionality also coming to Algrand and Solana.  “The way Ethereum DeFi was built, every team tackled a separate vertical such as lending and borrowing, perpetuals or DEXs [decentralized exchanges],” C3 founder Michel Dahdah said in an interview. “But having all these different financial products isolated in terms of how they manage collateral makes it impossible for them to cross margin, meaning the collateral you’re using to borrow money for shorting, for example, can’t be used to also open a long position in a perpetuals financial product.”  C3 will operate a “global clearing engine,” Dahdah said, so that users can lock collateral in one place and use it across a range of positions, in the same way that prime brokers act as a hub for collateral management in traditional finance.  “C3 is an ambitious idea. It bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi trading by completely rethinking how we manage collateral across both blockchains and DeFi protocols,” Ninos Mansor, partner at Arrington Capital, said in a statement. “They are taking on one of the biggest challenges in all of DeFi, a pain point that will continue to grow as DeFi becomes increasingly multi-chain.”  Read more: Algorand Boosts Smart Contract Performance With ‘Virtual Machine’ Launch",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/22/algorand-project-raises-36m-to-make-cross-chain-defi-friendly-for-big-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc86b18ad16eb5dd0dd25e9bc259094813c9ef43-6720x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420834,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlIL,1637598470,Former Oilfield Drillers See Energy Sector and Bitcoin Mining Joining Forces,"Drilling for oil and gas and mining for bitcoin might seem like an odd couple.  One is more than 150 years old. The other has existed for a little over a decade. One is a staple of industrial development, squarely grounded in the world of atoms. The other is an innovation of a digital era, financial plumbing for the world of bits. One involves sweaty outdoor work. The other involves a lot of math and abstraction inside cavernous air-conditioned data centers.  If the founders of bitcoin miner JAI Energy are right, the two industries are an ideal match.  Based in Casper, Wyo., (population: 58,446), these oil-and-gas veterans are on a mission to leave no energy stranded. Their thesis is that miners and drillers can solve each other’s problems: The crypto miners get a cheap source of electricity for their power-guzzling computers; the drillers can diversify their revenue sources and not have to waste vast amounts of excess energy produced at their current operations.  “Every oil and gas company in five-10 years from now will have some exposure to mining bitcoin,” Ryan Leachman, a founding partner of JAI, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk.  Read more: How Bitcoin Mining Works  Drilling and producing oil and gas has been plagued by a lack of infrastructure to transport the fossil fuels. After drilling in Wyoming and encountering that obstacle, Leachman and fellow JAI founding partner Justin Ballard turned to bitcoin mining to reduce so-called flaring of natural gas, as state regulations would have otherwise required them to close their drilled oil and gas well.  Flaring natural gas  Flaring of natural gas, where the excess gas is burned if encountered while drilling for fossil fuels, has become a standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure. The process is under environmental scrutiny and U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations, at a time when investors are increasingly prioritizing climate-friendly companies in their portfolios.  A scenario of net-zero emissions by 2050 requires all non-emergency flaring to be eliminated globally by 2030, resulting in a 90% reduction in flared volumes by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).  JAI’s solution for mitigating flared gas by using it to power bitcoin mining could be one way to help address the environmental concerns regarding the burning of natural gas  To reduce the amount of gas burned, Leachman and Ballard in 2019 switched gears to form a bitcoin mining operation where they capture the flared gas, convert it to electricity and use it to power mining rigs. At its 12-acre mining farm in Wyoming, JAI mines bitcoin for itself and hosts machines for energy companies that may want to mine for bitcoin using excess flared gas. JAI also provides products and services for companies to capture their excess energy.  Read more: Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About It  Now, Leachman and Ballard are expanding to Texas. The Lone Star State offers competitive rates for power, and JAI’s founders know the state well from their oil and gas days. One of JAI’s larger-scale projects in Texas will be “on-grid” as opposed to off-grid, meaning they will be drawing power from the electrical grid rather than from sources such as excess natural gas or solar power.  “Ultimately, we are trying to set ourselves up with sites that have the lowest power costs with an ability to continue to scale and grow our company,” Leachman said.  Bitcoin energy use in Texas  Texas has been at the forefront of grid and power concerns after the state experienced harsh winter storms earlier this year that prompted electrical outages. Even some bitcoin miners had to go offline. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at a blockchain summit in Austin last month, where he touted the benefits of having bitcoin miners on the grid as a source of interruptible load.  Bitcoin miners can aid “demand response” programs, which refers to formal or informal agreements to curtail demand when the grid is overtaxed and prices are high, CoinDesk reported last month following the summit. Bitcoin miners can also adjust their consumption to a level demanded by a grid operator during certain periods. Critics argue that merely adding new demand to the grid won’t solve Texas’ power problems.  However, Crusoe Energy, which is one of the trailblazers of digital flare mitigation system, thinks that bitcoin miners, renewable energy providers and grid operators have a chance to coexist, highlighting one of the company’s upcoming Texas projects that has connections to local power grids.  “In this setup, what we’re able to provide the renewable power generation company is a curtailable load resource,” CEO Chase Lochmiller told CoinDesk in an interview. “So we can actually curtail the draw of our machines during moments of peak power demand, and then we can consume all of the power during off-peak demand.”  He added that Crusoe has the ability to be the “buyer of last resort” when energy generated by renewable sources of energy isn’t being fully consumed and expects companies such as his to be “a mechanism to incentivize more renewable energy development.”  Bitcoin mining and ESG concerns  Bitcoin’s massive energy consumption has created concerns about its impact on the environment. Even though some industry executives have pushed back against the narrative that bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, many miners including Atlas Mining, CleanSpark and Stronghold Digital Mining are all using more sustainable sources of power for their operations.  A survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry forum, found that sustainable power has grown to about 58% of the total used by the industry worldwide during the third quarter from 3% in the second quarter. The increase is partly due to the rapid expansion of North American mining amid the exodus from China, and miners rotating toward more sustainable energy and modern mining techniques.  Traditional oil and gas companies may benefit financially from mining bitcoin, though that situation could continue to provide incentives for fossil fuel production, according to Matthew Schultz, chairman of bitcoin miner CleanSpark. Schultz said he isn’t convinced that large energy producers will take a bitcoin mining route, in light of ESG (environmental, social and governance) questions.  Read more: What Is Proof-of-Work?  Energy firms might think, “‘We’re already flaring the gas, why not make something out of it?’ I think that that’s an easy conclusion,” Schultz said in an interview with CoinDesk. However, if the flared gas becomes economically beneficial for an oil and gas company, it would become more likely to drill another well that’s going to have stranded gas, which would harm the environment further, he cautioned.  CleanSpark says it runs its operations with over 90% of carbon-neutral energy sourced primarily from nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and other renewable sources of energy.  Environmental critics might push for oil and gas producers to cap their wells altogether, versus opting to mine bitcoin with the excess gas; most flaring, however, occurs where natural gas is produced as a byproduct from oil drilling and where non-fossil fuel energy isn’t reliable enough yet to meet global energy needs. Cleaning up the wasted energy and engaging in flare mitigation is a better means to lowering emissions versus capping energy production, Crusoe’s Lochmiller said. The company lists Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Devon Energy as a customer that has pledged to reach flaring intensity of 0.5% or lower by 2025, and eliminate routine flaring by 2030.  Global oil demand fell nearly 7% in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and flaring fell by only 5%, the IEA notes. Globally, 142 billion cubic meters of natural gas was flared in 2020 – roughly equivalent to the natural gas demand of Central and South America. That amount of flaring resulted in about 265 metric tons of carbon dioxide, nearly 8 metric tons of methane (240 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent) and black soot, along with other greenhouse gases being directly emitted into the atmosphere.  “To reduce flaring, productive uses for the associated gas must be developed, or associated gas must be safely injected into the reservoir,” according to the IEA, adding in its flaring outlook that “one solution is to channel associated gas into the main gas grid to meet local demand or to be exported.”  Scalability of bitcoin mining  Despite superficial differences, fundamentally there are many aspects of bitcoin mining that an energy producer will find familiar, according to Leachman. “One of the similarities is that the low-cost providers, or the low-cost operators, are going to be the ones that will have the staying power,’’ he said.  For a bitcoin miner, access to cheap power is essential to stay competitive. If natural gas that was going to waste can be turned into power for mining, electricity would be essentially free for the energy company’s mining operations, while adding a revenue stream.  Oil and gas producers, along with providers of infrastructure, like pipelines, “really have the potential to have a very asymmetrical risk profile to bitcoin mining,” Leachman said.  These energy companies already have a sustainable business, and if they dedicate a portion of their capital to bitcoin mining, it can almost act like a hedge for their main revenue stream during a down cycle for commodities, he explained. An additional aspect of bitcoin mining that’s attractive compared to oil and gas production is that crypto mining is “completely scalable,” Leachman said.  Energy producers face hurdles in ramping up production, whereas bitcoin miners can generate revenue quicker once they are up and running and eventually are able to increase the scale of their operations at a faster rate.  Digital storage for natural gas  To be clear: Leachman isn’t saying all oil and gas companies will completely pivot to bitcoin mining.  “My recommendation for oil and gas companies wouldn’t be to necessarily have the goal to become the biggest bitcoin miner,” but rather to treat bitcoin mining as a secondary business that supplements their core business, he said.  Another part of Leachman’s pitch for bitcoin mining exposure is that it can act as digital storage, in a sense, for an energy company’s natural gas and provide better returns during periods of volatile commodity price fluctuations in traditional gas production.  Energy companies can convert their gases to bitcoin, hold the cryptocurrency digitally and participate in the upside as bitcoin prices appreciate in the future, he said.  By using the excess energy to mine bitcoin, “there is a chance that the small percentage that you dedicated to bitcoin mining could be worth significantly more than the gas that you traditionally would sell down the line,” he said.  Utility companies as bitcoin miners  Beyond oil and gas operations, utility companies can also explore bitcoin mining given their experience with power grids and storing energy, Leachman said.  Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a Bank of America research analyst, said in a note to clients that shared with CoinDesk that “unregulated independent power producers (IPPs) have the greatest opportunity to partner with miners and we have already seen agreements announced.”  Dumoulin-Smith highlighted utility Black Hills Corp. as the perfect example of such a business model. The company “appears to have the most exposure because of its Wyoming footprint and innovative Block Chain Interruptible Service (BCIS) tariff,” the Bank of America note said. Black Hills developed the BCIShttps://www.wyoenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/WEA-Blockchain-Info-1.pdf to meet energy needs of cryptocurrency miners, including fixed cost per kilowatt-hour rates, and negotiated prices that remain fixed for a period of two to three years.  Another source of allure for companies in energy or other unrelated industries is that profit margins for bitcoin miners are now as high as 90%.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,"Aoyon Ashraf, Michael Bellusci",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/22/former-oilfield-drillers-see-energy-sector-and-bitcoin-mining-joining-forces,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4d06124ec7e0c9c8c7840760a9e495eb9075f1c3-6048x4024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Many of those opportunities are capitalized on by hedge funds using algorithms worth millions of dollars to out-smart the average retail trader - which is happening all the time, whether you realize it or not. At Decentrader, we believe in a fairer financial system, so we are now leveling the playing field, bringing back power to you through our new trading tool…Commando.

42424236,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2m57h,1637592866,Biden to Renominate Powell as Fed Chair and Appoint Brainard as Vice Chair,"U.S. President Joe Biden said he will renominate Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve chairman, after much speculation that Fed Governor Lael Brainard could replace Powell to lead the central bank for the next four years.  Biden appears to have gone with the candidate who was better known to investors, while providing economic policy continuity. Powell helped to steer the world’s biggest economy through the COVID-19 pandemic, notably doubling the size of the central bank’s balance sheet to $8.7 trillion to stimulate global markets.  “That success is a testament to the economic agenda I’ve pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to recovery,” Biden said in a statement.  Bitcoin quadrupled in price in 2020 and has doubled so far in 2021, as a growing number of investors bought the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the inflation that might come as a result of so much money printing.  With Powell as chairman and Brainard as vice chairwoman, Biden said he expects that the duo will help keep the focus on low inflation, stable prices and provide more employment for the American people, as well as address Biden’s stance on climate change.  “Together, they also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system,” Biden added.  Powell vs. Brainard, and what it means for crypto  Economists have previously stated that differences between the two candidates’ positions – on both digital-asset regulation and economic policy – are so slight and finely nuanced that either choice likely wouldn’t have made a huge difference for the industry or cryptocurrency markets.  Despite Brainard being more outspoken about cryptocurrencies out of the two, generally speaking, both share a conviction that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed to grow unfettered to the point where they might threaten the existing financial system.  Moreover, both candidates were seen as monetary policy “doves” – meaning they would likely be more tolerant of inflation, if given a choice. That might be a positive for bitcoin given the cryptocurrency’s use by many investors as a hedge against rising prices.  The price of bitcoin has barely changed on Monday, hanging around $58,000, while ether, the native token of Ethereum, held its ground around $4,200.  Traders in traditional markets seem to have taken the news as a positive, with the S&P 500 up about 0.7% in early trading on Monday.  Powell was appointed as Fed chairman by then President Donald Trump and took office in February 2018, for a four-year term ending in February 2022.

42411147,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kbg,1637591400,How Misinformation on ‘Book Twitter’ Killed a Literary NFT Project,"Once upon a time, there was a wasteland teeming with deadly monsters and dark magic. The only thing stopping the wasteland’s evil forces from escaping was a magical wall maintained by five kingdoms. But as war brewed, the wall began to crumble.  What happens next? That’s for you to decide.  At least, that was the initial plan for “Realms of Ruin,” a collaborative storytelling project helmed by former Facebook executive Julie Zhuo and a team of best-selling young adult (YA) fantasy and science-fiction authors. Marie Lu, Tahereh Mafi, Ransom Riggs, Adam Silvera, David Yoon and Nicola Yoon were all signed on.  The established authors involved in the project planned to kick-start the story with origin lore and 12 character backstories, and then hand over the reins to the “Realms of Ruin” community for dreaming up new characters and story lines within the universe.  Built on the Solana blockchain, fans could mint their stories as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), buy and trade character art NFTs and talk with one another on Discord about the universe they were building. The authors would, according to an archived version of the project’s now-defunct website, “be reading closely to decide which stories and characters are compelling enough to become canon.”  Essentially author-approved fan fiction for the Web 3 age, “Realms of Ruin” seemed exciting and ambitious – some even described it as inevitable – until a teaser for the project launched on Twitter and Instagram on Oct. 20.  Instead of eager fans, the authors were met with suspicion that quickly turned to collective anger.  The online writing community banded together to discuss the apparent dangers of the project. Twitter users decried the environmental impact of NFTs, accused the authors of running a Ponzi scheme and a grift to steal contributors’ intellectual property and debated the morality of marketing the project to minors.  In less than five hours, “Realms of Ruin” was scrapped. The authors involved deleted their earlier announcements and replaced them with apologies. Before long, the apologies were deleted, too, along with other mentions of the project online. Book Twitter celebrated its victory.  No matter that Solana, a proof-of-stake blockchain, didn’t intersect at all with the environmental costs for which “Realms of Ruin” was being pilloried. Proof-of-work, the energy-intensive technology behind the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains that requires specialized computers to “mine” new coins, has long drawn the ire of crypto skeptics. Proof-of-stake has no such mechanism.  The controversy revealed a rich vein of mainstream distrust of crypto projects, especially when environmental impact is involved. It also showed there’s no room for technical nuance in the heat of online battle.  ‘Climate’ catastrophe  The negative reaction to “Realms of Ruin” was nearly instantaneous. Book Twitter expressed a range of issues with the project, the most common of which was the environmental impact of NFTs.  Legitimate concerns gave way to hyperbole and misunderstandings as fans condemned the “absolute climate carnage of NFTs.”  When Marie Lu, one of the authors involved with the project, tweeted that the Solana blockchain was “eco-friendly” and asked people to “Please do your homework before spreading misinformation,” fans mocked her.  Read more: What Is Proof-of-Stake?  “Marie Lu really said no babe, my NFTs only burn down a *quarter* of the Amazon rainforest, check your facts,” one account tweeted.  When confused Twitter users asked for explanations of why NFTs were so bad, other members of the online writing community stepped in to explain, offering tweets and explainer threads that often cited articles about proof-of-work mining – if they cited anything at all.  Crypto insiders were quickly outmatched.  “It started with an assumption that Solana was incredibly destructive to the environment, which is not true,” Austin Federa, head of communications at Solana Labs, told CoinDesk. “Full stop, it takes about 10 times as much energy to boil water from room temperature than it takes to mint an NFT on Solana.”  A source close to the project who asked not to be named told CoinDesk that Solana was chosen for its comparative sustainability.  Despite this, the source said the team still anticipated pushback about NFTs, which prompted them to add a section to the “Realms of Ruin” website about Solana’s energy usage.  The site read: “While many popular NFT platforms use the Ethereum blockchain which consumes large amounts of energy and is extremely expensive, the Solana blockchain has transaction costs below $0.01 and is very energy efficient. In fact, in the time you spent reading this, your body has burnt more calories in energy than it takes to mint a story on the Solana blockchain!”  But fans remained suspicious of Solana’s environmental impact. Rumors of the project being a scheme to pump Solana’s native SOL token exploded when one Twitter user pointed out a small rise in the coin’s price that correlated with the “Realms of Ruin” teaser announcement.  “There’s never been an NFT project on Solana whose volume was significant enough to impact trading,” Federa said.  Minting doesn’t cost a mint  Misunderstandings about the cost to mint an NFT on Solana also swirled through Book Twitter.  The now-deleted “Realms of Ruin” announcement teased a “robust collection of original character NFTs” (though the price of these NFTs was never listed or otherwise made clear to potential participants), and touted the “low transaction costs of Solana.”  With little information to go on, fans on Twitter began to speculate as to the cost of minting NFTs. On the project’s Discord, which has also been deleted, potential participants asked moderators to explain the process of minting NFTs.  “From what I’ve understood from the post in #announcements, you pay to have the story turned into an NFT,” one user wrote.  “So, you’re basically paying to upload your story?” another asked.  On Twitter, some users speculated that it could cost up to $300 to mint an NFT on Solana. To be fair, such fees are not unheard of on Ethereum, where transaction fees are much higher.  “The average cost to mint and use an NFT on Solana is approximately 35 cents,” Federa told CoinDesk. “From a transaction fee perspective, the cost of actually issuing and setting up an NFT or transferring it to someone is pennies.”  Discord users pushed back against moderators, and pointed out that the majority of crypto exchanges require customers to be over the age of 18. On Twitter, they denounced the immorality of marketing the project to teenagers (despite over half of young adult literature readers being, well, adults).  A Discord moderator called “redshirt” tried to quell fans’ rising panic about the mining costs by telling them that there were tentative plans to establish a treasury that would be filled by a percentage of proceeds from each NFT sold – both the character NFTs and the NFTs of the stories themselves.  “We’re hoping to have a way for people who can’t purchase SOL to request a small amount from our shared treasury for minting stories,” redshirt wrote. “That way anyone with a story to tell can create it. More info to come soon.”  But the promise of “more info to come’' didn’t sit well with fans. Before long the authors involved with the project were getting what Federa described as “serious threats” from upset fans.  “My understanding is they got like, not death threats, but like, ‘You’re a horrible person, you’re ruining people’s lives, you’re selling out…’ Like real vicious betrayal stuff,” Federa said.  Who retains the IP?  Potential participants also expressed concerns about the lack of clarity as to who would own the copyright and intellectual property on any stories published within the “Realms of Ruin” universe.  Conflicting information on the “Realms of Ruin” website seems to have been the source for the majority of users’ fears. One disclaimer gave copyright to the six authors involved, but in the website’s FAQ section, the project’s leaders assert that fans “truly own the stories you write, we will help you mint (publish) your stories as NFTs. Once you have minted an NFT, we can never take it away from you.”  “This does feel like a witch hunt, done in a way that was really, really unhelpful.”  According to Moish Peltz, a New York-based attorney who specializes in the intersection of NFTs and intellectual property, original works of authorship are covered by copyright protection laws the moment they are created and fixed in a tangible form – like NFTs – but the nature of fan fiction makes “Realms of Ruin” a more complicated case.  “However, once [the participants] are given permission to create the derivative works, they would presumably maintain ownership of their derivative works, unless there was some agreement to the contrary,” said Peltz.  CoinDesk’s source seconded this, and explained that the team intended to create a profit tree structure that would give varying percentages of any money generated from NFT sales to authors involved in a given story line – both the professional authors who kick-started the project, and the participants who created NFT stories in the “chain.”  However, this profit tree was never fully fleshed out or detailed on the “Realms of Ruin” website, which added to fans’ confusion.  Participants also expressed concerns about hypothetical future copyright issues, like how participants would be rewarded if “Realms of Ruin” was ever made into a movie or television series.  According to Peltz, there was some validity in participants’ fears.  “Nothing in [the ‘Realms of Ruin’ FAQ] speaks to what rights the project might have to use the submitted fan fiction and what rights might be reserved to authors, nor whether participants could expect to receive any financial considerations for the contributions of their fan fiction to the project,” Peltz told CoinDesk.  Questions in the Discord piled up faster than redshirt could answer, and users began speculating and answering each other’s questions. It quickly became clear that redshirt and the other moderators simply didn’t have answers to a lot of the participants’ questions.  “NFTs and copyright are still the wild west,” redshirt wrote in response to a user comment about copyright issues. “But we want to act in good faith and take feedback from you all to make this fair and a success.”  But promises of good faith did nothing to staunch the flow of questions or the eddying fears in the Discord.  Tech or culture?  Aside from the six established authors associated with the effort, the names of the people involved with the project were never posted on the “Realms of Ruin” website. Zhuo – the former Facebook VP – seems to have spearheaded the project.  In a now-deleted Medium post, Zhuo wrote that she’d been inspired by Loot, the text-based fantasy NFT game.  “NFTs are in a renaissance,” Zhuo wrote. “But something seemed missing. Stories.”  Read more: The Latest NFT Fad Is a Text-Based Fantasy Game Building Block  Despite the involvement of the established authors, “Realms of Ruin” appears to have operated as a tech venture rather than a publishing one. And unlike the dynamic and ever-changing tech industry, the publishing industry is known for its adherence to tradition and distrust of new technologies.  In retrospect, it seems as though Zhuo and her team had an abundance of enthusiasm and a partially fleshed-out idea when the announcement dropped (although to be fair, the announcement came over two weeks ahead of the project’s planned release date, and the team could have figured out the sticking points before then).  CoinDesk’s source said that no one on the team was expecting the hostility that the announcement was met with. But, in hindsight, the lack of clarity mixed with the tech-averse nature of the book community made “Realms of Ruin” a recipe for disaster.  Could Web 3 fix publishing?  Lia Holland, the campaigns and communications director at Fight for the Future – a non-profit that advocates for digital rights like privacy and net neutrality – was one of the first to step into the fray and defend Zhuo and the “Realms of Ruin” team.  Holland, who is unaffiliated with the project, found out about “Realms of Ruin” not through her work with Fight for the Future, but through her speculative fiction writers’ group.  As an author herself, Holland was appalled by Book Twitter’s knee-jerk reaction to what she saw as an innovative and potentially transformative approach to publishing.  Holland’s tweets also called attention to the rampant misinformation spreading on Twitter:  “All these threads I’m reading are like ‘I don’t know anything about NFTs, please don’t make me learn. But I KNOW they are awful and going to melt the planet. No, I’m not reading the website to learn about how little energy their set up would use,’” she wrote.  In a Fight for the Future podcast released the day after the project’s cancellation, Holland broke down the drama with her coworker, Ayele B. Hunt.  According to Hunt, Book Twitter’s “nuclearly reactive” response to “Realms of Ruin” wasn’t totally unexpected.  “Authors have been betrayed at every turn by the existing actors,” Hunt said, referring to Amazon and the traditional publishing industry. “Their suspicion of new things has a foundation in fact. These gatekeepers have toxified and toxified the space … and put investors over artists to the point that anything new can look like a scam.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Holland reiterated Hunt’s point.  “Authors and people in the publishing space have been deeply betrayed, over and over again, by the existing structures they work in,” Holland said. “There’s been so much consolidation and concentration and lessening of resources for authors. The space, especially for people who are not published, is often full of traps and scams.”  The deep well of skepticism is merited, she said.  However, Holland remained emphatic that Book Twitter’s immediate negative reaction to the “Realms of Ruin” announcement was uncalled for.  “This does feel like a witch hunt, done in a way that was really, really unhelpful and didn’t create enough space to have a conversation about this platform and what it was trying to do,” she said.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/22/how-book-twitter-misinformation-killed-a-literary-nft-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ace09f797e36b1590daae02ad2a0ce217d8d8a17-4961x3508.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413877,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlrVs,1637591067,ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF Wins ‘First Mover Advantage’ as VanEck Launch Falls Flat,"VanEck investments’ newly listed bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw limited uptake when it launched last week. Some analysts say that’s unsurprising because a rival bitcoin futures ETF launched by ProShares several weeks earlier appears to have enjoyed a first-mover advantage.  As of Friday, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (stock ticker BITO) had net assets of $1.4 billion. In October, it was the first bitcoin futures ETF to go live in the U.S. after it won regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Those assets dwarf the $57 million for Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures ETF (ticker BTF), launched a few days later, and the $8.7 million reported for the VanEck ETF, which didn’t come to market until last week.  The ProShares ETF held onto its dominance even though it’s a more expensive investment vehicle, with a net expense ratio, at 0.95%, compared with VanEck ETF’s (ticker XBTF), 0.65%.  “It is harder to gain traction when you come to market weeks later,” Todd Rosenbluth, the head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research, told CoinDesk.  ProShares $1 billion  The first-mover advantage is evident based on trading volume.  When VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF started trading last week on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, it drew only around $5 million of first-day trading volume.  The ProShares ETF, by contrast, hit a trading volume of about $1 billion by the end of its first day.  Deborah Fuhr, managing partner and founder of ETFGI, which tracks the ETF industry, said that “there is a significant first-mover advantage in the ETFs and ETPs (exchange-traded product) business.  “First mover takes most of the assets and trading volume,” she said. “This is a phenomenon that has existed in the U.S. for many years.”  Bitcoin ETFs  The cool reception for XBTF looks like a double disappointment for the sponsor, because VanEck’s application for a spot bitcoin ETF – which is backed by actual units of the cryptocurrency rather than by futures contracts – was rejected by the SEC on Nov. 12.  Valkyrie Funds CEO Leah Wald said the Van Eck ETF launch may have simply been a victim of bad timing as it began trading during a broad sell-off in digital asset markets. Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell about 10% in the seven days through Sunday, the biggest weekly decline in two months.  The ProShares ETF, by contrast, started just as bitcoin was pressing toward a new all-time high of just below $69,000.  “The factors that contributed to the down market had nothing to do with them and can be chalked up to nothing more than a bit of bad luck,” Wald said. “Let’s not forget that other much larger asset managers were unable to achieve launching such a product. Bringing a BTC futures fund to market is a victory on its own. Unlike those firms, Van Eck at least has a seat at the table.”  She stressed that creating an ETF is about much more than just day one, adding that Valkyrie Funds continues to see “robust demand in BTF.”  “Since the moment we launched our fund, we expected this to be about more than launch day, and continue to believe that is the case,” Wald said.  She added that there clearly is demand for exposure to bitcoin in a regulated vehicle and doesn’t expect that enthusiasm to wane anytime soon.  “Winning hearts and minds is a long-term effort,” Wald said. “We are still in the top of the first inning.”  Key Bitcoin Price Level at $60K  The launch of VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF was “unexpectedly later than announced,” and so it’s possible that investors who were interested in a bitcoin futures ETF had already placed their bets, said Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital, a crypto trading advisory firm.  “This is a temporary glitch coupled with the higher volatility of bitcoin, which has scared new and existing investors as BTC dropped from its high and broke below the important $60K level,” he said. “So for now, new investors are holding back on what could lead to further downward pressures.”  Read more: VanEck Bitcoin Futures ETF Finds Cool Reception",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Tanzeel Akhtar,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/22/proshares-bitcoin-futures-etf-wins-first-mover-advantage-as-vaneck-launch-falls-flat,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7bc542fdcfdc8544c3bc8ebc3e4a107941e69432-1920x1247.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funds will be used to hire people, expand geographic coverage and add more payment methods.  Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay’s co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk in an interview that the firm will also be looking at mergers and acquisitions.  “There are companies that can help us move faster in certain geographies or help improve certain components of the infrastructure stack,” Soto-Wright said. “We want to bring a billion people into the crypto economy by 2030. We can do that faster by partnering with other companies.”  How it works  MoonPay’s payment infrastructure lets people exchange traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies for each other using all major payment methods, including debit and credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. The platform supports more than 90 cryptocurrencies and over 30 fiat currencies.  MoonPay handles the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) checks to verify a customer’s identity, partnering with vendors around the world to ensure compliance with local regulations. MoonPay also shoulders the time and financial costs of potential chargebacks or fraudulent crypto transactions.  Soto-Wright started his career on the institutional side of finance before leaving to found an automated savings business that was later sold. He then teamed up with MoonPay co-founder Victor Faramond to address the limited functionality of crypto wallets at the time. The efforts attracted the attention of Bitcoin.com, which wanted to make it easier for customers to buy bitcoin, and the first MoonPay integration was born in 2019. A checkout widget followed, which has become the flagship product.  Funding round  MoonPay has been bootstrapped and profitable since its founding, having processed more than $2 billion in transactions to date, but growth has accelerated significantly over the past year. MoonPay says transaction volume has increased by 35 times since 2020 and the staff has grown from five to over 130. Soto-Wright said a funding round attracting “some of the world’s best investors” will help scale the business further.  Other participants in the round included returning backer Blossom Capital and new investors Paradigm, NEA and Thrive.  “We are excited about the opportunity in crypto, but one of the challenges to mainstream adoption is offering the same seamless experience that users have come to expect from modern internet products. MoonPay has impressed us with its product, infrastructure and execution,” said Coatue Managing Partner Kris Fredrickson in a press release.  NFT ambitions  “The next stage of where we’re going is really trying to focus on a new emerging movement around [non-fungible tokens], which we think are going to be a very big area where more and more people will be onboarded into the crypto economy,” Soto-Wright told CoinDesk.  In that vein, MoonPay is working on a way to streamline the checkout process on NFT marketplaces. MoonPay has started to roll this product out in beta testing with several partners, including OpenSea, Binance and Dapper Labs.  MoonPay’s NFT ambitions received a high-profile endorsement last week. In a new music video, musician Post Malone can be seen purchasing a Bored Ape NFT using MoonPay.

The “addressable U.S. consumer expenditure to monetize is large … at $8trln,” and the bank sees “~$5 [trillion] of consumer expenditure that could be digitized faster from more immersive experiences.”  Facebook (overweight rated) is the most obvious way to invest in the space, according to the report written by lead equities analyst Brian Nowak, and any success it has in building and monetizing the metaverse is “all upside and would be another layer-cake of multi-year monetization.”  In October, Facebook announced it was changing its corporate name to Meta, signaling its plan to refocus on the metaverse.  Nowak also said he favors the following companies with exposure to the metaverse theme: Roblox (overweight), Alphabet (overweight), Snap (overweight) and Unity Software (equal weight).  Adoption of the metaverse won’t be easy and will take some time, the note cautions, as existing digital media and e-commerce platforms are robust and improving all the time, which means that any metaverse will need to “partner to drive adoption.”  “American daily users already spend the total equivalent of ~11 [billion] days per year consuming digital media,” which are seen as “metaverse hours to capture,” the report says.  The metaverse has the potential to grow digital payments volumes but Morgan Stanley sees the revenue opportunity as smaller and occuring over the longer term, as the “challenge here is that the uncertain long-term regulatory environment around crypto creates more uncertainty about how large this monetization opportunity could be.”  UPDATE (Nov. 22 15:48 a.m.): Adds Facebook name change in the fourth paragraph.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Will Canny,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/22/morgan-stanley-sees-facebook-as-best-stock-to-gain-exposure-to-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4cb106fe2757bda9b58b8ab3fa594cbbbc16be44-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Metaverse gaming and non-fungible tokens could represent a revenue opportunity of 50 billion euros for the luxury market by 2030, Morgan Stanley said. That would be 10% of the total addressable market.  ”NFTs and social gaming present two near-term opportunities for luxury brands, allowing them to monetize their vast IP (intellectual property) built over decades,” the report says. Dolce & Gabbana’s sale of nine NFTs for $5.7 million last month shows the huge potential for “virtual and hybrid luxury goods,” and the bank estimates that the total NFT market will grow to around $300 billion by 2030.  By 2030, luxury brands could expand their total addressable market by more than 10% and industry earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by about 25%. Demand for NFT collectibles will lead to strong demand for luxury goods in the medium term, analysts led by Edward Stanley said in the report.  Morgan Stanley notes that luxury goods companies are already exploring collaborations with gaming and metaverse platforms, with an increasing number of revenue sharing deals. The firm said that could add $10 billion to $20 billion to the luxury sector’s total addressable market.  France-based Kering, the owner of such luxury brands as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, is best placed to take advantage of the metaverse because of its “brand demographics and given head start in innovative digital collaborations,” Morgan Stanley said.

SHIB accounted for 6.72% of the total turnover on the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange, slipping to third position behind bitcoin and ether, Coinbase Institutional’s weekly email dated Nov. 19 shows.  The self-proclaimed “dogecoin killer” topped Coinbase’s volume rankings in the preceding two weeks, contributing 16.6% to total activity in the seven days to Nov. 11 and 25% in the seven days to Nov. 5.  “In terms of the volume breakdown, BTC and ETC have reclaimed the top spots while SHIB is still in the third place for now as the retail meme coin mania cools off,” Coinbase institutional said in the weekly newsletter dated Nov. 19.  That said, SHIB is still ahead of prominent cryptocurrencies like programmable blockchains Solana’s and Polkadot’s SOL and DOT tokens, scaling solution Polygon’s MATIC cryptocurrency, and decentralized oracle network Chainlink’s native coin LINK.  The retail-dominated token has consistently been one of the top three traded coins since the second week of October.  SHIB picked up a strong bid in the second half of the last month after bitcoin set new record highs above the April high of $64,889. The meme token reached a new peak price of $0.00008894 on Oct. 28, ending the month with an 830% gain.  Many analysts saw SHIB’s surge as a sign of retail frenzy often observed at broader market tops. The dog-themed cryptocurrency’s parabolic run in early May was followed by a market-wide sell-off, which saw bitcoin falling from $58,000 to $30,000 within a week.  History looks to have repeated itself in the past few weeks. Bitcoin fell to a five-week low of $55,666 on Nov. 19, having failed several times to establish a foothold above the April high of $64,889 since mid-October.  With speculative fervor cooling, market attention may shift back to bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. SHIB was trading near $0.00004530 at press time, representing a 32% month loss.
