42377068,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4uR,1395874871,CoinDesk Launches Chinese Yuan Bitcoin Price Index,"CoinDesk has created a new Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) based on the price and volume of bitcoins exchanged for Chinese yuan (CNY).  The new Chinese yuan BPI is separate from the existing and widely referenced CoinDesk USD index, which CoinDesk will continue to maintain.  The USD index and CNY index will complement each other by providing the most trusted bitcoin price in the two most commonly exchanged national currencies.  Bitcoin’s wild ride in China  The rise of bitcoin in China was a one of the big stories and catalysts in the latter half of 2013.  Near the end of last year, CNY trading volume at Beijing-based BTC China surpassed the USD trading taking place at the leading exchanges of that time (by USD volume) – Mt. Gox and Bitstamp (see Chart 1).  However, following China's restrictions on bitcoin transactions with banks in December, bitcoin trading in China suffered a significant setback. Bitcoin trading in USD was once again seen as returning to dominance.  Is USD bitcoin volume still dominant?  Today, many sites which track overall bitcoin trading volumes show total bitcoin volume in USD as leading CNY trading by a very wide margin.  For example, Chart 2 below from the widely-referenced site Bitcoincharts.com shows USD and CNY share of total bitcoin volume at 83% and 11%, respectively.  Another widely referenced site for bitcoin prices and volume, BitcoinAverage.com, also tells a very similar story (Table 1).  USD bitcoin trading share has fallen  However, contrary to the figures shown on Bitcoincharts.com, BitcoinAverage.com, and other sties, CoinDesk believes that bitcoin trading in CNY may be underreported by a significant margin (Chart 3).  The above Chart 3 depicts the self-reported volume from five leading exchanges trading bitcoin in USD and CNY as shown below in Table 2.  The difference CoinDesk calculates for bitcoin trading market share – compared to what is shown on Bitcoincharts.com and BitcoinAverage.com – regards CNY trading, not USD trading.  The vast majority of USD bitcoin trading is taking place on just the top three exchanges: Bitstamp, BTC-e and Bitfinex. These three exchanges represent over 99%+ of total USD volume. CoinDesk’s USD figures more-or-less agree with BitcoinCharts.com and BitcoinAverage.com  Where CoinDesk respectfully disagrees with BitcoinCharts.com and BitcoinAverage.com (among other sites) is on completely excluding some Chinese CNY exchanges when calculating overall trading volume market share.  The problem of validating trading volume  In the past, there have been reports that Chinese exchanges have fabricated trading volume figures. These reports have included OKCoin, which is featured in the CoinDesk market share figures above.  The reason why an exchange might want to fabricate trading data is quite simple: the more volume an exchange appears to have, the more likely it is that liquidity-seeking traders will be attracted to that particular exchange.  What makes inflating volume data even more tempting is that, unlike bitcoin price data, there is no outside independent method available to easily verify exchange reported volume data.  It was for this reason that CoinDesk has been reluctant to launch a CNY index in the past.  Trading volume at BTC China and OKCoin  As the bitcoin exchange market matures, one can imagine a day when independent auditors will verify reported volume data, similar to how professional accounting firms certify the public financial statements for corporations.    In the meantime, the closest approximation we have to independent auditors are venture capital firms, which are investing in various bitcoin exchanges.    Recently, OKCoin reportedly received a major investment of $10m from several VC firms. Prior to this BTC China also received a $5m investment from a reputable firm (Lightspeed).  The closest approximation we have to independent audits are the venture capital firms investing funds in various bitcoin exchanges. We can reasonably expect that, given how important volume data is to the value of an exchange investment, that these venture firms audited both BTC China's and OKCoin’s internal volume records as part of their due diligence process.  There is another recent development which provides a greater degree of comfort with OKCoin's volume figures, which is BTC China’s announcement that it would be following OKCoin’s approach of charging zero commission on trading. CoinDesk views this shift in BTC China’s strategy as evidence that OKCoin’s zero commission approach is having a competitive impact on BTC China’s business.  For these reasons the CNY index will initially include BTC China and OKCoin.  What about Huobi?  There is another Chinese exchange which reports significant volume which is roughly on par with OKCoin, and that is Huobi.  Like OKCoin, there have been reports that Huobi has fabricated trading data. However, Huobi has not to our knowledge received a large investment from a reputable venture firm. Hence, for the time being we are not including Huobi in the new CNY index.  If we were to include Huobi in the earlier total market share calculation we can see how Huobi would substantially increase the total CNY share of trading from 70% to 81% (Charts 4 and 5).  CNY BPI launches today  In addition to the significant volume of bitcoins which are exchanged for CNY, events (or rumors) from China are once again having a material influence on bitcoin.  Overall, while there are reasons to be skeptical of self-reported bitcoin volumes, China is clearly a very important market for bitcoin, and CoinDesk feels it is important to launch a dedicated CNY Bitcoin Price Index.  The CNY index will be calculated in the same manner as the USD index, meaning it will be based on prices and volumes for bitcoins traded exclusively for CNY (just as the USD index is based solely on USD trades). In this way the two CoinDesk BPIs reflect a true bitcoin market price, not an artificial or blended price derived from another exchange rate.  Look for the CNY index in the upper right corner of the CoinDesk homepage and explore our BPI page for CNY index charts, alongside other analytical tools and raw data today.

42377052,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4Z3,1395874397,SecondMarket's Barry Silbert: 15% of Institutional Investors are Bitcoin Believers,"If the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum wasn't on the radar of bitcoin enthusiasts coming into the week of 24th March, all this changed when SecondMarket and Bitcoin Investment Trust CEO Barry Silbert sent out a tweet that quickly reverberated throughout the community on social media.  Silbert  indicated on Sunday, 23rd March that 38 institutional investors representing more than $250bn in investment capital were to meet with him at the event. The topic? Bitcoin and the future of digital currencies.    Requests from 38 institutional investors representing +$250 billion to meet with me re bitcoin at Barclays Emerging Payments Forum tomorrow      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) March 23, 2014    Held on 24th and 25th March, the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum featured talks from traditional payments institutions such as TSYS and Visa.  But Silbert, who spoke twice at the event himself, indicated the conference also reflected the increase in awareness about bitcoin and its potential to disrupt the established order in the payments industry  Three objectives  The investors he met with, Silbert said, had three objectives: to learn more about bitcoin, to better understand how to invest in the ecosystem, and lastly, to find out how their existing investments could be threatened by the ascent of bitcoin.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Silbert revealed it was perhaps this last objective that intrigued him most. He noted that a lot of the investors he spoke to were involved in the public market, and that they tended to have positions in companies like MasterCard, MoneyGram, WesternUnion and Visa.  Said Silbert:  ""They were all trying to figure out what effect digital currency was going to have in their holdings in one or all of those incumbents.""  The result was that Silbert painted the picture of an industry that, while still on the fence about bitcoin's ability to gain mass adoption, is preparing seriously for such an outcome.  The meetings by the numbers  Silbert's assessment was that many of the investors he met with have yet to decide whether they believe digital currencies will have a bright future in finance.  Silbert explained how he replicated an experiment he routinely performs during his speeches at the meetings, asking the investors to tell him whether they were skeptics, believers or still waiting for more information to decide their feelings toward the digital currency ecosystem.  Said Silbert:  ""Of all the folks that I met with, 21% were skeptical, 15% were believers. The rest - 64% - were still learning.""  The results surprised Silbert, particularly the low number of skeptics. He added: ""Usually when I do speeches, I'll see skeptics skew 50% or higher.""  Of course, he acknowledged that these investors weren't necessarily indicative of where the payments industry is on the whole. For example, these investors requested meetings with him, and a handful, he said, own bitcoin personally.  Notably, about one-third of the investors Silbert met with have already asked for a follow-up meeting or a follow-up call, and Silbert projects that more may do so in the days and weeks ahead.  Investors list major concerns  In total, Silbert had 18 meetings, some with as few as one investor, others with as many as four. As a result of this extensive process, Silbert indicated he was able to get a sense of why these investors have so far stayed out of the digital currency ecosystem, and the findings are positive for the bitcoin community.  Explained Silbert:  ""A lot of them manage money for vehicles that invest only in public companies, and since there are no public ways for them to invest in bitcoin, there has not been an opportunity for them to deploy that money.""  Silbert expects this to soon change, and that the Bitcoin Investment Trust, once it trades on the public market via OTCQX in Q4, will play a key role.  Added Silbert: ""Most of them said that [the Bitcoin Investment Trust] would be eligible for them to invest if they chose to invest in bitcoin.""  Yet another reason, however, was that both bitcoin the currency and digital currency companies remain small time compared to their usual investments.  Said Silbert:  ""Some of them are so big that they typically don't get involved until they can put a minimum of $25m to $50m to work.""  Bitcoin is next Western Union, not Visa  Silbert also received feedback from the investors on what they believe to be bitcoin's potential to interrupt the payments space. Overall, he said, investors feel that bitcoin threatens established remittance and money order providers such as Western Union and MoneyGram.  Said Silbert:  ""The consensus was that if bitcoin is going to be successful it will have a bigger effect on the Western Union/Moneygram business, whereas people feel like Visa/MasterCard, given the brand and depth of distribution, they see there's less of a near-term threat.""  Still, it should be noted that replacing these companies will be no small feat. Western Union, has noted it is watching the digital currency markets, no doubt in some small part to see whether it will threaten its $9bn market cap.

42377058,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6x4hr,1395870720,Chamath Palihapitiya: Bitcoin is Moving Past 'Amateur Hour',"In a wide-ranging, pointedly honest and often funny on-stage interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek writer Brad Stone at CoinSummit San Francisco on Wednesday, 26th March, venture capitalist and former Facebook and AOL executive Chamath Palihapitiya reflected on the future of bitcoin and on the changes the bitcoin ecosystem is undergoing right now.    Though he had just flown in from Toronto for day two of CoinSummit San Francisco, Chamath Palihapitiya immediately opened his fireside chat on 26th March with a quote that arguably summed up the feeling of the conference, saying ""I feel like I've traveled to Mecca"" in a quip that garnered laughs from the packed crowd.      BusinessWeek's Brad Stone followed by asking Palihapitiya to bring the audience up to speed on his recent investments, and he quickly illustrated that he remains bullish on bitcoin, stating his belief that ""everyone in the world should have 1% of their assets in bitcoin"".      Palihapitiya took big topics head on out of the gate, dismissing all other digital currencies by emphasizing that his previous statement referred only to bitcoin, not other alternative currencies, and stating that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance issued on 25th March was in fact a boon not just for the industry, but for the general investing public.      ""For anyone who thinks this is a bad thing, it's actually a really good thing. There has been tax policy that has been exploited by rich people for years that have allowed us to wash taxes on anything we own.""            Has-beens and also-rans  The troubles of Mt.Gox and several other recently failed bitcoin companies are ""awesome for bitcoin,"" Palihapitiya said.  ""We've got to flush out all the has-beens and also-rans. There's a bunch of amateur hour bullshit in the bitcoin ecosystem.""  ""They will get replaced by a more systematic approach to problem-solving, the right checks and balances, the right regulatory participation,"" he said. ""The fact that the price stabilized after is even more important, because it shows the growing maturity of the bitcoin market,"" Palihapitiya added.  CoinSummit, has a more business-focused mood than some past bitcoin events, with a notable absence of panels on libertarianism or floating extra-national communities.  This shift is exactly what bitcoin needs, Palihapitiya asserted.  ""All of the folks that want to have a libertarian bent or some other political agenda and strap it in on top of bitcoin – it's really bad for us. You need to replace them with people who have a technological motive or a financial motive.""  Bitcoin's apolitical agenda  Palihapitiya made it clear that this is an important point to him, returning to it when asked about his biggest worries as a bitcoin investor:    ""We need to divorce ourselves from all the political rhetoric. I don't think this is meant to be a mechanism to evade taxes, a mechanism to push back on government structure.      If we can drop the ego-driven part of wanting to thumb our nose at the establishment, then what we're left with is actually a Trojan horse that replaces the establishment. And that's good enough.""    What he is not concerned about is the use of bitcoin for illicit transactions, like on the now-defunct Silk Road marketplace.  In the future, Palihapitiya said, bitcoin will be more crime- and terrorism-resistant than cash, because it will likely get to a place where bitcoin addresses are associated with real names – or even Facebook accounts. But even right now, US dollars are used for more illicit purposes than bitcoins, he stated.  ""The CIA drops bushels full of money at the feet of Afghan warlords. What do you think they're doing with that, buying bread and fucking cheese? That's not what they're doing with it. They're harvesting heroin and killing people.""  Golden State Warrior  Palihapitya swore freely during his interview, usually drawing chuckles from a clearly admiring crowd. Stone jokingly asked when Palihapitiya, a partial owner of the NBA franchise the Golden State Warriors, would start accepting bitcoin for ticket sales.  ""We're working on a stadium, and are about to plow three-quarters of a billion dollars into the San Francisco economy. ... As soon as we figure that out, we'll talk to BitPay,"" he said.  Becoming more serious, Palihapitiya said that big retailers such as Walmart will eventually want to accept bitcoin because it will cut their credit card processing costs and provide customers with fraud protection.  Here are some of the other topics Palihapitiya touched on in his lively conversation with Stone.  On Mark Zuckerberg's opinion of bitcoin:  ""I think he thinks it's cool. I don't think they're going to do anything in the near term. I'm speculating. Here's a great thing that would be awesome, is if Facebook figured out how to partner or launch a secure wallet, and then how to apply their identity on top of it to create a whitespace within the blockchain so that transactions, buying between people who were willing to be named, have some mechanism to have an easier way of doing things, acknowledged by governments and tax authorities, etc. That would be a game changer for bitcoin overnight.""  On the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto:  ""Who cares? The only reason to care is because that person or group of people should be celebrated. ... We're all going to mythologize this now to kingdom come. It's almost better if this person or group of people never became public, because then it's really all of ours – and that's what we want.""  On why he advocates for everyone owning at least a little bitcoin:  ""When we look back after 30 years and these things are at $1m (dollars) a coin, I think it would be better if many people had shared in that appreciation instead of a few. That's why I'm so evangelical about it. You can own one bitcoin, you can own five, you can own a few satoshi. Everyone should just have a little taste of it.""

42397447,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Pdf,1395867488,"In a Doge-Eat-Doge World, Can Every Altcoin Survive?","The alternative currency sector is nascent but it provides a formidable opportunity for investors who are bullish on the concept of decentralized block chain systems with similar characteristics to bitcoin. A few experts in this area took the stage at CoinSummit San Francisco on Wednesday 26th March in a talk that included litecoin creator Charlie Lee, dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer and Paul Vernon of the altcoin exchange Cryptsy.  The session was moderated by Social Radius CEO Michael Terpin.    ________________________________________________________________________      In the near future, will we be tipping with dogecoin, spending 'loose change' with litecoin and making big payments with bitcoin? Instead of competing with each other, could cryptocurrencies work in harmony to each play a very specific role in the digital economy's future?      These and other questions for the potential of thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies formed the thrust of the CoinSummit panel titled, 'Altcoins - a fad or here to stay?'    Auroracoin  The timing of CoinSummit gave the panel a great opportunity to discuss auroracoin, the experimental altcoin aimed at providing the people of Iceland a digital option over the country's fiat denomination. Auroracoin starting distributing coins in its 'Airdrop' initiative just this week.  Michael Terpin, the panel's moderator, remarked: ""Auroracoin is fascinating. This week we had the Airdrop. And yet, they are down 30% today.""  Litecoin creator Charlie Lee added that while auroracoin has good intentions, it has probably not been able to capture the attention of the Icelandic public as a whole:  ""People aren’t educated about the coin. I think it’s important to educate and get merchants on board.""  Auroracoin's market performance over the last few days indicates that people are taking the coins and selling them on. Said Paul Vernon, CEO of Cryptsy: ""It’s just market driven. The fact that there is a drop is because people are getting rid of the coins.""  Vernon added that the fact there has been a major selloff means that many probably don't understand the intended impact or aim of auroracoin. ""I’m not sure the people who have received theses coins got any education other than ‘okay, here’s your coins’,"" he said.  A coin for everything  The idea that every cryptocurrency has a place in the ecosystem is a bullish view. Of late there has been much speculation that fragmentation could become a big problem. However, on the flipside many altcoins each specializing in one specific form or function may present a huge opportunity for the industry.  Lee says people see litecoin, for example, as the auxiliary currency for bitcoin: ""People view litecoin kind of as a backup to bitcoin. If bitcoin dies, there’s litecoin,"" he said.  Dogecoin creator Jackson Palmer says that transactions are most important for his altcoin. In his opinion, the number of people using his currency is the most important measuring stick for its success:  ""One doge equals one doge. Our goal is not to get the coin to $1,000; it is to get people to use it. It’s all about active use.""  Altcoins, at least for now, are very speculative by nature, even more so than bitcoin. Those looking for wild swings and extraordinary promise should think about altcoin investments:  ""Bitcoin is already speculative enough. But if you want something more speculative invest in altcoins,"" said Lee.

42397440,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PVn,1395863482,"Colombia Stops Short of Bitcoin Ban, Bars Banks From Industry","The Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (SFC), the government body responsible for overseeing financial systems in the South American nation, issued new guidance on its treatment of bitcoin and other digital currencies on Wednesday, 26th March.  Notably, the release was distributed one day after it was was originally expected on Tuesday, 25th March.  Despite reports that the SFC could enact harsh restrictions on bitcoin – one report suggested it would go so far as to ban bitcoin transactions altogether, the SFC issued what amounted to a boilerplate warning to consumers, and blocked financial institutions from holding, investing in or brokering bitcoin transactions.  Informal translations of the statements  , which were made public on the SFC website as Carta Circular 29, read:  ""The Bitcoin is an asset that has no equivalent statutory legal tender in Colombia since it was not recognized as currency in the country.""  The release indicated that bitcoin fails to meet the definition of a currency according to the criteria set forth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as it is not backed by a central bank.  Colombia's bitcoin warning  The SFC listed a host of concerns about bitcoin, naming the now-bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which imposed significant losses on users when it suddenly became insolvent earlier this year.  Further, the SFC reiterated that digital currencies can be used for illicit means, including money laundering and terrorist financing, and that users who are victims of theft are not able to achieve restitution through traditional means.  Read a translation of the warning:  ""This Office notes that supervised entities are not authorized to guard, invest or mediate these instruments. Additionally it is for people to know and accept the risks inherent in their operations with 'virtual currency' risks.""  Community reaction  Carlos Mesa, director of local digitcal currency avocacy group BitcoinColombia.org, spoke to CoinDesk about the news, noting that Colombia ended up adopting similar measures to those in China, a market where bitcoin is once again growing.  Said Mesa:  ""We see this with as something positive. I know many don't, but this may be the first step for Colombia take this topic more seriously, raise awareness and look forward to regulation.""  Roman Parra, of Colombia-based bitcoin buying and selling service provider Bitcoin Suramerica, also greeted the news as a positive for the local ecosystem, saying:  ""I think this is a good step on the right direction, because the goverment now recognizes that BTC exists and is helping us to make it public and avoiding in some way that unscrupulous people try to scam using it.""  Notably, Mesa had earlier scheduled a meeting with the SFC to be held this upcoming Friday, however, this has since been canceled. The local activist is, however, optimistic that he will have additional opportunities to work with the SFC as it explores the issue of digital currencies further.

42397463,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Pcg,1395861073,Bitcoin Exchange Leaders Look to Rebuild Trust in Aftermath of Mt. Gox,"Notable names from the digital currency exchange sector took the stage at CoinSummit San Francisco on Wednesday, 26th March in a talk that included Kraken CEO Jesse Powell and BTC China CEO Bobby Lee.  The session was moderated by Pantera Capital Management's Dan Morehead.  _______________________________________________________________  The spectacular failure of Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox was the inflection point for a discussion on bitcoin exchanges today at CoinSummit San Francisco.  The panel, which included Kraken CEO Jesse Powell and BTC China CEO Bobby Lee, focused on topics such as regulation, security and the path ahead for the new financial companies aiming to serve as access points for bitcoin consumers around the globe.  Problems remain  Both San Francisco-based Kraken and Beijing-based BTC China have been at the forefront of the effort to increase transparency in the bitcoin exchange sector following the bankruptcy of Mt. Gox, but the companies' top execs acknowledged more still needs to be done.  For example, Kraken recently released a proof-of-reserve audit that it told CoinDesk will be the first of more comprehensive assessments, while BTC China has openly talked about its banking issues in China.  It's this focus that has, in part, helped them grow into successful digital currency exchanges.  BTC China's Lee says that rival Chinese exchanges are engaging in misdirection, which in turn is confusing investors.  Explained Lee:  ""All exchanges in China are engaging in deceptive marketing practices, fake volume, fake liquidity.""  Phantom orders and flash crashes are big problems in China, said Lee:  ""Part of it has to do with culture. They think that it’s okay to do it if everyone else is. You just pad your bitcoins by 10,000, 20,000 BTC per day.""  Kraken's Jesse Powell pointed out that Mt. Gox may make all the headlines, but there have been persistent problems outside of that particular company. ""Many other exchanges have failed recently,"" he said.  Powell advocated for an independent resource where investors can get unbiased information about exchanges, saying:  ""I think that there needs to be a good resource out there, like a Consumer Reports or a Bitcoin Better Business Bureau.""  Regulatory pathways  Kraken just yesterday announced a $5m funding round, one that it plans to use to reinforce security and comply with US regulatory requirements.  Kraken's Powell addressed this need during the discussion, as well:  ""The cost of security alone is huge. Screwing it up is expensive, too.""  He added: ""The US has been difficult. In the EU, you need one license. In the US, you need 48 state licenses.""  Bobby Lee said that with the lack of regulation and transparency, no one really can tabulate the total losses that have happened. At least not yet.  Said Lee:  ""Since Mt. Gox, there have been a lot of crashes. A lot of people got hurt. The question is: Did the exchange experience a loss as well? These are the pitfalls of an unregulated industry.""  Powell believes that the concept of the distributed exchange could emerge as a result.  ""The ultimate way is some distributed exchange that nobody controls. I think that’s what the future is,"" said Powell. ""How you are going to regulate those guys I have no idea.""  New services  Distributed exchanges are one idea that may arise as a result of regulatory opacity. But right now, existing exchanges are going to mature and add new services in order to serve investors accustomed to traditional securities.  Margin trading, leverage trading or credit lines are options, said Lee.  ""Customers want that, they want the leverage. So I think it's an inevitable trend.""  Powell said that for Kraken, margin trading is “something we plan on offering soon. [But] we want to do it right.”  Another concept both CEOs talked about was the idea of localized exchanges in particular markets that can use an ECN-type system to provide liquidity from larger exchanges.  Local exchanges, they said, are important to adoption because those types of companies will be more familiar with particular markets.  Concluded Lee:  ""I do see a world with dozens or hundreds of exchanges with the liquidity being pooled. I do see that happening. I think that’s my prediction over the next few years.""

42397443,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PZj,1395856858,"Bitcoin ATM Maker Lamassu Reduces Delivery Times, Introduces Stand","Bitcoin ATM manufacturer Lamassu released a new newsletter update on 26th March indicating that it is on track to ship 200 bitcoin ATM machines to buyers by this May.  This figure is up from the roughly 14 it estimates were in operation as of last November.  Further, the company said will have at least one unit delivered to every continent by that time, though it said Antarctica would not be included.  The announcement also revealed the company's first bitcoin ATM accessory - a stand that will retail for $1,600 per unit.  Lamassu ATMs  have been popping up with increasing frequency around the globe as local entrepreneurs seek to gain access to the new and potentially lucrative part of the bitcoin space by building local networks of the machines.  New lead times  Lamassu has also notably reduced lead times. New Lamassu ATMs, the company says, will ship just eight weeks after an order is placed.  The company attributes the speed-up to its manufacturing team in Portugal.  Lamassu also introduced a stylish, minimalistic stand for its ATMs. The sleek stand is made using the same material and finish as the ATM.  Prices start at $1,600 per unit. Keep in mind that the ATM itself costs $5,000.  Discounts are available for those who buy multiple stands.  Some merchants had previously reported that custom stands took as long as two weeks to construct, a fact that added yet another consideration for those who wanted to install bitcoin ATM machines.  About Lamassu  Lamassu began accepting pre-orders for its ATMs back in August 2013. It shipped the first units in October and the next batch of 25 units shipped in November.

42397444,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PYk,1395849343,OKCoin CEO on Expansion and China's Competitive Edge,"Rui Ma is an early-stage investor in technology companies with the global accelerator program and seed fund 500 Startups. Residing in Beijing, she is an active member of China’s bitcoin community.  The second time I met with Star (Mingxing) Xu, it was at the same office building in the Shangdi district of Beijing, not too far away from where rival Huobi’s headquarters are located.  However, this time he had moved to a different floor, having outgrown his smaller quarters. Everything looked like it had been moved in a hurry, including the doorplate, which still read the name of the prior tenant, and everything, Star told me first thing as he struggled to find me a seat in his conference room doubling as an office for four, was about to be moved again.  At 60 employees, he needed more space, as evidenced by the staff members sitting elbow-to-elbow everywhere I could see, and he was going to move to yet another unit in the same building.  [post-quote]  It was a bit of a déjà vu moment for me as I'd had the exact same conversation with Leon Li of Huobi exactly two weeks earlier, almost to the hour.  It turns out that the two companies also have similar visions for expansion, except that Star might be on a slightly more accelerated timeline. His team, he claims, has already finished a bitcoin wallet product, ready with a merchant-facing API, and that it will officially be launched sometime next quarter.  Star was very emphatic about this, seemingly because he knew that Huobi’s Li had already publicly discussed his plans for international expansion to be happening in the second half of the year and not any earlier.  Through Star’s group of investors and friends, he already has convinced a handful to link up their services to the to-be-launched wallet, and is confident that he will be processing a significant amount of transactions very shortly after going live.  International expansion  When I asked him which geographic markets he would target first, he said that they were going to go after all the countries outside of China with equal fervour, and that thanks to the funding raised, he has a whole team of lawyers advising him as to the regulatory concerns of each jurisdiction.  On the subject of funding raised, he had some interesting commentary to provide. OKCoin recently announced that it had raised $10m in a Series A led by Ceyuan Ventures, a fund led by Bo Feng, a famous venture capitalist. Apparently Bo is personally a great fan of bitcoin, and has been investing in the asset for a while.  Said Star:  “He gave me a verbal offer after just a ten-minute meeting. When I told him I didn’t need this much money, he told me that I should plan for the long-term, and that bitcoin is a decade-long endeavour. I must say I got very lucky he is such a big supporter.”  Star had met Bo in other occasions, but they hadn’t done any official business until now, and those prior interactions helped to build trust.  When I asked him to speculate which venture capital firm might be behind the rumoured $10m in funding that rival Huobi has supposedly raised but not publicly announced, he threw out the name of a famous fund.  “They gave me an offer as well, but since I already had a term sheet from Ceyuan, I asked them to match it. Unfortunately, their price was lower, and so I’m pretty sure that fund went with Leon. Good choice.”  Speaking of the competition, Star had a lot of good things to say. Whereas the air was palpably tense the last time I saw him and Bobby Lee of BTC China in the same room as part of an event I co-organized, apparently they are all on friendly terms now.  “We try to get dinner when everyone’s in town and Bobby is really nice to me now.”  Competitive co-operation  As I learned later from Mr Jin, who produces and broadcasts a regular online video program that showcases bitcoin news and companies in China, it was supposedly Mark (Gang) Mai of VenturesLab, an angel investor in OKCoin, who got the heads of the exchanges (Huobi, OKCoin and BTC China) to get together on a somewhat regular basis and discuss the state of the market.  One of the first meetings, according to both Jin and Star, was to discuss the zero-transaction-fee model.  Star originally wanted to reinstate fees, but Leon of Huobi was adamant that his platform would be forever transaction fee-free, and so the situation has continued to today, where all the major exchanges do not charge transaction fees and BTC China in particular has wildly fluctuated its stance – much to the chagrin of Jin, who is tired of reporting on the subject.  For Star however, all that is water under the bridge.  While he agrees with his investor Mark that zero-fees is probably most hurtful for the small-time individual investor who does not have the ability to execute complicated bot trades, there isn’t much he can do to reverse what has already been accepted by the market as the norm.  “Leon has made his stance amply clear, and I am not going to go against it, because that would make our exchange uncompetitive. We will, instead, just have to find other ways to make money, such as through wallets, payments, and other value-added services.”  For example, the peer-to-peer lending product they have launched “makes money, and definitely helps defray our operational costs.”  Volume  has not been the focus of OKCoin for a while, he says, because zero-fees distorts it by a “large multiplier, maybe 5 times, maybe 10”. When I asked what other KPIs might be, however, he wasn’t specific, and brought the conversation back to his grand expansion plans.  Talent and customer support  So here are Star’s thoughts on the core competitive advantages of OKCoin in the international market:  First of all, he believes that he has put together a stellar team that moves faster than anyone he has worked with before. Secondly, he believes that the level of customer service OKCoin provides is unlikely to be rivalled by anything in the West.  He said: “We have twenty customer service representatives in total working in three shifts of eight hours each, available 24/7. We resolve things in a matter of minutes or hours, with live, knowledgeable support.”  “It’s a totally different standard from what is offered in the West because of the lower labour costs here and how picky the customers tend to be.”  For English speakers, he plans to operate a call centre as well, but perhaps in the Philippines as well as China.  Thirdly, Star believes that OKCoin’s Chinese roots will help, not hinder him. For one, he thinks the customer base might be helpful. “There are those who think over half of all the bitcoins currently available are being held by Chinese, whether locally or overseas,” he said.  For another, there are a ton of cross-border opportunities that he feels would be more visible or accessible to a Chinese company than others. He gave me some examples but asked me to not disclose it in this article.  While this interview took place just prior to what is now being billed as the 3/21 panic caused by a false rumour that China was going to ban bitcoin, Star proactively acknowledged that the regulatory future is unclear, but that bitcoin still remains so niche that concrete policies may be a long time in coming.  This uncertainty is probably, I’m guessing, another reason why he’s so keen to expand internationally, though he left this unsaid.  OKCoin is actively hiring for an overseas team, and would not be opposed to acqui-hiring a small team whose skills complement those of the core Chinese team – you should feel free to get in touch if you are so inclined.

The round was led by the Bitcoin Shop, which is a publicly traded company on the over-the-counter market.  ""Our investment in GoCoin reflects our confidence in their product and their team,” Charles Allen, CEO of Bitcoin Shop, said in a statement.  Former Facebook COO Owen Van Natta and investment firm Crypto Currency Partners also participated in the round.  “User demand continues to grow for alternative payments,” said Van Natta, adding:  “I’m excited to deepen my involvement with GoCoin and their best-in-class payments solution for merchants and game publishers.”  Expansion and competition  GoCoin plans to use the funding to expand its sales and technology teams as demand for cryptocurrency payments grows.  ""In our case, it’s expanding the sales staff in terms of direct sales and channel sales. And we’ll probably augment the technology team slightly,"" said company co-founder Brock Pierce.  The company was started in July 2013 and its platform went live in December.  GoCoin competes with Coinbase and BitPay in the bitcoin payment processor market. Pierce believes that GoCoin is the number three cryptocurrency payment processor in the world today. The industry will see a lot more competition in the future, he says:  ""My view is that there is probably room in this market for 15 of these companies. If you look historically in payments world, you normally see room for 15 of these types of companies.""  International focus  A favorable regulatory environment in Singapore led GoCoin to incorporate its business there. And it is focused on markets outside of the US.  ""I think we’re the only payments company that’s focused on international markets,"" said Pierce.  The demand for alternative cryptocurrencies as a form of payment outside bitcoin is also something that makes GoCoin stand out as a payment process. Said Pierce:  ""We’re agnostic when it comes to currencies. If there’s mutual demand from merchants and consumers to either spend or accept it, we’ll add the currency.""  GoCoin started to accept litecoin back in January. It recently added support for dogecoin as well.  “We’ve had an international multi-currency focus since day one, and this round will help extend our global footprint and take our services to the next level,” Steve Beauregard, CEO of GoCoin, said in a release announcing this latest round of funding.  Last November, GoCoin raised $550,000 in an early seed round.

42397441,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PXl,1395838857,"Circle Receives $17 Million Funding, Unveils Exchange and Wallet Service","Circle Internet Financial has closed a $17m Series B funding round and announced the launch of its first consumer product.  The bitcoin company raised the $17m from various investors, including Breyer Capital, Accel Partners and General Catalyst Partners, bringing its total funding to date to $26m.  Investment was also received from Oak Investment Partners, Pantera Capital and the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, which is run by Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive officer of SecondMarket and founder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust.  Leonard H. Schrank, the former chief executive officer of SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) also invested, as did Circle board member M. Michele Burns and Fenway Summer, a consumer finance advisory and venture firm led by Circle board member Raj Date.  Jeremy Allaire, Circle founder, Chairman and CEO, said:  “We are thrilled to have such a strong showing of support and vote of confidence from world-class investors and strategic individuals as we move into the commercial phase of Circle.""  He explained the funding will allow Circle to build its team, increasing roles across product, operations, legal, compliance, security and customer support. Allaire also has plans to open offices in a number of locations outside the US.  On top of this, the funds will be used to invest in the infrastructure required to provide a secure platform for the company's customers.  Product debut  Up until now, Circle has been very secretive about what it has been working on and the products it aims to offer. Today, the company has launched its first consumer product, but only a limited number of people will be able to test it out at this stage.  Allaire revealed his company is offering something akin to a bitcoin exchange and wallet service, although he is loath to use those terms.  He said users will be able to use the service to convert their fiat currency into bitcoins, then take advantage of tools that make it easy to send, receive and spend funds.  The company's main aim is to open bitcoin up to a broader market and make it easier for the masses to get involved in digital currency. Circle wants to make sure the service it offers is perfect, though, before making it available to all.  ""We are being very careful and deliberate in how we add users to our system, ensuring that it is a product that users value and recommend to their friends and family, and that, from an operational perspective, we are able to deliver an exceptional experience,"" said Allaire.  He explained that his company is building a global consumer financial service and institution that it wants consumers to trust with protecting and securing their digital assets. This is something Allaire claims the vast majority of bitcoin companies have failed to do:  ""They've failed to meet consumer support expectations, they've failed to meet even rudimentary security and audit obligations, and so we believe that the bar needs to be high in terms of offering a consumer service around bringing bitcoin mainstream.""  For this reason, Circle is being patient and is launching an invitation-only limited release this week.  Working with regulators  Allaire, who has founded two previous startups that both saw successful IPOs, said Circle hasn't so far faced any problems with regulators or banking partners. He puts this down to Circle's upfront approach.  ""Unlike many first-generation bitcoin companies, we've been extremely engaged and transparent with regulators about our commercial and product plans,"" he explained.  He believes it is important for companies in the space to educate government and commercial banking partners about what they are doing, and also integrate any feedback and suggestions.  ""We're all in this and learning together, and it's critical that industry participants look at government and the banking industry as partners in building the ecosystem for digital currency,"" Allaire added.  Investment  Circle isn't the only bitcoin company to announce investment this week. Yesterday, Kraken announced it had received $5m in Series-A funding, led by Hummingbird Ventures.  Kraken, which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, namecoin, dogecoin and Ripple, among other digital currencies, is owned by Payward, Inc.  Other companies in the space are expected to make funding announcements this week, too.

42397436,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PSq,1395837341,Agora Commodities Reports $10 Million in Bitcoin Sales,"Agora Commodities has managed to sell more than $10m-worth of gold and silver for bitcoin since it started accepting the cryptocurrency last year.  The firm points out that bitcoin gained more than 4000% in value last year, although that's not the company's primary focus, which is more on shiny, tangible commodities rather than digital currencies.  The biggest rush came in late 2013, as the price of bitcoin skyrocketed. Clearly, there were many speculators who decided to trade in their bitcoins for precious metals.  Just getting started  Agora Commodities is a relatively young company, but it is already the biggest dealer of precious metals for bitcoin on the planet. In addition to gold and silver, the company also sells platinum, palladium and rhodium.  The company sells a wide range of products, ranging from 1 kg gold bars priced at $43,000, to one-ounce silver coins priced at $21.  Bitcoin lovers can even combine their love of cryptocurrencies and precious metals with Agora's Silver Bitcoin Specie, a quarter-bitcoin piece priced at $23.50. No bitcoin included, of course. It features a handy QR code on the back and the design is rather nice, especially the binary string on the margin.  The only problem is that international shipping is quite costly, increasing the price of the purchase significantly. So, unless you plan to make a substantial investment in precious metals, it may not be worthwhile – especially if you were thinking about picking up a single coin as a gift, or a geeky conversation piece.  Coins as BTC wallets  If all this talk of physical coins sounds familiar, don't worry, it should. Mike Caldwell, the entrepreneur behind Casascius has been minting physical bitcoins for a while. However, his efforts were curtailed last year, when the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) ruled that his activities were essentially 'money transmitting' and that he did not have a permit to carry out such services.  Caldwell then turned to minting unfunded coins, which feature private keys and can be stocked with BTC by the buyer. Caldwell describes them as ""paper bitcoin wallets inside a coin container"".  While physical coins aren't very practical, and they are essentially the opposite of what a digital currency was intended to be, they do look quite a bit more appealing (and durable) than your average paper wallet.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/26/agora-commodities-reports-10-million-in-bitcoin-sales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22b393c150da6cb37a2335c2f02ec1423ff5077b-1600x868.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397439,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PUo,1395834945,New Polish Bitcoin Exchange Bitmarket.pl is Launched,"With digital currencies becoming increasingly popular among Poles, a new bitcoin exchange, Bitmarket.pl, was launched this month in the country.  The company said the exchange aims to lure traders with high levels of security and a fast turnover of transactions.  Said Michał Pleban, co-owner of the exchange:  ""What is important, only our own funds are allocated in the hot wallet, while our clients’ funds are safe in the cold wallet. We merge the rapidness of a currency exchange with the elasticity of a stock exchange.”  Pleban presented the exchange and its business model at a seminar on bitcoin, held on 24th March at the Warsaw School of Economics (Szkoła Główna Handlowa).  From domains to bitcoins  ""The exchange was launched this month, but we represent a company which has been active on the Polish market for eight years,” Pleban said. ""We are an offshoot of AfterMarket.pl – the largest domain aftermarket website in Poland, with more than 250,000 .pl domains in its portfolio.”  Pleban is the main architect of the website’s code, and said that the security measures employed by Bitmarket.pl are multilayered and based on two-step authentication, but do not negatively impact the speed of transactions.    Said Pleban:      ""In addition to this, we decided not to impose any fees on users’ transactions on the exchange.”              That said, the company does collects fees for withdrawals of funds from user accounts. These are currently PLN 1 ($0.33) and PLN 5 ($1.65) for electronic fund transfers and regular bank transfers, respectively, and 0.0001 BTC and 0.001 LTC for digital currency transfers, according to data from Bitmarket.pl.    Trust-building essential    With Pleban's statements clearly aimed to garner the trust of the local digital currency scene, which has seen several bitcoin-related incidents over the past few months, local observers say that market entry is increasingly difficult for new Polish exchanges.      As part of its trust-building efforts, Bitmarket.pl has tried to emphasize its financial foundations. The exchange is owned by Luxembourg-based EuroDNS, which has a share capital of some €540,000, according to figures released by company representatives.    Recent examples of turbulence in Poland’s bitcoin market include Bitcurex, the country’s leading bitcoin exchange, temporarily shutting down its site on 14th March following a hack that targeted funds in its users’ bitcoin wallets. The site resumed service on 18th March after stating that the perpetrators did not manage to break its security measures and gain full access to its operational hot wallet.  Late last year, though, another Poland-based bitcoin exchange reportedly fell victim to a hack and its owners were forced to shut down the site. Bidextreme.pl was hacked in November 2013 and its customers’ bitcoin and litecoin wallets were emptied.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LTC | MARKET,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/26/new-polish-bitcoin-exchange-bitmarketpl-is-launched,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/823f488a016dbbf7a6b713b61ee544fa2ff9e55d-1027x627.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PWm,1395829816,"Rumours, Panic and a DDoS Attack: Huobi’s Wild Week","While everyone was preoccupied with bitcoin price drops after last Friday's 'fake Chinese bitcoin ban' news incident, something even more dramatic was happening at China's largest exchange, Huobi, and its new litecoin trading system.  A 'flash crash' on the exchange saw the price plunge to just 1 RMB (Chinese yuan) a short time after a hoax news report of a complete government ban on digital currencies was posted on microblogging site Sina Weibo and reported by Sina's financial news service.  The number of trades executed at that price is unknown, as is the total amount of money lost – either by the company or by traders who lost due to margin calls. However, soon after the incident, Huobi agreed to make its customers whole again at 70 RMB ($11.29) per LTC for anyone who sold below that level.  Furthermore, the company said, negative balances would be reset to zero – even those still in the red after the 70 RMB redress.  Huobi CEO Leon Li said litecoin volumes had recovered by about 80% since, and users seemed to be satisfied with Huobi's resolution, but predicted that the full 100% recovery would more time.  This incident was very similar to the bitcoin flash crash at BTC-e on 10th February, supposedly induced by panic in the aftermath of Mt. Gox's suspension of all withdrawals. The price of 1 BTC dropped to $100 for just under two minutes, but that was long enough to do damage.  DDoS attack  That wasn't the end of Huobi's wild week, however. On Sunday 23rd March, the exchange suffered a crippling distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that took its site offline for the whole day.  News outside China has been almost non-existent, causing internet sleuths to speculate over whether, if at all, these incidents were related and who might be behind them. Prankers? Blackmailers? Business rivals? Huobi itself? Even Huobi management says it doesn't know for sure, but it insists, as did BTC-e in February, that it did not engineer the crash or profit from it.  Huobi had officially started litecoin trading just two days prior to the crash, and prices had not been spectacular over that time. While LTC had crept higher against BTC and USD in anticipation, actual figures after the launch were underwhelming.  Since the crash, the price has not risen above its pre-Huobi launch level and, on BTC-e, one litecoin is currently trading for around 0.027 BTC, $15.80, and 98.4 RMB, which is almost exactly the same rate.  Blackmail trend  There have been some other high-profile DDoS attacks in recent weeks, said to be the result of blackmail attempts. Project management site Basecamp (formerly named 37signals) went down just yesterday in what its owners said was an extortion attempt, while Meetup was also taken down a couple of weeks ago after receiving an email saying:  ""A competitor asked me to perform a DDoS attack on your website. I can stop the attack for $300 USD. Let me know if you are interested in my offer.""  Even if these DDoS incidents are completely unrelated, they point to a recent trend in computer crime: extortion of both businesses and individuals has lately increased, either via overt threats like the one Meetup received or malware like CryptoLocker, which demanded similar amounts from its victims.  Response to the crisis  Comparing its fate to that of BTC-e, Huobi has published an official response (in Chinese) to the fake news and subsequent crash on its site.    ""The system was told to sell at market price, but there were not enough LTC buyers, and transactions could not be completed, so finally the inventory was liquidated at below market prices. When the liquidated LTC was not sufficient to cover borrowings, some small portion of customers experienced a negative asset balance.""      ""Huobi only opened up LTC trading two days before the 21st March incident, and so there was not enough depth in the market. In the midst of a market panic, there were not many orders that varied greatly from the market price, and so the system could not close positions using normal prices, and it was only when that the price went down to 1 RMB that the position could be closed.""    Engineering the crash itself would make no sense for the company, the statement continued, since both buyers and sellers were Huobi customers, and the crash did great damage to the company's brand new LTC trading platform and its reputation in general.  When asked who might have been behind the fake government ban announcement, Li told CoinDesk:    ""The fake news was most likely a result of an individual/group maliciously manipulating the price and causing a drop on purpose. They were able to get away with it because people are concerned about the uncertainty in policy.""      ""To prevent such things from happening in the future, three things need to happen: 1) established media should not publish unverified news about policy; 2) investors need to have basic judgment; 3) the industry should have an authoritative channel for posting news.""    Getting traders to act rationally would be an achievement, and is something markets have probably desired for hundreds of years. Controlling media statements on government policy, though, could be easier in China with its vast state-connected media networks.  Taking further action  Huobi is calling for Sina Weibo (a similar service to Twitter) to reveal the owner and Chinese ID number of the 'Caitongshe' account that started the fake rumor in the first place, in the hope it can file a lawsuit.  It is also requesting that any users who bought litecoin for 1 RMB to post pictures of their trades on Weibo (as some have done already). The trades were legal and within the rules, but Huobi wants to demonstrate publicly that the company did not trade at the low price or profit from the crash.  Huobi also insisted that its bitcoin platform remained robust, and did not suffer large setbacks even after the official Chinese government announcement of 5th December, or the fake one of last Friday.  Admitting its risk management strategy for the new litecoin system could have been better, however, Huobi promised improvements to prevent wild fluctuations in future.  To be properly responsible to its customers, the company concluded, after a meeting with all stockholders, Huobi has agreed to use a portion of its loan loss provision funds to cover losses suffered by the exchange's users.

42397434,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PQs,1395826817,"Today in Gox: Police on the Case, More Coin Rumors","Mt. Gox rose again today to announce it is now working with Japanese police to investigate what happened to the bitcoins it lost, misplaced, or had stolen by hackers.  The statement, posted on the homepage on letterhead bearing CEO Mark Karpeles' name, said:    Following its application for commencement of civil rehabilitation, MtGox Co., Ltd. consulted with the metropolitan police department with regard to the disappearance of bitcoins which is one of the causes for said application. MtGox Co., Ltd. hereby announces that it has submitted necessary electronic records and other related documents.      MtGox Co., Ltd. intends to fully cooperate with each competent authority. Further, MtGox Co., Ltd. continues to make efforts to clarify facts as quickly as possible and to recover from damages.    The announcement is carefully worded, not mentioning whether Mt. Gox chose to consult with the police, whether the police came to Mt. Gox, or if it was just a routine matter as part of the civil rehabilitation process. According to a report by Reuters, the police do not intend to make any further statement on the matter.  Other than knowing the authorities are involved somehow, and the words ""recover from damages"" at the end, the update probably does little to comfort those who lost large sums of money when Mt. Gox declared bankruptcy nearly a month ago.  Rumor file  Another tiny ray of hope today came in the form of a tweet by Eren Canarslan, an investment banker from Turkey:    Within a few days(or hours) @MtGox will announce that ""they found ~670.000 #bitcoin & may release some BTCs to the victims. @PatronaPartners      — Eren Canarslan (@CanarslanEren) March 25, 2014    The one-off tweet, followed by nearly a whole day of radio silence (that as of press time still hadn't been broken) probably would have been written off as trolling or wishful thinking had it not been for these two other cryptic tweets he'd posted on 4th and 5th March:    @PatronaPartners As I heard from an insider from @blockchain: they found lost #bitcoin of @mtgox Note: It's not an investment advice/offer.      — Eren Canarslan (@CanarslanEren) March 4, 2014      @zeroblock @PatronaPartners @blockchain I talked with Mark Karpeles, the news is good !      — Eren Canarslan (@CanarslanEren) March 5, 2014    Within two weeks, Mt. Gox announced it had discovered 200,000 BTC in an 'old format' wallet. In the world of lost bitcoins, this has bestowed a kind of prophetic status on Eren Canarslan, whose bitcoin-associated follower count increased markedly over the day.

42397430,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PNv,1395819185,What the IRS Bitcoin Tax Guidelines Mean For You,"The US Internal Revenue Service finally announced its guidance for virtual currencies yesterday, explicitly referring to bitcoin (see the announcement here and notice here). The increased clarity – provided three weeks before the end of the US tax year – will come as a relief to many who were scared to get involved in bitcoin, commercially. But what does it mean for different members of the bitcoin community?  US businesses wanting to get involved in bitcoin have been waiting for this for a while. As recently as January, US Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson pressured the IRS in her annual report to Congress, telling it that it needed to publish guidance. The lack of rules was a serious problem, she said, and many businesses would be surprised to hear that capital gains could be imposed on bitcoins.  Well, now, that's official: in its guidance, the IRS has said that bitcoin should be treated as property, making it subject to capital gains tax. That has significant ramifications for different kinds of businesses and individuals dealing in bitcoin.  Miners  Miners that produce their own bitcoins are now subject to two different tax charges. They must include the fair market value of the virtual currency on the day that it is mined into their gross income.  Another stipulation in the IRS guidance is that capital gains are due on the sale of bitcoins viewed as a capital asset. The taxpayer must take this fair market value on the date of acquisition as the basis price for the coins. Capital gains will be due on the difference between that basis price and the eventual sale price.  This means that if and when they sell the bitcoins that they have mined, they will have to pay capital gains tax on any profit that they have made while owning them. Furthermore, if an individual mines bitcoin as a business, the net earnings from that business will be treated as self-employment income, and will be subject to self-employment tax.  Dave Carlson, a US entrepreneur who runs a mining operation that earned almost $8m a month in revenue when bitcoin was at its peak, says that this could spell trouble for miners.  ""The implications of the new IRS tax guidance will be a major factor for those US miners who didn't anticipate it and are already on the edge of profit. A capital gains tax on all coins mined could drive mining revenue below cost of power for many, forcing them to shut down,"" he says. ""Pool operators will have to issue 1099s to all their US contributors, which will drive pool fees higher.  The exception here is if bitcoins aren't viewed as capital assets, but are instead viewed as inventory. This would be the case if a miner (or any other business) made the selling of bitcoins their core business. In that case, any gains on the bitcoins would be taxed as an ordinary gain or loss.  ""The test depends on the facts and circumstances and there's not a simple bright line rule,"" says Tyson Cross, a San Diego tax attorney who runs Bitcoin Tax Solutions, an advisory site about bitcoin taxation. ""Asking yourself if you're a miner, how you fall into that test, will be kind of murky.""  At least one miner has a strategy to get around the taxing of bitcoin when mined, though. Yana Kesler, a certified public accountant from Philadelphia, purchased a $7,200 mining rig last year, and had it hosted in Europe.  ""When you mine yourself you are the producer. When you ask someone else to mine for you, that's your investment,"" Kesler says. She calculates the basis value of her coins as zero, but says that she does declare capital gains when she sells the coins.  Investors  The same basic concepts for capital gains realizations apply to investors who obtain their bitcoins through exchanges. They must measure the fair market value on that day as the basis for capital gains realization when they eventually sell the coins.  This is a good thing for investors though, argue tax experts. The alternative would be to impose foreign currency gains on most profits, which are taxable at a higher rate. Instead, investors who hold their bitcoins for more than a year and a day will be charged at the long-term capital gains rate, which currently rests at 15%.  This is what serious investors have been rooting for all along. ""Winklevoss called it,"" says Jacob Farber, an attorney in the virtual currency group at legal firm Perkins Coie, referring to the SEC filing for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust. ""They said that it should be treated as subject to capital gains. As investors that would be the right outcome.""  There's another upside for investors, says Cross: certainty. ""That's a huge issue for investors, especially institutional investors,"" he says, adding that he spoke to several institutional investors who were on the fence because of a lack of IRS guidance.  Exchanges  The exchanges themselves may have a tougher time of it, though. Farber's colleague Richard Peterson, chair of Perkins Coie's tax practice, says that now bitcoin is being classed as property, this will impose a reporting overhead. The key here is the 1099-B federal tax form, used to report the proceeds of a broker or barter exchange.  ""If I sell my shares through Merrill Lynch, they send me a 1099 on which they have to list the property sold, the date it was sold, the price, and then if they have the information they would have to report my tax basis and my gain or loss,"" he says. ""They would need to do that for every transaction I do for the entire year, and send me one statement.""  He suggests that exchanges may now have to file such a form describing every transaction made by a client. For some high-volume clients, this could run into hundreds of trades each year. Are bitcoin exchanges, which haven't been legally bound to do this, ready for the administrative burden?  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based exchange Coinsetter, couldn't comment on whether the firm was set up to do that today, or whether its systems would need to be altered to accommodate the change.  ""Companies in the space will now have to determine how to help customers report taxable gains properly, which won't be easy,"" Lukasiewicz says. ""However, I don't think this tax treatment is a huge surprise to most people who have bitcoin gains.""  Consumers  Tracking capital gains represents a sticky problem when it comes to bitcoin owners paying for goods and services using the digital currency.  If you convert your bitcoins to fiat currency and then make everyday purchases using dollars, it will be relatively easy to report the short or long-term capital gains from that single transaction.  But if you use the bitcoins in your wallet to purchase goods directly, then theoretically, the IRS should be informed of the capital gains incurred on the bitcoin at the time of the purchase, pointed out various tax attorneys that CoinDesk quizzed yesterday.  If you bought $25 in bitcoins, and they went up by $75 in value, and then you went to Overstock and bought a sweater using bitcoins, then technically speaking, you should account for the $75 in capital gains when you spend those coins, says Peterson.  ""That's the gain that the service is going to want to track when retailers accept bitcoin. That's where the true administrative nightmare comes in. There would have to be some town hall meeting with the [IRS] to resolve that.""  This rule imposes an unrealistic burden on bitcoin users. At best, if they rule was enforced then they would have to rely on a merchant providing the current US dollar value for a bitcoin purchase for their records, attorneys said. They would then have to compare this dollar value with the basis price (that is, the fair market value of the bitcoins on the day that they acquired them).  The consumer would have to do this for every bitcoin-based purchase that they made throughout the year, and add it all up at the end. If the merchant accepting bitcoin for payment didn't provide a current US dollar value, then the person spending the bitcoin would have to do the math themselves, making it doubly hard to keep track.  None of this makes bitcoin attractive as an everyday unit of exchange, argue attorneys.  In practice, though, it seems unlikely that anyone would do this. Greg Broiles, an attorney specializing in estate planning, trust and probate, who spoke on bitcoin and taxation at Bitcoin 2013, argues that accountants have a concept called ""materiality"". This essentially argues that transactions should only be included for accounting purposes when they're significant enough. An $8 sandwich paid for in bitcoins probably doesn't count. A $30,000 Harley probably would, though.  In theory, then, the IRS rules seem to bring advantages to those who invest in bitcoin as a long-term property-class financial asset, while discouraging those that want to use it as a form of digital currency. In practice, Boiles argues that the latter group probably won't care, and won't report it.  Merchants and payment processors  There are two other types of business that might be affected by the new IRS guidance: merchants, and the payment processors that support them.  The payment processors - known as third-party settlement organizations (TPSOs) in tax-speak - are now required to file 1099-K reports for their merchants if the number of transactions settled for the merchant exceeds 200, and the gross amount of payments made to the merchant exceeds $20,000.  Coinbase  didn't return our request for comment, but BitPay, the other large processor in the bitcoin space, said that it does file 1099-K forms for merchants.  For many merchants, these tax rules shouldn't change much. Many, such as Overstock, take payments in bitcoin via payment processors but have them immediately converted to fiat currency, meaning that they don't hold a position in the digital currency, and therefore won't be exposed to capital gains taxes. It will be up to the payment processors to simply send them a 1099-K form at the end of the year.  Companies, contractors, and employees  Contractors getting paid in bitcoin must declare its fair market value on the day of payment as part of their gross income. Companies paying salaries in bitcoin must withhold tax in the same way as they would if paying in regular fiat currency. There don't seem to be many of the latter, though.  So, the burning question is - what do you do with those bitcoins that you mined or bought two years ago and let languish on your hard drive? Don't be naughty, advises Broiles: report them.  ""I think that IRS is going to want you to amend past-year returns,"" he says. Let's say that someone mined a lot of bitcoin two years ago and then forgot about it. My suggestion would be to amend the tax return for the year when they mined it. The growth between long ago and today will be taxed at the long-term capital gain rate.""  None of this is set in stone. Tax attorneys and other experts will no doubt file commentary on the IRS notice, which is subject to change, and which should eventually be replaced by regulation that could differ in its approach. For now, though, at least the bitcoin community in America has something to go on.  Statements in this article should not be considered tax advice, which is best sought directly from a qualified professional.

42397431,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9POu,1395805237,Vault of Satoshi Gets Full Money Services License for Canada,"Canadian bitcoin exchange Vault of Satoshi announced today it had gained a full Money Services Business license in its native country, after spending ""some time"" in a probationary period. Announcing the license on Reddit, Director of Marketing Adam Cochran wrote:  ""Vault of Satoshi has always gone the extra mile to be a 'by the books' exchange. We've always been a registered corporation, let users know who we are, always reported to FinTrac, we follow all the same regulations as a currency exchange, and we operate inside all Canadian regulations on financial services.""  The license is national, allowing the company to operate in every province of Canada as it serves clients located in most countries around the world. ""We are also currently streamlining our bank end financial systems to open ourselves to additional currencies so that in the future we can better serve clients in their local currency,"" Cochran said. He added that, while the legal costs of compliance were probably higher in Canada than some places, it was preferable to operating in a grey area and taking risks with clients' money.  ""The decision was no contest. It's the same reason why others continue to operate in the US from overseas, they are taking a gamble with your money, whereas we at Vault of Satoshi will only operate in methods and jurisdictions in which we can be a fully compliant financial entity,"" he continued. ""We don't want your bitcoins magically disappearing and so legal decisions like this are absolutely paramount to making sure we can continue to operate properly.""  The company is also applying for a license with the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), saying it wants to be a ""legal, transparent and reliable exchange [...] to be a positive part of the ever evolving cryptocurrency legal landscape here in Canada.""  Looking positive  It's a dash of good news for Vault of Satoshi, which at the beginning of March announced ""a temporary and voluntary withdrawal from the United States, due to the challenging legal/political landscape for a foreign entity operating in the cryptocurrency space."" It also added that it was working day to day with legal experts and striving towards re-entry into the US market in a secure, legal and reliable manner. Vault of Satoshi was critical of the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which it claimed had been opaque about compliance requirements. It also cited the recent Charlie Shrem arrest as proof of an increasingly hostile regulatory environment, and said the need to undergo separate compliance procedures in nearly all US states was prohibitively expensive.  Client protection  Client safety and protection of client assets remained paramount, Cochran added.  ""Maybe it's a Canadian thing, we like our peace of mind and that security and reliability is something we strongly feel a responsibility to bring to our clients. We'll never take a risk with the trust they have invest in us,"" he said.  Vault of Satoshi otherwise exchanges USD and CAD for digital currencies in any country other than those on its blacklist, which contains the usual financial world suspects plus the US, Thailand and Iceland.

42397449,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Pee,1395798584,Rising Stars of Bitcoin Set Ambitious Goals for 2014,"The emerging leaders of the digital currency startup ecosystem took to the stage at CoinSummit San Francisco on 25th March in a talk that included Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong; Blockchain.info CEO Nic Cary; BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi; and Ripple Labs CEO Chris Larsen.  The session was moderated by Ribbit Capital's Nick Shalek.  Some of the biggest founders and CEOs in the digital currency space, including representatives from BitPay, Blockchain, Coinbase and Ripple, were on hand for CoinSummit San Francisco's ""The Rising Stars of the Bitcoin Start-up Ecosystem"" panel, which took place toward the end of a busy first day on Tuesday, 25th March.  The day's previous panel sessions focused on angel investing, decentralized applications and bitcoin applications.  This session, however, took a different approach, as the notable digital currency figures provided insights into not only how successful bitcoin businesses are being built today, but the goals and objectives their companies are seeking to achieve on behalf of the entire ecosystem in 2014 and beyond.  The industry leaders indicated that usability, development and merchant adoption are just some of the issues that remain top of mind.  Usability  Making bitcoin a better financial tool is what all of the assembled panelists agreed will be a focus in 2014.  Brian Armstrong, who worked on fraud prevention at AirBnB before starting Coinbase with co-founder Fred Ehrsam, summed up this sentiment, saying:  ""We want to focus on making [bitcoin] accessible to non-technical people.""  Nic Cary, the Blockchain.info CEO who started his first company at age 16, wants to make products that are desirable to the masses. Said Cary:  ""We have to build beautiful technology that is fun and attractive. The user experience is critical.""  BitPay  CEO Tony Gallippi reiterated that his company has been helping merchants accept bitcoin since 2011. As such, he doesn't want to stray from its established approach.  “I think we need to focus on what we do best,"" Gallippi said.  Ripple Labs  CEO Chris Larsen noted that the developer community is the most important way consumer usability will grow within digital payment systems.  Core development  The topic of bitcoin core development has been much discussed of late. The concern is that while a number of bitcoin startups are building on the application level, the core protocol is being left behind.  A San Francisco-based open-source distributed settlements system, Ripple now has an incubator that offers free office space for developers with no strings attached.  ""It’s essential to leverage developers. It’s essential to build that community.”  Bitcoin iteration is good for the whole ecosystem, that's why this threat remains such a problem. ""We all stand to benefit from bitcoin being successful,"" said moderator Nick Shalek.  BitPay's Tony Gallippi pointed out that his company employs core developer Jeff Garzik full-time to work on Bitcoin protocol issues.  Blockchain.info is hoping to follow BitPay's lead, according to Cary:  ""I would love to hire several core developers this year,"" he said.  Ambitious goals  All of the assembled business leaders listed lofty goals for the upcoming yea r.  BitPay wants to have enrolled 100,000 merchants by 2015; Ripple Labs wants to get one major bank on its protocol; Coinbase wants to onboard companies that have $1 billion in revenue; and Blockchain.info wants to surpass 10 million wallet signups.  These are just some of the benchmarks that these later-stage startups have to propel digital currencies to the next level, though the panelists acknowledged that challenges remain.  ""Over the last year we have had more exchanges close than open,"" said Gallippi. These bitcoin startups want more positive news that can trump all the bad activities.  Still, Coinbase's Armstrong advised young bitcoin companies to make new products no matter what.  ""Build something. Build anything and it will give you the idea of what to build next,"" he said.

42397435,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9PRr,1395795941,Angel Investors Want to Build the Bitcoin Ecosystem,"At CoinSummit San Francisco on Tuesday, 25th March, CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan moderated a discussion with angel investors centered on investing in the digital currency ecosystem.  Panelists included Ben Davenport, creator of the software that became Facebook Messenger and a bitcoin angel investor; and Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList and an accomplished writer who has called the untapped power of the Bitcoin protocol an Internet of money and a replacement for Wall Street.    ________________________________________________________________      In the digital space, it can be difficult for investors to decide whether to put money into a related company as an angel investor, or simply buy a stake in the currency.      The angels on CoinSummit's long white couch weighed the pros and cons of each approach, beginning with Ben Davenport, an angel investor who holds stakes in BitPay, Coinsetter, itBit and Yoyocard.      Said Davenport on the issue:      ""As an angel it probably doesn't make sense to be investing exclusively in companies while not holding a position in the coins themselves. [...] For most of bitcoin's history, it was pretty clear that the lower risk/higher return bet was to buy bitcoins.""              However, as bitcoin prices edge higher, it might now be possible to invest in a company that outperforms bitcoin itself, if you get in early enough, Davenport said.    But, there’s more to the decision than simply comparing potential payoffs, he pointed out: “You can’t think about those investments in isolation. You have to think about how they might affect your underlying bitcoin investments.""    For example, if a company’s technology improves the entire bitcoin ecosystem, it’s bound to increase the value of all bitcoins, he said. But there’s nothing wrong with simply buying and holding bitcoin as an investment, especially if one doesn’t have the time or resources to evaluate startups, the angels agreed.      Said AngelList founder Naval Ravikant:    ""Buying bitcoin is like buying a bet in the entire ecosystem.""  Trends in angel investing  More and more angel investors appear to be interested in buying into bitcoin startups; AngelList now has 1,500 investors looking for bitcoin opportunities, including at least two large syndicates, one run by Davenport, where multiple investors pool their money.  In fact, the first milliondollar bitcoin syndicate deal just happened on AngelList, Ravikant said. Though, details have not yet been publicly announced.  What kind of companies are all these investors looking for?  Right now, the most basic ideas are still being funded, with startups providing ways for users to store bitcoin and exchanges where they can buy and sell it.  Looking ahead, Ravikant said, ""I'm more interested in non-obvious ones,"" such as those that apply the underlying technology of the block chain to new problems. The type of companies that get funded will evolve with the ecosystem, Davenport said.  He added:  ""A lot of the opportunities don't open up until you have a number of businesses of a type in the space. Now that you have a number of exchanges, they all need KYC (know your customer diligence required by the US government).""  A company could seize that opportunity by providing an easy way to automate that, he said.  Collaboration is key  The panel wrapped up with an entreaty from Davenport to the entrepreneurs in the audience: ""I'd love to see so much more collaboration,"" he said.  In a tightly woven ecosystem like bitcoin, startups are not competitors but are instead dependent on each other's success for survival, he said.  Ravikant agreed, saying that while Silicon Valley has always had a collaborative feel, the bitcoin world is even more so.  In fact, the ecosystem is so interdependent that it really does bring to mind other kinds of tight networks, he said.  ""I have got to hand it to Satoshi Nakamoto for engineering the most brilliant pyramid scheme ever,"" he joked.

42397474,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAb9Pfd,1395792355,Price of Iceland's Auroracoin Falls 50% Against Bitcoin After Airdrop,"After weeks of anticipation, Iceland's attempted national digital currency auroracoin commenced its Airdrop - the distribution of 31.8 AUR to interested citizens - at midnight local time on 25th March as part of stage one of its three-part launch.  With experts weighing in on auroracoin's novel marketing approach, successors adopting its distribution model and speculators hovering for quick gains, auroracoin's moment of truth had seemingly arrived.  Opinions were varied as to what the response to its ambitious launch would be, whether Icelanders would embrace the currency, ignore it or simply cash it in en masse for a more traditional currency, sending its value to zero virtually overnight. The upstart auroracoin even garnered bitcoin-sized international news coverage, with mentions in media outlets such as CNBC, Forbes and NBC.  At press time, it seems that despite issues, auroracoin has succeeded at distributing its coins to a sizeable group of recipients, though prices and overall market cap were down considerably. Auroracoin's market cap dropped by nearly 50% in the first day of the Airdrop, though it seemed to have avoided the quick disintegration some feared.  The auroracoin website reported that 281,000 Airdrop coins had been claimed at press time, a figured that represented 2.68% of the total of 10.5m Airdrop coins.  By 12:00 GMT, auroracoin reported its first estimates of how many Icelanders had successfully claimed their allotments in the new digital currency.    The Airdrop is progressing much quicker than I had imagined. 2,600 people have claimed in less than 12 hours.      — auroracoin (@auroracoinIS) March 25, 2014    Price holds, then freefalls  As of 16:00 GMT, roughly 16 hours after the Airdrop commenced, the price of auroracoin was holding relatively stable, according to figures from Coinmarketcap.  Auroracoin held strong as the fourth-largest digital currency by market cap, though its value had declined roughly 9.9% during this period. While this may have sounded steep, it was only about 1% more than dogecoin, which dropped 8.61% over the same period.  The price of AUR on Cryptsy at that time was roughly 0.02 BTC ($10.45 USD), while on Mintpal it was trading for 0.0177 BTC (roughly $10.27).  This was down from approximately $11 the day prior.  By 23:00 GMT, however, the picture looked starkly different.  Auroracoin was still the fourth-largest digital currency by market cap, but this figure had declined more than 45% over the one-day period.  On Cryptsy, the price of 1 AUR had fallen to approximately 0.0123 BTC (roughly $7.16), down from the 0.0205 BTC or $11.93 observed at the day's openhttps://www.cryptsy.com/markets/view/160.  The price drop was so precipitous, auroracoin holders gathered on its official forum to debate whether to hold the currency in the face of its rapid devaluation.  Behind the price decline  Though the exact cause is uncertain, data from Cryptocoincharts indicates that many investors have been seeking to cash in auroracoins. Auroracoin had declined more than 50% against bitcoin in the last 24 hours alone at press time.  Data from Cryptsy indicates that those who received coins in the distribution were not the main force behind the sell-off.  At press time, sell orders in denominations of 31.8 were present, but in small numbers.  Distribution issues  By midnight local time, nearly 450 users were waiting on auroracoin.org, according to its official Twitter feed, to either claim coins or simply to observe the proceedings.  Due to heavy traffic, site issues were reported via Twitter.  http://t.co/RpRdFMX1lg is down due to heavy traffic. Icelanders are claiming at https://t.co/fAlBqxKp7X. — auroracoin (@auroracoinIS) March 25, 2014  Following this hiccup, Auroracoin experienced a number of distribution issues over the course of the Airdrop, none of which seemed to have the devastating impact some detractors were expecting.  For example, Icelanders living abroad expressed difficulty claiming their coins. Though, as noted on reddit forums, these individuals will have more opportunities to do so, as the initial Airdrop is scheduled to last four months.  At least one individual tried to claim his coins, only to find that someone else had already allegedly completed the registration process in his name.  Issues with wallet downloads  were reported, as were Facebook verification errors. The most common issue reported by auroracoin users were perhaps ""request timeout"" errors.  Others noted downloads progressed slowly before being eventually confirmed.  Skeptics turned believers  The Auroracoin forum also was a gathering place for those who wanted to share success stories from the Airdrop.  Some gave credit to Auroracoin’s creator, Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson, who has held steadfast to his idea even as international scrutiny increased.  Likewise, Twitter was a home for auroracoin users to share their excitement about the launch.    Airdrop successful, I have my #Auroracoin now let´s see what happens #iceland #cryptocurrency      — Halldór Guðfinnsson (@DoriGudfinns) March 25, 2014    Though, it is worth noting that such positive feedback was tweeted to auroracoin prior to its price drop.  The future for country-focused coins  Of course, the country-based coins looking to follow auroracoin's lead were watching the event as well.  Derek Nisbet, co-founder of the Scotcoin Project, indicated he is looking to complete a similar airdrop in 2014 to those that opt-in to the project, and that he is encouraged by the day's results, saying:  ""I believe the launch and subsequent uptake of Auroracoin's in today's airdrop has proved that genuine interest exists from the Icelandic people with respect to alternative [digital] currencies.""  SpainCoin developer Alvaro S. told CoinDesk his team was watching auroracoin for cues:  ""We'll be watching it in the coming days to see how it goes. Spaincoin will have a chance to fix any issues that arise with Auroracoin, we're ready to use daily quotas for instance, if there's excessive dumping.""  Alvaro added that, even with the price decline, auroracoin can be viewed as a success: ""It's doing pretty good nonetheless, taking into account the amount of coins given away are many times the amount supplied per day by mining operations.""  Doubtless, many observers will be paying attention in the coming days and months as the auroracoin community still needs to work to increase awareness and adoption, especially among key demographics such as merchants, in order to succeed in its mission of providing a viable alternative to Iceland's krona.
