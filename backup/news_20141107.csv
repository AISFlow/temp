42377775,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XDX,1415398826,Braintree's Bill Ready: Bitcoin Will Impact Mainstream Payments,"Braintree's chief executive Bill Ready has followed bitcoin for years, but for most of that time, he saw it as an interesting computer science experiment.  Today, however, Ready is convinced that bitcoin has a future in a payments space that's increasingly showing its age. Ready's bullishness on bitcoin doesn't stop there. He wants Braintree, which owns the buzz-generating mobile wallet Venmo, to help take bitcoin mainstream.  ""We can start to ... take [bitcoin] to the mainstream because we know what it takes to be compliant with regulatory bodies. From a computer science breakthrough to an alternative form of payment that hopefully sees much greater adoption than it has already.""  Bitcoin in a mobile-first world  Ready spoke exclusively to CoinDesk at the Braintree booth at Web Summit, an annual technology conference held in Dublin that attracted more than 20,000 attendees this year.  The Braintree boss said bitcoin has a place in a world where mobile phones are becoming the ""primary computing device"". He said:  ""Consumers will demand that they have a [mobile] wallet, so wallets will become prevalent because of adoption of mobile. In a world where wallets are dominant, it becomes easier to use a digital currency like bitcoin.""  Ready said bitcoin suited digital wallets because they could be inserted ""seamlessly"" while physical credit cards faced inherent limitations.  ""Bitcoin can insert seamlessly in a digital wallet in a way that a plastic card can't,"" he said.  Braintree was the first major payment platform to announce that it would allow bitcoin transactions, saying in September that it would integrate Coinbase into its system. Weeks later, its corporate parent PayPal followed suit, adding BitPay and GoCoin to the list of payment processors it would work with.  Is Venmo a bitcoin killer?  Ready is sanguine about bitcoin's prospects. He described a creaking ""legacy"" payments infrastructure that is ripe for disruption. A digital currency like bitcoin is well suited for the task. Although this might ease adoption by merchants, consumers require attractive interfaces for mass adoption to occur.  ""It's a two-sided network, with consumers and merchants or buyers and sellers on each side. Any payments product that's going to succeed needs to solve real problems on both sides,"" he said.  As mobile wallets – like Braintree's own Venmo, which works with bank accounts and conventional payment cards – are already being embraced by consumers for micro-transactions, bitcoin seems to offer few advantages. Venmo reported $700m worth of transactions this quarter, up 50% from the previous period.  Apps like Venmo, and to some extent, platforms like Apple Pay, appear to be potential bitcoin-killers. But it's a notion that Ready is quick to dismiss:  ""I wouldn't think about it that way. If you look at Venmo and PayPal, we support a number of payment methods within those wallets, including debit cards and credit cards. If you think about bitcoin ... it's complementary to a wallet. Venmo is not a killer of bitcoin; it's something that could be complementary.""  Bitcoin's mass adoption is just beginning  Ready has been involved in the payments space since the first dotcom boom, when he was a software developer at Netzee Payments, which listed on the NASDAQ in 1999. Having watched the payment landscape evolve over the last 15 years, Ready said the prognosis for bitcoin's mass adoption was good.  He said:  ""We are in the early stage of that now. As we start to offer bitcoin to our merchants – we have perhaps one of the largest merchant networks in the world – a lot of meaningful merchants are interested in bitcoin. We think we're going to take it to a much wider [number of merchants]. It's the beginnings of mainstream.""  Ready warned that while bitcoin appears to have a good chance of breaking into the mainstream, its advance won't be as rapid as some bitcoin boosters would like, saying:  ""I don't know that we wake up in two years and half the people are paying in bitcoin. It won't be that rapid. In a few years, a significant number of merchants will accept bitcoin, and therefore a meaningful number of consumers can pay that way. But not the majority [of consumers]. We're at the very beginning.""  One of the obstacles to mass adoption of bitcoin are its immutable transactions. Unlike credit cards, bitcoin transactions can't be reversed with a 'chargeback'. This benefits merchants, who don't have to deal with fees and possible fraud linked to chargebacks, but it doesn't offer consumers the same protections that credit card payments can provide.  For Ready, the lack of a reversal process for bitcoin payments is a critical problem. Bitcoin users can only treat the digital currency as another form of cash at the moment, he said, offering none of the utility and protection of a credit card.  ""It's one of the open issues that has to be solved. There's a group of people now using bitcoin who think of it as a cash transaction ... for bitcoin to be an alternative to prevalent payment methods, figuring out some form of consumer recourse is going to be important. It's not there yet,"" he said.  Opening doors for Coinbase  When Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong travelled to London two weeks ago to kick off a European tour to promote his company's new services, he described how his relationship with Braintree opened doors to the payment firm's customers, companies like on-demand platform Uber, for example.  Ready revealed that he was introduced to Coinbase by an investor in the startup, Union Square Ventures partner Fred Wilson, ""a long while back"". Ready said he initially discussed bitcoin with Wilson regularly, and when he was introduced to Coinbase founders Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, he kept up an ""active dialogue"" with the duo.  When Braintree began to consider adding bitcoin as a payment option in its developers kit, it found that Coinbase had the customer base and regulatory approvals that it was seeking from a bitcoin payment processor. Ready said:  ""As we were looking at wanting to start accepting bitcoin, we wanted to make sure we had a reputable player who was solving for a lot of the compliance issues. Coinbase is out in front of the pack on that. It also had a good consumer experience, certainly with Venmo and PayPal, a good consumer wallet that delivers a good buying experience is really critical. Coinbase was doing that more than anyone else.""  Bitcoin the technology, not the currency  Ready said he has followed bitcoin's development for years, although he initially viewed it as a computer science breakthrough rather than an addition to the payments infrastructure. He believed regulatory issues would prevent bitcoin from becoming a meaningful player in payments.  ""I wasn't sure it would be something that the mainstream could use, just because of regulatory issues. But in the last year, year and a half, you started to have regulatory bodies rule on bitcoin. Even in cases where the bodies haven't given rulings that are favourable, it legitimises it,"" he said.  The Braintree chief said he owns bitcoins, although he doesn't put much stock in them as speculative assets, preferring to focus on bitcoin's technological potential instead.  ""I'm interested in it as a breakthrough in distributed trust, a breakthrough in alternative forms of currency. I don't spend a lot of time speculating on it,"" he said.  Ready also said the digital currency world should focus on pushing for more improvements to bitcoin instead of becoming side-tracked by developing altcoins or competing protocols.  ""I'm in two minds about these branches off bitcoin. It's great to see experimenting, pushing it further, but another part of it is, unless you're doing something that's a step-function different, you're undermining the adoption of bitcoin ... you do more harm than help in building all these offshoots,"" he said.

42377783,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XML,1415391053,StopCoin Turns Your Coinbase Account Into an Automated Trading Bot,"A new service called StopCoin launched this week – an online extension to the Coinbase platform that gives wallet holders a user-friendly way to trade bitcoin.  Once logged in via Coinbase, StopCoin allows users to easily create buy and sell orders based on a specified bitcoin price without having to understand technical trading charts and terms.  Eliminating the need for users to place funds in a separate exchange and monitor the price themselves, the service monitors the bitcoin price activity and executes users’ orders automatically.  StopCoin's creator Zack Shapiro told CoinDesk he chose to build his product off Coinbase because it is the leading wallet in the space – “well designed, well-built, trusted”.  He said:  “My biggest shortcoming with Coinbase is that I don’t have any granular control over my bitcoins. I’m terrified that one of these days the price is going to go crazy. I would love to protect my investment. […] I don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, but I’d like to be able to sleep easy.”  By launching the service, Shapiro intends to target the growing number of people interested in bitcoin and want to become more involved – the users who open up Coinbase wallets, but whose funds just sit idle. This is in contrast to more seasoned traders who make the most of their bitcoin, buying and selling as the price moves.  Trading for beginners  StopCoin effectively gives less experienced users the opportunity to place limit orders.  To do so, the user indicates whether he or she is buying or selling, how much to buy or sell, and at which price bitcoin must reach for the platform to execute the order.  The dashboard displays all pending and closed orders, and the same information is also emailed to the user every Friday – in case those with multiple pending orders are out of touch with their transactions. StopCoin takes a 1% fee on all transactions up to a maximum of $10.  Shapiro said:  “My goal is to be very transparent with customers and help them really have financial security and take control of what they have in Coinbase.”  StopCoin is the first such service to be built on top of Coinbase. Shapiro said that some exchanges, like Bitstamp, offer similar functionality, but are more similar to day-trading platforms than consumer bitcoin wallets.  Consumer control  Shapiro’s believes that instead of bitcoin holders having to helplessly watch the value of their funds dramatically rise and fall due to the complex factors that affect the market, they should be able to protect that investment with a price floor.  Shapiro said that the concept for StopCoin was born out of his personal experience of first getting involved with bitcoin – one that many others in the community have also had to go through.  At the time, the price was swinging wildly on an ongoing basis, given the series of dramatic events making mainstream headlines around the world, including the demise of both Silk Road and Mt Gox. StopCoin is his solution.  This is the third version of StopCoin since its beta release. The service is not affiliated with Coinbase and Shapiro is bootstrapping the project himself.  He has previously worked at Path and TaskRabbit and launched a nighttime delivery company called Luna.

42377780,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XL5,1415387770,Day of Reckoning for Dark Markets as Hundreds of Domains Seized,"At least 400 dark net web domains have been reported seized and 17 individuals arrested in connection with Operation Onymous, an ongoing global cybercrime crackdown.  A number of high-profile dark net markets, most notably Silk Road 2.0, have been shut down by law enforcement agencies in the US and Europe over the past 24 hours. The European Union's Judicial Cooperation Unit, or Eurojust, reported on 7th November that 414 dark web domains have been seized so far as part of Operation Onymous.  All of the sites in question were accessible through the Tor network, which according to those involved with the investigation was compromised by means of an as-yet-undisclosed tool or mechanism.  DeepDotWeb reports that the number of well-known dark markets seized by cybercrime authorities continues to climb. Recent takedowns include the CannabisRoad forums, Blue Sky, Cloud9 and Hydra. Other markets, including Agora, Middle Earth and Evolution, remain unaffected at press time.  Troels Oerting  , head of Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), said that the long-standing belief that some dark markets were obscured from law enforcement efforts is false, noting:  “We can now show that they are neither invisible nor untouchable. The criminals can run but they can’t hide. And our work continues.”  Europol had not responded to requests for inquiry at press time.  Alleged vendors arrested in UK, Ireland  Law enforcement agencies have revealed a number of arrests in connection with Operation Onymous. Blake Benthall, the San Francisco software developer and alleged Silk Road 2.0 operator, is one of at least half a dozen individuals taken into custody.  Benthall has reportedly acknowledged his role in Silk Road 2.0, according to a report from Ars Techina. In a San Francisco court, Benthall reportedly confessed to managing the site. He has been deemed a flight risk and is being held without bail.  The UK National Crime Agency (NCA) released a statement on 7th November, announcing that it had coordinated with other organizations to arrest six people across the country. Individuals in Wales, Lincolnshire and Liverpool were arrested in connection with the investigation.  NCA deputy director Roy McComb said that the arrests this week were part of a broader effort initiated after the original Silk Road marketplace was shut down last year.  “It may take time and effort to investigate and build a criminal case, but we are determined to identify and prosecute people caught dealing drugs and committing serious crime using the dark web,” he explained.  Two more were arrested in Ireland during the operation, and as much as €2m-worth of bitcoin were confiscated, in addition to a narcotics cache containing ecstasy and LSD.  As reported by the Belfast Telegraph, the Ireland-based investigation is still ongoing and the bitcoin owned by those detained has been seized by law enforcement officials.  Some sites remain, for now  With the operation still ongoing and likely to continue, it remains unclear how the dark web marketplace ecosystem will remain operational.  Message boards used by dark web market participants have seen a steady stream of anxious and concerned postings, with many focused on the big question of the day: how, exactly, did law enforcement agencies seemingly crack the Tor network?  A number of officials tied to Operation Onymous have said that criminals who use the Tor network should no longer feel secure using the system. Tor participants obscure their behavior by having their data pass through a global network of distributed servers, effectively scrambling their online footprint.  Oerting of EC3 told Wired’s Andy Greenberg that the exact method for cracking the Tor network “is something we want to keep for ourselves"".  “The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again,” he continued.  As for the sites that remain open, some observers speculate that the hosting services for still-operational dark markets may be outside of US/EU jurisdication.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.

42377776,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XB1,1415373871,Japanese Scholars Draft Proposal for a Better Bitcoin,"A team of Japanese researchers has published a paper with a set of proposals it says would improve bitcoin, effectively creating a hypothetical low-volatility digital currency called 'improved bitcoin' (IBC).  The paper, authored by four scholars from various Japanese universities, was published by the Institute of Economic Research at Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University.  The work explores the problem of bitcoin's instability from an economic viewpoint, suggesting a new monetary policy rule – effectively, monetary policy without a central bank – for stabilizing the values of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.  The new rules, they say, are based on currency board principles and inflation targeting.  Bitcoin’s ‘dual instabilities’  The researchers note that bitcoin intrinsically manifests two forms of instability, leading to extreme volatility.  “The first instability stems from an inflexible supply curve of bitcoin, which amplifies bitcoin price volatility, the miners’ revenue/reward fully absorbs any price changes. There is no stabilisation mechanism,” the researchers note.  The second instability comes from risks to the sustainability of mining. ""During a bitcoin price boom miners engage in mining activity which guarantees the supply of bitcoin, but during a bitcoin price depression, no smooth way to induce exits from mining exists,"" they say.  Therefore, the researchers conclude, the current state of the bitcoin system can be described as “freezing equilibrium with dual instability”.  The team cautions that big price drops could have a very negative effect on the network in the long run.  In one possible scenario, miners would continue their efforts even if forced to operate at a loss for a limited amount of time. However, there is also a chance that they could gradually abandon bitcoin and use their computing power elsewhere, provided there is a viable alternative.  A third and more disruptive option is that bitcoin could suffer a sudden and substantial price drop, prompting many miners to simply pull the plug with no advance warning.  The researchers suggest:  “If the bitcoin price drops below a threshold, the bitcoin system as a whole may collapse or the bitcoin users are limited to a very small number of inner members with which bitcoin is exchanged at a very small scale.”  Applying a monetary policy  To address these shortcomings and other potential problems, researchers propose a number of design changes to bitcoin. These are intended to allow the use of monetary policy on bitcoin's decentralised system, effectively creating an autonomous monetary policy without a central bank.  IBC uses the currency board model as inspiration, effectively pegging bitcoin to the US dollar, euro or another currency. The system would include a supply rule that would address demand and price fluctuations. Thus, when the IBC value increases, the system would issue more coins until the value returns to the benchmark level.  The researchers explain:  “Suppose the market value/price of IBC is P dollar at the moment. A reward for the proof of work, V, is set to rise when the market value P is above the benchmark value and a reward V is set to be zero when P is below the benchmark. Alternatively, some difficulty parameter n, adjusting the speed of proof of work is to be changed.”  However, the team concedes that the currency board approach has a defect: it cannot absorb excess coins in circulation. Central banks, on the other hand, have the advantage of being able to absorb money by selling securities and other assets.  Solving supply issues  The researchers point out that the irreversibility of cryptocurrency supply is a major concern. The basic idea of a currency board-inspired system would have to be amended with a revaluation rule for exchange rates.  Such a rule would help absorb excessive currency in circulation by introducing inflation as another policy instrument, with the inflation rate controlled by a range of factors. The resulting inflation would disincentivize hoarding and push people to exchange their IBC.  Researchers noted that the rule is “closely related” to the inflation-targeting policy implemented by many banks and would serve the same purpose. However, it differs in that the revaluation rule would depend on economic principles tied to the bitcoin economy – that is, the cost structure of mining.  'Not a national currency substitute'  Although improved bitcoin is envisioned as a way of making the cryptocurrency more stable and appealing to mainstream users, the researchers admit that it would not be able to replace major currencies, identifying four problems that would be difficult to overcome:  Cryptocurrencies are significantly more expensive to produce than traditional currency  Reversibility of bank notes is based on the exchange between bank notes and government bonds, allowing central banks to buy and sell securities with bank notes – a feature cryptocurrencies lack  Bitcoin-type cryptocurrencies use ""delayed finality"" confirmation to avoid double spending, slowing down certain transactions  Cryptocurrencies are more vulnerable to security risks than bank notes.  While the third and fourth issues could be addressed, the researchers argue that the first two would remain insurmountable, as bitcoin is simply too expensive to generate. The network's reward-per-hour is 25 BTC and, at a bitcoin price of $600, costs $2m a day to maintain.  They note:  “This is not a small amount. The bitcoin system is often described as inexpensive because maintenance costs are not charged to the bitcoin users, but are generated as reward for mining. In short, bitcoin is based on a system that takes advantage of an externality. It is not a cheap system at all.”  The researchers warn that this 'capitalisation by externality' will have to be liquidated sometime in the future, potentially leading to a collapse in bitcoin value. However, new rules proposed in the IBC concept could help address some of these issues by preventing excessive currency demand arising from the externality.

The tech conference, which has grown from 400 to 20,000 attendees in four years, had seven 'stages', spanning digital marketing to sports and entertainment, along with a roster of high-profile speakers. These included Dropbox founder Drew Houston, actress Eva Longoria and and skateboarding legend Tony Hawk.  Bill Ready, chief executive of payments processor Braintree, which also operates the popular mobile wallet Venmo, spoke at the event. He said bitcoin could be one of several payment modes in a ""multi-wallet world"".  He told the audience:  ""In this multi-wallet world we've run into ... you need to deliver [convenience to users] to a wallet ... Whether you're using PayPal for one-touch or Venmo for one-touch; Apple Pay or bitcoin.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, Ready stressed that he saw bitcoin as ""complementary"" to mobile wallets and that it would co-exist with other payment methods including credit and debit cards.  Payment processor PayCash announced at the conference that it would allow merchants in Europe to take bitcoin payments, following a partnership with Kraken, an established exchange for euro-bitcoin trading.  Another European payments firm, Adyen, also told CoinDesk it was working on bitcoin integration, which could launch next year.  Looking outside of payments, the founder of digital signature company DocuSign, Tom Gonser, told CoinDesk his firm was experimenting with bitcoin and blockchain technologies in its research and development lab. Notably, DocuSign counts financial institutions like GE Capital and First American Bank among its customers.  Gonser pointed to bitcoin's decentralised nature as having the potential to change the way digital identities are secured in the future.  Bitcoin as the new gold  Yoni Assia, chief executive of Etoro, extolled bitcoin's worth as an asset class, calling it ""digital gold"". Etoro is a ""social trading"" platform, allowing users to trade bitcoin 'contracts for difference', a type of derivative.  Assia said: ""Bitcoin is disrupting both technology and financial markets. It's the new global currency ... people refer to it as the TCP/IP of value.""  He added:  ""Bitcoin is digital gold. Gold was the technology to transfer value for the past 5,000 years. That was before technology was really invented. Bitcoin uses logic, the Internet and computer sciences to replicate that, over the Internet.""  The Bitcoin Foundation's chief scientist Gavin Andresen took to the event's 'Centre Stage' today, speaking with the Wall Street Journal's Lisa Fleisher, about centralisation in bitcoin mining, regulation and the future of digital currency.  On the subject of regulation, he said: ""Getting regulatory clarity is really important. In the last year, year and a half, we've seen more regulatory clarity. I think it's been incredibly positive for bitcoin, but now we need regulation that isn't going to kill innovation.""  Andresen wasn't the only member of the bitcoin community present at the summit – several bitcoin companies had booths at the event, including BitPay, BitMEX and SpectroCoin.

42377781,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73XJp,1415329219,Robocoin Now Requires All ATM Operators to Collect Customer Information,"UPDATE (7th November 12:10 GMT): Robocoin ATM operator Jonathan James Harrison has issued a public statement encouraging other operators to boycott the company by switching their machines to alternative open-source software.  His statement reads: ""This is a call for help to the open source and bitcoin community to come together and make these bitcoin ATMs what they should be. Free and open ... I suggest we all turn off our machines together to show we won't be bullied into his new system.""  It can be read in full here.      Robocoin has announced that it will now require all of its bitcoin ATM operators to collect customer information in an effort to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  The Las Vegas-based company reported the decision was made under the direction of its legal team, which advised the startup that, as a registered money services business (MSB), it could no longer process anonymous financial transactions.  In its full remarks, Robocoin asserted that while it had hoped to allow its ATM operators to continue to choose whether to meet KYC standards, recent actions from the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), along with the shutdown of allegedly non-compliant ATMs, signal that bitcoin companies that fail to adhere to regulations will face repercussions.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley framed the announcement as a necessity should the startup want to achieve its goal of bringing bitcoin ATMs to the wider global market. In this light, he argued, the ideological preferences of individual operators shouldn't outweigh the good that the company could achieve by reaching the global underbanked.  When asked whether he believed there would be customer backlash over the decision, Kelley sought to keep the company's larger goals at the forefront.  He said:  ""Let's ask this question. How many bitcoin ATMs do we want in the world? Do we want 30? Do we want 100? Do we want 200? Or do we want 1,000, 10,000, 100,000? Our logic is it's all about providing scalability and consistency to the customer. Whether or not we wind up having to part ways with a few guys that lack alignment with us, that's just the way it goes.""  Kelley added that Robocoin would help any operator unwilling to meet the company's directive, and would act as broker to resell their machines.  The news notably comes on the heels of a wave of community backlash against Robocoin for alleged difficulties it caused operators in connection with the delivery of its units.  No links to money laundering  As part of the decision, Robocoin operators will need to upgrade to the Robocoin 2.0 platform, which mandates that bitcoin ATM customers use the company's new proprietary wallet.  At least one Robocoin operator, Jonathan James Harrison, has taken issue with the change, reporting that he will resist the upgrade to the company's new platform. Harrison aims to hold a launch party tomorrow for his latest bitcoin ATM, whether the machine is operational with its existing Robocoin 1.0 software or not.  Further, he has suggested he will attempt to galvanize sentiment against the company should it not continue support for its Robocoin 1.0 platform, which he alleges the company had previously suggested he could keep.  ""Friday will be a very bad PR day for you,"" he wrote in an email to Robocoin.  Kelley stressed in an interview, however, that he doesn't see the strategy shift as a contradiction or redefinition of any understandings between Robocoin and its operators.  Rather, he said Robocoin's relationship with ATM owners remains unchanged. Operators, he said, continue to be in the business of buying cash with bitcoin and selling bitcoin for cash, and that pursuant to this goal, all parties in the transaction should resist becoming enablers of money laundering.  ""We do not want to be associated with any kind of money laundering,"" Kelley said. ""Any machine that doesn't collect customer ID, it gives the money launderer the ability to convert cash that was earned illicitly into bitcoin and to do it without any kind of customer information. We cannot be a part of that; we can't be associated with it.""  Eye on larger goals  To Kelley, the decision was a tough, but necessary, move that he feels will send a positive signal to the wider public about how his company is looking to extend the benefits of bitcoin more broadly.  ""We're listening to the world,"" Kelley said. ""The world says 'we demand more access to bitcoin'. We want to provide that, but we cannot provide that with a few machines with our brand on them that are engaging in non-compliant activity.""  Kelley framed the Robocoin 2.0 upgrade as a way to better bring bitcoin to the world. For example, he cited the improved ease of use of the platform compared to the original iteration.  ""With our new software, customers walk up to the machine for the first time, put in cash, get a bitcoin wallet made right there, and then have the ability to send that bitcoin to another person anywhere else in the world, or send it to their own wallet,"" Kelley said, emphasizing how this improves on the company's original approach.  Harrison, however, alleges that he felt Robocoin's 2.0 software had so far underdelivered, a claim that Kelley also countered by taking a long-term view on his product.  ""That's the beauty of developing on a new platform, at launch it may have a few little glitches the same way you might have with a new Apple update, but over time it gets stable, it improves, we get feedback,"" he said.  Courting business partnerships  In statements, the company sought to portray the step as one that is vital to the company's continued operation, and therefore in the best interest of its operators and customers.  ""There are some guys in some markets who want to be the only one and they want to own that machine,"" he said. ""Our logic is that we want a machine on every corner to make sure we can deliver on the promise of bitcoin.""  Kelley went on to state the he feels the change is necessary should Robocoin seek to appeal to new business partners in accordance with its goals, just as Coinbase and other companies in the ecosystem have done in the past.  ""Big companies do not want to do business with guys who have machines that are non-compliant,"" Kelley said.  The statements concluded by noting how Robocoin has evolved in the year since it launched, reading:  ""Bitcoin and the bitcoin ATM industry have matured. As the legal landscape becomes clearer, Robocoin evolves and so do the requirements with which we must comply.""
