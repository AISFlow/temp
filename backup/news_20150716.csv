42398514,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbUS4q,1437069171,State of Bitcoin Q2 2015: Price Rallies Amid Economic Turmoil,"CoinDesk    CoinDesk’s latest State of Bitcoin report is now live, focusing on events in the cryptocurrency world in the second quarter of 2015.  This article runs through some key findings from the nearly 100 new slides found in the report.  Why 'State of Bitcoin'?  The Q2 2015 State of Bitcoin report marks the seventh report in CoinDesk's series. During its creation, we reflected on how much has changed since the first State of Bitcoin was released in February 2014, enough that we felt it worth revisiting the report's title.  In short, why should this publication still be called the 'State of Bitcoin'?  From the very beginning, the State of Bitcoin included data on altcoins and other non-bitcoin subject matter (eg the Ripple protocol). However, when this publication was originally conceived we chose a title with ‘Bitcoin’ rather than a more general title (eg ‘State of Cryptocurrency’) given the overall dominance of bitcoin as reflected in measures such as bitcoin’s share of the total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, mindshare and media coverage, developer focus and other factors.  Fast-forward 17 months and many significant industry developments that are not specific to bitcoin have now taken place, including progress made by various altchains and the advent of ‘private blockchains’.  However, as revealed throughout the Q2 2015 report, bitcoin and its blockchain remain the ‘big enchilada’, leaving the ‘State of Bitcoin’ an appropriate title for our analysis of the most important trends and developments in the overall cryptocurrency industry.  Price has first up-quarter in a year  Top-of-mind for Q2 is the renewed life seen in bitcoin’s price in the past few weeks.  The bitcoin price, on a quarterly return basis, had been on a 12-month losing streak prior to the end of June (Chart 1).  Much of the speculation behind why bitcoin’s price appreciated 8% in Q2 (with gains coming in the quarter’s final days), and a further 5% in Q3 (Chart 2), has focused on the macroeconomic and financial issues in Greece and China.  Our assessment is that there is merit to this view, with a couple of important caveats.  With regard to Greece, it is true that several measures of sentiment suggest the country has a growing interest in bitcoin. However, for a number of reasons we believe it is observers of the Greek crisis, rather than the Greeks themselves, that are likely to be responsible for any price appreciation associated with Greece’s debt crisis (Slide 84).  In contrast, the significant gaps in exchange rates on Chinese exchanges and those outside the country suggest the Chinese were driving bitcoin’s price appreciation following concerns over financial market stability and trading restrictions.  While the Chinese government crackdown on sellers appears to have slowed the stock market free-fall, further financial market instability (forecasted by China-watchers like Michael Pettis and others) may lead to Chinese buyers piling back into bitcoin. Bitcoin market watchers will recall that Chinese buying was an important driver during bitcoin’s 5x price spike in November 2013.  Even with bitcoin’s end-of-June price rally, the second quarter was one of the least volatile in recent history (Slide 11). Whether lower price volatility represent progress, poses problems, or is a combination of both is a subject of considerable debate.  Banks and governments catch blockchain fever  While many large financial institutions have been examining bitcoin and related technologies for some time, Q2 was the quarter that many came public with announcements of various trials and investments in blockchain technology and related companies (Slide 52).  One notable example was the announcement by NASDAQ of a blockchain-based solution for managing privately traded shares, which were previously transferred through a cumbersome manual process.  While the word ‘bitcoin’ was conspicuously absent from NASDAQ’s public announcement, it is in fact bitcoin’s blockchain that NASDAQ is utilizing.  In addition, seven banks from around the world have now established partnerships with Ripple, including three of Australia's ‘big four’ banks (Slide 34). The increasing attention shown in blockchain technology by traditional financial services firms is being driven by an awareness of the potential to reduce costs, improve product offerings, and increase speed, as highlighted in a recent report from the Euro Banking Association (EBA).  There were also two significant government blockchain announcements this quarter. The Isle of Man is running the first government-run blockchain project, creating a registry of digital currency companies operating on the island. Also, the government of Honduras has purportedly partnered with decentralized record-keeping startup Factom on a new land title registry initiative (Slide 51).  Overall, Q2 heralded the arrival of the blockchain, and its utility as a technology platform, as it stepped out from the shadow of bitcoin the currency.  VC investment robust, but concerns emerged  Total bitcoin venture capital increased 21% to $832m in Q2, with the quarter’s two biggest deals by Circle and Ripple of $50m and $28m, respectively. We continue to project 2015 bitcoin venture investment to surpass early stage internet investment in 1996 (Slide 38).  However, rising competition in the bitcoin ecosystem has led to an increasing number of acquisitions and bankruptcies, with consolidation particularly active in exchange and mining sectors due to cost and competitive pressures (Slide 32).  Further, the closure of bitcoin startup Buttercoin, which counted deep-pocketed Google as one of its investors, served as a wakeup call that the venture capital spigot, which has buoyed the industry of late, can be turned off as well as on.  Bitcoin commerce still lags  The rate of growth in the number of new bitcoin-accepting merchants remains below previous quarters (Slide 57).  The fundamental challenge for bitcoin as a medium of exchange (for non-illicit transactions) continues to be the lack of compelling reasons for mainstream consumers to use bitcoin. In the short run, we anticipate that many bitcoin businesses that were initially focused on payment processing will either pivot, merge or shutter.  Given these trends, will bitcoin be confined to remain a store of value with no future as a widely used medium of exchange? Not necessarily.  ""I’ll spend bitcoin when I'm paid in bitcoin""  One reason people don’t use bitcoin as a medium of exchange is because very few are actually paid in bitcoin. But this may be about to change.  In Q2 the most well capitalized bitcoin startup, 21 Inc, revealed its plans around its BitShare mining chip, which will be integrated into a wide variety of consumer devices (Slide 77).  What makes the BitShare chip and similar efforts so interesting from a medium of exchange perspective is their ability, in the words of 21 Inc CEO Balaji Srinivasan, to ""generate a continuous stream of digital currency for use in a wide variety of applications"".  In other words, after a device with an embedded mining chip is acquired, the user will be automatically and regularly paid in bitcoin, just as many people have their wages directly deposited every two weeks into their bank accounts.  Overall, there are many open questions about embedded mining chips, and even if the technology and economics are sound, it may take a considerable amount of time for such devices to gain significant adoption. However, should the use of embedded mining chip devices become widespread then it could be a game changer for bitcoin’s prospects as a medium of exchange.

42398507,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURyw,1437064232,European Court of Justice Official Proposes Bitcoin VAT Exemption,"Bitcoin operations should be exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT), the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice said in an opinion document published today.  Citing existing exemptions  for currency and money transactions in Europe’s VAT Directive, Advocate General Juliane Kokott urged the court to opt against applying a tax to bitcoin purchases and sales. She further argued that bitcoin, while not legal tender, is still a form of money.  Kokott wrote in the opinion:  “I therefore propose that the Court should reply...[that] these operations are exempt from tax under section 135, paragraph 1, point e) of the VAT Directive.”  Swedish tax officials asked the ECJ to look into the matter last June. At the time, the Skatterverket – Sweden’s tax office – challenged a court decision that ruled bitcoin transactions in the country should be exempt from VAT, an outcome that grew from a dispute between the tax authority and bitcoin forum operator Daniel Hedqvist.  Member-state level decisions  The publication of the European Court of Justice's opinion follows the release of bitcoin VAT exemptions by various EU member states.  Last year  , Belgium's Federal Public Service Finance (FPS) released a statement which noted that certain domestic digital currency transactions were exempt from VAT.  Spain's bitcoin community rejoiced in April following the news that the digital currency had been declared exempt from VAT. A spokesperson from Spain's Ministerio de Hacienda, the tax Office, told CoinDesk that the cryptocurrency had always been exempt from VAT but that the decision clarified existing readings of the law.  The confirmation, the spokesperson said, was based on the interpretation of EU VAT Directive 2006/112/CE, which defines bitcoin as a ""financial service"".  Last month, it was Switzerland's turn to celebrate a VAT exemption for bitcoin in the country.  Not all European Union countries have come to support a VAT exemption for bitcoin. In December, Estonia opted to apply VAT to the full amount of bitcoin trades, not just the commission or the fee incurred by the transaction.

42398497,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURr4,1437057923,Police Arrest 20 in Digital Currency Pyramid Scheme,"Spanish police have arrested 20 individuals in connection with a pyramid scheme that used a fake digital currency called the unete to attract unwitting investors.  The Spanish National Police Corp announced the arrests on 16th July, which took place in Madrid and other parts of the country.  Police estimate that the scheme resulted in as much as €50m in losses, ensnaring roughly 50,000 victims worldwide – with 6,000 in Spain alone.  Spanish police seized over €5m and approximately $22m from related bank accounts. Two luxury cars and 18 computers were also taken into custody. According to police, the investigation into the scheme was sparked a year and a half ago after a former employee approached law enforcement officials.  In late June, Spanish language newspaper El País reported that a number of investors had begun legal action against those allegedly behind the scheme.  That report, which focused on founder José Manuel Ramírez Marco, outlined how the scheme, launched in 2013, quickly gained traction among investors for its flashy promotional events and charismatic sales pitches.  Investors exchanged euros for unetes – modelled after bitcoin and given a promised value of $1 apiece – and were encouraged to bring more investors into the scheme in order to receive bonuses.  Police said investors were promised as much as $1,300 in weekly returns. The scheme's official site promised the ability to shop online with the digital currency.  Key to the enterprise was an operation based in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a Caribbean island-nation and business tax haven, through which the illicit funds flowed. In April 2014, Latvian bank Riemutu closed an account owned by Ramírez in connection with an investigation into money laundering, effectively stopping the scheme in its tracks.  Ramírez also organized a so-called Unetenet Foundation to gather donations for sexual violence victims. Despite soliciting funds from investors, El País reported, Ramírez appears to have never registered the group or actually conducted any charitable activities.

42398493,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURn8,1437047660,Charges Against Colorado Bitcoin Trader Dismissed,"UPDATE (16th July 17:08 BST): Comments added from Brian Klein of Baker Marquart, Burt Wagner's attorney.      An indictment against a Colorado bitcoin trader, Burt Wagner, has been dismissed ""without prejudice"" by a district court judge.  Wagner had been charged by the US Attorney's Office for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in the state of Colorado in late 2014.  However, in a surprise turn of events, Judge William J Martinez issued an order to dismiss the case this Monday at its request.  Brian Klein, Wagner's attorney, said in a statement:  ""I appreciate the US Attorney’s Office doing the right thing and dismissing the criminal case against my client. With this dismissal, Burt can begin the process of resuming regular life. It has been a true privilege to represent him. I could not be happier for Burt and his family.""  An indictment, which is voted by a grand jury, informs the accused of the allegations against them so they can plan a defence. The charge in question must then be proved at trial.  The question of whether money transmission laws apply to bitcoin traders remains a grey legal area, with LocalBitcoins user Pascal Reid recently losing a bid to dismiss money transmitter charges in Florida.  Wagner faced up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if found guilty. The trader's family have raised over £12,000 in donations, including bitcoin, to fight the allegations. Their outstanding legal debts alone are said to total $95,000.  View the document in full below.

42398499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbURt2,1437044254,Bitcoin Firm Bitspark Joins Accenture's FinTech Accelerator,"Hong Kong-based remittance platform Bitspark has joined Accenture's FinTech Innovation Lab Asia-Pacific 2015 as the only bitcoin and blockchain startup in the lineup.  The three-month programme, launched by Accenture – a multinational technology services and consulting company – in collaboration with traditional finance institutions including Bank of America Merill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and UBS will provide mentoring, coaching, networking and investment opportunities to the seven startups accepted on to the accelerator.  George Harrap, CEO of Bitspark, said in a company blog posthttps://blog.bitspark.io/bitspark-selected-by-accenture-to-be-part-of-2015-fintech-innovation-lab-asia-pacific/:  ""There is a clear trend in the banking industry in 2015 that they are ready to engage in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.""  He continued: ""We are happy to be introducing our world leading blockchain-powered remittance platform to the financial services industry who can not only assist us to accelerate our business but also provide us with support, mentorship and the contacts to ensure we can bring our technology to the market in the best way possible.""  Bitspark, which is expected to present its decentralised blockchain remittance platform to potential investors and the end of the 12-week accelerator, is joined by Sparro, a payment network built on the Ripple protocol which aims to ease cross-border payments.  Interest in crypto  Accenture's involvement in the crypto space may not come as a surprise, given the company's response to the UK Treasury's s call for information on digital currencies obtained by CoinDesk last month.  In its response, Accenture said the UK government should regulate bitcoin wallets in the same way it does bank accounts.  UBS and Goldman Sach's involvement with the accelerator also follows the banks' recent ventures in the space.  Swiss investment bank UBS is exploring the application of blockchain technology in the wider financial sector at its London-based research lab.  Also, Goldman Sachs recently participated in a $50m funding round for bitcoin financial services startup Circle Internet Financial.

42426412,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbnh,1437037252,Bitnet Launches 'Instant Approval' Tool for Bitcoin Merchants,"Payment processor Bitnet has launched an 'Instant Approval' service, reducing the delays faced by merchants as they wait for bitcoin transactions to be confirmed on the blockchain.  With its new product, merchants integrated with Bitnet's payment solution will receive funds ""within seconds"", avoiding the usual wait for between two and six transaction confirmations on the blockchain.  The service works by calculating the probability of whether a bitcoin transaction will ultimately confirm on the blockchain.  Risk profiling  Despite having partnered with BlockCypher – a bitcoin technology firm which provides blockchain optimisation services – Bitnet will also carry out its own risk mitigation procedures; including investigating whether the consumer has included fees in the transaction and noting how quickly it is being propagated through the bitcoin network.  Akif Khan, chief commercial officer at Bitnet, explained that if a payment doesn't include a transaction or miner's fee, this is a clear indication that the transaction is unlikely to confirm on the blockchain, as there would be no incentive for the miners to validate it.  Network propagation, he said, would also enable Bitnet to asses the risk of a possible double spend attack, with Khan noting that the chances of it happening were reduced if the transaction was propagated across the network quickly.  Khan added:  ""Most transactions propagate across the bitcoin network with predictable speed, if this is not the case it means that the transaction is being rejected by some peers or nodes. This rejection is typically the result of the peer believing that the transaction is non-standard.""  He continued: ""Whatever the reason, when a transaction is propagating more slowly, it increases the chance that a double-spend transaction could be present in the network and reach miners before the slowly propagating original transaction reaches them.""  Bitnet, Khan noted, does not decline the transactions to the merchant. ""We notify the merchant accordingly and take liability for funding that transaction.""  ""If the probability is not high, we don't decline the transaction, we fallback to waiting until the transaction confirms and notify the merchant accordingly, thus maximising the chance that the merchant can accept the transaction.""  According to Khan, Bitnet, which raised $14.5m last year, will also take into account other risk factors, but he declined to divulge further details, noting these were of a confidential nature.  Monetisation  The new service is being offered at no extra charge and as part of Bitnet's current payment processing solution.  When asked about monetisation, Khan said the on-boarding of new clients – attracted by the speedier transactions on offer – would help the payment processor increase its revenue prospects.
