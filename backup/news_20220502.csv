42374807,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2lXP,1651535080,First Mover Asia: Why the Metaverse Is a Potemkin Village,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether are flat, but most other major cryptos decline.  Insights: The metaverse offers the illusion of success; the reality is different.  Technician's take: A decisive breakout or breakdown in BTC could occur this month.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $38,595 +0.4%  Ether (ETH): $2,863 +1.1%  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Algorand ALGO +2.1% Smart Contract Platform Litecoin LTC +1.5% Currency Ethereum ETH +1.1% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polkadot DOT −2.6% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL −2.3% Smart Contract Platform Filecoin FIL −2.3% Computing  Bitcoin, ether tick up ever so slightly  Will May bring flowers for crypto investors?  So far the traditionally strong month for bitcoin hasn't done much to make make anyone forget a dismal April.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $38,600, not far off where it has stood for the past three days. Ether, the second-largest crypto by market cap, was changing hands at roughly $2,860, up slightly over the same period. Other major cryptos were largely in the red as risk-averse investors veered away from lesser digital assets such as CRO, off nearly 11% at one point, and meme token SHIB, down more than 4%.  This cautiousness comes as the U.S. central bank eyes a likely half-point interest rate hike later this week. How crypto prices react following the increase could follow two paths, wrote 3iQ Digital Asset's Head of Research Mark Connors in an email to CoinDesk. Connors noted the potential for a continued ""divergence in volatility between U.S. equities and bitcoin."" Bitcoin's volatility has decreased significantly over the past five years even as stock volatility has risen, a sign of increasing confidence in digital assets.  But he also said that ""if rates continue to rise and push credit (investment grade, high yield) lower, risk of liquidations and deleveraging will impact all assets, including crypto (prices lower) in the short term.""  Bitcoin sank 17% in April and is down 44% since reaching its all-time high of approximately $69,000 last November. May has traditionally been a stronger month with BTC gains averaging 27% over the past 11 years. But the cryptocurrency has increasingly correlated to U.S. equities, which have plunged this year, particularly the once high-flying tech sector with the Nasdaq 100 made up largely of tech, biotech and healthcare firms down 13% in April. Major indices were up a tick on Monday, mirroring bitcoin and ether.  Meanwhile, European Union energy ministers discussed ways to wean their countries from Russia oil and gas. Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy prices, was trading at $107 per barrel, up about 40% from the start of the year. Ten-year Treasury yields soared past 3% for the first time in five years as prices for Treasury bonds continued their 2022 slump.  Connors saw ""no material price impact to crypto"" in this development and struck an optimistic note for BTC regardless of the size of the interest rate increase and stocks' performance. ""Bitcoin will outperform equities regardless of the rate hike, our data indicates,"" he said in a follow-up phone interview.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,155 +0.5%  DJIA: 33,061 +0.2%  Nasdaq: 12,536 +1.6%  Gold: $1,862 -1.8%  Insights  The metaverse is a Potemkin village  In 1787 Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin, a Russian field marshal, constructed facades of villages in the then-recently annexed Crimea to give traveling royal Catherine the Great something to look at while she toured the area. Nothing was behind these buildings. While they looked like sound structures, from afar they were a facade.  Fast forward to today and ""Potemkin village"" is an idiom that describes any construction whose sole purpose is to hide what’s behind it. To make the observer from afar think that something is more complete than it is.  So what does this have to do with the metaverse?  A few weeks ago a public relations agency pitched an interview with a ""metaverse landlord,"" someone who had an acquired a large amount of land in the metaverse and – presumably because this was included in the pitch – was now a well-to-do member of the crypto landed gentry because of the income paid by the tenants residing on his virtual holdings.  Naturally, we wanted to see some on-chain data. The beauty of the blockchain is the ability to verify any sort of claim about trades or gains because they are all recorded and verifiable via a block explorer. In the analog world, it’d be as if you had the ability to analyze any company’s balance sheet, no matter if it is public or private, to verify the statements it makes. No need for due diligence research, it’s all there on the blockchain.  But this request was ignored, and the PR person faded away because there wasn’t much substance to the metaverse landlord claims. There’s no doubt this person owned land in the metaverse, but was he actually making any money from this endeavor?  Highly unlikely, because metaverse platforms continue to struggle to attract users. Despite Decentraland’s $2.3 billion valuation, there are only around 1,500 active players, according to publicly available data and a user base of 822 monthly active users with a crypto wallet (it’s possible to log into Decentraland as a guest without a wallet).  Despite all this, Decentraland non-fungible tokens (NFT) that denote land title continue selling, according to on-chain data. NFT Stats’ tracker shows that over the last week the median price of a Decentraland land NFT was $6,800 and that 117 NFTs were sold.  The most valuable of all these recently sold NFTs is currently “Fashion Street Estate,” which sold for $234,000 in April. And what’s on this land? This isn’t to be confused with the dozen other “Fashion Street Estate(s)” that are listed on OpenSea. One was sold for 334 ether ($950,000) late last year (though its ownership history looks like wash trading) and was supposed to host a virtual Sketchers store, but it doesn’t appear to have gotten off the ground.  Despite the breathless headlines about the digital land rush to anticipate a population of netizens and brands moving in, there hasn’t been anything to materialize to meet these expectations. There are virtual landlords, but nobody pays the rent.  Of course, this isn’t meant to be a total indictment of metaverses. A very popular one currently exists called Steam, a game service where your unique identity can be brought between virtual worlds. Almost 30 million people are online over a given weekend, blasting away on games like Counter-Strike or Grand Theft Auto V.  Metaverses have existed before, too. In the late 1990s, there was Cybertown, a 3D-based virtual world with jobs, economies and homes. The name of its developer, Blaxxun, was even a reference to Black Sun, the name of a metaverse club in Neil Stephenson's ""Snow Crash."" Then there was Second Life, which improved upon many lessons learned from Cybertown, and whose founders are still around to be vocal critics of the crypto iteration of the metaverse.  All these platforms had users and economies, but none of the noise of crypto. No inflated expectations.  Now we have a metaverse Potemkin village with Web 3 investors pushing a product that data shows very few people are actually interested in.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Downtrend Intact; Support at $37K  Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a short-term downtrend since late March, confirmed by a series of lower price highs. That indicates persistent selling pressure, although support at $37,500 could sustain the current price range.  Further, BTC has been anchored around $40,000, the midpoint of a three-month price range, which suggests indecision among buyers and sellers.  Typically, BTC consolidates within a three-month price range following an extreme move such as the 50% sell-offs that occurred after the April and November price peaks around $64,000 and $69,000 last year. That means a decisive breakout or breakdown could occur sometime this month.  On the weekly chart, bitcoin has experienced a loss of upside momentum, which suggests limited upside beyond the $46,000-$50,000 resistance zone. A bearish set-up on the monthly chart increases the risk of a breakdown in price.  For now, BTC is on watch for a countertrend bullish signal on the weekly chart, per the DeMARK indicators. If confirmed, BTC could experience a brief price bounce, consistent with strong seasonal trends in May.

For a month, buyers have not been able to reach the main target of $148, which we wrote in the previous forecast. The dynamics of the LUNA market during growth was unchanged and this only increased the probable tragedy. The exit of the LUNA price from the local passive growth channel showed the first signal of market weakness. A modest 30% price fall (other cryptocurrencies have fallen much lower) shows the strength of the cryptocurrency at the moment. However, it should be understood that below the $60 mark, a real catastrophe for the LUNA market could begin. https://www.tradingview.com/x/Sat2ZqBx/ The volatility of this cryptocurrency will quickly bring the price to $33. Therefore, in case of increasing aggression of sellers (length of candles and increase in trading volumes), investing in LUNA should be forgotten for a while. If you keep the $60 mark on the weekly timeframe, the $148 target will be relevant again. However, you can risk buying LUNA for $60 only after a firm fixation of the price on the weekly timeframe. In the case of a smooth push of this mark at low volumes, it is better to close your long positions and prepare for a new fall wave.

The VanEck Community NFT is a collection of 1,000 tokens divided into several levels of rarity that each confer access to benefits such as early access to the company’s digital asset research, and invitations to in-person and virtual events.  “Since each NFT in the VanEck Community NFT is unique and scarce in their own right, the use of this NFT allows us to build an exclusive community where members who hold said NFT are invited to experiences and events where they can network with like-minded investors and crypto enthusiasts,” VanEck internal sales manager Matthew Bartlett told CoinDesk via email.  The Ethereum-based NFT collection is based around a series of memes featuring a character modeled after Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Treasury secretary, named “Hammy.” The project follows his exploration of the world of finance.  People who sign up for the collection will receive their NFT via airdrop the week of May 2. At the end of the month, the NFT will evolve into an avatar, with unique traits that will allow for exclusive access to VanEck content.  VanEck has launched several crypto products over the past several months. In mid-November, it launched its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (XBFT) that was one of the first bitcoin (BTC) futures exchange-traded funds approved in the U.S. In March, it released its Digital Assets Mining ETF (DAM).

42420816,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcRB,1651526248,"‘Smart Money’ Wallets Are Unloading APE, Filling Up on aSTETH, Nansen Data Suggests","Prolific and active cryptocurrency traders have been unloading Yuga Labs’ ApeCoin and filling up on Aave’s aSTETH, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  Over the last 24 hours, $1.28 million worth of APE has flowed out of wallets that Nansen has categorized as belonging to “smart money,” more than any other token tracked by the firm.  Nansen considers a wallet to be “smart money” if it meets at least one of several tests, including:  It is known to belong to an investment fund  It has made at least $100,00 by providing liquidity to the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, SushiSwap and Uniswap, excluding so-called impermanent loss  It has made multiple profitable trades on a decentralized exchange (DEX) in a single transaction, through mechanisms such as “flash loans”  Typically, outflows are a harbinger of a decrease in asset prices. APE prices dropped as much as 16.8% over the past 24 hours following the public debut of the “Otherside” metaverse project, Yuga Labs’ biggest non-fungible token (NFT) product launch.  Best known for creating the Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, Yuga Labs launched ApeCoin, an ERC-20 governance and utility token used for the ApeCoin decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). People who wanted to participate in the “Otherside” metaverse project would have to purchase an NFT with APE if they didn’t have a Bored Ape or Mutant. Each “Otherdeed” NFT, representing a title to virtual land in the “Otherside” metaverse, was on sale at a flat price of 305 APE.  Not surprisingly, among NFTs, the most actively traded collection in the last 24 hours has been Otherdeed for Otherside.  With just under 100,000 ETH in volume and generating roughly $285 million for Yuga Labs, Otherdeed for Otherside congested the Ethereum blockchain, costing traders more than $176 million in fees alone.  Yuga Labs tweeted, “This has been the largest NFT mint in history by several multiples, and yet the gas used during the mint shows that demand far exceeded anyone’s wildest expectations.”  In light of creating some of the highest gas fees in Ethereum’s history, Yuga Labs publicly apologized on Twitter for “turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.”  Over the same 24-hour period, roughly $0.8 million worth of aSTETH has flowed into smart money wallets, the biggest inflow among tokens tracked by Nansen. Inflows are considered a bullish signal, but the value of aSTETH maintains roughly the same price level as ether.  aSTETH is Aave’s yield-bearing token for stETH, or staked ether, in Lido, the leading liquid staking solution. Even though Curve has the largest pool of stETH, with $4.7 billion in total value locked, Aave is another main destination for stETH, with $3.01 billion total stETH supplied. Smart Money inflows of aSTETH reinforce the popular narrative that staked ETH could be an ideal investment pathway for major institutional investors.",NEGATIVE,ETH | APE,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | APE,Sage D.

Buyers were unable to keep the price in the global consolidation and gave control over the mark of $1.1. The defeat of buyers was total. Buyers didn&apos;t even try to make any fights or bounce back. In April, the FTM price fell by 50%. The monthly candle closed with a full body, giving no chance of thoughts of the beginning of the reversal. https://www.tradingview.com/x/79rr1HKF/ Thus, the main scenario at the moment is the continuation of the fall of the FTM price to $0.45. To receive final confirmation of this scenario, buyers must test the strength range of $1.2. There must be serious opposition from sellers in this range. Why? All sellers who expect the trend to continue to fall in the range of $1.2 will gladly open short positions, and big players will be ready to increase their positions. Therefore, in the case of a local growth wave, one should not entertain hopes of completing the correction in the FTM market.

Bitcoin (BTC), the world's largest crypto by market capitalization, declined by less than most of the alternative cryptos (altcoins) last month, indicating an overall lower appetite for risk among traders. On Monday, BTC was roughly flat, compared with a 3% loss in Shiba Inu's SHIB token and a 2% dip in Solana's SOL token.  Still, some altcoins have edged higher, including Avalanche's AVAX token, which was up by 4% over the past 24 hours but down by 17% over the past week. Overall, both stocks and cryptos have experienced choppy price action over the past few months.  Just launched! Please sign up for our daily Market Wrap newsletter explaining what happens in crypto markets – and why.  On Monday, the S&P 500 fell to a new record low for the year as the 10-year Treasury yield hit 3% for the first time since 2018. Also, on Monday, European stocks plunged during the first few minutes of trading, which caused some exchanges to briefly halt trading. Gold, a traditional safe haven, was also down on Monday.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $38,547, +1.91%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,842, +2.76%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,156, +0.57%    ●Gold: $1,863 per troy ounce, −2.43%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.00%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin dominance on watch  The risk-off tone in stocks is also evident in crypto markets.  The chart below shows the bitcoin dominance ratio, or the ratio of bitcoin's market cap relative to the total crypto market cap. The ratio has been stuck in a year-long range, albeit elevated above 40%.  Typically, the BTC dominance ratio declines during risk-on periods as altcoins outperform bitcoin. And during down markets, the ratio rises as bitcoin experiences less selling pressure than alts. The last significant rise in the dominance ratio was seen during the 2018 crypto bear market.  Currently, the ratio is trading above its 200-day moving average, which could signal a reversal from its steep downtrend.  Additional increases in the dominance ratio could also cap upside moves in several altcoins relative to bitcoin.  Still, multi-asset crypto fund flows have continued to rise this year, which could reflect the need for diversification among investors. For example, in April, bitcoin and ether-focused crypto funds saw outflows, while multi-asset funds saw inflows, according to data from CoinShares.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is up 1.3% through the first two days of May, changing hands around $38,310 as of press time.  Historical data shows that May is typically a strong month for bitcoin, with gains averaging 27% over the past 11 years.  A repeat in 2022 would be welcomed by bitcoin bulls, especially after April's 17% rout – the cryptocurrency's worst monthly performance so far this year. Bitcoin has declined over the past four weeks alongside weak U.S. stock markets, and lately it has been especially correlated with the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index.  Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, estimates BTC will end May somewhere between $32,000 and $48,000.  “A more local view of the dynamics of the first cryptocurrency indicates an ongoing struggle around the $38K mark,” said Alex Kuptsikevich. “This struggle will decide which of the above levels the price will be closer to at the end of the month.”  IntoTheBlock analysts see macroeconomic conditions impacting crypto’s outlook through the rest of 2022.  “Both bitcoin and [ether] saw net outflows from centralized exchanges in the hundreds of millions,” wrote IntoTheBlock in a newsletter, “suggesting buyers continue to accumulate on their private addresses.”  CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported earlier Monday that bitcoin is historically immune to the “should I sell in May?” sentiment prevalent in some other assets. In the past 11 years, seven of them saw bitcoin trade higher in May.  Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, was down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at $2,803.

Some people claim that cryptocurrency mining is energy-intensive and wasteful. In contrast, others argue that it needs to be seen in the context of the benefits that it brings to the wider economy. There have been many attempts to ban cryptocurrency mining in New York during the past year. However, none of them has been successful. Massena and Plattsburgh passed bans on mining Bitcoin in 2018, but those were overturned after a year. Now, some state lawmakers want to ban some types of Bitcoin mining altogether. However, these attempts are misguided. Mining is a Growing Trend in New York Upstate New York is becoming the new home of crypto mining operations. These companies generate huge amounts of energy by performing computer work for a small fee and are crucial to the cryptocurrency network. In addition to cheap electricity, New York also has abundant hydropower, which makes cryptocurrency mining an excellent business opportunity. However, while some towns are eager to welcome cryptocurrency mining, others are wary. Let&apos;s look at some of the concerns. First of all, crypto mining does not support climate goals. The state has a target of reducing its carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, but crypto mining is threatening that goal.

Bitcoin Miner Reserve Holds Still Amid The Recent Price Consolidation As pointed out by an analyst in a CrypoQuant post, BTC miners have been accumulating for some time now, and the dwindling price hasn&apos;t scared them. The &apos;Bitcoin miner reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of coins present in wallets of all miners. When the value of this indicator observes a decrease, it means the supply held by miners is going down. Such a trend may be a sign that miners are dumping right now as they usually withdraw coins from their reserve for selling them on an exchange. And therefore, this can be bearish for the price of the coin. On the other hand, an uptrend in the indicator, when prolonged, can prove to be bullish for the value of Bitcoin as it may show miners are accumulating at the moment.

42421590,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoi3p,1651517433,Otherside and the Future of NFT Consolidation,"This past weekend, the crypto media company Yuga Labs orchestrated what was almost certainly the biggest non-fungible token (NFT) launch in the history of the Ethereum blockchain: a sale of virtual land in a forthcoming metaverse space called Otherside.  The firm sold tokens tied to 55,000 distinct parcels of land at around $6,500 each, and generated something like $300 million in revenue. (The NFTs were priced exclusively in ApeCoin, Yuga Labs’ official cryptocurrency, the volatility of which makes it tough to settle on an exact number.)  The sale also functioned as a kind of unofficial funding round for a company that raised $450 million in blue-chip venture financing earlier this year.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Yuga Labs, for the uninitiated, is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which remains the crypto ecosystem’s single most valuable NFT collection. The firm didn’t even have to say what it planned to do with the money, in teasing the Otherside land sale; the fact of its proximity to the Bored Apes was more than enough reason for investors to buy in.  And buy in they did, in spite of a series of system-breaking failures.  Ethereum is a notoriously rickety network, with a fee system designed to increase rewards for miners when there’s more activity on the blockchain. (Each block on the chain can only fit a certain number of validated transactions – traders can opt to spend more on fees for the privilege of cutting to the front of the line.) Activity was high during Saturday night’s Otherside sale, and fees were too: traders shelled out over $100 million in fees alone.  And because all pending transactions on Ethereum are queued up in one giant list, what clogs a single NFT project can end up clogging the entire network. At certain moments on Saturday and early Sunday, even simple crypto transfers demanded several thousand dollars in fees.  That meant that the $6,500 buy-in was effectively even higher – only investors with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of liquid crypto could capitalize on the land rush. And Bored Ape owners got to skip the whole process, claiming free Otherside NFTs at their leisure, as gas prices descended to reasonable levels. One prominent Ape investor, Jimmy McNelis, boasted about paying just .88 ETH in fees to claim 144 Otherside land parcels.  The result is that Otherside effectively comes with a baked-in class of landed elites. Staking a claim in Yuga Labs’ metaverse was far easier for a Bored Ape owner than for any other variety of NFT whale; for traders without hundreds of thousands of dollars already invested in this space, it was nearly impossible. (A single Otherside NFT currently costs about $11,000 on the secondary market.)  If, as metaverse boosters like Mark Zuckerberg predict, the creator economy really does move into virtual online spaces like these, we’ll all be working on Ape-owned land – almost a riff on manorialism, the Medieval economic system, with Apes as lords.  The decision to conduct Saturday’s sale in ApeCoin also meant that prospective investors had to load up on the coin in advance of the sale, resulting in a literal pump and dump: the price of a single ApeCoin shot up to $26 ahead of the sale, and immediately dipped nearly 50% once traders swapped their coins for NFTs.  Yuga Labs’ response to the chaos was to propose abandoning Ethereum entirely.  “We’re sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while,” reads a statement from the company’s Twitter account. “It seems abundantly clear that ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain in order to properly scale. We'd like to encourage the DAO to start thinking in this direction.”  It’s ironic for a few reasons, the first of which has to do with the idea that Yuga Labs would “like to encourage” the ApeCoin DAO to start thinking about working on its own blockchain, as opposed to building its own blockchain outright.  Yuga Labs has spent months trying to distance itself from ApeCoin and its primary governing body, the ApeCoin DAO, presumably for regulatory reasons. The thinking is that if ApeCoin comes from Yuga Labs, it’s a kind of securities offering, and should be regulated as such. If it comes from this amorphous, headless DAO, though, it should technically be outside the scope of the SEC (more on that here).  And even though Yuga Labs can’t just tell the ApeCoin DAO to do something, it can probably still get its way, thanks to the enormous amount of voting power it exerts over DAO proposals.  On Twitter, conspiracy-minded NFT investors suggested Yuga Labs may have even brought down the blockchain intentionally, as a way of manufacturing consent for a brand new network.  Axie Infinity, now the splashiest example of a “play-to-earn” (P2E) blockchain-backed video game, already operates on a dedicated chain called Ronin. Where Ethereum adds new transactions to the blockchain with something called a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, Ronin uses an alternate mechanism known as delegated proof-of-stake. It’s generally considered a more centralized system; validators with the most staked crypto will always exert the greatest control over the network.  Porting crypto from mainstream blockchains over to Ronin requires a special program called a “bridge,” which is particularly vulnerable to exploits and hacks. Last month, Ronin saw around $625 million siphoned from its bridge in one of the largest crypto exploits ever. Widespread distrust around bridges could potentially impact the price of these assets, too, as traders opt to keep their tokens on more reliable networks.  A dedicated ApeCoin blockchain would restrict the entire Ape economy to a single network. That includes the Bored Apes themselves, but also spin-off collections (Mutant Apes, Bored Ape Kennel Club) and any other non-Ape properties owned by Yuga Labs, like CryptoPunks and Meebits.  And even if the hypothetical ApeCoin blockchain isn’t technically “owned” by Yuga Labs, the company will still effectively lead the DAO. At that point, why not just run a private cloud server?  Read more: The First NFT Monopoly  It’s no wonder the Otherside debacle has traders so peeved. The rich get richer, supposedly decentralized systems continue to centralize, and the venture capital firms behind Yuga Labs are poised to expand their monopoly over the space even further.

Over the past decade, their inflation rate has skyrocketed to the point where items like toilet paper and flour are practically impossible to come by. This makes it nearly impossible to run an effective business in this country as you can&apos;t predict your costs from one month to the next or even today. So what&apos;s the solution? Investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may very well be the answer to a hyper-inflationary economy! Inflationary economies erode the value of saved money and slow down the economy. This causes citizens to prioritize spending over saving, decreasing their savings account value. As a result, people often seek to hedge against inflation by investing in assets like gold in such a situation. While gold has long been a popular choice, crypto has been gaining in popularity in recent years. Bitcoin as an Inflation Hedge It may seem hard to believe, but recent reports show that the annual inflation rate in the U.S. topped 8.5%. In other parts of the world, annual inflation rates are skyrocketing. Some economists worry that this bout of inflation will last and permanently damage the global economy. If this scenario continues, Bitcoin may be an inflation hedge. Indeed, JPMorgan Chase has reported on institutional investors buying bitcoin as an inflation hedge compared to gold.

42374789,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw2lFn,1651515708,"Marathon Digital Kicks Off Miners’ Earnings Season With Focus on Rig Deployment, Funding","Marathon Digital (MARA), which is one of the world's largest publicly traded bitcoin miners, will kick off the first-quarter earnings season for crypto mining companies this week, with a focus on how the company is going to house more than 70,000 new mining rigs and source capital for growth, according to Wall Street analysts.  The earnings report is slated to be released after the stock market closes on Wednesday. Marathon will also be hosting its first-ever earnings call at 4:30 p.m. ET on that day.  Analysts will be looking for updates on its roughly 70,000 new miners that will need to be housed and deployed. “MARA has taken delivery of ~70k new Bitmain S19s, but delays in finalizing PPAs (power purchase agreements) with Ercot (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) have resulted in ~45 days' delay for Compute North (the hosting provider) to have the facility ready for MARA's miners,” Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen wrote in a research note on Monday. “We are interested to hear an update about the status of and timeline for deploying these miners.”  Petersen has a buy rating on Marathon and a 12-month average price target of $36, which was lowered from $51 to reflect the delay in rig deployment and lower bitcoin price estimates for the year. Petersen now expects bitcoin's price to average $49,529 this year, down from his previous estimate of $54,722.  Compass Point Research & Trading echoed the questions around Marathon’s strategy for housing its new miners. “We will also be looking for commentary around where the company expects to house its 78k S19 XP miner coming later this year, as MARA has not indicated where they will be hosted,” analyst Chase White wrote in a research note on Monday.  Chase also has a buy rating on Marathon, and his 12-month average price target is $50, down from his previous estimate of $66. The average price target of the six analysts who cover Marathon is about $51, according to FactSet data. The stock was recently trading at $16.23.  Marathon said on April 4 that it is still on track to meet its hashrate guidance of 23.3 exahash per second (EH/s) by early 2023, despite a 45-day delay in deploying its mining rigs during the first quarter. Hashrate is measure of computing power.  Funding and relocation  Compass Point’s White will also look for a discussion of how Marathon plans to raise funds for future growth. “We will be looking for any commentary around how the company plans to finance its buildout going forward, and specifically what sources of capital might be available,” White wrote. “We expect MARA will likely indicate a willingness to start selling some of its monthly mined BTC to fund a portion of its opex (operating expenses) and capex (capital expenditures).”  Read more: Battered Bitcoin Miners Increasingly Turn to Debt Financing  For his part, Jefferies’ Petersen is looking for updates on how the company plans to relocate its mining machines away from a site in Hardin, Mont., that is powered by coal, to a site with more renewable energy sources.  “On the earnings call, we hope to learn more about whether MARA intends to use Compute North or is considering other hosting providers to house the Hardin miners and any future orders,” Petersen wrote.  Another topic that could be a point of discussion is recent chatter about mergers and acquisitions among miners. With some speculation swirling around Marathon as a possible target, the company told CoinDesk last month that it's not interested in selling the company now, citing what it considers to be its undervalued stock.  On average, analysts estimate Marathon will post adjusted earnings per share of 23 cents, sales of $51.5 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $38 million, according to FactSet.  Marathon shares have fallen 50% this year, while those of rivals Core Scientific (CORZ) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) have dropped 44% and 54%, respectively.

The deal, which was first announced in February, was expected to close by the end of March, according to an earlier blog post by Liquid.  Instead, Kayamori wrote in the letter sent Sunday from the Bahamas, where crypto exchange FTX is based and where it co-hosted last week’s Crypto Bahamas conference, that the acquisition closed on April 4.  Kayamori had to wait until the beginning of May to thank shareholders for their support, he wrote, because some of them hadn't received their consideration.  “There were some human errors,” Kayamori explained, but the delay “shows that the existing international wire transfer [system] is fundamentally broken and crypto (stablecoins) can solve this problem.”  Kayamori’s email says that Liquid’s operations will be renamed FTX Japan and FTX Singapore once the company obtains a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Liquid is being sued for wrongful termination by a former employee who alleges the Singapore subsidiary made her a “scapegoat” after it suffered a $90 million breach last year.

Related Reading | Terra Price Continues Moving North; How Soon Will It Cross $100?

The earn rate will be modified each month for the foreseeable future.

After emerging from stealth mode at this year’s Bitcoin Miami conference, Hoseki is working with Ledn, which raised $70 million late last year, to provide bitcoin holders with ""proof-of-assets"" services. The approach is similar to industry-grade proof-of-reserves for custodians, something seen as a vehicle for establishing trust in a market that has often lacked it.  Hoseki is seeking to build a framework that allows people to express ownership in bitcoin, said the startup’s CEO, Sam Abbassi. He compared owning digital assets to owning property on the American frontier in the Old West.  “If I have my bitcoin on a Trezor (a digital wallet), there isn’t really an easy way for me to express ownership of that to a counterparty, if I’m trying to get a mortgage, for example,” Abbassi said in an interview, adding:  “I can maybe take a screenshot, but it’s very imperfect. I can also move it to an exchange, potentially, and export a statement. But those statements aren’t standardized; they’re missing some of the information that underwriters, brokers and lenders want.”  It could be said Hoseki is providing a layer of institutional-grade tooling for personal wallets. Bitcoin natively enforces its own property rights, as Abbassi points out, and so the idea is to place a simple wrapper around that, rather than creating complex abstractions, he said.  Ledn is at the test stage with its bitcoin mortgage product (a similar service was recently announced by Figure), which Abbassi sees as “low-hanging fruit.” He said the Hoseki alpha product will be out at the end of May or early June and a number of partnerships with bitcoin companies are lined up.  “The mortgage use case is our go-to market,” Abbassi said. “It’s a very real problem that people have today, and something that I went through personally, and a lot of my friends have gone through. So we thought that was the most palpable thing to launch with.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/02/ledn-taps-hoseki-for-bitcoin-proof-of-asset-service-ahead-of-mortgage-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f50838bc96f524ca316bf2abb78944f380224d3c-4592x3448.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One of the best ways is to invest in your talent and become a centralized talent, leveraging technology to build your reputation in a global marketplace. Going Metaverse!! When you look at today&apos;s media landscape, it&apos;s clear that the Metaverse has the potential to revolutionize the content creation industry. The term was first coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash. There is a description of a world in which a virtual reality-powered internet is a norm in the book. Unlike a traditional, centralized website, the Metaverse will allow users to make more money without having to share the profits with a third-party hosting platform. The future of the internet is being rewritten. Metaverses are fully digital environments powered by blockchain and virtual reality. Those who become metaverse content creators will have access to powerful tools that will allow them to create immersive experiences for their audiences.

One of those is billionaire Warren Buffett who has not been shy to voice his displeasure with the digital asset. This time around, Buffett has once again made known his hatred for the digital asset by saying that he would not buy all of the BTC in the world for $25. This has drawn the ire of investors in the space, one of which is Mexico&apos;s third-richest man, Ricardo Salinas Pliego. Warren Buffett Disses Bitcoin Billionaire and legendary investor Warren Buffett recently made some remarks about bitcoin.

42395446,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxBEd,1651510677,"Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey Among Bitcoin Heavyweights Defending Mining in Letter to EPA","A group of major bitcoin (BTC) investors – including Microstrategy’s (MSTR) Michael Saylor, Block’s (SQ) Jack Dorsey, miners like Core Scientific (CORE) and Riot Blockstream (RIOT), asset managers like Fidelity and Galaxy Digital (GLXY), and venture capital players like Benchmark Capital – are among the authors of a letter sent on Monday to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defending bitcoin mining and discussing the many misconceptions about environmental impacts.  This letter comes in response to a previous letter sent to the EPA on April 20 by Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and 22 members of the Congress, which raised “serious concerns” about how bitcoin mining is polluting communities and having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.  The congressional letter “is premised on several misperceptions about bitcoin and digital asset mining, that have previously been debunked or conflate bitcoin mining with other industries,” said Saylor, et al. in the new letter to the EPA. “It is clear that education is required to ensure that public officials understand that the digital asset mining sector does not contribute to the environmental issues raised in the Letter.""  Rebutting a congressional claim about bitcoin mining facilities polluting communities and generating harmful greenhouse gas, the authors of the new letter noted that data centers that hold miners are not power generation facilities and are no different than data centers owned and operated by megacap tech firms such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT).  “Datacenters engaged in the industrial-scale mining of digital assets do not emit CO2 or any other pollutants, like other industrial facilities do; they are merely server farms engaged in computation,” the authors wrote. ""These mining data centers purchase and utilize electricity generated externally from a power station, similar to the big-tech data center operations,"" the letter added.  Read more: Crypto Mining, the Energy Crisis and the End of ESG  The emissions issue has been debated widely, and among recent actions by U.S. policymakers was the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposing that all publicly traded companies report greenhouse-gas emissions from their operations in addition to the amount of energy they consume. The mining industry, however, mostly welcomed the move, hoping to shed light on efforts at using renewable energy sources.  There’s also been moves at the state level, with New York’s Assembly advancing a controversial bill aiming to put a two-year moratorium on select proof-of-work (PoW) crypto mining operations in the Empire State. Although the scope of the bill is narrow, crypto advocates are concerned that its passage would pave the way for future legislation cracking down on crypto mining in that state, and maybe elsewhere.  The private sector is acting as well, with Wikimedia, the nonprofit foundation that runs Wikipedia, over this last weekend saying it has decided to stop accepting cryptocurrency donations following a three-month debate in which the environmental impact of bitcoin was a major discussion point.  Reopening coal and other fossil fuel operations?  Today’s letter also takes aim at the congressional claim of bitcoin miner efforts to reopen previously closed gas and coal facilities to help power their operations. Saylor and company note this activity represents less than 2% of the Bitcoin network hash rate. “In reality, the majority of digital asset miners are migrating away from fossil fuel-based electricity generation and increasingly targeting renewables,” the authors argue.  Notably, the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a voluntary global forum of bitcoin mining companies and others in the industry, said a survey showed mining has become 63% more efficient from the previous year, with the estimated sustainable electricity mix now up to 58.4%. “This [power mix data] is markedly more sustainable than the default U.S. energy mix at 21% sustainable,” the authors wrote. “Digital asset mining is a fully digital process location agnostic, meaning miners can operate from anywhere in the world and data centers are able to target stranded or abundant renewable sources of energy,” they added.  Other steps taken by the industry to incentivize miners to use more green energy include the Sustainable Bitcoin Standard (SBS). The premise of this platform is that when a miner wins a block reward of bitcoin, it is issued a matching amount of sustainable bitcoin certificates (SBCs), which, like bitcoin, are on-chain tokens. These tokens can be held or uncoupled from the Bitcoin chain and sold to institutional and ESG-focused investors, who can then match these to their bitcoin holdings.  PoW versus PoS  Today’s letter also takes issue with the congressional argument regarding proof-of-stake (PoS) as superior to PoW due to its vastly lower energy usage. This is nowhere close to an apples-to-apples comparison, according to the letter's authors. They contend that PoS isn’t even really mining, but instead “a technique to determine authority over a distributed ledger, [that] does not achieve decentralized distribution“  They continue: “Moreover, it has a much more limited track record, is controlled by founders, has single points of failure and it remains dubious as to whether Proof of Stake can effectively govern a global, apolitical monetary system, in a manner like Proof of Work … Given that Proof of Stake and Proof of Work are qualitatively different, it’s misleading to refer to Proof of Stake as a more ‘efficient’ form of Proof of Work, since it does not achieve the same thing.”  Read more: Why Crypto Mining Actually Matters",POSITIVE,BTC | CORE,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | CORE,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/02/michael-saylor-and-jack-dorsey-among-bitcoin-heavyweights-defending-mining-in-letter-to-epa,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23f56390ec63e0eec4ce6c02df928e5c4b0b795c-612x373.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Polites: Similar to traditional tech user acquisition, projects need to build an effective communications strategy that discusses what value they are providing and how it directly impacts their users and communities. First, the key is to be consistent. Going &apos;stealth&apos; is a wild card strategy that can be used early on to gain momentum, but should not be the focus as a roadmap progresses. Over-communicate vs. under-communicate is my advice. Especially since attention spans are decreasing and community members will take their interest elsewhere if they don&apos;t know exactly what is happening and when. Second, make sure to have at least one marketer on your team. It sounds simple, but we find numerous dev-heavy teams that neglect marketing until the very last minute.

The bank added a feature in the investment section of its app for users to acquire bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), USDC and XRP, telling its customers that it is a new tool. CoinDesk verified this by logging onto the platform.  It's the latest tie-up between financial incumbents and service providers looking to bring crypto to the masses – be it PayPal tapping Paxos or NYDIG working with U.S. credit unions.  Banco Galicia's service is operated in partnership with Lirium, a Liechtenstein-based crypto product for digital wallets and mobile banking apps, CoinDesk confirmed.  When a user asked the bank on Twitter if the service was available, Banco Galicia said yes and added that it was adding new investment options.  Banco Galicia is offering its users the ability to buy and sell crypto, but does not allow them to withdraw or send crypto, Lirium COO Martin Kopacz told CoinDesk, adding that the bank also offers a custody feature. Banco Galicia plans to roll out the service to all of its customers by mid-May, Kopacz noted.  To offer the crypto trading and custody service, Lirium worked with OSL, a Hong Kong-based digital asset trading platform that began operating in Latin America last October.  Lirium is also working with four Argentinian financial institutions that plan to launch a crypto trading service, Kopacz said, without disclosing dates. In addition, Lirium is working on similar integrations in Brazil and Mexico, according to Kopacz.

Scammers announced the rug pull on Twitter and accused the Magic Eden platform of being &apos;cash grabs.&apos; They also claimed that the platform ignored three red flags: it didn&apos;t carry out an identity check on the scammers, didn&apos;t question the accent of the creators, and didn&apos;t explain the feasibility of the concept.

42420808,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYcHt,1651506851,Ohio's Senate Candidates Stake Out Crypto Positions,"CLEVELAND – Ohio has a long history of success in the fields of iron and steel, less so in bytes and bits, and its history with cryptocurrencies is short and largely aspirational.  In 2018, Ohio became the first U.S. state to allow businesses to pay taxes in cryptocurrency. Less than a year later, that program ended when the Ohio Attorney General determined it to be illegal. Around the same time, Cleveland fostered hopes for renewed economic relevance by turning itself into a blockchain destination. Those dreams faded as cities like Miami took off.  So when Republican U.S. senator Rob Portman announced in early 2021 that he would retire, creating an open seat in 2022, it seemed an unlikely setting for a crypto-heavy election cycle.  Yet, the contest to succeed him, among the highest profile and most expensive primary races in the country, includes several candidates with ties to crypto, in both parties and among the front-runners.  While crypto policy is unlikely to affect the race’s outcome, the technology’s mindshare among the candidates augurs well for the industry’s clout in Washington.  The Republican field  After Ohio’s historically “purple” electorate swung all the way for Donald Trump in the last presidential election by eight points in 2020, whoever wins the Republican primary Tuesday is likely to take the open Senate seat.  Polling shows JD Vance and Josh Mandel atop a crowded field of candidates. Mandel is a familiar name to those who have followed Ohio politics or crypto. He served as a state representative and state treasurer (he implemented the program to pay taxes in crypto), then he secured a footnote in crypto-politics history with a single tweet proclaiming his vision for Ohio: “pro-God, pro-family, pro-bitcoin.” Naturally, supporters can donate to his campaign in crypto.  Vance, while less vocal in his support of crypto in his campaign, owns a sizable amount of BTC (Mandel didn’t report owning any crypto as of an August 2021 financial disclosure). Vance is also heavily backed by Peter Thiel, who recently stated his views on the moral imperative for bitcoin adoption, and shamed crypto-skeptical financial leaders.  Thiel donated $13.5 million to Vance’s super PAC, $10 million of which came before a recent endorsement by former President Trump. The venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder’s support likely kept Vance’s chances alive when his campaign was struggling.  Trump’s endorsement made the author of “Hillbilly Elegy” a leading contender. Jockeying for that endorsement was the race-within-the-race. Mandel, Vance and others in the Republican field vied for Trump’s favor. Since receiving it, Vance has seen a rapid rise in the polls.  As president, Trump famously called bitcoin a scam, but this didn’t stop Mandel or Vance (or Thiel) from being publicly pro-crypto, underscoring that crypto is still truly an ancillary issue.  For Vance and Mandel (and Thiel), their interest in crypto appears to be at least as much ideological as financial. It’s a weapon for repudiating a perceived ruling class. If current financial controls are rigged by a cabal of elites without allegiance to Ohioans, crypto offers an alternative.  “At the end of the day, the thing that I really do worry about is that we have an economy that is rigged by the government to favor special interests,” Vance told CoinDesk. “The cryptocurrency world is very new, but it could provide an avenue for creating prosperity that the special interests in Washington won’t control.”     The Democratic field  On the Democrat side, the presumptive winner of the primary is incumbent Rep. Tim Ryan. Ryan co-sponsored the Keep Innovation in America Act, a crypto-friendly bill designed to maintain reasonable tax reporting requirements. But he’s had much less visible involvement than his longshot challenger, Morgan Harper.  Harper received a JD from Stanford and worked at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her level of earnest engagement with crypto is unusual for someone with a background at the regulatory agency. Her platform touts universal health care, the Green New Deal and debt-free college education.  Harper has done a crypto AMA (ask me anything) session on Reddit, appeared on crypto podcasts, and written several Twitter threads detailing her interest in the space:  Harper’s line on crypto runs parallel to that of Vance or Mandel: We can use crypto to circumvent and obviate the elites who have swindled us. In a state where household incomes have been roughly stagnant in the 21st century, less conventional solutions might have broader appeal to scorned voters than in other, more optimistic areas of the country.  ""If you distrust government, if you’re cynical about politicians, then you should be a strong proponent of bitcoin."" Mandel told the Columbus Dispatch in February. ""It’s one of the strongest antidotes we have to power-hungry governments and corrupt politicians.""  Crypto’s political appeal  In an Ohio that feels left behind by the economy and those in power, candidates on both sides of the aisle invoke crypto as a potential palliative for a low-trust society.  This race already lost its most crypto-fluent candidate in February when car dealer turned crypto entrepreneur Bernie Moreno dropped out of the Republican primary. He was the leading figure behind Blockland, an initiative attempting to turn Cleveland into a crypto hub through conferences and a dedicated physical space downtown. It has run into the political roadblocks that Moreno called “the inertia that is northeast Ohio.” Though this inertia may have stopped Blockland, it may strengthen the case for crypto in the area in the same stroke.  After dropping out, Moreno endorsed Vance. He laments that some of the candidates in the field discuss crypto without having knowledge to back it up.  ""You got people … that genuinely don't know anything about the technology. Like zero,” Moreno said. “It’d be like somebody who is saying 'hey we should be in the car business and cars are the greatest thing in the world' but they don't own a car, or someone who's giving reviews of great steak restaurants and they're vegan.""  Vance echoed that sentiment, telling CoinDesk that he owns crypto, “unlike the other guy who talks about cryptocurrency all the time but doesn’t actually know what it is.”  Though crypto is receiving unexpected attention in this race, the rhetoric is largely facile – don’t go looking for insights on the blockchain trilemma, or thoughtful discussions of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and stablecoin regulation. That’s to be expected: You can’t have higher expectations for politicians than you do for Crypto Twitter.  Going into Tuesday’s primary, it appears unlikely Harper will win, the Republican race is still up in the air and, as mentioned, crypto won’t make much (if any) of a difference in the final vote counts. But crypto’s sustained relevance here hints at its increasing political potential.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Dante Sacco,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/02/ohios-senate-candidates-stake-out-crypto-positions,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42421171,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXd52r,1651505676,Amy Wu: Gaming Companies Can't Afford to Avoid Web 3,"Like many, Amy Wu, now head of ventures and commercial at massive cryptocurrency exchange FTX, first got into crypto during the 2017 bull run. But it wasn’t until the pandemic that she started investing heavily in the industry for Lightspeed, the venture firm where she served as partner at the time.  “It was the next bull market for crypto, and I felt we were going to miss out on a multi-trillion dollar industry if we didn’t start studying and participating in crypto deeply,” she said. She and her Lightspeed partners started taking “five to 10 crypto meetings a day,” learning a lot at, well, lightning speed.  This article is part of Road to Consensus, a series highlighting speakers and the big ideas they will discuss at Consensus 2022, CoinDesk's festival of the year June 9-12 in Austin, Texas. Learn more.  One of Wu’s most pivotal investments through Lightspeed was in FTX, where she became an “active member” of the advisory board. She got to talking regularly with the company’s co-founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, whom she met in early 2021 and felt “inspired” by.  “As longtime venture investors, we are looking for generational CEOs,” she said. “It was so obvious that Sam was extraordinary.” Wu was impressed by his natural ability to explain complex crypto concepts without using any jargon – like the way Ray Dalio effortlessly explains credit to laypeople. Bankman-Fried’s knack for this, and his ability to operate effectively as a CEO, convinced Wu to join FTX full time at the beginning of this year.  Now based in the Bahamas at the company’s headquarters, Wu leads FTX’s $2 billion venture capital fund, FTX Ventures, as well as initiatives for the company in gaming, the commercial space, and mergers and acquisitions. When CoinDesk caught up with her, she was preparing for Crypto Bahamas, a roughly 1,800-person conference put on by FTX and SALT, an events platform, with the goal of bringing together crypto industry natives and key players in traditional finance and entertainment to foster “interdisciplinary conversation,” she said.  “We’re all going a little bananas right now,” she adds before our call. Still, she takes the time to tell CoinDesk how she responds to traditional finance workers’ qualms about crypto, why gaming companies are so bullish on Web 3 and what a tokenized dating app might look like.  When you’re talking to traditional finance people who are really averse to crypto, what are some of the concerns they bring up about crypto and blockchain?  The questions that I get all the time are, ‘What are the real use cases? Are people using crypto for things other than trading or as a store of value?’ I also get, ‘There's so many hacks and vulnerabilities in the space. What is it going to take to reduce that?’ Then, of course, the number one question I get is, ‘What's the regulatory environment for crypto?’  How do you answer those questions?  On the regulatory side, we’ve decided to be a very active participant. Sam spends most of his time talking to regulators in D.C. He plays an active role working with them and discussing what the right regulations might look like, that are fair and protect consumers, but also drive the right incentives. FTX was founded on the assumption that we were going to be a completely regulated industry.  As for all the use cases, the reality is that this year, we’re seeing that some of the strongest teams in traditional industries are moving into and building in and learning about crypto. I'm really hoping in the next 18 to 24 months, we'll actually start seeing these killer app use cases come out. There's a lot in gaming, but dating apps, social networks and utility consumer apps are also going to bake in incentivization with Web 3 elements. That's what I'm most excited about seeing.  The third question people ask about hacks – this is a problem. There was literally a [$625 million] hack on Axie Infinity’s Ronin bridge last month. People don't feel safe in crypto. That needs to be solved. There needs to be more security software and different tooling to really help fix that issue. It's one of the biggest areas that we're looking at investing in right now.  You mentioned a blockchain dating app as an opportunity for a killer app use case. What would that look like?  I haven't seen one yet. However, it'd be pretty fun to utilize the incentive mechanisms of a token in a dating app format. I can imagine that maybe there's a date referral program where it's like, okay, if I refer a lot of great dates that turn into great third or fourth dates, then I get rewarded more tokens, or something like that – trying to improve the dating funnel and also driving user adoption for the app.  You also mentioned Sam going to D.C. to help develop the “right” regulations for the crypto industry. What would the right regulations look like to you?  One set of regulations where you're essentially balancing the consumer protections with incentivizing the right behaviors – you don't want to create regulations that, for example, only benefit large incumbents, making it hard to compete if you're a new company. Some of the GDPR data regulations in Europe, for example, are just benefiting Google and Facebook, and smaller players can’t compete.  There’s an element of that in crypto also. Lawmakers need to have a level of understanding in order to start thinking about, ‘How do I tax this? How do I regulate this?’ Otherwise, it just creates a lot of friction, and doesn't have the intended effects of consumer protections.  FTX reported a user base growth of 60% between October 2021 and January 2022, with daily trading volume rising to $14 billion on average. To what do you attribute FTX’s massive growth in such a short time?  It was a combination of Sam running the company very distinctly, and also just being in the right place at the right time. There was tremendous product market fit because there essentially wasn't an exchange at the time that was built around a more hardcore use case of trading. At the time, a lot of exchanges were tailored for retail users. FTX was built for traders by traders. The feel of our FTX Pro app was designed for a more professional use case.  We then acquired Blockfolio, which has this great retail experience – a lot easier to use UX. But FTX’s growth is the combination of a lot of things, including a blistering pace that Sam has set. The culture of execution within FTX has really contributed to the success of the business. There are virtually no titles within the company. Many of us have external titles that we use, so that external parties can understand our role, but internally, it's an extremely flat organization.  The decision making is both very centralized and also decentralized at the same time. The number of employees is very small – we only have about 300 people. For the size, revenue base and trading volumes that we have, most of our peer exchanges have 10 times the number of employees. But we think we're operating and executing in aggregate faster because when you're lean, you can move faster.  Also, Sam is basically online working 24/7. He has this uncanny ability to have a grasp on everything that's happening around the company. He's able to very quickly provide guidance, but allow any employee within the company to feel a lot of empowerment, to take hold of any project. They feel a lot of excitement about that.  I know one of your big focuses at FTX is gaming. What big gaming companies in the Web 2 world are spinning off Web 3 divisions right now?  You can count on one hand the number of large gaming companies that are not doing that. Virtually all of them are. That’s because a large gaming company is, essentially, a collection of dozens of IPs. They know that it's a portfolio management strategy. You can't predict how big one of your games is going to be, unless it's a beloved franchise like Halo.  Therefore, they launch a number of games, and they see what really resonates with gamers. Most gaming companies feel that they can't miss out on Web 3. We already know that Axie Infinity has attracted over 2 million daily active users. There is definitely an audience out there that's super excited about it. Basically, Web 3 is something that almost no gaming company can afford not to experiment in.",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jessica Klein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/05/02/amy-wu-gaming-companies-cant-afford-to-avoid-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b9fa4c9dffb07985c86fcb41700f6b0414ffcf2-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In addition, other blockchain-based applications in travel might be of interest to you.

With fuel comprising almost 25% of airlines&apos; expenses, most airlines simply cannot compete in price without charging extra for baggage, choosing less-direct routes, or adding a surcharge for those traveling with more than just a carry-on.

42422838,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qLxh,1651502199,What a Mining Moratorium Could Really Mean for New York’s Crypto Industry,"The New York state Senate is considering a bill that would place a two-year moratorium on some proof-of-work crypto mining operations.  The crypto industry has geared up to fight against what opponents describe as ""bad policy"" that could affect more than just miners, causing a chilling effect across the entire industry in New York. The bill’s opponents will rally in Albany on the Capitol’s steps on Monday.  A similar bill was proposed last year by Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, a Democrat from upstate New York who also sponsored this year’s version. Though the previous bill passed in the Senate, it died in the Assembly after facing stiff pushback from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).  This year’s bill is much narrower in scope than its failed predecessor, which would have imposed a three-year moratorium on all crypto mining in the state. The latest bill would apply only to new permits for proof-of-work mining operations in former power plants where the primary source of power is derived from fossil fuels or permit renewals where the applicants try to expand their facilities beyond their current sizes.  Existing operations, including Greenidge Generation, would be exempt, as would all other mining operations that tap into the state’s cheap hydroelectricity.  That, however, hasn't soothed fears in the crypto industry. Lobbyists and industry leaders have taken to social media to protest the bill, claiming that it lays the groundwork for future legislation that could crush the state’s mining industry and maybe even the industry as a whole.  Also concerning, they assert, is the message that the legislation – whether it is passed or not – sends to the crypto industry and its investors in New York.  Industry impact  Despite tight regulation and high taxes, New York has emerged as the U.S. hub of the crypto industry. Many major crypto companies including Gemini, Paxos and OpenSea have their headquarters in New York.  New York state’s abundant cheap industrial energy – prices are as low as 1.9 cents per kilowatt hour in some cities, compared with the national average of 7.3 cents – has drawn the attention of the mining industry. Miners have set up shop in former industrial towns in New York’s North Country and Finger Lakes regions, sometimes taking over shuttered coal-fired power plants and turning them into gas-powered crypto mining operations.  John Olsen, New York state lead at crypto lobbying organization the Blockchain Association, told CoinDesk that a mining moratorium could be an “existential threat” to the state’s crypto industry, which he said is already overburdened with regulatory obstacles, including the BitLicense.  “A two-year mining ban sends a really bad message to the blockchain industry, to crypto companies, to Web 3 companies,” Olsen said. “As more and more states begin to think about the future and where blockchain plays a role, New York is saying ‘You’re not welcome here.’”  Olsen told CoinDesk that he is concerned the bill unfairly targets the crypto industry, while not preventing other electricity-intensive industries, including the cannabis industry, from causing the same amount of pollution.  “It’s troubling to me that a bill like this is directly targeting one specific industry. New York itself could use all the help it can get in generating jobs and keeping people here in the state, but also in developing new technologies and bringing the state forward,” Olsen said. “We’ve seen a lot of anti-tech rhetoric and legislation in previous years …[crypto] companies are just going to think ‘You know, it’s not worth it here in New York,’” he said.  Steve McClurg, chief investment officer of crypto-focused financial services firm Valkyrie Investments, echoed Olsen’s sentiments.  “This ruling could have unintended consequences for New York,” McClurg wrote in a statement provided to CoinDesk. “As a result of this legislation, we believe innovators and entrepreneurs will continue [to] leave New York in an exodus that started during the pandemic to more welcoming states like Florida, Texas, Wyoming and Tennessee.”  Foundry, a digital asset mining and staking company with operations across the U.S. (Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk), is one of those that has insinuated it may be a flight risk in the event of a New York moratorium. The company has headquarters in Rochester and employs more than 100 people.  Foundry CEO Mike Colyer took to Twitter on Monday to lambast the bill, saying the “push to ban Bitcoin mining is working…our customers are scared to invest in NY...thanks for killing high-tech business.”  The Foundry Twitter account was even more blunt, with this tweet: “A moratorium on bitcoin mining will take NY out of the game as our industry flourishes elsewhere, generating jobs and tax dollars in other states that are more welcoming.”  Environmental angle  The expansion of proof-of-work mining in New York – especially operations like Greenidge Generation that are reliant on fossil fuels – has been a source of concern for environmental groups.  In addition to calling for a ban on new permits for fossil-fuel powered proof-of-work mining operations, the bill also requires a study to be done on PoW mining’s environmental impact.  Many in the crypto industry, however, have pointed out that the moratorium proposed by the bill wouldn't stop environmentally intensive mining; rather it would move it to states like Texas with less stringent environmental protections.  “I think a mining ban in the name of climate protection and environmental justice is a bit disingenuous, simply because these companies can go elsewhere,” Olsen said. “You’re really just sending jobs and the industry outside of your own state.”  Graham Newhall, a communications specialist who works with the Blockchain Association on New York issues, said that by moving to places that don't have New York’s robust environmental protection laws, miners might end up causing more pollution.  “It’s not as if there is a giant dome over New York state that won’t be affected by pollution that’s happening in other states,” Newhall said.  “There’s no national proof-of-work ban coming,” Newhall added. “If one state decides to unilaterally do that on its own, it will lose the jobs but the pollution will still increase elsewhere.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/02/what-mining-moratorium-could-really-mean-for-new-yorks-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9a53f09eb01eb575b9374d7aef3c1094fe56e43-2889x1941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

So as brands and designers strive to stand out from the crowd and put their unique spin on trends and styles, it can be hard to find any similarities between them at all. And in today&apos;s world of fast fashion, where nearly everything is made as cheaply as possible and shipped over to you within days of its creation, it can seem like every brand out there is more or less exactly the same as the next brand…Until now, that is. A Brief History Of Fashion The development of fashion design as an artistic expression and a form of creative art. It is credited to Francesco Albani in 1796. He was a Roman artist, who was into various painting styles, but he is best known for his fashion drawings. He brought his love and passion for art from Rome to Paris, where he became one of France&apos;s most influential artists during his time. The term Haute couture appeared for the first time in 1826 in France. It referred to high-quality dressmaking that used luxurious fabrics and detailed embroidery. In fact, Haute couture remains popular today, focusing on custom-made clothing created by hand from start to finish. In America, ready-to-wear fashion made its debut at New York&apos;s Seventh Regiment Armory in 1913. It featured clothes created by famous designers like Paul Poiret and Jeanne Lanvin.

42395458,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxBTO,1651500523,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Loses Key Support During Ugly Weekend for Crypto Markets,"Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin loses key support. Ethereum's transaction costs skyrocket while Solana suffers yet another outage.  And check out the CoinDesk TV show “First Mover,” hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern time.  Greg King, founder and CEO, Osprey Funds  Andrew Yang, founder, GoldenDAO  Rick Fox, chief business development officer and co-founder, HiDef, Inc.  John Olsen, New York state lead, The Blockchain Association  Market Moves  Bitcoin (BTC) fell below critical price support over the weekend as several adverse developments worsened the sentiment.  The top cryptocurrency suffered its second straight weekly close (Sunday, UTC 23:59) under the Ichimoku Cloud support and the psychological level of $40,000. The cloud acted as solid support several times since late February. Therefore, its latest violation may prove costly for the bulls.  Veteran investor Warren Buffett, a long-time crypto-skeptic, reasserted his stance, saying he wouldn't buy all of the cryptocurrency even at $25. ""If you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I'd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything,"" Buffett told CNBC.  The legendary investor added that bitcoin doesn't produce anything, suggesting that the cryptocurrency lacks intrinsic value.  Solana, the second-largest smart contract platform by market valuation, suffered yet another outage over the weekend, its seventh of 2022, as the flood of inbound transactions, representing 100 gigabits of data per second, knocked out validators. The seven-hour dark period was bad optics for Solana and Ethereum competitors. The smart contract tokens could nosedive against bitcoin during the crypto market's next leg lower if any.  Ethereum's transaction fees went through the roof due to the high demand for the highly anticipated virtual land sale related to Yuga Labs' metaverse project. The situation turned so bad that Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), said, ""ApeCoin will need to migrate to its own chain to properly scale."" While the non-fungible token (NFT) frenzy burned around 70,000 ETH (worth $2 billion), the market was not impressed. At press time, ether traded 0.8% lower on the day at $2,900.  ApeCoin or APE, the governance and utility token of the BAYC,crashed 40% to $15, perhaps in a classic sell-the-news move.  ""The Ape Land Sale has been the biggest attention grabbing event in crypto lately. Members of the Ape community buying APE token for the land sale and other speculators drove APE from $10-ish to ~$28,"" CK Cheung, investor at DeFiance Capital, said in a Telegram chat. ""On the day of the sale, both community members who bought $APE but fail to participate in the land sale and speculators need to unwind their position. Leading to the unavoidable retrace after the major event.""  Steve Lee, an investor at BlockTower Capital, said, ""Those who bought 'extra' APE for this event might have to offload those amount while they are in APE community."" Lands were sold at a fixed price of 305 ApeCoin tokens per plot rather than in a Dutch auction as initially planned, which could have potentially driven prices significantly above that level.  Elsewhere in the crypto market, fears of liquidations posing a systemic risk to decentralized finance and the broader market gripped investors after a well-known Fantom whale called Roosh faced liquidations worth $50 million. ""The magnitude of the position for a relatively small chain led to fears that Fantom could collapse under a cascade of liquidations. Many on Twitter urged followers to get their funds off-chain,"" Ilan Solot, partner at the Tagus Capital Multi-Strategy Fund, said in an email.  In a tweet thread, pseudonymous degen crypto farmer Tux, said whale liquidations can lead to death spirals where all loans face forced closures. ""You're like my borrow limit is safe and it's at 50% rn. What happens when a $50 million loan is liquidated,"" Tux noted. ""The price on-chain drops 35%. Then someone who had 20% borrow limit remaining will get instantly liquidated and then it ends up liquidating more peeps under him/her and eventually, you will be caught in the torrent as well.""

It is an excellent opportunity for lawyers to reinvent themselves as trusted strategic advisors. Blockchain has tremendous potential, and lawyers can position themselves as invaluable members of their client&apos;s core team by learning to use this technology to help their clients. With so many applications, such as legal records, blockchain offers a great opportunity for lawyers. Blockchain can reduce human error and provide a secure storage system for documents. It can also improve the credibility of certain areas of law, such as forensics and fraud investigations. Law Firms Must Adapt To Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology is transforming how businesses and law firms do business. It provides a secure, transparent, and immutable database for legal transactions. This technology is also based on asymmetric cryptography, making transactions between users secure. Each user has a unique, cryptographically-related private and public key. It is mathematically impossible to guess another user&apos;s private key. This makes blockchain a great technology for law firms, as it enables simple contracts to be coded and executed when conditions are met. Until blockchain technology becomes widely adopted, some law firms will continue to resist using this technology.

42395455,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxBUN,1651495936,"ApeCoin Drops, Ether Trades Flat Despite Record $200M Gas Burn","ApeCoin (APE) prices slid as much as 11% on Monday in an otherwise flat crypto market after a much-awaited non-fungible token (NFT) project was sold for APE over the weekend.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rose a nominal 1.8% in the past 24 hours, data shows. The two assets continue to trade below pivotal levels of $40,000 and $3,000, respectively. A decline in broader markets over the past few months has contributed to a fall in cryptocurrencies.  Movement in other majors was mixed. XRP and Terra’s LUNA gained upward of 4%, while Solana’s SOL slid 1.2%. A dip in SOL followed a seven-hour network outrage on the Solana over the weekend as bots related to an NFT project spammed the network, causing temporary technical issues.  Investors in broader markets remained concerned about further rate hikes in the U.S., even as markets in Asia and Europe inched higher. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng finished 4% higher, while U.K.’s FTSE gained 0.47% so far. S&P500 and Nasdaq futures both lost as much as 0.38%, while crude oil prices fell 3.77%.  Record gas burn on Ethereum  A single NFT project contributed to a spike in gas prices on the Ethereum network over the weekend.  Virtual land on the “Otherside” metaverse, a part of the Bored Ape Yacht Club ecosystem built by Yuga Labs on Ethereum, went on sale for a fixed price of 305 apecoin, or over $7,000 at the time, late on Saturday to significant demand.  While the virtual land sold for a fixed price, the heavy demand pushed gas prices to several ether, running into thousands of dollars at one point. Some users claimed to pay upward of $9,000, to even $14,000, in fees. Gas prices returned to normal at the time of publication of this article on Monday, data shows.  Users paid over 71,000 ether – nearly $200 million at the time of publication as per CoinGecko – in gas fees trying to purchase land on Otherside. This is by far a record high for the network, surpassing a January peak of over 19,200 ether. The fees were burned, or destroyed permanently, effectively taking some $200 million in liquidity out of the market.  Demand for ether to pay gas did little to move overall prices over the weekend. Price charts show ether hit lows of $2,743 on Saturday night before jumping $100 on Sunday and then falling to the $2,800 mark at publication time.  Prices of APE, however, fell 11% in the past 24 hours to just over $15. The tokens and their futures were some of the most traded in the past week, attracting higher-than-usual volumes and liquidations.  The weekend’s price action meant some users lost money on both falling prices and failed mints.  “APE went down and people that wanted to purchase Otherdeed could not mint due to failed transactions on Ethereum, making them lose money on the two fronts,” shared Jolyon Horsfall, Co-CEO of NFT launchpad project SparkWorld, in an email to CoinDesk.  “[This] shows how inefficient it can be, which does not benefit the users that want to get access to NFTs and it might reduce the demand from NFT projects to utilize Ethereum as their network of choice,” he added.  Others seconded the sentiment. “High fees are a double sword for public blockchains,” said Nikos Kostopoulos, blockchain adviser at Netcompany-Intrasoft. “From one point, they validate the success of a project and indicate a growing user base willing to pay high fees to utilize the network, while on the other side [they] are becoming a reason for users to seek alternatives.”  An ApeCoin-branded blockchain might not be far-fetched, either.

In a blog post on Sunday, Crypto.com said it would reduce rewards on the usage of its Visa-enabled cards based on the tiers offered. Lower tiers – such as Midnight Blue and Ruby Steel – would get 0%, Royal Indigo and Jade Green would get 0.5%, Icy White and Frosted Rose Gold would get 1%, while Obsidian, the highest tier, would get just 2%.  Monthly rewards on the lower tiers would be capped from $25 to $50, while there would be no rewards cap on the higher tiers, the company said.  Staking rewards on Crypto.com’s cards would additionally cease after completion of the 180-day period for all those who staked on May 1 or before, except for cards of the lowest two tiers. These are a steep drop from current rates of 1% on the lower-tier cards, to over 8% on the highest tier, depending on staked funds.  Crypto.com’s prepaid cards are a popular product within crypto circles, allowing users to load up supported cryptocurrencies or stablecoins and spend fiat at Visa merchants.  Meanwhile, other benefits on the cards, such as cashbacks on subscription services and complimentary airport lounge access, would continue. Furthermore, interest rates on Crypto.com’s Earn product, which allows users to earn up to 14% on crypto holdings, remain unchanged.  Community reacts  Card users expressed dismay over the changes in social media posts on Reddit and Twitter. Most comments criticized the decision.  “I’m going to continue to use the card for the remainder of my staking period and then unstake and say goodbye to the card,” claimed one Reddit user.  “Not the end but they just lost a lot of customers,” said another.  Some on Twitter said yield rates offered on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were much more lucrative as a use of idle capital.  Prices of CRO, Crypto.com’s native token, fell 11% in the past 24 hours with the bulk of losses coming in the hours after the rewards decision. CRO traded over $0.36 on Sunday, and fell to as low as $0.29 in Asian trading hours on Monday before slightly recovering at publication time.  Some analysts explained that the lack of adequate rewards contributed to a lower fundamental value for CRO tokens, which led to the price drop.  “Staking CRO tokens enabled rewards for users and incentivized the use of their debit card,” shared Edson Ayllon, product manager at dHEDGE, in a Telegram message. “Reducing cashback rewards reduced the intrinsic value proposition of CRO. This is similar to how DeFi protocols use liquidity mining to attract assets.

42395438,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASxBCf,1651483887,India Includes Crypto Businesses in New Rules for Cyber Security,"India named the country's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) as the national agency for cyber security, including the crypto industry, in a move that clarifies which agency has the authority over suspicious or illicit activities in the sector.  The move requires crypto businesses, such as virtual asset service providers, to keep know-your-customer (KYC) information and records of financial transactions for five years “to ensure cyber security in the area of payments and financial markets for citizens while protecting their data, fundamental rights and economic freedom in view of the growth of virtual assets.”  While the industry views the announcement as a soft step toward regulation before crypto-specific legislation is enacted, the government has not suggested the move is a step toward regulation. A similar, but much stronger, move was the rule to tax crypto businesses before crypto-specific legislation, announced in February. At the time, a senior finance ministry official said “just because it is taxed does not make it legal.”  India’s crypto legislation remains in cold storage with the government seeking global consensus and Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman noting the potential of crypto and blockchain as well as the safety concerns around it.  “Blockchain itself is so full of potential not just in the payment arena, but also in very many others,"" she said last week. ""Our intention is in no way to hurt this (cryptocurrency or blockchain)."" However, she added that ""it also can be manipulated for not so desirable ends, whether it is on money laundering or whether it is on leading towards financing terror.”  This is the first time the government has made it clear that the data needs to be maintained for a period of five years. KYC processes and data will need to be aligned to the guidelines of three entities: the Reserve Bank Of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Department of Telecom (DoT).  Crypto businesses also need to appoint a point of contact for CERT, a unit of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, to have an open channel of communication regarding these new rules.  Speaking at a public forum on Friday, Sitharaman sought “collective global action” for effective regulation of this dynamic technology.  “If there is impatience outside in the world saying what are you doing about crypto? I can understand the impatience but I'm sorry, that's how it is going to be,"" she said at a recent fireside chat at Stanford University. ""It will have to take its time for all of us to be sure that at least with the given available information, we are taking a discerned decision. It can't be rushed.”  Read more: Making Sense of India’s New Crypto Rules",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/02/india-includes-crypto-businesses-in-new-rules-for-cyber-security,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

The famous traditional market adage may not apply to bitcoin (BTC), however, according to seasonality analysis.  Bitcoin has logged gains in May in seven years out of the past 11 years, per charting platform TradingView's bitcoin index, which records prices from July 2010.  Historically, May has been the fourth-best month for the cryptocurrency.  ""In terms of seasonality, May is considered a relative success for BTC. Over the past 11 years, bitcoin has ended the month up seven times and down four times,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email.  ""The average rise was 27%, and the average decline was 16%. Under these scenarios, the estimated average range for BTC at the end of May is between $32,000 and $48,000,"" Kuptsikevich added.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results, more so as bitcoin's market composition has changed significantly since 2020, with institutions and macro traders having more say in determining prices.  These entities treat bitcoin as a risk asset and could liquidate their holdings if bears continue to dominate the action on Wall Street.

Will the breakout rally reach $0.10? Key technical points: TRX prices surpass the $0.070 mark. The MACD and signal lines exceed the zero line. The 24-hour trading volume of Tron is $1.88 Billion, marking a 64% rise. Past Performance of TRX TRX coin price failed to sustain or surpass the resistance confluence of the 200-day EMA and $0.070. However, the fresh bullish attempt marks a jump of 16% with two bullish candles of 13 and 3 percent each, breaking above all the crucial EMAs and surpassing the $0.070 mark. Source-Tradingview TRX Technical Analysis TRX prices have surpassed their $0.070 mark and display the bullish trend to retest the $0.077 mark. But, the movement has to be able to hold over the 200-day EMA without any significant selling pressure easing to an upper resistance level. Its bullish alignment with the important EMAs is weakened by an engulfing bullish candlestick, resulting in a reversal in the 50- and 100-day EMAs. Thus, the odds of crossovers with bullish sentiment are growing substantially. The RSI slope indicates an upward trend away from the middle line, indicating an increase in the buying pressure. The average line for 14 days shows a bullish trend in action and is over the mid-point line.
