42429552,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzWHh,1534364780,Crypto Bulls Fighting Back? Market Sees Green After Sell-Off,"The cryptocurrency market is flashing green Wednesday following a major downturn, with the total capitalization rising more than $11 billion on a 24-hour basis.  The signs of a turnaround emerge in the wake of a rough patch for the market, during which it hit its lowest point for 2018, as CoinDesk previously reported.  At press time, bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is trading hands at an average of $6,349 – a considerable improvement from yesterday, when the price hit a low of $5,921.65, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Bitcoin hit a high of $6,612.73 during Wednesday's session, BPI data shows.  A turnaround for the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH) is perhaps most notable given the severity of its recent market free fall.  The price of ETH fell from $407 on August 7th to a low of $257 yesterday – a more than 36 percent week-to-week depreciation, according to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index (EPI). Ether's plummet made it next to impossible for many cryptocurrencies to show positive growth in BTC value.  Sellers of the cryptocurrency have since taken a breather, allowing for a more than 12 percent relief rally in price to occur (by press-time prices). The EPI is reporting a price of roughly $289 at time of writing.  The rest of the market immediately followed suit, bringing the total market capitalization at one point back above the $212 billion mark from a more than eight-month low. As of the time of writing, that figure is hovering around $205 billion.  All of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are currently reporting 24-hour gains above 4 percent with the exception of stellar lumens. What's more, ETH, XRP, Monero, and EOS are all posting gains of above 8 percent, with ETH leading the pack for price growth in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

Distributed Systems has already been working on ""decentralized identity solutions,"" Coinbase Identity project manager B Byrne wrote in a blog post. The startup's five-person team will join a unit within Coinbase that is dedicated to developing digital identity solutions.  Blockchain can help individuals maintain complete control over their digital identities, ensuring that their personal information remains safe, Byrne said. He went on to write that this could apply to Social Security Numbers for Americans by adding protections for users, as an example.  Byrne argued:  ""Every time you want to prove who you are with your SSN, you need to give away a copy of it. That copy has exactly the same power as the original, so when there's a data breach with copies of your data it puts your identity at risk. A decentralized identity will let you prove that you own an identity, or that you have a relationship with the Social Security Administration, without making a copy of that identity.""  ""If you stretch your imagination a little further, you can imagine this applying to your photos, social media posts and maybe one day your passport too,"" he added.  That being said, Coinbase appears to be in no hurry to implement digital identity tools. Byrne wrote that the exchange will be ""deliberate about how and where we apply this technology.""

In a lawsuit filed by Los Angeles litigation firm Greenberg Glusker on August 15, Terpin claimed that AT&T's employees have been complicit in a SIM swap fraud. In this type of scam, criminals pose as the owners of their victims' mobile phone numbers, convincing telecom providers to grant them access to their phones.  This allows them to access the victim's accounts at various services, which includes cryptocurrency wallets.  The lawsuit claims that Terpin's account has been hacked twice in seven months, saying ""most troubling, AT&T has not improved its protections even though it knows from numerous incidents that some of its employees actively cooperate with hackers in SIM swap frauds by giving hackers direct access to customer information and by overriding AT&T's security procedures.""  Terpin is seeking $23.8 million in compensatory damages and a further $200 million in punitive damages, according to the suit.  The lawsuit also claims that security issues are nothing new to AT&T, which has been already accused of failing to protect its clients.  ""In recent incidents, law enforcement has even confirmed that AT&T employees profited from working directly with cyber terrorists and thieves in SIM swap frauds,"" the plaintiff contended.  In a statement, Terpin said that ""mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency cannot take place as long as phone company employees are handing over critical unauthorized access to the heart of everyone's digital lives.""

In the firm's latest 10-Q quarterly report, filed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, Riot Blockchain provided more details about the SEC's investigation into the firm's blockchain pivot, noting that the regulator is now looking into a number of the firm's registration statements, as well as its acquisition of a minority stake in Canadian crypto exchange Coinsquare.  Riot first disclosed that it had received document requests from the SEC earlier this year, noting that the regulator was looking into specific statements about its financial health from the past 10 months.  Perhaps more notably, Riot Blockchain stated that the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance and Division of Investment Management had sent several comment letters related to the company's cryptocurrency mining efforts.  The filing stated:  ""The comments raise matters related to, among other things, the unsettled nature of accounting treatment for the Company's cryptocurrency mining and the fair value method selected by the Company (as opposed to intangible accounting methods proposed by some experts) and applicability to the Company of the Investment Company Act of 1940, particularly as relates to the Company's minority interest in goNumerical, Inc. a/k/a Coinsquare.""

The SEC does not intend to act on Riot's registration statements while the investigation is ongoing, this week's filing said.  Ongoing effort  The filing noted that Riot Blockchain is communicating with the SEC's Division of Enforcement, Division of Investment Management and Division of Corporation Finance, and ""intends to cooperate fully with the examination.""  However, the report cautioned that ""management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the overall impact on the company's operations, if any, that would result from an unfavorable final determination of these matters or the investigation of the company.""  Riot also admitted that the SEC was looking into the stocks that the company issued its employees over the last year, though some of these preceded its blockchain pivot. This latest letter was sent to the SEC at the end of July.  SEC investigations aside, Riot reported that it holds nearly $5 million in digital currencies, after seeing a nearly $3 million dollar loss from the ongoing bear market over the last eight months.  Overall it claims to have about $28 million in total assets (and an equivalent amount in liabilities and stockholders' equity) as of June 2018, down from more than $52 million at the end of 2017.

42429540,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzVth,1534345151,Insurance Ratings Bureau Pilots IBM Blockchain for Automatic Reporting,"The American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) is turning to the IBM Blockchain platform to support a new automated insurance reporting tool, the organization announced Wednesday.  Built on IBM Blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric, the open Insurance Data Link (openIDL) system is aimed to simplify regulatory reporting by allowing insurance carriers to store data on a permissioned blockchain for regulators to view on an as-needed basis, a press release says.  The system would essentially streamline the association's current mission to consolidate and report its members' insurance carrier rating data to various state-level Departments of Insurance.  IBM industry academy member Craig Bedell told CoinDesk in an email that AAIS specifically chose IBM Blockchain due to both the open-source nature of Hyperledger Fabric and the enterprise-level platform that the computing giant provides.  At present, AAIS submits either monthly or quarterly reports for each member insurer, depending on state laws. However, the new system, which is currently in a pilot phase, would allow AAIS to deprecate its data reporting role, as carriers would directly store their own data on the blockchain. Regulators would then be able to examine the information at any time, rather than waiting for a report to arrive.  AAIS chief executive Ed Kelly said in the press release that the organization recognizes ""the potential for blockchain to streamline the regulatory reporting process for our member carriers, as well as the opportunity to improve security, accessibility and accuracy of data for regulators.""  ""Hyperledger Fabric's support for private and confidential transactions allows insurers to share data with the network, knowing that they own their data and have control over who has access to it,"" said IBM Global Insurance Industry global manager Sandip Patel.  ""This is an exciting example of how blockchain can bring together an entire ecosystem of users and allow information to be shared in new ways to drive real business results,"" he said.  Although in the pilot phase, Bedell said that the platform is already ""open for business."" Insurance carriers are already being onboarded and the organizations are working to bring on state Departments of Insurance as well.

42429546,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzW3h,1534339851,30% of UK Firms Hit by Crypto Mining Malware in a Month: Survey,"Almost a third of U.K. businesses said they had been hit by cryptocurrency mining malware within the previous month, according to new research.  In a survey published by Citrix, almost 60 percent of responding companies further indicated they had found mining malware on their systems at some time in the past, with the vast majority of those instances (around 80 percent) being in the last six months.  As reported by ZDNet, the research also found that 60 percent of afflicted firms said less than 50 computers had been infected, while a tenth said over 100 machines had likely hosted illicit mining code.  Crypto-mining malware, which has ballooned in popularity among cybercriminals since last year, is hidden software that infects victims' devices, harnessing their processing power to mine cryptocurrencies. Mining code can also be concealed within websites to tap visitors' devices for the same purpose.  Recent reports have indicated that while, last year, ransomware was by far the most popular tool in the online bad actor's box, illicit miners have now taken over and represent around 32 percent of all malware attacks.  Uncovering mining malware is not always easy, either. According to the survey, while network monitoring software discovered the malware in over a third of cases, a similar number were reported by company employees, and 16 percent found the intrusions after devices noticeably slumped in performance.  While the figures emphasize the need for companies to put measures in place to counter the rapidly growing threat of malicious miners, the research suggests that a fifth of firms still have not done so.  Recently, researchers at Kaspersky Labs recently reported that a new form of cryptojacking malware has been spreading across corporate networks in nations including India, Brazil, Colombia and Turkey. The miner ""is capable of stealthily establishing itself in a system and spreading across large corporate networks infecting both workstations and servers,"" Kaspersky said.  Another attack reported this month by security firm Trustwave was found to target MicroTik routers and led to the installation of the Coinhive mining software on over 17,000 devices, largely in Brazil.

The groups are objecting to a proposal aired by South Korea's Ministry of SMEs and Startups on Monday for an amendment to the country's existing venture business law that would, if enacted, exclude cryptocurrency exchanges from the category of SMEs and startups and group them instead with entertainment and gambling businesses.  Citing the ""emergence of social problems like speculation led by cryptocurrency exchanges,"" the move by the ministry aligns with the government's recently stated plan to revise existing laws to strip crypto trading platforms of their tax benefits.  The proposal has now drawn criticism from several blockchain associations, CoinDesk Korea reports, which accuse the government of stifling innovation because the impacts of the change may go beyond just exchanges and affect the blockchain industry as a whole.  Arguing that the amendment goes directly against a push by the country's president, Moon Jae-in, for regulatory innovation, the Korea Blockchain Association, Korea Blockchain Industry Promotion Association and Korea Blockchain Startup Association jointly submitted a letter to the ministry on Tuesday.  ""If this legislation is implemented, domestic companies with the second largest number of blockchain technology patents after IBM will be excluded from classification as venture businesses just because they operate a cryptocurrency exchange,"" the associations argued.  They continued:  ""The investment in research and development by blockchain technology-based companies will be hindered. As such, companies that are not able to receive policy benefits and tax incentives will either fail or move overseas.""  The startup ministry's proposal – open for public feedback until Sept. 4 – is the latest seeking to curb crypto speculation in South Korea, following measures early this year that ordered exchanges to offer services to Korean residents only and to adopt a real-name verification process.

42429555,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzWPh,1534330815,Breakdown Over? Bitcoin Indicators Suggest Price Outlook Is Improving,"Bitcoin looks to have fought off a recent bear market breakdown that saw prices landing just above the yearly low of $5,755.  Bitcoin dropped to $5,858 yesterday at 02:00 UTC, just $103 shy of this year's bottom, according to Bitfinex data.  The suffering has been even worse for much of the altcoin market, some of which have been bleeding out to new yearly lows and seeing drops between 2–15 percent.  Major cryptocurrencies such as ether and XRP dropped by 2.95 and 9.6 percent respectively, before the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization took an about-turn, stabilizing prices and reversing some of the damage from yesterday's chaos.  At time of writing, bitcoin is up 5.16 percent over a 24-hour period, according to CoinMarketCap, and is changing hands at $6,375.  Daily chart  Glaring out on the daily chart, the relative strength index (RSI), used to judge the momentum of a trend, has formed a bullish divergence (Aug. 8–14), whereby prices moved lower, but the RSI moved higher creating a 'divergence' from the current bearish setup.  This is this first positive move from the daily RSI since June 23, when the last divergence foretold of the July pullback from the bear trend, which saw bitcoin climb 40 percent.  Further, the MACD (moving average convergence divergence), also used to judge and interpret a trend, is printing bullish signs with the histogram (purple bars) ticking up in favor of the bulls.  The %K and %D lines (blue and orange) representing health and position of a stock are also itching to cross – a bullish signal that only strengthens when viewed from higher timeframes.  Monthly chart  A monthly low slightly higher than the yearly low of $5,755 reveals the bears are becoming exhausted in their attempt to drive down prices with declining volume apparent since the middle of May.  It is also worth noting that the monthly RSI is at its lowest since October 1, 2015 – a level that may have potential to trigger a buying frenzy, reversing the bearish trend seen since Jan 1.  A drop below recent monthly lows would expose bitcoin to the yearly low of $5,755 as it fails to cement a higher high.  View  A bullish divergence can be seen on the daily RSI – a sign of a potential reversal in the current bear market.  The daily MACD shows promising signs with the histogram ticking up in favor of the bulls and threatening a bullish cross from the %K and %D lines.  Declining bear volume on the monthly chart since the middle of May – keep an eye on the monthly close to see if bears fail to match or top the previous month (July volume), signaling exhaustion.  Monthly RSI is at its lowest levels in two years.  A drop below recent monthly lows would invalidate the bullish perspective.  Disclosure: The author holds USDT at the time of writing.

42429538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzVph,1534320039,"Prime Trust Enters Crypto Custody Race, Will Hold 'Any' Ethereum Token","Prime Trust, a small U.S. financial institution that's played a behind-the-scenes role in several dollar-backed cryptocurrencies, is entering the hotly competitive crypto custody business.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Nevada trust company quietly began offering cold storage for bitcoin in mid-July, and will announce next week that it can also handle custody for ether and any token issued on the ethereum blockchain under the ERC-20 standard.  Such services are in demand among institutional investors, who despite the bear market find crypto's returns alluring, but don't want the bother of protecting the private keys to a digital wallet and/or are required by law to use a qualified custodian. In cold storage, these cryptographic keys, which are like a long password and can be used to drain the money from a wallet, are kept offline, on a hardware device or a piece of paper that's typically locked away in a safe.  However, several big names in financial services are entering this niche as well, with Northern Trust, Goldman Sachs and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, all looking to offer institutional-friendly solutions. Crypto startups like Coinbase, BitGo and Ledger have also been courting this market.  But Prime Trust says that as a startup launched two years ago with all-new technology, it can outmaneuver the big boys. Referring to Northern Trust's testing period and the uncertainty over when Goldman will come out of the bushes with a custody product, Scott Purcell, Prime Trust's CEO, told CoinDesk,  ""They are trillion-dollar Fortune 100 entities, and they are just not going to move that fast.""  Back-office breakthrough  Previously, Prime Trust was known in the crypto space for its back-office role in the so-called stablecoin announced last month by IBM and startup Stronghold. The token, issued on the Stellar blockchain, is backed one-for-one with U.S. dollars that Prime Trust deposits at federally insured banks where it has relationships. Purcell said it's also providing this service to 10 similar projects.  He claimed his company will be the first to offer custody for any ERC-20 tokens, which he described as no small feat.  Purcell said his team solved a ""massive technical problem"" after partner company Polymath hosted a conference in Barbados. There, his engineers were able to spend quality time with some of the authors of the ERC-20 standard, which allows the creation of different tokens representing various kinds of assets on the same blockchain.  ""We had had an engineering breakthrough which now enables us to easily cold-storage any ERC-20 token (along with BTC and ETH, of course),"" said Purcell.  Doing so is ""great in theory, impossible in practice due to various tweaks/nuances in each different token. That's why nobody does this – nobody until now.""

42429551,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLzWDh,1534305748,Bitcoin's Taproot Privacy Tech Is Ready – But There's a Catch,"Bitcoin's privacy is pretty abysmal – after all, what else can you say when anyone in the world can look up any transaction using a web explorer?  But while that's the case today, developers have long been trying to find a fix, or at least improve it over time. One of bitcoin's most famous developers, Greg Maxwell, even aroused quite a bit of interest when he proposed something called Taproot back in January.  Far from providing full bitcoin privacy, Taproot's code offers a way to make all transactions on the blockchain look the same to outsiders. Still, chatter about the proposal has arguably faded as other projects caught the community's eye and bitcoin's price tumbled.  Among those who haven't forgotten about the proposal, though, are bitcoin's developers, as plenty of toiling has been going on behind the scenes. Mathematician Andrew Poelstra pulled together a mathematical security proof in April, while Xapo engineer and Bitcoin Core contributor Anthony Towns put forward an idea for potentially decreasing how much data the technique uses in July.  The continued work showcases why many believe Taproot to be a discovery that provides an ""enormous privacy win"" for bitcoin, as Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille put it in a recent talk. Even better, it's actually not a crazy difficult change to make to bitcoin.  ""Taproot is simple enough it could probably go in straight away,"" Towns told CoinDesk.  The problem, and it's a big one, is it's dependent on tech that doesn't exist yet.  Towns explained:  ""Without Schnorr, Taproot doesn't get you all the way to where you want to go.""  The missing piece  The reason is that Taproot would keep it a secret that any advanced payment is occurring on bitcoin.  More commonly known as smart contracts, there are a variety of complex transactions used in bitcoin, like the kind that enables the off-blockchain protocol lightning for more scalable bitcoin payments and other complex types that are still in development.  But because bitcoin's ledger is public, it's obvious when someone uses one of these transactions.  Taproot puts an end to that by making these transactions look the same as every other ""boring payment,"" as Maxwell put it in the technology's announcement post.  Yet, it can't do this without Schnorr, an upgrade to bitcoin's signature scheme that's been on developer's coding agenda for years. The signature scheme is supposed to be better than bitcoin's current signature scheme ""in basically every way."" And it enables Taproot because it allows signature data to be mashed together into one.  ""Schnorr is necessary for that because without it, we cannot encode multiple keys into a single key,"" Wuille continued in his presentation.  Schnorr's just finally getting off the ground. In fact, it looks like it's going to be bitcoin's next crucial change, with Wuille recently publishing a (very) technical proposal detailing how it might one day be added to bitcoin.  But since Schnorr's been taking years, developers have long been dreaming about what they can build on top once the technology is actually live.  As Towns put it, Schnorr is a ""more exciting"" change, but Taproot is ""the cherry on the top.""  Developers have long been thinking about other enhancements, including those enabled by Schnorr, though it's worth noting that Taproot isn't the only important change being considered. Towns thinks the privacy enhancement might be rolled in with other upgrades.  ""As far as I'm concerned, Taproot, Schnorr, Graftroot is a bundle that all goes together,"" he said, referring to yet another technology Maxwell pioneered.  And it doesn't stop there. Towns guesses that still even other long-anticipated changes will go in at the same time, including MAST, a proposal to boost bitcoin smart contracts, and SIGHASH_NOINPUT, a change that could usher in a more reliable lightning network - the tech bitcoiners hope will help bring bitcoin to the masses.  Even though these technologies have different names and have been proposed at different times, Towns is starting to think of them as one thing.  Deciding what's next  There are so many proposed changes, in fact, developers have been grappling with which should be made first.  Wuille explained in his talk why it's not such an easy decision. There's a small pressure for deploying all these features together at once. Each time they deploy a new ""consensus change,"" it requires a new addressing format.  Since the addresses are different than the old one, this makes it very obvious who's using the new feature - especially since not everyone is going to suddenly adopt the feature the day it launches. It's going to take time, just like past changes have taken time.  That's a small hit to privacy. And doing this more than once would be even worse.  On the other hand, deploying all these changes together would be a mess.  Speaking of other changes, there's also so-called ""signature aggregation,"" the most-hyped application of Schnorr, which could help to scale bitcoin even further. But since it's so complex and needs further review, this is one change that developers think should be added to bitcoin later on.  But Schnorr might not ultimately prove to be a roadblock for Taproot.  In fact, Wuille's been focusing on a proposal to deploy Schnorr and Taproot together, partly because he thinks the privacy addition from Taproot is so exciting, calling it an ""enormous win"" for smart contracts in bitcoin.  On the Schnorr front, Towns mentioned that developers are still working out some kinks, such as a hardware attack vector that Maxwell discovered. Developers are cagey to give code timelines, since upgrades often take longer than expected. And Schnorr is no different.  Earlier on, Poelstra was hopeful it could be deployed by the end of the year, giving bitcoin users a chance to decide whether to adopt it or not. But it all depends on how quickly developers can settle on a path for the change, code it up, and get it reviewed.  As Towns put it:  ""You can't come up with a proposal until you know what to stick in it. The only real delay is finalizing what's going into it.
