42386795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVIwX,1621546873,Crypto Lenders Say Wednesday's Crypto Crash Cleaned Up 'Excessive Leverage',"The COVID-19 pandemic and latest bitcoin bull run have provided a handful of stress tests for cryptocurrency lending firms.      During Wednesday’s market correction lenders were more prepared.      The latest dip didn’t hurt as much as in March 2020, but it did clear out “excess leverage,” said Nexo co-founder and managing partner Antoni Trenchev.      “It was so rapid. Because there was quite a lot of leverage, that’s why the crash was so deep,” Trenchev said. “Now that it’s cleaned up we don't have such excessive leverage in the system right now. That’s why we're seeing this recovery right now.”      Nexo lowered its loan-to-value (LTV) ratios a few weeks ago because of froth in the market, following the lead of Unchained Capital, which reduced its LTVs to 40% in February.      “Everybody had more wealth in bitcoin and no one is in a position to complain about a move like that, and it made this period less stressful,” said Unchained CEO Joe Kelly.      This time, the impact of margin calls on Unchained’s loan book was much less significant, Kelly said.      In late April, crypto lender Celsius tried to help customers prepare for a market crash by warning them on Twitter they should add crypto to their accounts in case of margin calls.    Read more: DeFi Liquidations Up 14-Fold in Broad Crypto Sell-Off    Although Nexo and Genesis said they had made “hundreds of millions” of dollars worth in margin calls, the startups this time had more of a cushion from which to make margin calls and liquidations.      An example of the difference: In March 2020, Nexo had $1 billion in assets under management compared to $15 billion now.      Margin calls affected around 10% of BlockFi’s loan book yesterday while the March 2020 crash resulted in liquidations that affected 25% of the lender’s retail loan book, said CEO Zac Prince.      BlockFi’s “retail platform went down for a short period of time due to the scaling challenges associated with record volumes and activity,” but the “loan book is healthy,” Prince added.      After the crash, bitcoin supply was a bit thinner, but liquidity began to be less tight by the afternoon, said Matthew Ballensweig, lending director at Genesis, a crypto lender owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/20/crypto-lenders-say-wednesdays-crypto-crash-cleaned-up-excessive-leverage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91905dc2bd904720fc2930d37dfac9ffb0f16511-1200x744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386779,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVIdf,1621545055,Venmo's Censorship of Gaza Payments Makes Case for Neutral Platforms,"As Israeli bombardment of Palestinians in the Gaza strip continues, some attempts to send humanitarian relief to Palestinians are being blocked or suspended for review by Venmo, the social payments app owned by PayPal. The politics of the Israel-Palestine conflict are, obviously, complex, and I’m not here today to argue one side or the other. But the incident highlights both the risks of financial censorship inherent in payment tools like Venmo or PayPal and the difficult problem of designing guardrails as digitization makes financial tools farther-reaching.      The Venmo policy came to light through social media reports from users who found the app either refused to process or temporarily halted payments labeled as being for ""Palestine relief"" and related terms. Venmo has acknowledged the blocked payments, pointing to U.S. sanctions laws designed to stop financial support for international terrorism or other bad actors. Business Insider found that the sanctions list maintained by the U.S. government’s Office of Foreign Assets Control includes several specific groups with “Palestinian relief” or similar terms in their names.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist.    The filtering is most obviously concerning because the humanitarian situation in Gaza, an area about the size of Detroit, is so dire. Israeli bombing in Gaza has killed at least 212 people, according to the New York Times, while leveling dozens of buildings and damaging electrical systems and other basic infrastructure. And thanks to decades of sanctions and isolation, both infrastructure and essential services in Gaza were already degraded even before the bombing started.      It should be morally uncontroversial to want to lend humanitarian aid to those suffering such a grim fallout from a conflict much larger than themselves. Anecdotally, there does seem to be a significant surge of financial support for Palestinians amid a larger shift in Western public sentiment.      Yet individuals looking to send relief money to Palestine face obstacles for reasons that highlight broader issues that confront our digitizing and globalizing society.    In the absence of a truly effective means of separating the good from the bad, a neutral financial infrastructure might be preferable to the kind of slapdash controls showcased by Venmo    Many reputable and long-established aid agencies, such as Islamic Relief, Oxfam and Medicins sans Frontiers, are active in Palestine and good candidates for donations if you’re so inclined. But there have also been claims, both in Palestine and elsewhere, of ""relief"" organizations sending donor funds to militant groups instead of medical or food aid. That would explain the presence on the OFAC sanctions a list of groups with names like “Palestinian Relief Society,"" which – at least according to the U.S. government – may not be entirely what they claim.      This sort of deception is not a novel problem, and militant groups have plenty of other financing strategies. But the social media era exacerbates this and other kinds of fundraising fraud. We have more insight than ever into tragedies unfolding far away from us, and the ability, thanks to innovations in financial technology, to do something about them just by clicking a button. You can even send money directly to individuals in some parts of the world from your cellphone using mainstream consumer products. That should be a huge step forward compared to the onerous and error-prone process of writing a check and sending it in the mail to an aid agency.      But these advances have turned out to be a double-edged sword. It can still be difficult or impossible to be sure of the real motivations, or even the identity, of the faraway person you’ve been moved to help. At the risk of being glib, misuse of relief funds is a more nefarious version of someone running a GoFundMe for their nonexistent cancer and then using the money to go on vacation or buy a house.    Read more: In Palestine, Civilians Are Using Bitcoin More Than Hamas    The most baffling part of the current story is that Venmo is using data input from users themselves to sift potentially problematic payments (users can change tags to circumvent the filter), rather than blocking specific recipients. That’s an extremely flawed and exploitable way to try to comply with OFAC sanctions. William Lafi Youmans, a professor at George Washington University, demonstrated that “it’s very easy to get around this prohibition” by simply using different terms when submitting the transaction. That is exactly the sort of porous filtering that genuine bad actors will circumnavigate effortlessly, while donors with truly humanitarian motivations might be more easily turned away.      But no one has yet put forward a clearly good approach to the problem, for Venmo or more generally. Cryptocurrency is often maligned for enabling criminals (and with the surge in ransomware, we may have the first case where this is clearly true). But more broadly, the increasing speed, ease of use and granularity of all kinds of payments channels create new opportunities for abuse as well as for good.      Keeping the good and blocking the bad at a large scale, even in the most superficial sense, requires intense and broad monitoring, including artificial-intelligence (AI) systems like the one apparently in play in the Venmo case, and constant efforts to identify users and track their activity. That, obviously, is a major hit to people’s privacy and, ultimately, to their freedom to do what they want with their own money – especially because, as the Venmo case demonstrates, such systems are prone to overreach and errors.      A deeper problem is who gets to decide what ""good"" and ""bad"" is. The OFAC list, for instance, is an intensely political document used to advance U.S. political interests. Though it has been very effective at punishing some really malicious people, it's hardly the final word on who deserves to be able to participate in the global financial system.      These intractable decisions about monitoring and censorship are inevitable if a payment system is controlled by a government or by corporations, which face liability for failing to comply with government mandates like the OFAC list. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies don’t face that pressure because they are not associated with any legally liable entity. At the same time, it’s technically impossible to block a cryptocurrency payment the way Venmo censored its customers.      Among other benefits, this lack of guardrails makes bitcoin extremely useful for everyday residents of Gaza, who are overwhelmingly unbanked thanks to sanctions. They don't even have a sovereign currency, primarily using the Israeli New Shekel on a day-to-day basis.      But again, the sword is double-edged: Palestinian militants, whose attacks have killed about 20 Israelis in the current fighting, also use cryptocurrency to raise funds. One expert in 2019 estimated that bitcoin mining added $195,000 to Hamas' budget. It’s certainly true that conventional media narratives overemphasize the use of crypto by criminals and terrorists, but that doesn't mean it isn't happening (though it should be noted that Hamas provides social services in Gaza in addition to its military activities).      In the absence of a truly effective means of separating the good from the bad, a neutral financial infrastructure might be preferable to the kind of slapdash controls showcased by Venmo and the politicized designations behind them. Paper currency and other bearer instruments were that infrastructure in the pre-digital age - but only cryptocurrency can play the same role in the future.      Finally, for those interested in supporting emergency food, medical treatment and shelter for Palestinians, this is a good list of reputable non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing relief there.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $40,265 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,709-$42,441 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,804 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 7.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,216-$2,992 (CoinDesk 20)  Topsy-Turvy    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up by 2.1% as of press time Thursday. BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and near the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      Earlier in the day, bitcoin climbed from a low of $35,709 around 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET Wednesday) to as high as $42,441 12 hours later, an 18% gain, based on CoinDesk 20 data. But then bitcoin slid, to $40,265 as of press time.      “At this point, a break above $40,500 could push towards $45,000,” quant fund ExoAlpha advised in an investor note. “But we would remain cautious either to open a short position here at $38,000 or go back in on the long side at this same level.”      The crypto markets were flashing green before news broke that the U.S. Treasury is requesting more stringent tax reporting requirements for businesses transacting in crypto.      “There are definitely still some downside risks left short term, and markets rarely rebound in one single move up,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital. “Political noise, with news of tax rules tightening, is still weighing on a prompt recovery.”      Read More: Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure, Faces Resistance At $45K    Volatility pops, especially for ETH    Crypto’s notorious volatility appears to be on the rise. On Wednesday, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility went over 80% for the first time since March. Ether’s gyrations were even higher: It gained 30 percentage points in one day, to 139%.      Traders may be salivating at generating profits from the fluctuations.      “Crypto is here to stay and the volatility we're currently witnessing is creating an attractive entry point to add to and create new positions,” said Steve Ehrlich, chief executive officer of the cryptocurrency brokerage Voyager Digital.      Crypto over-the-counter trader Alessandro Andreotti doesn’t think ETH maximalists care if the asset behaves wildly.      “I don't think long-term holders in ETH will be too bothered by that, honestly,” Andreotti said.      Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital, said that one “interesting benefit to volatility” is it provides a real-time stress test of cryptocurrency market infrastructure, including of both centralized exchanges and decentralized finance.      “Though these systems are not perfect, they're becoming more robust and able to handle larger volumes and price swings without breaking down,” Mosoff said.    Cost of BTC leverage dips, futures interest falls    In the derivatives market, funding costs for leveraged bitcoin trades have gone down. Some venues even went negative before heading up, and were close to zero as of press time. It’s a sign of a lack of interest in using the crypto equivalent of margin to make trades.      “A lot of leveraged length has been stopped out and the market is much cleaner and should build a base for recovery,” said Tellurian’s Bonnefous.      One additional sign of bear mode is in the futures market: Bitcoin open interest has dropped by $5 billion from Tuesday to Wednesday. It’s a sign institutional interest may be waning. At least for now.      “Although it's not entirely clear where crypto is headed for the short- to mid-term, in my opinion we are definitely not out of the woods for another dump,” said trader Andreotti.    Ether options traders pile into calls at $5K    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $2,804 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), climbing 7.5% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      Ether popped Thursday but (like bitcoin) varied wildly in the past 24 hours, going from a low of $2,216 around 01:00 UTC (9 p.m. ET Wednesday) to as high as $2,992 a dozen hours later, a 36% jump according to CoinDesk 20 data. ETH then slid and settled at $2,804 as of press time.      In the ether options market, traders appear mega-bullish on the asset hitting $5,000. According to data aggregator Skew, over 90,000 ETH in open interest is in calls with a $5,000 strike price. In options, a call is the right but not obligation to buy an asset before a specified date, known as expiration.      Options traders are likely loving ether’s volatility, saidMarc Fleury, partner at investment firm Two Prime.      “We are witnessing explosive moves up and we should expect violent corrections as well,” said Fleury. “Increasing liquidity will increase short-term volatility and decrease long-term volatility, particularly in the crypto derivatives space. At least, that is what monetary theory predicts.”      Quant firm ExoAlpha noted in its investor letter Thursday that the previous bull cycle had massive gyrations. That might explain the ETH calls betting on a record price level. ETH’s current zenith is $4,382, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “On a longer-term perspective, the bull trend remains intact for this cycle,” ExoAlpha noted. “In 2017, the bull run had been hit by two corrections of -40% and the market quickly recovered to new heights.”      Read More: Diddy, Haddish, Durant Investors in Crypto-Powered Banking App Eco    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all green Thursday.

42386788,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVIoz,1621544014,Beijing's Crypto Crackdown Is Not New but Don't Dismiss It,"China's crypto warning on Tuesday may look similar to previous notices. However, it conveys a pointed message to commercial banks and payment companies that have been friendly to crypto-related businesses.      The National Internet Finance Association of China, the China Banking Association and the Payment and Clearing Association of China published a notice saying member financial institutions should not provide services to crypto-related transactions or investment funds. The news appeared to help spark a crypto sell-off on Wednesday, when the overall crypto market lost nearly $1 trillion before it began recovering on Thursday.      “Although yesterday’s notice looks largely the same as before, it is a more explicit warning specifically for Chinese banks and payment processors,” said Tao Luo, former Beijing Fengtai district attorney and chief consultant at Global Blockchain Compliance Union.      China’s central bank officially barred financial and payment institutions from providing any services related to all cryptocurrencies as early as 2017. But some major crypto trading platforms are still able to process transactions through personal bank accounts due to certain banks’ lax compliance requirements, Luo said.      The warning could lead Chinese financial institutions to implement more rigorous compliance requirements and further limit basic banking services they can offer to crypto traders, at least in the short term, according to Luo.      The recent notice appears to be targeted more at the banks by spelling out what specific banking services are prohibited. Some services in the recent notice, such as purchasing crypto with fiat currencies and setting up crypto funds, were not included in the 2017 ban prohibiting financial institutions from transacting, clearing, settling and insuring all cryptocurrencies as well as initial coin offerings.      The earliest crypto-related ban in China dates back to 2013, which barred financial institutions from offering services related to bitcoin.      “The regulation seems to have tightened,” said a Beijing-based executive from a U.S. crypto investment firm that has a few multi-million dollar crypto funds in China. “The number of available service providers has dropped.” The executive sought anonymity due to the sensitivity of OTC trading activities in China, some of which are still illegal in the country.    The messenger    “Sometimes who sends the message is almost as important as the message itself,” Luo said. The three associations issuing the warning are among the most important watchdogs besides China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), which oversees China’s banking and online payment services.      The members of the three associations that issued the notice range from major state-owned commercial banks to payment giants including AliPay and WeChat Pay.      “That fact that the notice comes from these ‘semi-official’ associations indicates the regulators might just want to give the banks a wake-up call,” said Aries Wang, partner of South Korea-based crypto venture capital firm BlockWater Capital. “There will be more serious consequences if it is from the central bank.”      The bans in 2013 and 2017 were issued by the People’s Bank of China along with other government agencies including China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.      The Chinese financial regulators have taken a similar approach in limiting investment in other asset classes such as real estate and U.S. stocks, Luo said.      Although the Chinese banking system can not officially offer any services related to crypto, sometimes these banks have offered services without knowing they were dealing with crypto-related businesses, said Wang.      Certain Chinese banks would allow crypto trading firms to use personal bank accounts to deposit cash for their trading businesses as long as the firms are not involved in money laundering, while other banks would not even know they are dealing with crypto-related businesses, he added.      Many of the crypto trading firms have over-the-counter trading (OTC) desks, which is a major marketplace for Chinese traders to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.    OTC trading in China    OTC trading services is one of the two major ways for Chinese investors to enter the crypto market. Investors could set up an account on a foreign exchange, such as Coinbase, where they can buy crypto with fiat currencies or cash in on their crypto holdings. However, many Chinese investors are not able to go abroad and open such accounts due to the exchanges’ compliance requirements. That leaves OTC trading as the more common trading platform for Chinese traders.      “If the Chinese regulators completely close bank accounts associated with crypto businesses, the impact on trading, such as the OTC desks, in the country could be devastating,” Wang said, adding it is highly unlikely regulators would be able to ban all such transactions in practice.      The intensifying crackdown on crypto trading could be, in part, attributed to OTC trading desks’ potential involvement in money laundering.      The notice comes amid China’s nationwide crackdown on an increase in money laundering activities in the banking system due to the rise of telecom fraud. Some fraudsters tend to use crypto OTC trading desks because tens of thousands of their bank accounts have been closed by the Chinese police. Prominent Chinese OTC trader Dong Zho has been in police custody since last year for his involvement in money laundering.      Another reason prompting the crackdown notice could be the overheated crypto market.      The crackdown notice calls the crypto market’s extreme volatility a substantial threat to China’s financial stability and its citizens’ assets. “As virtual currencies see more drastic price swings, we have also seen more frequent trading and marketing activities,” the notice said.      A number of memecoins have been issued in China following the success of dogecoin copycat SHIB in the U.S. There are more than 60 new coins that derive from DOGE on the market. Unlike decentralized finance (DeFi), which could be complicated for the average crypto investor to participate in, memecoins can be easily traded on small exchanges, Wang said.    Rebound    However, the Chinese crypto market is likely to survive this round of crackdowns in the long run.      “Traders would probably experience short-term headwinds,” Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at crypto hedge fund Trade Terminal, said. “But they have seen multiple rounds of crackdowns before and they can wait out the cycle.”      In China, crypto trading remains in a murky legal area. The regulators tend to carry out crackdowns when the Chinese crypto market is overheated or serious compliance issues emerge.      The Chinese crypto community has seen two large-scale crackdowns over the last decade. China’s central bank banned financial institutions from offering services related to bitcoin in 2013 and expanded the ban to all cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings in 2017. Yet, Chinese crypto trading persists.      “It's just about controlling the narrative, not about controlling bitcoin,” Leonhard Weese, co-founder of the Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong, said. “Bank accounts will be shut, new accounts will be opened and everyone is on notice not to get too big.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/20/beijings-crypto-crackdown-is-not-new-but-dont-dismiss-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f73b5183752ad71cb54a9c0cc4ab0e14d581d97d-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386797,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVIz3,1621539891,Som Seif: 'Rational' for SEC to Approve Crypto ETFs,"Som Seif was an investment banker with RBC Capital Markets before he founded Claymore Investments, a provider of exchange-traded funds, unit investment trusts and other services, which he sold to BlackRock in 2012. His new company, Purpose Investments, has launched ETFs for bitcoin and ether, attracting more than $12 billion to its bitcoin ETF at the time of writing.    Consensus 2021: Som Seif will appear at this year’s CoinDesk’s Consensus conference on May 25, in the “Bitcoin for Advisers” Exploration. Register here.    U.S. regulators haven't approved ETFs for digital assets, much to the annoyance of many investors and crypto investment firms, who believe such vehicles are crucial for more mainstream acceptance of the industry. CoinDesk caught up with Seif ahead of his appearance at Consensus next week. The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.      CoinDesk: Why do we need a bitcoin ETF as opposed to just investing in bitcoin?      This is an important asset class that’s getting more and more demand by all types of investors. But the reality is that, for most investors, it’s a very clunky asset to own. Prior to the launch of the ETFs in bitcoin and ether, investors would have to open up an exchange account or a separate custody account and then execute transactions using a nontraditional brokerage or their own wallets. It’s like how it was with gold in the '90s and early 2000s, before the gold ETFs came.      With ETFs, the assets are available to every investor in the same way that they would normally invest in any other security, in their traditional accounts in a traditional company and tradable like a normal security. For an asset like bitcoin, which is very much supply and demand driven, it will open up the ability to capture much greater demand for the assets in time. It’s like what we saw with gold once the original gold ETFs were launched in 2003 and 2004. The demand function of gold grew exponentially over the next 20 years, and today it's a core part of many people's portfolios.    My guess is that the SEC will approve it and it will be very rational for them to do so and very irrational for them at this stage not to    CoinDesk: How much of a demand increase might we see because of ETFs for bitcoin and ether?      Digital assets are a young area. It's only 11 or 12 years old in terms of kind of knowledge and awareness. For most people, bitcoin has only been growing for the last five years. So it’s got a long way to grow. ETFs give people an easy and secure way to access demand, and it makes people more likely to purchase. People were interested in bitcoin and ether previously, but exchanges and custody create friction.      In the institutional world, unless you were going to go through the process of opening up a crypto custody account, most of them didn’t touch this. With normal securities, you understand the structure of things, but digital assets are quite different. You don’t have the back-end settlement structures and the traditional custodians. Because it’s a bearer asset, the security around the asset is an important thing, and it’s very different from securing a stock.    Read more: Canada Approves Three Ethereum ETFs in One Day    With ETFs, all of that goes away because the investment is in a traditional form, and you can have confidence in that structure in the same way as you would have confidence when you're buying the S&P 500, the Nasdaq or whatever. You can hold it in your traditional custody accounts and you can put a traditional ownership and governance structure around that.      CoinDesk: Regulators in the U.S. haven't approved ETFs for digital assets. Why do you think Canadian regulators have been amenable to these products?      Canadian regulators historically have shown a willingness to have a conversation and to be open-minded about innovation. There’s a long history of Canada being first in the investment world and with ETFs.      Back in 2017 and 2018, both sets of regulators made the decision not to approve the products, and there were two reasons. One was a question of whether this is a legitimate asset and do we want people to have access to it? There are questions around brokerage, trading and whether there is enough liquidity.      The second was, is the infrastructure there to even enable a product like this so there is sufficient liquidity? Is there sufficient market-making capability to ensure efficiency of price? Are there institutional-quality custody solutions from the security and structural perspective? Back then, both regulators made the decision that the market didn’t have enough structure for both of those things.      The Canadian regulators made a decision that people are going to want to access this one way or another. We had a couple of examples of unregulated exchanges that ended up being fraudulent, like QuadrigaX. And regulators said we’d much rather give access via a regulated security structure versus an unregulated security structure.    [Canadian] regulators said we’d much rather give access via a regulated security structure versus an unregulated security structure.    And I think the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has to ask the same question. Companies like Coinbase and Grayscale are giving investors access to this market. That makes it harder to argue that we shouldn’t give people access to a more efficient structure. The trading fees on Coinbase are ludicrous. You can see in their profits – they are making a lot of money. And my guess is that the SEC will approve it, and it will be very rational for them to do so and very irrational for them at this stage not to.      What are your long-term outlooks on bitcoin and ethereum as assets?      They are very different assets, and they play very different roles. I’ve been very personally biased towards ethereum in the last few years.      My view on bitcoin is it's purely a supply and demand store of value. We know that supply is limited by a specific structure of inflation every year, we know the inflationary rate of bitcoin. I'm a big believer that over the next number of years, bitcoin will be much higher in price, but it’s hard to argue where it’s going to be in the next six or 12 months.      On ether, it has a very different utility. It’s not just about supply and demand. It’s about growth and applications. Bitcoin is ubiquitous and people don’t think of crypto without thinking about bitcoin. With ether, awareness is only starting to grow. As NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and DeFi (decentralized finance) continue to grow, we’ll see more and more people come in, and I think we’ll see significant upside in the next 12 months, perhaps up to $10,000. Over time, I think ether will be the more valuable platform, but it could take a number of years.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/20/som-seif-rational-for-sec-to-approve-crypto-etfs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d28368eee26632e8bf6068cb481c6ca85d3965c-1400x877.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at one point surged as high as $43,000, regaining almost all of the ground lost during Wednesday's 14% price plunge, which was the biggest single-day decline in 14 months.      Shortly after 16:00 coordinated universal time (12 p.m. ET), bitcoin dropped about 5%. That move roughly coincided with the publication of a U.S. Treasury report calling for businesses that receive transfers of more than $10,000 in cryptocurrencies to report them to the Internal Revenue Service.      “There are definitely still some downside risks left short term, and markets rarely rebound in one single move up,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital. “Political noise, with news of tax rules tightening, is still weighing on a prompt recovery.”    Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the digital-asset firm Equos, wrote in his daily newsletter that a move back above $42,800 ""will FOMO those on the sidelines back into BTC.""  ""Resistance at $44,000 will be the first blocker on thoughts of bitcoin returning to trade with a $50,000 handle,"" according to Blom. ""Should we reach $38,800, and should bulls fail to protect it, then $33,800 awaits. Any move down will likely see more drama as fear once again returns to the market.""  ""Short-term price movements are difficult to predict, but thus far we are encouraged by the resiliency in price,"" Greg Cipolaro, head of research for the bitcoin-focused asset manager NYDIG, wrote Thursday in an email. ""Only in hindsight will we know for certain whether the recent events were a mid-cycle correction or part of a larger cyclical risk-off move.""    Bitcoin's rebound came as U.S. stocks rallied on positive economic news, while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds declined by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.63%.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Daniel Cawrey",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/20/bitcoin-trades-at-40k-as-rebound-rally-stalls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fa8566242ca918bffe2224a6fb9f8e668140df6-752x353.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386796,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVIxn,1621531234,Flux Protocol Raises $10.3M Seed Round to Build DeFi Infrastructure on NEAR,"Some of crypto’s leading venture capitalists are placing a $10.3 million bet on decentralized finance (DeFi) burgeoning on the NEAR blockchain, according to an announcement Thursday.      The seed funding round in DeFi infrastructure firm Flux Protocol, which is built on the NEAR blockchain, was led by Distributed Global and included Coinbase Ventures, CoinFund, Uncorrelated Ventures, Figment Capital and others.      The relatively weighty early round highlights how VCs are looking for fresh pastures after DeFi on Ethereum has swelled to a $67 billion concern and as high transaction fees have priced out small investors, pushing them to Binance Smart Chain and other networks. Backers of the speedy NEAR blockchain hope the network can bring DeFi to the mainstream.      Getting the data right and trusting the source of the data are critical in the high-stakes world of open finance, especially during a week marked by sell-off-induced liquidations.      “You can't have $100 million liquidations because an oracle delivered the wrong data,” Flux CEO Peter Mitchell said in an interview. In crypto, oracles are third parties that provide exteranal information to blockchain-based smart contracts.      Mitchell said the credibility of many oracle DeFi projects depends on their reputation.      Flux’s model adds some economic guarantees to the mix. Validators stake tokens as a form of collateral. If their resolution data is accurate, the tokens stay put. But inaccurate reporting could lead to arbitration, and validators found in the wrong could see their tokens slashed, Mitchell said.      ""We are creating a more secure foundational layer to allow DeFi to really scale to the mainstream,” he said.      The validators receive fees for providing accurate data to Flux, he said.

42386787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVInj,1621529582,Dutch Court Rules Bitonic No Longer Requires Crypto Wallet Verification,"A Dutch court has ruled in favor of Bitonic, a crypto exchange led by Daan Kleiman, stating it no longer needs to fulfill crypto wallet-verification requirements implemented by the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the central bank of the Netherlands.    In an announcement Thursday, Bitonic said it had received a decision from the court regarding a case against the DNB about the objection made in regard to crypto wallet-verification requirements.  DNB told crypto companies via a webinar on Sept. 21 about an additional technical requirement for verifying crypto addresses under the Sanctions Act. No registration would be made if the strict DNB requirement was not met.  Bitonic, which also heads the crypto lobbying group VBNL, took the case to court earlier this year and said Dutch regulators have formally acknowledged its view that the requirement was “unlawful” and should never have been made during registration.  The Rotterdam District Court has ruled in favor of Bitonic in a case against the DNB. The court acknowledged Bitonic's objections and doubts about the registration procedure and the legality of the wallet-verification requirement set up by the central bank.  The judge acknowledged that the wallet-verification requirement was part of the registration process and that Bitonic had every right to object to it, the exchange said.  “DNB admits that Bitonic was right. It is the outcome of an order by the court that the Dutch supervisor should motivate its registration decision better. In essence, DNB chose to revoke the requirement as laid out in the registration decision,” Bitonic said.  DNB has now revoked the registration requirement and said it will remove the wallet-verification measures as soon as possible.  “We will no longer ask for all transactions and ask [for] a copy of your wallet screenshot. We will further investigate which other simplifications are possible,” Bitonic said.

In March, Diddy bet on Eco with hopes to do the same.      The rapper and a bevy of celebrities, athletes and entertainers joined Eco’s $26 million round earlier this year, according to Eco CEO Andy Bromberg. Among them: comedian Tiffany Haddish, National Football League players Larry Fitzgerald and Kelvin Beachum Jr., musician Justin “3LAU” Blau and soccer player Keisuke Honda.      Speaking to the current rush of celebrity interest in the crypto space, the respective VC firms of National Basketball Association stars Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony also participated. The full roster of backers has not been previously announced.      “We are excited to help transform banking to make it more accessible for all,” Anthony said in a statement.      Eco is not a pure-play crypto name like Coinbase. Fashioning itself as a banking alternative, the start-up “rewards” users with a cash-back system similar to credit card points. It generates returns by lending users’ deposits out in the stablecoin USDC, but the crypto backend is almost completely absent from its messaging.

The company actually fits in with some of its celebrities’ apparent investment theses. Larry Fitgerald, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, has scattered bets across early-stage fintechs since 2019, but never in ones with crypto exposure.

As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $42,500. That's roughly where it started on Wednesday, just before a 14% sell-off over the ensuing 24 hours – the biggest single-day decline since March 2020. Prices nearly fell below $30,000 at one point.      Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was also on the mend Thursday, up 20% to about $2,931 at press time. The price tumbled 28% over the course of Wednesday, briefly dipping below $2,000.      Other cryptocurrencies joined in the rebound. All of the free-floating cryptocurrencies in the CoinDesk 20 were up over the past 24 hours, with cardano (ADA) jumping some 69% to $1.92. Bitcoin cash (BCH) surged 57% to $845.

Some $131.1 billion in bitcoin changed hands, nearly $5 billion more than Tuesday's figure and nearly double the dollar volume of March 12, 2020, the ""Black Thursday"" of crypto.      However, it should be noted that bitcoin was trading at one-fifth its current price at that point. Thus, when measured on a bitcoin volume basis, March 2020’s sell-off was far worse.

42386757,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVFjl,1621514973,What Coinbase’s Media Play Means for Crypto,"In case crypto media wasn’t fraught enough, Coinbase is now apparently launching a media arm.      The U.S.-based exchange is looking for a top editor, who would report to the company’s marketing department, Axios reported Tuesday. Coinbase said in an email that it has nothing to share at this time, but a job posting for a content director suggests that the exchange is branching out into media.    Emily Parker is CoinDesk's managing director and Global Macro editor    This may just be the beginning. Exchanges like Kraken already have content operations, and the top-tier venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a Coinbase investor) is also getting into the media game. As more new investors rush into the market, there will be greater demand for crypto content. Exchanges can use media arms to raise brand awareness, attract users and just spark wider interest in crypto, which could ultimately be good for business.      But at what cost to the crypto industry?      Okay, let’s get a few things out of the way. Yes, I am a managing director at CoinDesk, which in theory would be competing with Coinbase’s new media arm. And, yes, CoinDesk is owned by Digital Currency Group, or DCG, a for-profit company with deep-pocket investments throughout the industry. CoinDesk maintains a policy of editorial independence. Still, the perception of interference creates its fair share of drama, such as when DCG’s Barry Silbert announced that DCG was shorting dogecoin and people wondered if that would shape CoinDesk’s dogecoin coverage. For what it’s worth, Coinbase is also a DCG portfolio company, and this piece isn’t exactly advancing either company's interests. But see what I mean about crypto media being fraught?    Read more: Emily Parker: Why We Should Take Dogecoin Seriously    Ultimately, you’ll just have to believe me when I say that I have no agenda other than to express my personal opinion, based on experience and observation. Exchanges getting into media isn’t necessarily bad for the industry, but there will be big challenges in striking the right balance. Here are just a few.      Newcomers need objective information.      Crypto has entered the mainstream. It’s on ""Saturday Night Live."" It’s on ""Ellen."" It’s on Elon Musk’s Twitter feed, basically all of the time. Paris Hilton makes non-fungible tokens, and Tom Brady is launching an NFT company. Slim Jim, social media’s favorite meat stick, has a crypto strategy.      What this means is that we are seeing an influx of new investors into the market, and these new investors need reliable information, or even warning labels. Buying your first crypto? Here’s what to watch out for. This is not to insult the intelligence of newer investors, it’s simply to say that some knowledge comes with time. More seasoned crypto hands may have a better sense of who’s who or how to distinguish promising projects from duds. They have seen previous boom-and-bust cycles, and they may have even been burned by scams.      Take dogecoin, a wildly popular coin with no shortage of risks. Will exchanges’ media operations be incentivized to highlight the flaws of specific tokens, particularly when the platforms may be listing those tokens themselves?      Crypto Twitter doesn’t like bad news.      The crypto world generally does not like “negative” stories, at least in my observation. If you publish a story about a problem with a specific project, a government crackdown or bitcoin being used for illicit purposes, you’re likely to be accused of “FUD,” or of being on a secret mission to destroy a particular token.      And it’s not just crypto Twitter. More sober stories sometimes just don’t perform as well overall as “Bitcoin to the moon” articles. It makes sense: Crypto is strikingly sentiment-driven. No one knows for sure what moves the market, but there is the perception that a single article, or even a tweet, could have a significant impact on price.    Read more: Musk Learns the Hard Way: Crypto Doesn’t Need a Savior    But there is also something deeper at play. For a long time, crypto was an underdog industry, scoffed at by traditional investors and widely associated with crime. As such, some of the longer-term players in the crypto industry are quick to go on the defensive when they feel they are being maligned by journalists. Many still believe that crypto is totally misunderstood by the mainstream media and is badly reported by the industry press.      The bottom line is that less-than-effusive stories tend to attract an unpleasant mix of social media rancor and lower traffic. Often the only reason to publish these stories is simply out of a commitment to, well, journalism. And journalism means sometimes publishing things that people don’t like. Will crypto exchanges’ content creators share this commitment? Maybe. But they may find it a lot easier to just give readers what they want.      The line between content and marketing will get blurrier.      So if exchanges have an agenda, what’s the big deal? People aren’t stupid. They should be able to distinguish between marketing and actual news.      The problem is that as more exchanges enter the media world, competition for eyes will get fiercer. And people won’t want to read ads; they will look for engaging content. Exchanges ultimately want to attract new users. To do that, they have to get people’s attention, which will require increasingly sophisticated content that doesn’t resemble marketing at all. Imagine, for example, a piece that reads like an objective article but features examples that have been cherry-picked to create a positive impression of a particular crypto project. These incentives may not be immediately obvious to the reader, many of whom will not be that skeptical to begin with. Maybe this trend would lead readers to seek out more independent sources of information, but it could also end up eroding trust in the media as a whole.    Read more: A16z to Launch $1B Crypto Venture Fund    The one possible silver lining is that these exchanges will not be driven by the same pressures as typical media outlets. To put it more bluntly, they have cash to burn, at least while this bull market lasts. They will be able to attract top talent. They won’t necessarily have to worry about advertisers or traffic numbers because their media arms could be subsidized by other parts of their business. In theory at least, that could lead to more editorial freedom. One positive outcome would be patronage for more of the technical deep dives and investigative reporting that this community needs.      How that will play out in reality remains to be seen. The danger is a surge of “another sunny day in crypto” stories, which are not ideal for an industry that is already rife with risk.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/20/what-coinbases-media-play-means-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37b86997836d40496cc7ab6947033b0c5e0d904-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386775,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBVG59,1621514700,"Introducing $DESK, CoinDesk’s New Rewards Program","Like many media outlets in the Web 2.0 era, we at CoinDesk are exploring new ways to engage our audience directly, without the intermediation of the giant internet platforms that dominate the digital economy.      So begins the journey of $DESK in beta at this year’s Consensus by CoinDesk conference, where those attending can earn special reward tokens and redeem them for items and experiences.      (You can read about the mechanics of $DESK at its application site. Please note that only Consensus attendees earmarked to receive rewards will initially be eligible to claim tokens. This article is more about the “why” than the “how.”)      This beta test of $DESK (long facetiously rumored to be in the works) is narrowly focused on the event environment. With the help of our partners at Unifty.io and Torus, we’re endeavoring to foster a carnival-like experience with two goals in mind: 1) to get attendees’ hands on crypto, many for the first time, and 2) to reward them for participating in the event’s various offerings, enhancing the overall sense of audience engagement.      With the various incentives we’ve created, we hope to glean valuable information from this closed-loop, beta-test environment, discovering what things and experiences people value at an event like Consensus while also figuring out what they’re willing to do to get their hands on them.      Read more: $DESK: Your Questions Answered    How does the $DESK economy work?    Well, attendees earn $DESK by completing various tasks at Consensus such as buying a ticket, watching sessions or attending networking functions. Then, on the spending side – following a model that, let’s face it, is not unlike that of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants – attendees can redeem their hard-earned $DESK for goodies in our NFT marketplace.      These include sponsor swag, tokenized versions of CoinDesk articles covering seminal moments in crypto history, experiences with speakers and even two large Papa John’s pepperoni pizzas delivered straight to your home (a nod to another important moment in crypto history).    Why $DESK?    If you’ve attended Consensus in previous years, you may recall how we distributed digital wallets to attendees pre-loaded with NFT sponsor swag. While many people warmed to the concept, we found that engagement was limited.      We hypothesize there were two reasons for this.      The first is that swag distribution was too random. Giveaways weren’t aligned with attendees’ interests. (I remember giddily opening my first wallet to find a tokenized edition of a 35-page money transmission licensing memo from some law firm. With all due respect to our lawyer friends out there, this was not exactly something I was excited to read.)      $DESK seeks to rectify this by pooling all swag into a marketplace with varying prices and degrees of scarcity, and then letting attendees purchase the items they want with the rewards they earn.      The second reason for limited engagement with past Consensus wallets was the transaction was unidirectional. You turned up, you got a wallet with swag. You didn’t have to do anything. There was no way to earn more goodies. There was no gamification, no competition.      Read more: What is the ERC-20 Ethereum Token Standard?      Now, in using $DESK to incentivize people to partake of the many event offerings and to engage directly with each other in fun, interactive ways, we hope to enhance the overall experience, bolstering the event’s appeal as a vibrant, participatory affair. In some respects we see $DESK as a tool for building a Consensus community.      Some of the drivers behind the project stem from necessity. After the coronavirus pandemic forced us to launch Consensus: Distributed last year as our first fully virtual, full-scale event, we realized we had to be inventive if we were to make the experience more interesting and engaging for our audience, speakers and sponsors. How could we get people to do things?      We realized that with any virtual experience, including Consensus, you’re not fully there. It’s easy to get distracted when you’re watching a Zoom webinar. And when the tickets are either free or priced at levels well below those of in-person events, the motivation to stick it out through all the sessions is low. If you’re not there among the masses, you don’t feel as compelled to get out and meet people or to build your knowledge.      We have an incredibly robust agenda this year with nuanced content, but we know that as organizers we are competing for your attention with everything else that’s happening on the internet at that time. Now, with $DESK, we can offer you a little something extra in return for that valuable attention.    Easy on-ramp    We’ve designed $DESK to be an easy, safe and fun way for people to use crypto. Many Consensus attendees are new to the industry and have never created a wallet or bought or sold anything in crypto. $DESK offers a risk-free, easy way to do so, without the real-life danger of forever losing your keys or wallet. You don’t even have to worry about the on-chain gas fees typically required to execute smart contracts (all transactions will be conducted cost-free on Rinkeby, an Ethereum testnet, or proving ground for software experiments).      The hardest part about crypto is going from 0 to 1 - from not owning any to owning some. So we’ve tried to make that first step as easy as possible. If this effort helps new people come on board, to create a wallet or to buy a non-fungible token for the first time, that will be a huge win.      We also wanted to borrow from one of the crypto industry’s real innovations: the airdrop, deploying a loyalty-driver model such as the one Uniswap distributed to its users in September 2020. In a similar vein, we’re distributing $DESK to all previous Consensus attendees as a way of saying thank you.      In all, $DESK is about being on-brand with what the industry is doing and about innovating our core product. We think we can be an industry leader, making virtual events more interesting for attendees. As the first, real, event-focused reward token, $DESK has the potential, we believe, to overhaul a business model that has been pretty static for years. Gamifying the experience with cryptocurrency rewards could fundamentally transform how the events business operates.      Eventually, we believe every event will have something like this. We want to be the first to do it.    After Consensus    What happens to $DESK after the conference? We’re still figuring that out, but we have some big ideas on how to incorporate the token across our entire media ecosystem. Members of the CoinDesk community could perhaps earn $DESK via different interactions with the platform, such as reading articles (as our friends at Decrypt have done), completing educational courses, signing up for newsletters or watching videos.      We’ll roll out the $DESK roadmap in the coming weeks and months. We’re excited to see how this experiment proceeds.      Can $DESK be a tool to reinvent both events and media? Can we use it to take on the Web 2.0 titans, to forge a new Web 3.0 business model based on direct publisher-to-audience engagement and community building? We’ll see. The answer to those questions will, in part, be determined by how much readers like you engage with the product at Consensus 2021.

Here’s everything you need to know and how to get involved.  More people own cryptocurrency than ever before. For bitcoin alone, wallet addresses are up 27% since the start of the year, according to Glassnode. The obvious catalyst for this rise in market participants is the current bull market, which continues to draw worldwide attention and push digital asset prices to new heights.  The surge of interest in digital assets has also introduced CoinDesk to a vast new audience, with the site’s unique visitors for 2021 up 633% compared to the first three months of last year.  Read more: Introducing $DESK, CoinDesk’s New Rewards Program  The financial world is evolving fast, and CoinDesk is eager to keep pace with this change. That’s why we’re excited to launch $DESK as an integral part of this modernization.  What is $DESK?  $DESK is a CoinDesk-issued token created in collaboration with Unifty. It’s hosted on Rinkeby, an Ethereum-based testnet for trialing new software.  As an ERC-20 token, $DESK is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. That means it will be compatible with Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, including wallets and decentralized applications, once the token is fully live.  $DESK is launching in beta at Consensus 2021. During this phase, the token will provide rewards for conference attendees as they attend and participate in various events. All transactions are completely gas-free – meaning they won’t have a service fee (in $DESK or otherwise) – to make using $DESK as easy as clicking a button.  Read more: What is the ERC-20 Ethereum Token Standard?  The Torus Wallet, a frictionless digital asset wallet provider, will support the storage and redemption of $DESK during the beta launch. This is a non-custodial service, meaning $DESK holders will have complete control over their own tokens once they receive or earn them.  CoinDesk created $DESK as a tool to help build community, not as a monetary asset. Unlike traditional securities or mainstream cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, $DESK is not intended to have any monetary value, and it cannot be traded on a secondary market for other digital assets or exchanged for fiat currency.  How do I get $DESK?  Receiving $DESK couldn’t be easier. Simply follow these two steps before the event and start accruing tokens:  Head over to coindesk.com/desk (the Torus wallet is already built into the platform, so there’s no need to download anything).  Enter the unique code emailed to you from CoinDesk to connect to Torus. For Gmail users, please check your ""Promotions"" folder if you cannot find the email doesn't in your inbox.  Note: $DESK is currently open to Consensus 2020 and 2021 attendees. If you have trouble, contact desk@coindesk.com.  You can earn $DESK tokens by completing a variety of tasks during Consensus 2021 and through engagement with the CoinDesk platform, including:  Pre-Consensus sign-up  Registering attendance to Consensus 2021  Participation in Unlocked 101 (the educational sessions held prior to Consensus)  Attending virtual sessions  Virtual world networking  For attendees of last year’s Consensus event, CoinDesk sent a claim code for 500 $DESK on May 18 to the email you used to register, in appreciation of your continued support.  What can I redeem $DESK for?  $DESK holders will be able to take part in live auctions to bid for crypto-focused experiences as well as redeem tokens for a range of exclusive Consensus NFTs (see below).  $DESK Rewards  Virtual trading card NFTs  Physical CoinDesk swag  Virtual meetings with VIPs  Sponsor swag  First access to new products from partners  Other FAQs  How many tokens will be minted?  For the beta, CoinDesk will control the issuance of new $DESK tokens. There is no fixed amount, so $DESK should not be held in anticipation of scarcity.  Will my $DESK balance disappear after Consensus 2021 ends?  No. $DESK tokens are yours to hold, spend or send after Consensus 2021. CoinDesk will host more experiences to engage with our events and digital platform in the future.  What are the future plans for $DESK?  We’re going to walk before we run. This is the first event we’re doing with $DESK, and we’re primarily focused on giving conference attendees the best experience possible. But we’re excited about the possibilities of $DESK beyond Consensus. Stay tuned!  Will $DESK ever have a monetary value?  Like airplane miles, $DESK will always be worth a fixed amount.  If I don’t attend Consensus 2021, will I still be able to earn $DESK?  Yes. If you attended Consensus 2020, you’ll get a link to log into your wallet and claim a small amount of $DESK to get started. The real perks, however, are inside Consensus 2021.  Can I stake my tokens?  No. There is no current mechanism to stake $DESK.

Chainlink will be integrated into the Hedera Token Service and will be Hedera’s preferred oracle service.      “The Hedera Governance Council provides a pretty unique structure within the crypto industry in that it brings a variety of organizations around the table to create interesting projects,” David Post, managing director of business development and strategy for Chainlink Labs, said in an interview, adding:    “Projects built on Hedera will have the opportunity to access best-in-class price feeds, data feeds and verifiable randomness.”  Read more: Chainlink Is Building an Off-Chain Oracle Network    Because Chainlink Labs just began an enterprise research and development program, the Hedera governing council will be the first of many steps the startup is going to take in the enterprise space, Post said. The move comes as institutional interest surges in bitcoin and begins to gain traction in decentralized finance.      If an action “needs to be executed” within an application based on on-chain activity, then Chainlink’s oracles will be part of that, said Hedera Hashgraph co-founder Mance Harmon.      “For example, if Alice needs to transfer to Bob some number of tokens, they’ll be able to do that externally by looking at what’s going through the oracles and have policy execute as a result, appropriately based on the external inputs,” Harmon said.      Going forward, Hedera is interested in having two crypto companies on its council, Harmon said. A firm in compliance or blockchain analysis is likely to be the next crypto company added, he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LINK | WALLET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/20/chainlink-labs-joins-hedera-hashgraph-governing-council,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dc8cd0e669225a4e88a2cb25a99129c3accf874-1500x995.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sharp price swings have become the norm this week as the broader uptrend weakens in a way that is similar to what happened to bitcoin in 2018 at the start of a bear market.    Bitcoin faces resistance at around $45,000, defined by the 50-period volume weighted moving average on the four-hour chart.  The relative strength index (RSI) remains oversold on the four-hour chart, although buyers are on the sideline as volatility rises.  Bitcoin is stabilizing around the 200-day moving average. A decisive break below $40,000 would signal a trend shift from bullish to bearish.  Lower support is seen at around $27,000, which is a roughly 60% retracement of the March 2020 low.  “$27,000 may be a more realistic gauge of support given the lack of oversold buy signals, which is probably a function of how fast the pullback unfolded,” Katie Stockton, managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, said in an interview with CoinDesk.

The fake message, which contains multiple typos and grammatical errors, allegedly comes from the OCC or senior agency officials.      “Your fund $10.5M is ready to be paid to you,” the communication said. “Note your fund can only be paid to you VIA a Bitcoin Wallet Address ID NO.” The message claims that “the IMF.UNITED NATIONS and WORLD BANK have made a new policy that any debt or payment belonging to an individual above $1M should be paid through a bitcoin wallet address.”      The federal regulatory agency warned that any communication claiming the OCC is “holding ... funds for the benefit of any individual” is “fraudulent,” and that consumers should not respond “in any manner” to the message.      The fraudulent email comes two days after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported a dramatic surge in cryptocurrency investment scam reports over a six-month period extending from the last quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021.      According to the FTC, during this timeframe about 7,000 consumers reported losses from cryptocurrency scams amounting to over $80 million, a roughly 12-fold increase in the volume of reports and an almost 1,000% increase in reported losses compared to the same six-month period a year earlier.      The FTC said that younger consumers were most vulnerable to these scams. Investors between the ages of 20 and 49 were likelier to report losing money in cryptocurrency scams than older investors. The report also found that more than half the investment scam losses for people in their 20s and 30s involved cryptocurrency. However, individual losses to cryptocurrency scams among older age groups, although less frequent, were greater with a $3,250 median loss.      In the OCC alert, the agency said scammers instructed potential victims to respond to one of three email addresses: info.unitedubanigeria@gmail.com, paullehmann@diplomats.com and us.coc@usa.com.
