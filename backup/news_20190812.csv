42382534,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwpV,1565645431,Congressional Research Service Finds Potential Blockchain Uses for Energy Sector,"The U.S. Congressional Research Service has released a report detailing the potential uses for blockchain in the national energy sector.  In a report published August 9, the legislators detailed the current state of energy consumption related to cryptocurrency mining, both nationally and internationally. They also explored possible ways to regulate the energy-intensive mining process and to integrate blockchain technology in current energy systems.  Some of the opportunities for blockchain include placing utility bill transactions on a smart grid, supporting electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and distributing energy resources.  “Traditionally electric utilities are vertically integrated. Blockchain could disrupt this convention by unbundling energy services along a distributed energy system,” according to the report. This could lead to greater industry transparency, efficiency, and competition among energy producers.  Additionally, blockchain could increase consumer choice in the energy market. For instance, the researchers cite the ability to purchase excess energy “produced by their neighbor’s solar panels.”  In April, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $4.8 million funding grant for universities to research and develop blockchain use cases for the energy sector.  Costs of crypto mining  The agency calculated that nearly 1 percent of the country’s electricity generating capacity goes towards mining cryptocurrencies, a rate they observed increasing year over year. The researchers noted that crypto mining can burden a municipality’s power structure and increase consumer rates.  For instance, in Plattsburgh, New York, it was found that crypto mining “contributed to an increase of nearly $10 to monthly electricity bills in January 2018 for residential customers.” This surge in energy use contributed to an 18-month moratorium on any new cryptocurrency mining operations in the city.  Additionally, citing a study published in ""Nature Climate Change, vol. 8,"" the researchers claimed that “the associated energy consumption of Bitcoin usage could potentially produce enough CO2 emissions to lead to a 2 degree celsius increase in global mean average within 30 years.”  However, the researchers provided counter arguments that crypto mining will continue to increase at an unsustainable rate, and suggested crypto’s energy consumption may be a “temporary issue.”  According to the report:  “Some argue that sustainability concerns due to energy consumption are misplaced, and that the competitiveness of Bitcoin mining means that only miners with the most competitive mining hardware and the lowest electricity costs will persist over time,” the agency writes. Additionally, “Some anticipate that energy demands will diminish as the reward incentive shifts from discovering new Bitcoin to earning revenue through transaction fees.”  The researchers also argue that mining often occurs in locations with access to renewable sources of energy. Specifically, the state of Washington, provided between 15 and 30 percent of all Bitcoin mining operations globally in 2018 using hydroelectric sources of power. They also cite Mongolia, which gets 63 percent of its electric capacity from thermal power.  Conversely, 58 percent of mining pools are located in China, where many of the active sites are powered by coal. The researchers cite the China’s National Development and Reform Commission, which called mining a “wasteful and hazardous” activity.  Potential regulation  To combat rising energy usage, the researchers option the viability of policies like “minimum energy conservation standards, voluntary energy efficiency standards, and data center energy efficiency standards,” for the crypto industry.  While the country is currently a patchwork of different energy systems with equally varying regulations, Congress may pass unified legislation “to curb the energy intensity of the technology.” Some of the minimum standards considered may regulate ASIC chips or computer power usage generally.  Also floated was extending the voluntary ENERGY STAR specifications to mining gear, or submitting mining farms to the standards put forward by the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI) that oversees energy usage of data centers.  Additionally, the federal government may look to standards enacted at the state level, like those passed in March 2018, by the New York Public Service Commission, that ruled “municipal power authorities could issue a tariff on high-density-load customers—including cryptocurrency companies.”  Though bitcoin mining represents an energy intensive process, the researchers found that ""less energy intensive, alternative algorithms exist, such as proof of stake and proof of authority.""  In August 2018, the U.S. Senate held a hearing to consider the energy efficiency of blockchain.

42382537,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwtH,1565640006,Exit Scams Swindled $3.1 Billion From Crypto Investors in 2019: Report,"Cryptocurrency crime made good money last quarter, although less than in the first quarter of 2019.  Cybercrime against exchanges amounted to $125 million in Q2 compared to $356 million in Q1, according to an initial release of CipherTrace's Q2 2019 Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report. Aggregate crypto losses reached $4.3 billion this year on the back of one particular exit scam, ""Plus Token.""  Given that CipherTrace’s price estimations are set at the time of initial reporting, current valuations would be much higher.  Included within Q1 is the QuadrigaCX exchange collapse which CipherTrace labelled an exit scam. Investors lost $195 million.  CipherTrace further claims 2019 may be the “Year of the Exit Scam,” with $3.1 billion stolen through exits and another $874 million in misappropriated funds. These numbers, CipherTrace notes, are only preliminary with numerous other allegations under investigation.  An unconfirmed exit scam by South Korean exchange and pyramid scheme Plus Token is included in the estimates. Investors are suspected to have lost as much as $2.9 billion. The details around the exit scam have yet to be established, however.  In total, investors, users, and exchanges have lost almost $4.3 billion from illicit activity year to date.  CipherTrace notes that illicit funds will soon come under more intense scrutiny following the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) recent Travel Rule. The rules mandate personal information for both the sender and receiver of funds for transfers over $1,000.  UPDATE (13, August 16:00 UTC): A prior version of this story incorrectly labelled the QuadrigaCX exchange collapse a hacking event.

The SEC alleges Kik violated federal securities law, while Kik maintains that kin is not a security and its sale was legitimate.  Kik CEO Ted Livingston told CoinDesk on Wednesday that the SEC had taken quotes out of context in its original complaint, saying: ""I think what surprised us is just how much the SEC twisted the facts.""  ""We knew we were openly challenging the SEC when we published our Wells [Response],"" he said. ""We said 'Hey, somebody has to take on the SEC.'""  To combat these allegations, Kik took the unusual step of rebutting every paragraph in the SEC's complaint, providing context to certain comments and addressing claims throughout a massive, 130-page filing.  While there is no firm timeline set for how the case will proceed, Livingston said a federal judge is leaning toward a speedy discovery process, which may conclude as soon as November 2019.

The ETFs, proposed earlier this year by asset managers Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck/SolidX and Wilshire Phoenix, and filed with exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX, are all seeking to become the first such investment vehicle based on bitcoin.  The filings were published in the Federal Register in February and June, kicking off the legally-mandated 240-day clock on a final decision.  Final decisions on the Bitwise and VanEck/SolidX proposals are expected by Oct. 13 and Oct. 18, respectively.  The next decision on the Wilshire Phoenix proposal is scheduled to occur by Sept. 29.  While a number of companies have proposed bitcoin ETFs in recent years, the regulatory agency has yet to approve any, citing concerns with market manipulation, market surveillance and a potential divergence with futures trading as some issues.  Bitwise has sought to alleviate these concerns, publishing multiple reports indicating that the actual bitcoin market is smaller, more regulated and much better surveilled than expected, and that it trades tightly with CME's futures market.  The company maintains that the bitcoin market is ""extremely efficient,"" once wash trading and otherwise faked volume data is excluded.  Bitwise's ETF proposal, one of the several under active consideration by the SEC, has received support from a number of individuals in the industry, including Blockchain Capital's Spencer Bogart; Castle Island Ventures' Matthew Walsh; Coinbase Custody's Sam McIngvale; the Blockchain Association's Kristin Smith; and more than 30 others.

42382540,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwyJ,1565629202,"Crypto Code Commits Remain Near All-Time Highs, Despite Price Declines","The Takeaway:  According to a new report from Electric Capital, open-source crypto projects have lost developers, but thanks to the industry's most committed technologists, total activity has stayed relatively constant since the late-2017 boom.  Lower-market-cap crypto projects have lost the most developers, while promising sectors like decentralized finance and infrastructure projects have been gaining them.  Throughout 2019, roughly 2,450 developers have pushed code on 10 or more days per month. The total population of these highly committed developers is up 13 percent.  Even as market caps went down, year-over-year growth rates among developers never dropped below zero.      The least committed contributors were the first to leave as cryptocurrency market caps went south.  That's the main finding from Electric Capital's second ""Developer Report,"" which was published Monday. The report analyzes code activity in all the open-source repositories in crypto and follows the venture capital firm's first such report from March.  While there's a sense that protocols and projects have been losing code contributors, the majority of developers that left crypto during the market correction in the first half of 2019 (77 percent of them) were the least committed contributors to the least promising projects.  Meanwhile, total commits really haven't gone down.  ""The mystery we're really trying to unravel here is why commits have stayed very, very consistent through crypto winter even though high-level developers have decreased,"" Maria Shen, who leads data science for Electric Capital, told CoinDesk in a phone call.  In fact, Electric found that most of the total losses in developers were those doing the least amount of work. Meanwhile, more consistently contributing developers have kept the overall contributions consistent even as the developer total shrank.  Electric Capital's research spanned over 27,000 code repositories, with additional work added in to cull duplicate entries and low-level contributions that tend to inflate real developer activity. The researchers also de-duplicated developers who contributed to more than one project, though by and large, these were rare.  The principal insight, according to Electric Capital, came in dividing developers into three groups:  one-time (those who only committed code one day per month),  part-time (those who committed two to nine days per month)  and full-time (those who committed 10 or more days per month).  The top 100 projects lost only 4 percent of their total developers while the rest lost 19 percent. Across the board, the less often a developer made commits, the more likely they were to quit making contributions.  Nevertheless, monthly commits into the code base in 2019 never dropped below the levels seen in the early part of 2017's crypto boom, in no small part because the total number of developers contributing on 10 or more days each month has ticked up slightly, ending at 2,455 in June 2019.  ""It's a useful breakdown to keep track of since the total number of developers declining doesn't tell the full story,"" Linda Xie of Scalar Capital told CoinDesk.  ""Fifty percent of the drop [in total developers] is from people who committed one commit in a month. That for me was a key takeaway of the data,"" Avichal Garg, co-founder of Electric, told CoinDesk.  More importantly, the team notes that market downturns among the major blockchains over the last year only served to slow the accumulation of part-time and full-time developers. New developers continued to join the top 100 projects, though at a slower pace when prices were down.  Which means that, if crypto really is at the beginning of an upturn, ""way more developers should rush in over the next two or three years,"" Garg said.  It's also important to note that there are a number of early projects out there (such as Near, Coda and Oasis) that have not yet posted their code into open repositories, so there could be some undercounting. Nevertheless, Electric believes its data is ""directionally"" informative.  Further, it's also worth noting that the analysis made efforts to include any project that's contributing to a given blockchain, not just direct commits to the underlying protocol (such as applications and infrastructure efforts that aren't directly in the core code).  Key data points  With 100 pages primarily devoted to graphs and charts, there is a lot of information to glean from studying this report.  Here are a few points that stood out:  Ethereum on top: Of all the developers evaluated in this analysis, 18 percent worked on ethereum, which continues to have the largest contributor base (the second strongest is bitcoin).  Up-and-comers: The next three largest developer communities were EOS, Cardano and Monero, in that order.  Money isn't everything: Litecoin and Dogecoin all have more than $100 million in daily transaction volume, but less than six developers on average per month. Meanwhile, Stellar, Tron, Maker, BAT, Aeternity, Waves, Tezos and Status have more than 40 on average but come in at less than $100 million in daily volume.  Trends in loss: Developers are primarily leaving the blockchains that aren't in the top 100 by market capitalization. They are also gravitating to infrastructure work and decentralized finance, at the expense of other applications and blockchains oriented around money.  The long tail is still long: Nevertheless, there are still 583 ecosystems that have seen at least two developers at work over the last six months; 748 had at least one sustained developer.  Code is sticky: Smart-contract blockchains are losing occasional contributors but gaining full-timers.  Best winner and worst loser: Among the projects that averaged more than 40 developers, Maker gained the most and EOS lost the most, in numerical terms.  How to win devs and influence crypto: A well designed testnet launch can be a great way to market a blockchain to developers looking for a place to contribute. Electric found major upticks around these efforts. Shen pointed in particular to Cosmos's ""Game of Stakes"" as a standout success.  Why this information matters  ""Developers who have been really building in the ecosystem have continued to build,"" Shen said, ""and these ecosystems are incredibly strong.""  Broadly speaking, Garg argues that this report's findings are encouraging for the whole ecosystem. Tactically, he said, this kind of work helps his company identify projects that are neglected by the broader investment community.  Further, he said there have been some industry-wide assumptions that this research supports with real data. For example, that decentralized finance is attracting a lot of interest and that the very low-quality projects from the initial coin offering (ICO) boom are stagnating or dying.  ""This data is generally valuable for everyone to quantify these intuitions we all have,"" Garg said.  Garg also pointed to some surprises in the data.  For example, that Grin's developer community has held on despite waning interest in crypto more broadly. Additionally, that EOS did well at attracting committed developers, despite meeting general skepticism across the industry.  Critically, Garg said, across the history of the technology industry, engineers are a leading indicator of winning companies and dominant software. That's why Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft all fight so fiercely to attract and retain talent. He believes the same will prove to be true in crypto.  Said Garg:  ""Where the developers aggregate, that's where value aggregates.""

Colin McCabe, Toby Woods, and Robert Price sold over 1 million pounds worth of Class A drugs including cocaine, ketamine, and cannabis. The trio sold their products on the dark web and shipped as far as Australia, according to an August 9 BBC report.  The FBI first tipped off UK police of the self-proclaimed ‘Project4’ drug ring.  As the ringleader, McCabe was sentenced to 12 years behind bars by the Aylesbury Crown Court, followed by 9 years and nine months for Price. Woods received 14 months for his participation.  Investigators caught the ring via DNA matching, connecting drug-bearing envelopes to the men. Police found further evidence upon arrest, including packing material and phones with numerous addresses. They found over a kilo of cannabis resin and 580 grams of MDMA at Price’s address.  Commenting on the drug ring, Judge Francis Sheridan said Project4 “was as professional and well organised an operation as I’ve ever encountered.” Bitcoin helped keep the operation under wraps, the judge further claimed.  Detective Inspector Rob Bryant praised his police department’s tech capabilities:    ""McCabe was the key player in the organisation and coordinated the buying and selling of the substances and used encryption software and the dark web in an attempt to remain anonymous.

Citing regulatory uncertainty, technical challenges and growth in non-blockchain related opportunities the company is concluding its blockchain project, the Colu Local Network (CLN), according to a statement.  As part of the scale down, the company will repurchase approximately 54 million tokens sold during its $17 million ICO from those that participated in the crowd-sale.  The CLN token, which ran on the Colu Local Network, was used as a means for retail payments and provided incentives for consumers to shop locally. The company aimed to mitigate the threats of the ""retail apocalypse."" It also built an app to help small businesses manage paperless transactions and help locals discover local merchants.  The company launched the token project in four cities, including London, Liverpool and Tel Aviv. It received an additional $14.5 million from financial and insurance company IDB Group for the project.  Colu will repurchase the tokens in ether at the original crowd-sale ETH to CLN rate, which it notes “is higher than the current market exchange ratio.” The company has set a buy-back window of 90 days, after which the tokens will be burned.  The company plans to create a website dedicated for the repurchase. It also says holders in several companies will be excluded, including those in the United States and Canada. Additionally, only those who complete KYC and AML processes will receive repayment.  Culo recently launched the Belfast Coin, in partnership with Belfast City Council, and coin for use in the Municipality of Tel Aviv-Yafo. Neither project is blockchain-based and both will continue to operate.  “The Colu Group is also in talks with a number of other municipalities across the world, about introducing similar initiatives,” according to a statement.  Dan Ariely, professor of behavioral economics, told Crowdfund Insider:  “Colu DLT’s decision to purchase CLN tokens appears unprecedented in the industry. It demonstrates how the Colu Group’s core values guide its actions. The Colu Group is focused on fostering relations between municipalities, local businesses, residents, and other city stakeholders. These relationships rely on the very same kind of trust and consideration, which is now being shown towards CLN token holders. It is wonderful to see the Colu Group following their ethical standards not just in words but in action. Such acts of giving up profits for the benefits of customers, partners, and investors are crucial to this tech sector if we want it to continue to evolve and grow.”  Colu DLT’s Chairman of the Board of Directors, Amos Meiri, said “blockchain may yet help to” build trust between people and foster local economies.

42382528,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwjD,1565611257,"IBM, Tata Become First Big Techs to Back Hedera Blockchain","IBM and Indian telecom company Tata Communications have joined the governance council of Hedera Hashgraph, a blockchain-like public network for enterprises.  Now, eight of the 39 available spots for governing council members are filled, the network announced Monday.  “Our goal is to create the most decentralized governing body of any of the major public platforms,” Mance Harmon, CEO of Hedera, told Coindesk. “We’re covering multiple industries … and we’re wanting global coverage.”  Hedera claims its flavor of distributed ledger technology (DLT), which works differently than blockchains, can facilitate micropayments and distributed file storage, support smart contracts and will eventually allow private networks to plug into the public one to take advantage of its transaction ordering mechanism.  After three rounds of funding done through simple agreements for future tokens (SAFTs), Hedera has raised $124 million.  IBM is the first major tech company and Tata is the first Indian company to join the network. Some of the network’s other governing members include Japanese financial holding company Nomura, Deutsche Telekom and law firm DLA Piper. At this point in the network's lifecycle, council members are invited by Hedera to join and given fee income for running nodes.  Public-private partnership  IBM said it is most interested in how the public network interacts with private networks.  “The most exciting part is the proposed Hedera Consensus Service,” said Bryan Gross, principal offering manager of the IBM Blockchain Platform. “It has the potential to provide the core innovation of proof-of-work blockchains, like bitcoin and ethereum, without the performance and privacy trade-offs that are typically associated with these networks.”  Since the Hedera Hashgraph is designed to unify public and private networks, IBM will use it to build trust in custom Hyperledger Fabric networks. (Big Blue contributed the Fabric platform to Hyperledger, an umbrella project for enterprise blockchains.)  “Hedera Consensus Service makes it possible for Hyperledger projects out there to use the service to put transactions in order and eliminate the need for them to stand up nodes for transaction ordering, and they get the trust model of a public network,” Harmon said.  Tata Communications, part of the Indian conglomerate Tata Group, could not be immediately reached for comment but said in a press release that it plans to use distributed ledger technology to improve operational efficiency.  Checks and balances  The addition of the two major firms will further decentralize Hedera’s governance, said Harmon.  That governance includes a system of checks and balances that are supposed to prevent power from being consolidated at the network.  Members of the council have equal say in approving updates to Hedera’s codebase and in setting policies for the network’s nodes.

42382538,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwvn,1565610092,Goldman Sachs Analysts' Slide Suggests Now's a Good Time to Buy Bitcoin,"Market intel from Goldman Sachs suggests investors should capitalize on the current price dip and buy bitcoin.  In a series of slides prepared by a technical analysis team and sent out to some institutional clients, Goldman included one that said the short-term target for bitcoin (BTC) is $13,971 and that investors should consider buying on any dips in the current scenario.  The investment bank said that, based on its Elliott Wave analysis, BTC would find support around $11,094, and that there's scope for a move higher to $12,916, then $13,971.  “Any such retracement from $12,916-$13,971 should be viewed as an opportunity to buy on weakness as long as it doesn’t retrace further than the $9,084 low,” the slide said.  It should be noted that the prices used for the analysis don't include weekend prices and are likely from futures market data.  While this technical analysis seems bullish on bitcoin, Goldman Sachs' former CEO and chairman has previously said bitcoin just isn’t his thing. Lloyd Blankfein said in an interview last June that bitcoin is ""not for me ... I don’t do it. I don’t own bitcoin.” (He retired at the end of last year.)  Rumors that Goldman would launch a crypto trading desk and custody service have been reportedly put on hold over the uncertain regulatory scene in the U.S.    Goldman Sachs slide deck by CoinDesk on Scribd    Edit (21:30 UTC, Aug. 12, 2019): Edited text to clarify that the intel came via a slide deck from a technical analysis team at Goldman, not a research note, and that Lloyd Blankfein is no longer CEO.

42382542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rwx3,1565607608,Bitcoin Price Faces Struggle to Hold Above $11K After Range Breakdown,"View  Bitcoin's short duration charts indicate the bears are in control and prices could drop below $11,000 in the next 24 hours.  A strong bounce from the 5- and 10-week moving averages at $10,804 and $10,625, respectively, could fuel a rise back to $12,000.  A high-volume weekly close (Sunday, UTC) or a back-to-back daily close above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish outlook.      Bitcoin (BTC) could drop below $11,000 in the next 24 hours, after sellers took victory in a four-day-long tug of war with the bulls.  The top cryptocurrency's trading range had tightened in the four days to Aug. 9, with prices printing lower highs above $12,000 and higher lows in the range of $11,200 to $11,650.  That contracting triangle pattern represented a stiff battle between the bulls and the bears, as well as bullish exhaustion following a 35 percent rally from July 28 lows near $9,100.  A range breakout would have meant a continuation of the uptrend. Prices, however, dived out of the narrowing price range on Saturday, confirming victory for the bears.  The range breakdown had been expected, as a key technical indicator on the intraday charts was flashing signs of bearish reversal, as discussed on Friday.  So far, the downside has been restricted to levels around the former resistance-turned-support of $11,100. The cryptocurrency dipped to a low of $11,080 on Sunday before rising back above $11,500 earlier today.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,355 on Bitstamp, representing little change on a 24-hour basis.  Hourly chart  BTC fell from $11,871 to $11,200 in the 60 minutes to 12:00 UTC on Aug. 10, confirming a downside break of the narrowing price range. The breakdown was backed by a surge in selling volume, as represented by the red bar (above left).  On the line chart (above right), BTC has dived out of an inverted flag – a continuation pattern that accelerates the preceding bearish move.  The flag breakdown has opened the doors to $10,800 (target as per the measured move method).  Seasoned traders may consider a long-tailed hammer candle created in 60 minutes to 10:00 UTC on Sunday as a sign of bullish revival. The candle, however, lacked volume support.  That said, the hammer would gain credence if prices rise above the flag high of $11,589, in which case a rise to $12,000 could be on the cards.  Weekly chart  BTC created a candle with a long upper wick last week, as it failed to close (Sunday, UTC) above the $12,000 mark.  Notably, the cryptocurrency has failed four times in the last seven weeks to find acceptance above $12,000, as indicated by the candles with long upper wicks.  It is often observed that markets test dip demand after facing multiple rejections at key price levels. So, a pullback to sub-$11,000 levels, as suggested by the intraday chart, looks likely.  Note that the ascending (bullish) 5- and 10-week moving averages are currently located at $10,804 and $10,625, respectively.  A strong bounce from these levels, if any, could yield a break above $12,000. A bull revival, however, needs a weekly close above $12,000. That would imply a resumption of the rally from April's low near $4,050.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The firm posted a teaser page to the ""More"" tab in its KakaoTalk app on Aug. 12, according to a report from CoinDesk Korea, offering a few details of the planned product.  Developed by Kakao's blockchain affiliate GroundX, Klip will be a digital wallet that manages user information and digital assets. Specifically, it will support Klay, the native token of the firm's Klayton blockchain, and related tokens based on its KRC-20 standard.  The firm suggests that listed digital assets will be able to be sent to users' contacts in KakaoTalk in real-time, as with its Kakao Pay product.  Klayton went live on its mainnet on June 27, with GoundX saying it boasts fast response times on the level of legacy web services.  The Klip teaser page also shows a number of logos from early decentralized app (dapp) partner services such as Hintchain, a food recommendation project. Kakao said users can hold and manage cryptocurrencies given as rewards for using these dapps in the Klip wallet.  The storage and trading of other digital assets will be added in the future, Kakao said. These will include including Klay-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or crypto-collectibles. Items acquired in Klay-friendly blockchain games will be created as NFTs and will be able to be stored in Klip or exchanged with other users.  GroundX announced last month that a number of blockchain games will use Klay tokens including Klayton Knights (Biscuit Labs), Marvel Clans (Mix Marble) and ExiInfinity (SkyMavis).  In an echo of Facebook's Libra project, Kakao also said that it will be possible to use Klip through KakaoTalk without installing other apps, such as Kakao Page, Kakao Friends Shop and Kakao Game.  Kakao said it aims to improve accessibility by making Klips available directly from the KakaoTalk 'More' tab.  The firm added that it aims to boost adoption of blockchain technology by letting its 50 million KakaoTalk users organically encounter Klayton-based services through Klips.

42382502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rtj1,1565599540,China's Central Bank 'Close' to Launching Official Digital Currency,"An official at China's central bank has said the institution is nearing the launch of its digital currency.  Speaking at an event in China over the weekend, Mu Changchun, deputy director of the payments unit at the People's Bank of China (PBoC), said its researchers have been hard at work since last year to complete the systems needed to support the digital yuan offering and that it is “close to being out.” The news was reported by Bloomberg on Monday.  Since Facebook announced details of its Libra cryptocurrency project in mid June, China has viewed development of its digital coin with new urgency.  Early in July, the former governor of the PBoC Zhou Xiaochuan said that Libra poses a threat to payments systems and national currencies.  As such, he argued the Chinese government should “make good preparations and make the Chinese yuan a stronger currency."" Zhou further suggested that “commercial entities” could be allowed to issue digital yuans, as Hong Kong allows with its dollar.  Around the same time, Wang Xin, head of the research bureau at the PBoC, said the central bank has been looking at the Libra situation with “high attention,” and could ramp up development of its own digital currency.  In his weekend comments, Mu reiterated that the PBoC's digital currency would be a substitute for M0 – or coins and notes in circulation – not M2, which includes bank deposits. The digital currency would boost circulation of the yuan, including internationally, he added.  As previously reported, the large number of patents filed by the PBoC relating to its digital currency paint a picture of how it might work. They suggest the work addresses a technology that issues a digital currency, as well as provides a wallet that stores and transacts the asset in an “end-to-end” fashion.  The patents indicate the wallet would store a digital currency issued by the central bank or any authorized central entity that is encrypted like a cryptocurrency with private keys, offers multi-signature security and is held by users in a decentralized way.  At the latest count, there have been 52 patents filed under the name of the Digital Currency Research Lab of the PBoC, with the latest published in Oct. 9 2018, having been submitted on March 26. 2018.

The Electric Coin Company, developer of zcash, appeared to confirm the news, saying in a tweet on Friday:  ""Those affected by @coinbase UK issues: this is limited to Coinbase UK only. UK residents can still buy/sell Zcash through @cex_io. No other exchanges in the UK affected.""  It further said ""To pre-empt speculation, we confirm that Zcash is 100 percent compatible with UK regulations & KYC/AML requirements.""  In its guidance released at the end of July, the U.K.'s financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said that while some forms of crypto assets may fall under its regulatory remit, ""exchange tokens"" such as bitcoin and ether do not. That category would appear to include zcash.  The British tax agency, HM Revenue & Customs, has recently been sending out letters demanding that cryptocurrency exchanges – including Coinbase, eToro and CEX.IO – reveal customers’ names and transaction histories in a bid to claw back unpaid taxes, industry sources told CoinDesk.  Zcash allows users the option to hide (or shield) details of their transactions using a type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs.  When Coinbase Pro announced zcash support back in November 2018, it said that it would ""support deposits from both transparent and shielded addresses, but only support withdrawals to transparent addresses. In the future, we’ll explore support for withdrawals to shielded addresses in locations where it complies with local laws.”  Users of Coinbase in other jurisdictions appear unaffected by the removal of zcash support at press time.

42382505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rto3,1565596839,IRS Warnings to Bitcoin Traders Offer Clues to Coming Tax Guidance,"The Takeaway:  The IRS' recent warning letters to 10,000 traders offer hints at what its forthcoming guidance on crypto taxes might say.  While the letters are not guidance, the tea leaves indicate the IRS might be changing its required methods for calculating the value of crypto holdings and the forms and schedules for reporting them.  Major questions remain unresolved, including how hard forks and airdrops should be treated.      As U.S. cryptocurrency users eagerly await tax guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), they can find hints of what may come in the agency’s recent warning letters.  The tax collector said earlier this year that its first guidance on crypto since 2014 is coming, but it’s not clear what information will be provided or when it will be published. (IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said at the end of May that guidance could come “within the next 30 days,” but that loose deadline passed.)  Yet the three form letters, sent last month by the IRS to more than 10,000 crypto traders, asked taxpayers to verify that they filed their taxes due on crypto gains and losses correctly, or amend their tax filings (one under penalty of perjury). And reading between the lines, the letters suggest changes in the agency’s approach to the asset class when compared to past public statements.  Take, for example, how the three new letters instruct traders to calculate the fair market value of cryptocurrency holdings.  The letters tell traders to look at the exact date and time they conducted a transaction, diverging from its guidance from 2014, which said to apply “the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.”  As an illustration, say you bought 5 bitcoin on April 10, 2015. The 2014 guidance says to pick a price at some point during the day and use that to calculate fair market value. Bitcoin opened at a price of $243.69, fell as low as $232.77 and closed at $236.07, according to CoinMarketCap. Any of these prices could work, as long as all calculations for all taxes were consistent.  The recent letters instead direct you to look at the exact time you bought the 5 bitcoin and use the price at that time to calculate the value.  That’s more sensible, in the view of James Foust, a senior research fellow at industry advocacy group Coin Center.  “If someone has multiple transactions over the course of a day and there’s significant volatility it doesn’t make sense to apply the same daily exchange rate, and also it could result in some weird outcomes,” Foust said.  However, this may pose an issue for traders who now have to find this information, said Sean Ryan, chief technology officer and co-founder at crypto tax software provider Node40.  He noted that the letters call for taxes on transactions conducted between 2013 and 2017, adding:  “Now they say date and time and that does matter because we know that virtual currencies fluctuate minute-to-minute, trade-to-trade. So by saying it’s no longer susceptible to ‘date accurate’ and has to be ‘date and time accurate’ it throws a wrench in the system because they have to go back and find that [information].”  Different forms and schedules  The letters also diverge from past efforts to collect information about crypto traders.  The IRS has previously asked exchanges to generate 1099-K forms for customers, which are usually used for payment settlement organizations, Foust noted, meaning merchants receiving revenue through a particular income stream.  “That’s not helpful for paying taxes because the overwhelming majority of [customers] are not receiving payments on exchanges, they’re buying digital currencies,” he said. It could also lead to confusion with buys and sells. Foust explained:  “Say you buy for $10,000 and sold for $9,000, the IRS would see that as you received a payment for $9,000, not a $1,000 loss.”  “It’s not super-clear why the IRS ... decided to get the exchanges to use the 1099-K form to report this customer information but that’s sort of the world that we’re in right now,” Foust added.  The exchanges generating the 1099-K forms would provide them to both the taxpayer and the IRS, but the information included “is almost never going to be correct,” Ryan said.  By specifying a different schedule, and therefore different form, in one of the letters, the IRS is essentially saying that the correct form is actually the 1099-B, he said.  According to Ryan, one of the schedules listed in one of the letters is Schedule D, which is for reporting gains and losses from capital assets.  The letter itself notes that “if you sold, exchanged, or disposed of virtual currency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether), or used it to pay for goods or services, you have engaged in a reportable transaction.”  The information that needs to be reported would be listed in form 8949, which in turn would normally derive its data from the 1099-B, Ryan said.  Foust added that if an exchange were to provide a 1099-B, “you often don’t have to [fill out] form 8949 at all because the 1099-B is supposed to give you all that information.”  Like with the 1099-K, exchanges would also provide that information to the IRS.  Left hand, meet right hand  Foust noted that the IRS’s letters are not actual guidance, but still, “it’s nice guidance to get.”  “It’s the kind of thing you would hope would come in the form of guidance and not in the form of educational letters sent to a few thousand taxpayers and [everyone else] has to read the tea leaves,” he added.  Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at law firm Steptoe & Johnson who focuses on taxes and related issues, said it is likely that the IRS group developing new guidance is not coordinating with whichever team wrote the letters. Any new guidance will have to pass through several layers of approval, including the U.S. Treasury Department (which the IRS falls under).  Any individual who received a letter likely did so because the IRS has evidence that they made cryptocurrency trades, she said.  “Some people are complaining, ‘well you haven’t issued guidance, therefore, you shouldn't be enforcing,’” she said. “These letters are saying ‘if you use virtual currency and you made a gain from it you should be reporting.’”  The IRS did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Zarlenga said the letters may not be inconsistent with past guidance. In her view, the IRS is most likely just looking for individuals who did not report any gains or losses from crypto transactions, despite having conducted them.  “I don’t think this indicates a change in their position at all. I think these letters are getting at basic reporting on gains and losses in the use of cryptocurrency,” she said.  By and large, last month’s letters aren’t even “treading new ground,” Zarlenga said. Taxpayers need to be able to indicate when they bought a cryptocurrency, when they sold it, how much it cost when they bought it and how much it cost when they sold, the letters said.  The U.S. is in good company trying to collect taxes from its crypto-trading residents. The U.K.’s HM Revenue and Customs recently asked crypto exchanges to provide information about their customers, including transaction history, while the Australian Tax Organization announced in April it would collect data to help ensure residents paid the appropriate amount of tax.  All three countries are members of the J5, a multinational collaboration between tax agencies to combat money laundering and other illicit behavior. Cryptocurrencies are one stated focus for the group.  Still unanswered  Since its first (and so far only) official guidance on crypto taxes in 2014, the IRS has offered glimpses as to how taxpayers can file returns through other actions, such as its requests for information from exchanges like Coinbase.  However, even last month’s warning letters leave some of the largest questions around paying taxes on crypto unanswered, Foust said.  “We’re sort of in an unfortunate situation right now because the IRS hasn’t provided substantive guidance on how people are supposed to report their virtual currency transactions and calculate what their tax burden is,” he said.  The implications, he added, are:  “People are being put in a position where they’re being asked to certify in one of those letters certify under penalty of perjury that they’ve [abided by] rules that haven’t been published yet.”  The most obvious question revolves around forks, or events that create a new cryptocurrency available to holders of an old one, Ryan said.  “The IRS has been completely silent on ‘now is that income? You just doubled your quantity, not your value, your quantity,’” he said. “If they’re going to consider that income they have to tell you how to assign cost basis because there’s no trading history.”  In his view, forks should not be considered income.  Likewise, the tax treatment of airdrops, or giveaways of a cryptocurrency to spur adoption, remains an open question.  Depending on the circumstances, a taxpayer may or may not be able to opt in to receiving tokens through an airdrop.  If a wallet provider or other service automatically airdrops tokens to all users, Ryan said, that should not be considered income.  On the other hand, he said, “if you opt in to an airdrop I think you should report that as income.”  IRS image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/08/12/irs-warnings-to-bitcoin-traders-offer-clues-to-coming-tax-guidance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c9ed3450bd5e18ba0bb493b2014bb1d1a9deccb-1500x904.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382509,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rtrp,1565577006,Trump's Currency War With China Could Be Bitcoin's Do-or-Die Moment,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      The global economy faces its biggest crisis in 11 years.  In theory, this should be bitcoin’s moment to shine, a chance to prove itself as an uncorrelated asset immune from political risks. Eventually, that result may bear out. But a rocky road lies ahead – for bitcoiners and nocoiners alike.  Before we do the bitcoin up-or-down game, let’s dive into why the current situation in global finance is so disturbing.  The Backdrop  It all begun last Monday, when Beijing let the renminbi fall below RMB7.0 to the dollar.  Almost immediately, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would take the rare step of labeling China a “currency manipulator,” a move that, in theory, would give the Trump Administration legal cover to impose punitive sanctions against Chinese. Markets freaked out at the specter of a currency war, a tit-for-tat feedback loop of exchange rate depreciations fueling a destructive downward spiral in trade and growth.  Now, that fear may never play out.  On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China helped assuage investors’ fears. In buying more renminbi to stabilize its value, it signaled that it isn’t, for now, intending to aggressively use its currency as a trade weapon.  Also, the U.S. pronouncement made no sense. By the Treasury Department’s own definition, manipulation entails persistent, one-sided intervention in markets to weaken the domestic currency. But the renminbi’s fall came because the PBOC briefly had pared back its prior interventions supporting it.  If anything, China has persistently done the opposite of market manipulation over the past five years, propping up its currency against a market that wanted to take it lower, all in order to refocus the country’s economic growth model away from a dependence on foreign exports.  On that basis, there’s no way the International Monetary Fund or World Trade Organization would support the Trump Administration’s case that China is a currency manipulator, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to very harmful international sanctions if it were to unilaterally hit China with retribution on that basis.  The Ripple Effect  The problem is the global political and economic environment doesn’t build confidence that politicians will act rationally. Facts and multilateral institutions’ views carry less weight in an era when major Western nations are retreating from the neoliberal norms of the nineties and aughts. So, don’t be surprised if we see even more extreme market turmoil over currency-war risk in the near future.  Any escalation would play out in a global spiral. A weaker renminbi means all other countries that trade with China are also disadvantaged. So, they’ll also feel compelled to weaken their currencies, which means their trading partners will, in turn, feel pressured to do so.  Any countries with nominally free-floating currencies won’t do this via intervention or outright devaluation; instead, they’ll use interest rate cuts, which soften demand for their currencies and so have a similar effect. Central banks don’t even need to justify such cuts in currency terms; they’ll just note that a global trade war is undermining the domestic economic outlook.  Already, New Zealand, India and Thailand have announced interest rate cuts in response to the renminbi’s decline. Meanwhile, bond markets are expressing investors’ worst fears: the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is now almost below that of the three-month T-bill, ominously close to an “inverted yield curve,” which has traditionally signaled impending recession and much weaker monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.  This low-interest environment is eating into banks costs. This is why Swiss bank UBS is now charging large depositors a fee to hold money at the bank – a negative interest rate play that angers savers.  The scariest image here is not one of rebellion by angry rich savers, or even of a repeat of the heavy market turmoil of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis or the even more extreme losses of 2008-2009. It’s that a currency war in which the U.S. is a deliberate belligerent would look more like the 1930s.  That’s when the end of the gold standard and the U.S. Smoot-Hawley tariff law combined to spur a global cycle of devaluations that extended and widened the Great Depression. The ensuing international tensions fanned the flames of the Second World War.  Of course, this is not the 1930s. We have a far more globalized economy, and we have the Internet. This greater interconnectivity, economists and political scientists often argue, will compel people, businesses and their politicians to resist conflict, economic or otherwise.  But we also now know that interconnectivity, at least in its current “Web 2.0” format, has been highly disruptive to a political establishment that used to champion pro-globalization, pro-free trade policies.  Google’s and Facebook’s centralized, data-mining algorithms have created echo chambers of dopamine-addicted group-thinkers, which, along with disinformation bots and “fake news,” have weakened the mainstream media outlets around which that establishment once revolved.  The 'Buy Bitcoin' Argument  Whether you’re cheering for its demise or not, the liberal vision of the nation-state is under threat, and that’s sowing chaos. On one side, the Internet has enabled new, transnational groups with loyalties that transcend their countries’ interests. On the other, this dislocation has fostered a backlash from defenders of the pre-liberal order of hardline state power.  This same past week’s images of China’s violent crackdown in Hong Kong, where protesters desperately attempted to neutralize Beijing’s frightening digital surveillance, is a prime example. Another is Trump’s militaristic rhetoric.      But here’s what also wasn’t around 80 years ago: cryptocurrency. People who worried in the 1930s about currency debasements, ethnic conflict or war destroying their wellbeing often turned to gold as a safe haven. Gold represented an ancient, widely recognized store of value whose properties, including its supply, were outside of the influence of turmoil-stoking governments.  But now a citizen seeking a hedge against such threats has a digital alternative, one that’s far more appropriate for the Internet age, a vital bulwark against the centralized control of both banks and large Internet companies and against wayward governments.  That alternative is bitcoin, whose digital properties are similar to those of “hard currencies” like gold: it’s hard to mine, provably scarce, fungible and transferable. Even better, as bitcoin bulls like to point out, the upcoming halving in bitcoin’s supply will put its stock-to-flow ratio above that of gold. (I’d say that should be priced in, however; I don’t see it as a reason, in and of itself, to buy now.)  Why bitcoin and not some more recent, technically superior altcoin? Because, as with gold’s preeminence over silver as a safe haven, bitcoin has by far the biggest community of believers in its capacity to protect a holder’s wealth from political incursions. It’s this shared belief that gives bitcoin its power, a point poorly understood by those who erroneously argue that software forks undermine its digital scarcity. (Exhibit A: Bitcoin Cash’s market cap compared with bitcoin’s.)  Herein lies the “buy bitcoin” argument for this current moment: that, regardless of your own beliefs, a sufficiently large number of other people now believe bitcoin to be the best way to hedge against political-economic turmoil in the global financial system.  It’s tempting to say this mindset helped drive bitcoin’s price higher after Monday’s currency market news. But it’s always been difficult to correlate bitcoin’s day-to-day movements to real-world move.  More important is the fact that bitcoin has not sold off in recent months as other real-world assets have come under pressure – a result that possibly counteracts an argument I made a year ago that global financial market jitters would first spark a selloff, as bitcoin would be lumped into widespread risk aversion, with a recovery only once it had established its credentials as hedge against politics. Perhaps the departure of many newbie speculators who bought in during the crypto mania of 2017 has left the market in the hands of a more die-hard core of true-believing HODLers.  Still, it would be foolish to assume the path from here is straight upwards. One major risk to that view is that of a profound, sweeping regulatory backlash, a jump into what Nic Carter of has labeled the phase of “full criminalization.”  The idea is that governments, seeing investment outflows accompanying the financial turmoil, will worry about bitcoin enabling capital flight and so seek to ban it or at least introduce restrictions on exchanges that make the on- and off-ramps very difficult to use.  For sure, a global regulatory backlash can’t kill the censorship-resistant “Honeybadger of money,” which is these kinds of situations do make a strong case for owning it in the long run.  But for now, the best prediction is that market volatility will continue.  Image Credit: Evan El-Amin / Shutterstock.com",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BCH | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Michael J.
