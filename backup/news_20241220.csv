37901236,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26826,1734738900,Quantum BioPharma Joins Corporate Crypto Adoption with $1M Bitcoin Purchase,"Quantum BioPharma (QNTM), a biopharmaceutical company, has become the latest publicly traded firm to incorporate cryptocurrencies into its treasury strategy. On Dec. 20, the company announced a $1 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Following the disclosure, QNTM’s shares on the Nasdaq dropped nearly 10%. Quantum BioPharma, also listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, specializes in biotech solutions for treating neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and alcohol misuse disorders. “The company is now set up to receive financing in cryptocurrencies as well as executing other types of transactions in cryptocurrencies,” Quantum stated, though it did not reveal the specific tokens in its portfolio. More non-crypto businesses are embracing digital assets to diversify their holdings and hedge against inflation. In November, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year, with a 0.3% monthly increase, marking the sharpest rise in seven months. Jiva Technologies, a wellness e-commerce firm, approved a plan to invest up to $1 million in Bitcoin last month, citing its inflation-resistant qualities. Similarly, video-sharing platform Rumble allocated $20 million of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in late November. Hoth Therapeutics, another biopharmaceutical company, added $1 million in Bitcoin to its treasury on Nov. 20. MicroStrategy, which adopted this strategy in 2020, remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 439,000 BTC as of December 2024. Think Tank Advocates Bitcoin Adoption The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, has pushed major corporations like Amazon and Microsoft to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Microsoft shareholders voted against the proposal during a Dec. 10 meeting, calling it “unnecessary.” Amazon’s shareholders are set to review the proposal in April 2025. The think tank plans additional Bitcoin-related proposals for 2025, aligning its efforts with a “pro-freedom” agenda.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/quantum-biopharma-joins-corporate-crypto-adoption-with-1m-bitcoin-purchase/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-first-exchange-listing-as-pepe-and-wif-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37900968,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631282,1734737908,"3rd largest blockchain by stablecoin cap, $100M+ in RWA – What went right for Arbitrum in 2024?","The bear market was in full swing at the start of the year, and Arbitrum’s ARB suffered like many altcoins price-wise as the risk appetite dried up and some investors were shaken out. Despite that, 2024 still ended up as a win for the ARB ecosystem . Not only did it become the third-largest blockchain by stablecoin capitalization, it also achieved over $100M in Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization. RWA, stablecoin liquidity, and everything that went right for Arbitrum In 2024 Arbitrum’s stablecoin market cap significantly increased this year, thanks to the enabling environment the blockchain provides. According to reports , Arbitrum added almost $1 billion to its stablecoin market cap between November and this month, positioning it ahead of blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. As of December 20, Arbitrum has a stablecoin market cap of approximately $6.75 billion and is on track to surpass $7 billion in total value locked. When stablecoin market cap grows on a blockchain as it has on Arbitrum, it typically signals liquidity stacking ahead of activity on the network. There was also a noticeable uptick in the tokenization of RWAs on Arbitrum . At the start of this year, it had less than $100k in tokenized assets, but that stat has steadily grown to around $85 million as of mid-December. Major contributors to this growth include major asset managers like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock,, who deployed tokenized Money Market Funds on the platform. 99% of these tokenized assets are US Treasuries, which is unsurprising as tokenized equities and equity indices have always been a niche sector, with a combined AUM of merely $800k. Investors can access stocks and indices on Arbitrum, such as SPY, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, and COIN. While a majority of those assets are held by externally-owned accounts, the Arbitrum DAO treasury holds 18.4% of the chain’s RWAs, and 10.1% reside in DEX liquidity pools. Why is the Arbitrum DAO holding so much in RWAs? The goal is to create an alternative revenue stream with a different risk profile than ETH and ARB. Ecosystem development and community engagement Arbitrum’s ecosystem recorded significant growth across various parameters. The network’s TVL (Total Value Locked) hit $20 billion, proof of its capacity to scale and innovate. This is thanks to developments like the support for USDC as a gas token for Orbit chains, which facilitated broader adoption and new use cases for onboarding retailers into Web3. Another area that made Arbitrum more enticing to whales is its profitability for liquidity providers. It attracted more users and devs thanks to its shorter block times, which many have lauded. As it stands, Arbitrum One boasts an average block time of 250 milliseconds. However, with Arbitrum Orbit, block times can be configured to go as low as 100 milliseconds if transactions arrive that quickly. The efficiency contributed immensely to the competitive edge the blockchain now has over other blockchains, including Ethereum, which has an average block time of around 12 seconds. Arbitrum stuck around during the bear market, and unsurprisingly, the ecosystem’s community and developer activity have rewarded it with their support. Showcases of its active user base include surpassing a billion transactions on Arbitrum One and the 1 million Stylus NFTs mint milestone. Despite the already strong RWA growth on the chain this year, there’s still significant room for expansion. As it stands, 99% of RWAs on Arbitrum are US Treasuries , which means other industries like real estate are yet to be represented and could be the next in line. Real estate can offer higher yields and tangible value. There has always been global demand for premium properties, which makes it an untapped market with massive potential. Arbitrum’s low fees and scalability make it the ideal ecosystem for RWAs in crypto, and if it intersects with other use cases, it could be set for another great year in 2025.

37901850,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321709,1734736068,Is the Ethereum Price Crash Over? Here’s Where Its Headed Next,"The Ethereum (ETH) price’s post-US Federal Reserve meeting rollercoaster continued on Friday with prices crashing as low as the $3,100 area before covering sharply to just above $3,400. That leaves the Ethereum price roughly flat over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap , but losses since last week’s peaks just above $4,100 currently stand at around 16.5%. The Fed rocked sentiment across traditional financial and crypto markets on Wednesday after they sounded the alarm about sticky inflation and revised their guidance for easing in 2025 to just two rate cuts from the four they had previously signaled. US equity marketed, which were arguably due a correction following their impressive run to new record levels since Trump’s election victory last month, were hammered at the time. S&P 500 FALLS 3% IN BIGGEST POST-FED DROP SINCE MARCH 2020 — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) December 18, 2024 It’s no surprise then that a risk appetite-sensitive asset like Ethereum (ETH), and cryptos more broadly, also took a beating. However, price action on Friday in suggests the worse might be over, and a period of stabilization and even a potential recovery into the year end could be on the cards. The Ethereum price looks on course to form a bullish dragonfly doji daily candle, which tends to form around the time of price bottoms. ETH also received super strong support as it neared its 200DMA, and there are strong signs that dip buyers are aggressively entering the market to support the price. Even Trump-affiliated crypto project World Liberty Financial’s wallet was spotted scooping up over $2 million in ETH. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial ( @worldlibertyfi ) spent another 2.5M $USDT to buy 722.2 $ETH 2 hours ago, after the price dropped by ~6%! Since November 30, this fund has spent $47.5M on 6 crypto assets: $ETH , $WBTC , $LINK , $AAVE , $ENA , and $ONDO (tweet ). Of this,… https://t.co/8v3pGVG8Hr pic.twitter.com/Ix3h8Y1hxc — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 20, 2024 Assuming no further macro surprises hit in the coming weeks (unlikely given an absence of important US data or Fed events), focus should return to bullish themes such as the incoming Trump administration’s pro-crypto policy stance, and how a 2025 should bring a new golden era to crypto. That means the stage could be set for a gradual recovery for the Ethereum price into the year’s end, assuming the US dollar and US yields stop charging higher. Calls for new all-time highs before the year’s end may not be realistic, but a gradual recovery in the upcoming sessions back toward $4,000 certainly is. Ethereum Price – Wen New All-Time Highs? The Ethereum price’s strong rejection of its latest retest of yearly highs in the $4,100 area has some investors panicking. But they should relax. Firstly, the major theme in crypto right now is adoption – Wall Street gobbling up supply, talk of a crypto industry boom over the next for years in the US, and potentially even the establishment of Bitcoin national reserves, which would further legitimize the nascent industry. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed is ""not allowed to own Bitcoin"" They weren't allowed to own Corporate Bonds before Covid either. Rules change… pic.twitter.com/3UBBUuKtdF — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) December 18, 2024 So yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut as much as hoped next year, which isn’t as good for risk assets like stocks and crypto as if they cut more. But the adoption tailwinds are set to far outweigh anyway macro headwinds. And macro isn’t even really a headwind anyway – we remain in an environment of a strong US economy at the same time as a Fed that is still inclined to ease rates, which many longer-term minded investors think of as “Goldilocks” for risk assets. Secondly, ETH’s historic cyclical relationship with BTC also gives reason for optimism about the medium-term Ethereum price outlook. In prior cycles (like 2020/21 and 2017), Bitcoin has broken out to new record highs one to two months ahead of ETH. Bitcoin broke out in mid-November, meaning it’s not been just over one month. That sets the table for a potential January surge for the Ethereum price as it follows Bitcoin’s lead. FUD relating to ETH’s recent price underperformance versus BTC and its “poor tech” when compared to rivals like Solana or Sui shouldn’t deter investors. That’s not to say those blockchains won’t perform well, but Ethereum remains far and away the dominant blockchain in DeFi with around 56% of TVL, per DeFi Llama , and has US ETFs plus the backing of BlackRock , one of Wall Street’s biggest players. . @BlackRock buying $ETH while everyone panic selling: https://t.co/FYX6l6bJ9y pic.twitter.com/rB48lRarUj — Ethereum Daily (@ETH_Daily) December 12, 2024 One BlackRock executive recent commented that, rather than launching more crypto ETF products, their focus right now is on promoting their existing BTC and ETH ETFs to a wider investor base.

Two days ago, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, added support for Usual Protocol ( USUAL ). “Binance is excited to announce that Usual (USUAL) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and timings listed below.” According to a post on the social media platform X from Usual in response to the Binance listing, the team says the protocol aims to usher in a “stablecoin renaissance”. “9 0% for the Community: Usual is built to empower, with the majority of tokens for users. No VC (venture capital)/Team Dumps: Just 10% allocated to insiders, cliffed for one year. 100% Revenue for the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization): Every $ of revenue belongs to USUAL holders” According to the Usual Protocol’s website , USUAL acts as a governance token performing two major functions: “1. Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is down 6% over the same period.

The broader market is still bearing the brunt of Bitcoin’s crash, worrying both investors and speculators. Related Reading: SUI The Rising Star: Analyst Foresees Over $25 Breakthrough Market Overview: A Sudden Change The recent drop in the value of crypto assets has caused around $787 million to be lost through liquidations of different types of digital assets. Dogecoin, which is often considered as a joke, has been among the hardest hit. Approximately $29 million in DOGE liquidations were recorded recently, with bullish positions suffering the most losses, according to CoinGlass data. In a mere 24 hours, the price of Dogecoin plummeted to a low of $0.34 before ultimately stabilizing at approximately $0.365, a 6.05% decline. Macroeconomic issues influencing more general market movements can help to explain this fall. The Federal Reserve’s concern about interest rate cuts has aggravated bearish attitude. For example, Ethereum and Dogecoin followed suit after Bitcoin’s value dropped to the $94k level. A Closer Examination Of Liquidation Issues Approximately $24 million in bullish wagers on Dogecoin were liquidated in the past 24 hours, while $5.93 million in losses were attributed to short positions. The market’s present extreme volatility is underscored by this wave of liquidations. Dogecoin is currently approaching critical support levels, as noted by analysts. Some analysts have speculated that it could fall below $0.20 if adverse momentum persists. Key support levels for DOGE are being closely monitored by market analysts. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Dogecoin may be oversold, which could indicate a potential rebound if traders are able to effectively defend the critical price zones. Related Reading: Solana Poised For Growth In 2025 With Record $173 Million Q3 Funding—Report The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the present challenges, market watchers’ future expectations of Dogecoin remain high. Some analysts believe that DOGE’s capacity to maintain a weekly closing above $0.26 will help to create a recovery rally toward higher goals. Still, the reality of continuous market pressures and unpredictability helps to temper this hope. As they negotiate this stormy terrain, many traders are left wondering how low Dogecoin might fall before it finds solid ground. Given the expected significant price swings in the next days and weeks, all eyes will be on this famous meme coin as it tries to recuperate in the face of a difficult crypto climate.

37899693,https://crypto.news/?p=14321085,1734735545,Michael Saylor is willing to advise Trump on the crypto policy,"MicroStrategy Inc. co-founder and executive Chairman Michael Saylor says he is willing to advise Trump on cryptocurrency policy when the crypto advisory council is set. During the Dec. 18 episode of the Open Interest show on Bloomberg Television, Saylor voiced his willingness to provide his advice on the digital assets policy to President-elect Donald Trump, either publicly or confidently, if he is asked to do so. Before expressing his willingness to advise Trump on the crypto policy, Saylor admitted that he had already met “with a lot of people” in the incoming administration but declined to specify the personalities nor mentioned if he already met Trump. Is Saylor fit for a position? Since the 2020s, Michael Saylor has been one of the key Bitcoin advocates and investors. Saylor is one who puts money where his mouth is, as he personally spent around one billion dollars on BTC. In 2020, Saylor took to X (Twitter at the time) to announce that he personally owns 17,732 bitcoins and that he acquired these coins before MicroStrategy (MSTR) made the first massive purchase of bitcoins. YahooFinance! reports that currently MicroStrategy owns around 440,000 BTC, which is close to a 2% share of the entire BTC supply. MicroStrategy made headlines on the eve of the latest BTC price peak when the company was included in the Nasdaq 100 index. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge Michael Saylor names Bitcoin an apex property of the human race and has an insatiable thirst for bitcoins. He compares Bitcoin to the territories like Manhattan or Alaska that were bought by the early colonist administration, specifying that Bitcoin is rather a kind of cyberspace. That’s why MicroStrategy aims to own bitcoins in bulk. According to Saylor, buying as much of this “space” as possible is crucial for the United States. This vision speaks to the statement posted by Donald Trump on the Truth Social platform. “We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!” the post reads . Saylor singled out Trump as the most crypto-friendly Republican politician. It seems that Saylor shares the President-elect’s views on Bitcoin. Although not an outright GOP supporter, in September, Saylor made claims that he sees Republicans as a more progressive party when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. He names regulation pressure decrease, treating crypto as a tool to boost the U.S. economy, and encouraging individuals to pursue their economic aims using digital finance as progressive characteristics of the Republican approach to the crypto industry. What Do We Know About the Crypto Advisory Council? Trump proposed the creation of a crypto advisory council during his now famous speech at the Nashville cryptocurrency conference in July 2024. As of December, not much information about the preparations of this council has been made public. The participating companies’ lineup is not clear yet. However, it has been reported that such brands as Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Paradigm, and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) are seeking interactions with the incoming administration. Allegedly, an a16z rep was involved in advising the Trump team during the presidential campaign. On December 6, Trump introduced entrepreneur and venture capitalist David O. Sacks as the “White House A.I. and Crypto Czar” via the Truth Social post. It’s worth saying that, to say the least, before 2024, Trump wasn’t an avid crypto enthusiast. In the past , the President-elect made a series of anti-crypto remarks, calling Bitcoin “not money” and saying that the value of cryptocurrencies is based on thin air. However, the 2024 Presidential campaign saw a drastic change in Trump’s stance on crypto. He started to take donations in digital currencies, visited a major crypto conference in Nashville where he promised to make America “a crypto capital of the world,” and made several important proposals concerning the cryptocurrency policy. On top of tax cuts for the U.S. cryptocurrency companies, the removal of Gary Gensler from the SEC, and the creation of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, Trump announced the creation of the advisory body with the leading position granted to the richest man on Earth and his passionate supporter Elon Musk. This unofficial agency is called The Department of Government Efficiency, or simply DOGE, a reference to a legendary memecoin, a notorious soft place of a Tesla CEO .

37899791,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631276,1734735524,Ripple donates $5 million in XRP to President Trump’s inauguration,"Ripple just dropped $5 million in XRP into President Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. The Trump-Vance inaugural committee reportedly confirmed it, and it’s the largest crypto contribution they got. The fund, which has already hit over $200 million, will fuel a three-day bash celebrating Trump’s win and VP-elect JD Vance. Coinbase and Kraken each pledged $1 million, while MoonPay chipped in too, though they haven’t shared how much. Ondo Finance has dropped $1 million. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said: “For the first time, we have a President who truly understands the potential of disruptive technology and embraces the crypto sector. We’re excited to continue to work with President-Elect Trump and his administration to push for long-overdue regulatory clarity and unlock this next wave of innovation.” Setting new records The inaugural committee has already smashed fundraising records. They’ve blown past the $107 million raised for Trump’s first inauguration in 2017 and Biden’s $62 million in 2021. Insiders say the total could hit $225 million by Inauguration Day. Major names in tech and crypto, like Jesse Powell from Kraken and Marc Andreessen from Andreessen Horowitz, are also on board. They see Trump as a leader who understands blockchain’s potential and are betting he’ll make policies that encourage innovation. The president has already proven that he meant everything he said during his campaign. The Trump administration is stacked. Former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, known for being an early Bitcoin believer, will take over from Gary Gensler as SEC Chair. He is expected to ease up on crypto regulations. David Sacks is also joining as the first crypto and AI czar. He’ll work on bridging the gap between regulators and the crypto industry while leading the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology. Other pro-crypto picks include Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary and Howard Lutnick as Commerce Secretary, both strong supporters of blockchain. Ripple’s moment and XRP’s rise This spotlight on Ripple brings XRP (XRP) back into focus. The token has had a strong year after its legal battle with the SEC ended in a win. A court ruled that XRP isn’t a security, restoring confidence in the token and pushing its price higher. As of press time, it is the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trading at about $2.30—up nearly 500% since the legal win. Analysts are watching resistance at $2.58, with targets of $2.92 and $4.50, while support levels sit at $2.35 and $1.96. Ripple also just launched RLUSD, its dollar-pegged stablecoin, on December 16. Approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services, it’s available on both Ethereum and the XRP Ledger.

The company announced this in a December 20 post on X, adding that the repayment will be made from exercising its 12th series stock acquisition rights. Details of the 5th Series Ordinary Bonds In a separate post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the money accrued from the offering will be used to push forward the buying of BTC initially planned for 2025 to before the end of 2024. “These funds will accelerate Bitcoin purchases originally planned for 2025 into the current year.” The bond issuance consists of ¥5 billion in total, divided into units of ¥250 million each. The offering will carry no interest and be redeemed at face value, with each bond worth 100 yen per 100 yen principal amount. The scheduled issuance date is December 20, 2024, with the maturity date set for June 16, 2025. The entire security will be allocated to EVO FUND, a private investment entity, and will be subject to redemption provisions. Further, the bonds can be redeemed early if EVO FUND gives written notice at least one business day in advance or if funds from the exercise of the Tokyo-listed firm’s 12th series stock acquisition rights reach a specified threshold. This development follows Metaplanet’s announcement on December 17, 2024, of a separate ¥4.5 billion ($28.7 million) bond issuance that will also mature on June 16, 2025. It means that in just a few days, the company has raised a total of ¥9.5 billion, or about $60.6 million. Bitcoin-Centred Approach Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-centred approach aligns with its strategic focus on adopting the asset as a hedge against economic instability. In June 2024, it acquired 23.351 BTC for approximately $1.6 million, followed by 42.4 BTC for $2.4 million, bringing its total holdings to 203.7 BTC. The company continued to increase its holdings, purchasing 57.273 BTC for $3.4 million and 106.976 BTC worth $6.6 million in October. Additionally, it made a significant purchase of 156.7 BTC in October, valued at $10.4 million. In addition to its buying strategy, the Japanese investment firm recently established a new Bitcoin treasury operations business line. This division will focus on purchasing, holding, and managing the cryptocurrency through various financial instruments, including loans, equity issuances, and convertible bonds. According to BitcoinTreasuries data, as of December 20, 2024, the outfit holds 1,142 BTC, valued at approximately $109.6 million. Its stock has also seen remarkable growth, with shares trading at ¥3,575, reflecting a 58.05% increase in the past month and a 2,134.38% rise year-to-date, based on data from Google Finance.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) says it’s suing the three banking giants and Zelle’s parent firm for allegedly failing to protect people from widespread fraud on the popular payments network. The lawsuit, which has been anticipated for months, alleges hundreds of thousands of the banks’ customers filed fraud complaints and were largely denied assistance, with some being told to contact the fraudsters directly to get their money back. “Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo also allegedly failed to properly investigate complaints or provide consumers with legally required reimbursement for fraud and errors. The CFPB is seeking to stop the alleged unlawful practices, secure redress and penalties, and obtain other relief.” The CFPB alleges widespread consumer losses and security failures on the part of the banks, stating the lenders limited identity verification measures, allowed repeat offenders to hop between banks, ignored red flag warnings from customers and abandoned customers after fraud occurred. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra says the banks, which co-own Zelle, rushed to launch the platform without properly addressing security concerns. “The nation’s largest banks felt threatened by competing payment apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle. By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fend for themselves.” Zelle says it’s fully prepared to defend itself in court. “The CFPB’s attacks on Zelle are legally and factually flawed, and the timing of this lawsuit appears to be driven by political factors unrelated to Zelle. Zelle leads the fight against scams and fraud and has industry-leading reimbursement policies that go above and beyond the law.” JPMorgan Chase has previously said it may sue the CFPB over the Zelle investigation, stating the agency is going “above and beyond what the law requires.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This development is significant considering current market dynamics with massive price decline in the last 48 hours. Despite the rapid price decrease, investors have remained unwilling to sell. Low Bitcoin Liquidity and Rising Demand Hints at Looming Storm According to CryptoQuant , an on-chain analysis firm, the cumulative volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, referred to as sell-side liquidity inventory, is low. Based on the figures, the current sell-side liquidity inventory is at a level last seen in October 2020. Data from CryptoQuant reveals that only 3.397 million BTCs are available for sale across different platforms. These include exchanges, miners, OTC desks, and GBTC. In 2024 alone, sell-side liquidity has dropped by 678,000 BTC. The shrinking supply will impact possible selling pressure and create a tighter market demand. This could lead to a price rally if it continues as demand surges. Will Accumulator Trigger Supply Shock? Meanwhile, Bitcoin demand has grown steadily since late September. Figures show Bitcoin has been growing at 228,000 BTC per month. Additionally, accumulator addresses- wallets that consistently buy Bitcoin but have never sold- are also strengthening their holdings. These addresses have increased their monthly accumulation to a record level of 495,000 BTC. Notably, accumulators are reckoned with in Bitcoin as they contribute to the liquidity crunch. This is because they lock BTC away from circulation. Market observers say their activities contributed to the recent all-time high (ATH) of $108,000 BTC attained this December. Market Chaos and the Path Forward On December 20, 2024, massive liquidation hit the crypto market as over $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin price plunged to a low of $92,281, leaving many investors concerned about the next price trajectory of the asset. The market soon rebounded as BTC resumed its climb and found support at the $95,000 level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $97,028. Market volume remains up by 8.09% at $116.76 billion. Analysts say this hints at the confidence among some investors who might be buying the dip , anticipating that the coin could reclaim its position above the $100,000 level .

Powered by blockchain and AI, this innovative low cap altcoin aims to transform property investment while offering substantial returns. With projections of significant growth by Q2 2025, the anticipation is growing. But what sets this altcoin apart, and why do the Solana expert believe it could deliver exceptional ROI? Let’s find out the key factors driving the excitement. Why Solana Expert Sets His Sight on this Low Cap Altcoin A Solana expert who turned an initial investment into millions during Solana’s rise from $0.50 to nearly $260 now sees similar potential in a low cap altcoin. Driven by high-speed transactions and low fees, Solana’s success has established itself as a blockchain powerhouse for decentralized apps and has become a benchmark. This expert predicts a new altcoin will deliver exceptional ROI by Q2 2025, driven by Solana’s market growth and trends now evident with this low cap altcoin. The focus is identifying transformative opportunities that mirror Solana’s exponential growth and real-world impact on the cryptocurrency market. PropiChain is Transforming Real Estate with Outstanding Blockchain Investment Features PropiChain is an RWA altcoin reshaping the real estate investment landscape by combining blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and the Metaverse to create a revolutionary platform for buying, selling, and managing property. Its unique features set it apart from traditional property investment methods, and it has started to generate significant attention in the industry. Real estate tokenization is one of the key innovations of this low cap altcoin. This process enables investors to buy digital tokens representing fractional real estate asset ownership. For instance, an investor with as little as $500 can own a share of a high-value property, earning rental income relative to their investment. This makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience, from small individual investors to seasoned professionals looking to expand their portfolios. Another standout feature is PropiChain altcoin AI-powered predictive analytics tools. These tools provide users real-time data on market trends, property values, rental yields, and occupancy rates. For example, an investor considering a luxury rental property can access detailed insights about its financial performance, helping them make well-informed decisions. This AI-driven approach reduces the risks traditionally associated with property investments and maximizes potential returns. This altcoin also integrates Metaverse technology, allowing users to take virtual tours of properties from anywhere in the world. This feature adds convenience and opens up new investment opportunities by allowing investors to explore properties remotely. Smart contracts are central to this altcoin’s operations, automating key processes like rental payments and fund distribution. This eliminates the need for middlemen, streamlines transactions, and reduces administrative costs. This low cap altcoin blockchain ensures security and transparency in every transaction, preventing fraud and title disputes. With these innovative features, this low cap altcoin addresses the challenges of the real estate market while creating new opportunities for global investors. The Future of Real Estate Investment: A High-ROI Opportunity in a Low Cap Altcoin As Solana traders and crypto enthusiasts shift their attention to this low cap altcoin, PropiChain’s potential for massive growth becomes undeniable. With a projected 50,000% ROI by Q2 2025, altcoin is carving its path in property investment. Its innovative features stand apart from speculative altcoins. Having raised over $1 million in presale, PropiChain is poised for success, with tokens currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2. With a BlockAudit security audit ensuring the altcoin’s safety and a CoinMarketCap listing on the horizon, confidence in PropiChain continues to build. Early investment in this low cap altcoin could prove highly rewarding, particularly for those securing tokens at presale prices. For example, an investment of $800 at the presale price of $0.011 could acquire approximately 72,727 tokens. With projections of 50,000% growth, this investment could see a return of over $400,000 by Q2 2025. Now is the time to copy the Solana expert. Early adopters can gain a significant advantage as PropiChain moves closer to its full launch. Join a community of forward-thinking investors and secure your place in the future of blockchain-powered real estate investment.

37898214,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631265,1734731725,EU Commission approves Nvidia’s Run:ai acquisition,"The European Commission has unconditionally approved Nvidia’s $700 million bid for Israeli startup Run:ai, a deal that was under scrutiny over competition concerns. This comes after the case had been referred to the Commission by an Italian competition authority in September asking if the proposed acquisition would not result in competition concerns in the European Economic Area (EEA). EU gave thumps up to the Nvidia transaction After some rigorous screening, the EU said it approved the proposed acquisition of the Israeli startup saying it did so unconditionally, adding the transaction would raise no competition concerns in the EEA. According to a Reuters article , the EU’s probe into the deal focused on activities that could strengthen Nvidia’s control over GPUs, sought-after chips that could divide and process computer tasks. The EU, however, concluded that the deal would not raise any such concerns in the EEA. Nvidia designs and supplies GPUs for data center applications, while the Israeli startup – Run:ai is a supplier of GPU orchestration software that enables corporate clients to manage their compute infrastructure. “Since Nvidia is a leading producer of key hardware for AI applications used in the EU and beyond, it was important to carefully check whether its acquisition of start-up software company Run:ai may have negatively impacted competition in critical markets which are key for future competitiveness,” said Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for clean, just and competitive transition at the European Commission, in a statement. “But our market investigation confirmed to us that other software options compatible with Nvidia’s hardware will remain available in the market.” Ribera. The statement also emphasized that the two companies’ areas of activity do not overlap, while the EU Commission on the other hand has the authority to oversee mergers and acquisitions of large multinational corporations operating in the EU countries. The EU has scrutinized other big techs apart from Nvidia Nvidia announced the acquisition of the Israeli startup in April in a deal worth $700 million, a price tag that was to be reviewed by the bloc following requests by Italian regulators under the EU Merger Regulation (EUMR). When announcing its plans, Nvidia said the deal would help customers make more efficient use of their computing resources. “Run:ai enables enterprise customers to manage and optimize their compute infrastructure, whether on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments,” Nvidia said in an April 24 blog post. Run:ai co-founder and CEO Omri Geller revealed the startup has collaborated with Nvidia since 2020, adding that both companies “share a passion for helping our customers make the most of their infrastructure.” However, regarding the proposed acquisition, the EU Commission revealed in October that Nvidia would need to get approvals and antitrust clearance for the transaction due to the raised concerns that the deal would undermine competition within the sectors in which the two companies operate. Responding to the EU’s concerns then, Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo said back then that the company was willing to provide any information to regulators regarding the deal. “After the acquisition closes, we’ll continue to make AI available in every cloud and enterprise, and help customers select any system and software solution that works best for them.” Nvidia. These developments also come as the big tech industry has for years enjoyed minimal oversight on the takeover of smaller rival firms prompting regulators to pay more attention to these to ensure fair competition. Firms like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have also been scrutinized over their investments in AI startups or other tech firms as they expand their AI operations and stay ahead of peers. The EU has probed the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI as well as others like Google and Samsung.

Early investors could see pennies transform into millions – so don’t miss your shot at crypto glory! Pepe Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes over the past six months, rising by 67.15%. In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion While PEPE and DOGE are notable, XYZ unites sports fans and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and positioning itself as the next G.O.A.T of memecoins.

Bulls Are Betting Big on BTFD Coin for Their Next Big Win—Act Now!,"Did you hear about Peanut the Squirrel? This quirky meme coin, inspired by a viral internet sensation, captured the hearts of the crypto world earlier this year. The PNUT token skyrocketed in popularity, leaving many to wonder how they missed the chance to join the hype. It was a perfect storm of social media buzz and a heartfelt backstory that drove the coin’s value to dizzying heights. But crypto is never just about looking back—it’s about finding the next big opportunity. Enter BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s currently turning heads with its presale momentum and massive ROI potential. If you’ve been waiting for a chance to own the dip and ride a new wave, BTFD is your golden ticket. It’s not just another meme coin; it’s a movement, and it’s already being hailed as one of the best new meme coins to buy this week . With over $4.2 million raised, more than 6,100 holders, and a growing community of Bulls backing it, BTFD is stealing the spotlight. Let’s dive into why this coin is quickly becoming the talk of 2024 and why you don’t want to let it fly under your radar like Peanut the Squirrel did. BTFD Coin: Owning the Dip, Leading the Charge BTFD Coin is rewriting the script on what a successful meme coin launch looks like. Currently priced at just $0.00013 in its 12th presale stage, it’s the perfect entry point for investors who know the value of getting in early. The presale has already sold over 57 billion tokens, and with a listing price set at $0.0006, early investors could see a 4.6x return once the coin hits the market. Let’s break it down: investing $2,000 today would net you 15.38 million tokens. At the listing price, your investment would soar to $9,228. That’s the kind of ROI potential that’s earning BTFD its spot among the best new meme coins to buy this week. It’s an opportunity to join a presale while the price is still low, avoiding the regret of watching yet another coin take off without you. What sets BTFD apart is its vibrant Bulls Squad community.

This isn’t just a group of investors—it’s a movement of like-minded individuals rallying around a shared mission to capitalise on market dips and push the coin forward. Joining BTFD isn’t just about owning tokens; it’s about becoming part of something bigger. BTFD’s appeal doesn’t stop with its community. The coin’s developers are building for the long term, and one of the most exciting features on the horizon is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. Currently in beta, the game adds real utility to the token, attracting gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Although rewards aren’t live yet, the beta launch showcases the team’s commitment to innovation and growth. BTFD isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s creating its own path. With additional benefits like 90% APY staking rewards, BTFD offers multiple avenues for investors to grow their holdings. It’s a coin designed to reward those who believe in its vision, making it one of the best new meme coins to buy this week. Peanut the Squirrel: The Viral Meme Coin Peanut the Squirrel, or PNUT, is a meme coin born from one of the internet’s most heartwarming stories. Peanut was a rescued squirrel who gained fame for his adorable tricks and tiny hats, thanks to viral posts by his caretaker, Mark Longo. The story captured global attention, and in November 2024, the PNUT token was launched as a tribute to this beloved squirrel. The coin’s release was perfectly timed, coinciding with widespread social media outrage and public endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. These factors combined to create a viral sensation, driving PNUT’s value to skyrocket within days. It was a whirlwind rise that left latecomers watching from the sidelines as early investors cashed in on the hype. While Peanut the Squirrel offered a fun and profitable ride for those who got in early, its moment has passed, and the crypto market is moving forward. The lesson is clear: timing is everything. If you missed PNUT, now’s your chance to focus on BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s combining buzz with real potential and long-term value. Don’t Let Another Opportunity Pass You By Peanut the Squirrel was a viral sensation that brought joy and profits to the crypto community, but its moment has come and gone.

This will be done through its subsidiary, Hexarq, after receiving regulatory approval from the country’s financial markets watchdog, the AMF. The services are expected to launch in 2025. Source: amf-france.org France’s Groupe BPCE Prepares Crypto Integration Across Its Products by 2025 Hexarq has received PSAN (Prestataire de Services sur Actifs Numériques) authorization from the AMF. This allows Hexarq to offer services such as crypto custody and legally buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies against the euro in France. The PSAN framework oversees digital asset service providers in France. With this approval , BPCE’s subsidiary is the fourth crypto business to gain AMF’s CASP authorization. Société Générale’s crypto subsidiary, Forge, received approval first in 2023, followed by Deblock SAS and GOin SAS in 2023 and 2022, respectively. BPCE, one of Europe’s top ten largest banks, is preparing to offer cryptocurrency services to its vast customer base. Hexarq plans to integrate its crypto services into BPCE’s two primary banking networks, Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne, by 2025. Hexarq, launched in January 2021, focuses on digital asset services, including cryptocurrencies and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Following the AMF’s approval, the crypto platform will expand its offerings and use BPCE’s broad banking infrastructure. BPCE’s entry into the cryptocurrency market is significant, as the group manages assets worth approximately €1.3 trillion (around $1.3 trillion), with a customer base exceeding 35 million. Hexarq will roll out these services through a dedicated app, which will be integrated into BPCE’s Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne networks. France Leads EU Crypto Regulation Ahead of MiCA’s Full Rollout If all goes according to plan, BPCE’s cryptocurrency services will be integrated into its existing networks, allowing millions of bank clients seamless access to digital assets. Despite this major step, BPCE declined to provide additional details on the exact timeline or the specific services to be launched in 2025. France has taken a leading role in Europe’s crypto regulation, becoming the first major EU economy to open crypto asset service provider license applications under the MiCA regulation . The AMF has been actively working to regulate the crypto space in France, having started accepting CASP applications in August 2024. This move is made before fully enforcing the European Union’s MiCA regulations, which will take effect on December 30. In the meantime, the French crypto market is experiencing continued regulatory developments. Some exchanges, like Bybit, are preparing to halt operations in France by January 2025. In addition, a major crypto exchange, Gemini, recently announced its expansion into France last month after securing a VASP (Virtual Asset Service Provider) registration, further solidifying France’s growing importance as a hub for crypto operations within Europe.

37897460,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631260,1734730539,"Scaramucci defends MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin spending, says there is nothing for investors to fear","Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, thinks people are blowing things way out of proportion when it comes to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying spree. Critics say CEO Michael Saylor has gone too far by taking on billions in debt to buy Bitcoin. Scaramucci says those critics don’t understand the company’s balance sheet or Saylor’s strategy. In his own words: “People think if Bitcoin crashes, he’s going to implode. But you’d need a full-blown Bitcoin collapse lasting six or seven years to really hurt him. His debt is structured long-term, and it’s not rolling over any time soon.” MicroStrategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin obsession MicroStrategy has transformed itself from a dull software company into Wall Street’s top Bitcoin proxy. Its stock has skyrocketed over 400% this year, fueled by Saylor’s unapologetic strategy of using convertible debt to load up on Bitcoin. As of press time, the company has $7.2 billion in outstanding convertible debt, including $6 billion raised this year alone. It’s bold, risky, and completely unprecedented. Some investors are sweating bullets, thinking MicroStrategy might be forced to sell its Bitcoin stash if prices fall sharply. Such a sell-off could flood the market with tokens and drive Bitcoin’s price even lower. But Scaramucci doesn’t buy into the doomsday scenarios. “The narrative of him being forced to sell hundreds of thousands of tokens into the market—it’s a forced narrative,” he said. Scaramucci, who has spent 35 years on Wall Street, claims he knows what implodes companies. He compared Saylor’s debt strategy to Lehman Brothers’ downfall and said there’s no similarity. MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds have become a favorite for arbitrage traders, who exploit the volatility of Bitcoin’s underlying value. Meanwhile, SkyBridge’s own ETF, the First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF lists MicroStrategy as one of its top holdings. “Saylor’s got this figured out,” Scaramucci said. “He’s issuing debt and equity to create a positive flywheel. This isn’t some reckless gamble; it’s a calculated move.” Bitcoin’s wild ride after Trump’s election win Bitcoin’s price action has been a rollercoaster lately. After smashing past $108,000 earlier this week on the back of the Trump rally, it dropped below $93,000 before clawing back to around $97,000 as of press time. Much of the recent volatility stems from the Federal Reserve. Investors are spooked after the Fed said it will scale back interest rate cuts next year. That’s hit equity markets, and the chaos has trickled into crypto. Still, Bitcoin’s performance this year has been nothing short of insane. The price has more than doubled, fueled by many big catalysts. But as we know, the rally always cools eventually. And Scaramucci isn’t blind to the risks. “Could we see a 30% or 40% correction in Bitcoin next year? Sure,” he said. “It could drop to $60,000 or $70,000, no problem.” But he doesn’t see Bitcoin going below $50,000 anytime soon, especially with favorable legislation on the horizon and more institutional money coming into the market. Scaramucci even threw out a wild number. “Could Bitcoin’s market cap hit $18 trillion? I think it could. It’s not going to be a straight line, but it’s absolutely possible,” he said. For context, Bitcoin’s market cap currently sits at $1.9 trillion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dip has dragged down other cryptocurrencies. Ether fell 9%, and XRP dropped 10% in the last 24 hours. Even Tesla, another major post-election winner, saw its stock slide. Same thing with Nvidia, the AI darling.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. SUI and Dogecoin holders invest in a DeFi coin that’s getting popular faster than expected. Table of Contents SUI’s price soars as more people borrow money to trade Dogecoin exits the overbought territory DTX Exchange: The leader of the next DeFi rally Joining the DTX presale Over the past few months, SUI has established itself as a great DeFi coin. However, there’s a new project that can take its title, offering a promising DeFi coin with massive utility. This new altcoin is gaining popularity pretty quickly, as its presale funding has crossed the $10 million milestone. Moreover, crypto watchers suggest the new DeFi coin’s huge potential can also outdo Dogecoin (DOGE) soon. SUI’s price soars as more people borrow money to trade SUI is doing well right now. This isn’t just regarding its price movements; the project has seen a huge increase in usage. That’s because more and more people are using SUI to borrow money for trading. Because of this, SUI’s TVL reached $1.8 billion. This also drove SUI’s price to rise above $4.70. With that in mind, experts say SUI will surge in the next DeFi rally. They see its price increasing by two to three times in a few months. Dogecoin exits the overbought territory Dogecoin did well after the US elections, with its price increasing by over 120%. However, after a while, DOGE’s price dipped. This was an expected move, as Dogecoin investors took profits after the rally. There was also a market-wide dip that pushed DOGE’s price further down. However, Dogecoin is recovering now. Its technical indicators show that it is no longer overbought. This means that investors are now more inclined to buy DOGE again. Experts say that this will push DOGE’s price up. They see the price increasing by at least 100% next year. They say DOGE’s price won’t rise by a lot because DeFi coin projects will take center stage. Regardless, they still see Dogecoin as a good investment for the next DeFi rally. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP DTX Exchange: The leader of the next DeFi rally DTX Exchange is a new trading platform that will launch soon. As such, it has massive room for growth. However, being new isn’t the only thing driving DTX Exchange’s growth potential. The DTX Exchange will offer great perks for traders. One of them is lightning-fast transaction speed. Solana offers 600 TPS. On the other hand, DTX Exchange aims to offer 100,000 TPS. This will allow its users to get great entries/exits and make a lot of profits while trading. Moreover, this potential DeFi rally leader will make trading much easier. It will allow users to trade crypto and many other financial assets all from one place. Users will also be able to manage all their assets from one dashboard. This will be possible through DTX Exchange’s Phoenix Wallet. Notably, DTX Exchange will let users trade with 1,000x leverage, helping them turn small trades into massive profits. The users will also get zero commissions, boosting profits even further. Another feature that makes DTX Exchange stand out is its fair launch. Most DeFi coin launches are usually supported by whales and VCs. This gives them the power to manipulate the price as they please. As a result, smaller investors can suffer. That’s not the case with DTX Exchange. This next DeFi rally leader isn’t backed by VCs or whales. It also has an incremental price model. This model makes sure that prices rise steadily, allowing everyone to have an equal opportunity to invest in DTX and make profits. Thus, it’s no surprise that experts see DTX Exchange as the next DeFi rally leader. Joining the DTX presale The DTX public presale is currently in full swing. So far, it has raised over $10.2 million. This shows the massive interest that investors have in this new DeFi coin. Also, over 300,000 wallet addresses have registered for the presale. This shows that DTX holders are diversified and not bundled into a few large ones. Investors can buy DTX tokens for $0.12 each in Stage 6 of its public presale. As the presale continues, DTX will increase in price. Once it reaches $0.20, DTX will officially launch on major exchanges.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-solana-memecoin-will-surge-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37897141,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665740,1734730212,How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before It Rebounds? Expert Forecasts,"Over the past 12 days, Dogecoin (DOGE) has endured a sharp decline, shedding more than 40% of its value. After trading above $0.48 on December 8, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency briefly sank to $0.2638 by December 20, prompting a wave of speculation about its near-term direction. The backdrop to this drawdown has been the broader crypto market’s response to US Federal Reserve policy signals, with the latest downturn largely attributed to more hawkish projections from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). While the Fed’s December meeting delivered a widely expected 25 basis point rate cut, the real shock came from the revised dot plot, which pointed to fewer future cuts than previously anticipated. The market had hoped for three rate cuts in 2025, but the FOMC’s guidance now leans toward just two, suggesting a more cautious approach amid persistent inflationary pressures. This shift in outlook triggered broad-based selling in risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $93,000, and altcoins -20% drawdowns. Within 24 hours, a staggering $1.17 billion in long positions were liquidated across the crypto markets. How Low Can Dogecoin Go? A number of prominent analysts have weighed in on DOGE’s retreat, framing it within the context of historical patterns and macro-level drivers. Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlights the significance of previous cycles. He notes that, historically, Dogecoin has experienced multiple significant corrections en route to its cycle tops, stating that the current pullback—similar to past 50% drawdowns—could be part of a normal bull market structure rather than a sign of systemic weakness. Related Reading: Dogecoin Trading Volume Rises Over $6.5 Billion As Liquidations Cross $31 Million, What’s Going On? According to Kevin, “In the previous cycle Dogecoin had three separate 50% corrections on the way to its cycle top. If we tap macro structured support and the macro golden pocket right below that would be roughly a 45% correction from the high which based off historical analyses would be just enough for us to resume uptrend. If we lose $0.26 cents on a weekly close then I would start to seriously worry about this market structure but until then this should be treated as a normal bull market pullback.” Kevin also underscores Bitcoin’s influence over the altcoin landscape. Instead of focusing solely on DOGE’s standalone chart, he encourages traders to “not be hyper focused on altcoin charts” to gauge the market’s macro direction. BTC remains the pivotal asset whose price action often dictates sentiment across the broader crypto space. Kevin illustrated this point by sharing a BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap, suggesting the market may seek to flush out lower liquidity pockets before any meaningful rebound. “Let’s go snag all that liquidity at $95K-90K and then we can start talking about a bounce. Until then no reason to over analyze. From a fundamental standpoint the market is overreacting to what Powell is saying and not actually listening to him. Just because rate cut projections,” he writes. Related Reading: Ex-Hedge Fund Guru Bets Big On Dogecoin As ‘Core Crypto Bet’ Balo (@btcbalo), another crypto analyst, reinforces the importance of the $0.26 level. He points out that Dogecoin “still has a few days to save the weekly,” indicating that a weekly close above this threshold would maintain a structurally sound market framework. A successful defense of the $0.26 zone could set the stage for a renewed uptrend, potentially targeting a return to $0.42—what Balo views as a critical pivot point. Reclaiming $0.42 would, in his words, allow DOGE to “teleport” toward the $4 mark, a scenario he associates with a full-scale bull run recovery. A third analyst, CEO (@Investments_CEO), brings a historical perspective, suggesting that DOGE’s current pattern aligns with its multi-year cyclical nature. “DOGE appears to be aligning with its typical 3-4 year cycle. Zoom out,” he states. The analyst refers to DOGE’s price action following its previous cycle fractal. Back in 2021, Dogecoin experienced its first major run-up approaching its all-time high (ATH). After a 50% correction, DOGE resumed its rally, broke through the ATH, and then entered price discovery. As mentioned earlier, this scenario could align with the $0.26 price target. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.26919.

37897284,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-liquid-staking-startup-trial,1734730200,Solana liquid staking startup Sanctum trials ‘creator coins’,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Sanctum, the Solana startup focused on growing the network’s liquid staking ecosystem, launched a new primitive today called creator coins. Creator coins are essentially Solana liquid staking tokens that Sanctum issues while giving the yield to creators. Fans can earn loyalty points for holding creator coins, and creators can use those points to dole out perks. It’s a new spin on an old concept in crypto, but Sanctum thinks launching with more crypto-native creators can help it pick up adoption where others have failed. Sanctum is a newer startup that came up through the Solana Foundation’s startup incubator this spring and promised to create an “infinite LST future” on Solana. Its initial flagship product was called INF — a token that helps provide liquidity to a pool of Solana LSTs. It then carried out a much-hyped airdrop focused on “earnestness” that ignited some controversy over the summer . Since then, Sanctum has been a bit quieter, most notably launching LSTs with Asia-based crypto exchanges including Binance in the early fall. Creator coins are a concept Sanctum has seemingly toyed with for a while as well — co-founder FP Lee created the fpSOL liquid staking token as a “personal LST” experiment in May. Creator coin holders forgo their SOL staking yield to support creators. Sanctum takes a small cut of this as well, Sanctum’s anonymous co-founder J told me. Sanctum’s Solana staking APY is around 10% on average, J added. In exchange, users earn “seeds,” which are loyalty points that can track fans’ investment and let creators offer loyalty perks. When I asked why creator coins couldn’t just pass along some staking yield to users while charging a commission for the creators, J said giving creators all the rewards “makes economic sense for now,” but this could be changed in the future. One obvious target audience for creator coins is celebrities who — like the “Hawk Tuah” girl — seem to keep launching volatile memecoins that end in lawsuits or reputational damage. Creator coins may come with less immediate upside, but they also come with less risk. Still, Sanctum isn’t the first to try luring creators with crypto-based loyalty programs. Jack Harlow joined a loyalty platform named MITH last year, for instance, but other creators appear to be somewhat slow to adopt the platform, which hasn’t posted on X since May. As a response to this, Sanctum is limiting creator coins to just crypto creators for now. “A lot of previous attempts often failed because there’s a certain disconnect between the creator and their supporters,” J said. “This is why we didn’t necessarily want to get the biggest creators for the beta launch. We wanted Solana folks who were really dialed in and connected to their fanbase.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Catzilla’s presale success positions it as the next Shiba Inu. Table of Contents Catzilla: Redefining meme coins Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Conclusion The explosive presale of Catzilla Coin (CATZILLA) has captivated the cryptocurrency community, smashing expectations and sparking waves of investor enthusiasm. This meteoric rise has ignited whispers of Catzilla potentially becoming the next Shiba Inu (SHIB) — a token that once transformed from a meme into a household name in crypto. Catzilla: Redefining meme coins Catzilla bursts onto the DeFi scene as a bold new contender, taking a stand against shady practices and bringing financial opportunities back into the hands of the community. With transformation at its core, Catzilla seeks to unite investors, meme enthusiasts, and crypto pioneers under one vision: a brighter, fairer financial future. While many meme coins fizzle out after their initial hype, Catzilla is built for sustainable growth. Its structured presale, beginning at $0.0002 and climbing to $0.0016 across 14 progressive stages, offers savvy early adopters an 88% discount on CATZILLA tokens. This isn’t just a quick trend — it’s a carefully crafted path to long-term value. Catzilla isn’t just another meme coin — it’s an ecosystem with practical applications that set it apart: Governance: Have a say in the future of Catzilla by participating in community-led decisions. Incentives: Get rewarded for support and contributions to the ecosystem. Staking: Lock in CATZILLA to earn potential passive income while strengthening the network. Interested investors can secure CATZILLA tokens via the presale. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with growing utility Shiba Inu is a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin but operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it began with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. This action increased SHIB’s visibility. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s Ethereum integration allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. This suggests potential for broader utility. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem may make it an attractive option for those interested in meme coins with utility. Conclusion As 2024’s bull market heats up, Catzilla Coin positions itself as a compelling frontrunner in the meme coin revolution. Offering a meticulously structured presale with potential 700% returns, alongside governance, incentives, and staking utilities, Catzilla is more than a token — it’s a vision for a fairer and more innovative crypto future. Whether an investor chasing the next big opportunity or a believer in community-driven projects, Catzilla aims to create a movement to redefine what meme coins can achieve.

Qubetics spearheads blockchain interoperability with its Web3-aggregated chain, TRON is poised for a potential rebound after a recent pullback, and Render navigates a path forward following a significant price drop. These projects highlight why they are some of the most intriguing cryptocurrencies to watch now. Qubetics: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Interoperability The blockchain ecosystem faces significant challenges in interoperability, with most networks operating in isolation. Qubetics addresses this gap by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain, enabling seamless data exchange, asset transfers, and cross-chain functionality. By unifying disparate networks, Qubetics enhances collaboration across ecosystems, unlocking the full potential of decentralised applications for developers, enterprises, and users. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 13, offering significant investment potential: Token Price: $0.034 Post-Presale Target: $0.25 per token Analyst Predictions: A potential value of $10 to $15 post-mainnet launch ROI Potential: Up to 29,106.88% for current-stage investors Qubetics is positioning itself as a critical enabler of decentralised technology adoption by providing a cohesive framework for blockchain networks. Its strategic approach to interoperability and growth-oriented presale structure makes it a compelling option for investors seeking long-term opportunities. TRON: Momentum and Potential for 30% Gains TRON (TRX) has experienced notable price fluctuations recently, with a slight 6% pullback over the past week. Despite this, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated impressive growth, surging over 30% in the past month and 120% in six months. Currently priced between $0.24 and $0.33, TRX is nearing oversold territory, as indicated by a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43. Key levels for TRON include: Resistance: $0.37 (nearest) and $0.45 (secondary) Support: $0.19 If bullish momentum returns, TRX could break past the $0.37 resistance and aim for $0.45, representing a potential gain of over 30%. Traders closely monitor these levels as TRON’s price action is influenced by broader market trends and investor sentiment. With a history of strong recoveries, TRON continues to be a project worth watching for its resilience and growth potential. Render: Struggles Amid Market Sell-Off Render (RNDR) has faced significant challenges following a broader market sell-off triggered by Bitcoin’s decline below the psychological $100,000 mark. This event led to panic among investors and heavy selling pressure, causing Render to lose a critical support level that had sustained its previous uptrend. Current market conditions reflect investor indecision, with Render showing signs of being oversold. Despite this, the token has struggled to regain its trendline support, highlighting its challenges in re-establishing a clear recovery path. Render’s price action will likely depend on broader market stabilisation and renewed investor confidence in its long-term utility. Conclusion Qubetics, TRON, and Render illustrate the diverse opportunities and challenges in the cryptocurrency market. Qubetics stands out by focusing on solving interoperability issues and promising presale potential, offering significant ROI for early investors. TRON’s momentum and potential 30% gains make it a compelling option for traders looking to capitalise on market movements. Meanwhile, Render’s struggles reflect broader market uncertainties, but its position as an oversold asset may present opportunities for value-driven investors. These projects provide a snapshot of the innovation, resilience, and volatility that define the crypto space, making them some of the best cryptocurrencies to explore now. Whether you’re seeking transformative technology, short-term gains, or recovery plays, these cryptocurrencies offer a range of opportunities to consider.

Floki Inu (FLOKI) is also making waves, aiming for a significant price jump that has investors buzzing. Meanwhile, DOGEN is stunning the crypto space by achieving an impressive $4 million presale milestone. The stage is set for major market action, leaving traders eager for what’s next. DOGEN: The meme token for alphas who always win Luxury cars, fat stacks of cash, and a lifestyle that turns heads everywhere. That’s the DOGEN dream — where winners thrive. DOGEN is calling upon those who are always leveling up. This isn’t just another meme token; it’s the currency of real alphas who know how to win. DOGEN is primed for growth, with projections of a 700% surge even before the presale ends. The project is also poised for the thousand-fold gains that meme tokens are crushing this season. As the new alpha on Solana, DOGEN is joining the ranks of giants like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which hit 1000% gains. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s destined to shatter records in the upcoming bull run. For those feeling the DOGEN spirit, it’s time to flex.

Interested investors can join the DOGEN pack via presale. Ethereum potential rally to $4,317 Ethereum’s price is on the move. Currently trading between $3,648 and $4,137, it is heading towards the resistance level at $4,317. If it breaks through, it could reach $4,806, which would be an increase of about 34%. Over the past month, Ethereum’s price has risen by 10.71%, with the short-term moving average currently below the long-term average. This suggests a possible rally for Ethereum, in line with a broader crypto bull run. FLOKI nears oversold zone FLOKI has been trading between $0.000151 and $0.000255, showing a notable dip of nearly 30% over the past month. The Relative Strength Index is around 30, indicating the coin is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator is also low, suggesting potential undervaluation. Currently near its support level, a bounce could propel FLOKI towards the resistance at about $0.000318, offering considerable upside. The short-term moving average is below the long-term average, reflecting recent downtrend patterns. However, with a positive performance over the last six months and growing optimism for an altcoin surge, FLOKI might be poised for a strong rebound in the upcoming period. Conclusion ETH shows steady progress but offers limited short-term gains. FLOKI could see notable movement with its targeted surge. DOGEN stands out as the star, crafted for those who demand success and luxury. With an anticipated 700% growth by presale’s end and potential for massive returns, DOGEN aims to dominate, following the footsteps of prior breakout tokens.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Catslap prepares for $1M token burn today, boosting price and excitement around slap-to-earn and Zealy quests. Table of Contents $1 million Catslap token burn and its impact Engagement soars through slap-to-earn and Zealy quests Catslap’s community and influencer backing What’s next for Catslap? The buzz surrounding Catslap (SLAP) continues to grow as the team gears up for the next big event in the project’s history: a $1 million token burn scheduled for today. This strategic move aims to bolster the token’s price as the community continues to engage in the innovative Slap-to-Earn and Zealy quests airdrop campaigns. Catslap’s team announced this monumental token burn via a post on X yesterday, solidifying their commitment to driving value for SLAP holders. They also revealed the end date for the first slap-to-earn season, which will draw to a close on January 10th next year. The top 10 slappers will earn a slice of a $100k USDT prize pool, which has prompted a new flurry of slapping activity. $1 million Catslap token burn and its impact So far, 140 million SLAP tokens, valued at $456,500, have been removed from circulation based on the burn dashboard . After today’s additional $1 million burn, the total burn amount will be close to $1.5 million, significantly reducing token supply and setting the stage for a potential price rally. Adding to this effort is Catslap’s ongoing buyback program, which executes token buybacks every 20 minutes. To date, the program has removed 124 million SLAP tokens from circulation. The combined effect of the token burn and buybacks caused a 7.5% uptick in the SLAP price yesterday defying the current market trend. However, the price has dropped slightly again alongside other top cryptos. This is on-trend for both the market conditions and token burns which often have a more long-term price impact. Normally, it takes a while for the true effect of the new scarcity to be felt, and we could see a strong SLAP price rally in the coming weeks after the broader market readjusts. Engagement soars through slap-to-earn and Zealy quests Catslap’s community engagement has been a key driver of its success. The slap-to-earn season 1 campaign, set to end on January 10, 2025, has attracted headline-worthy levels of participation. The Slapometer has recorded a staggering 1.239 billion slaps, thanks to a combination of on-site slapping activities and the Zealy Community Slapdrop Campaign. Participants in the Slapdrop campaign can climb leaderboards for a chance to win a share of the $100,000 prize pool. Beyond the top 10 leaderboard positions, all eligible participants will receive SLAP tokens based on their ranking. https://twitter.com/CatSlapToken/status/1869700705097060665 The Zealy leaderboard alone has over 500 community members taking part. The integration of on-site slapping with Zealy’s quest-tracking platform introduces a unique XP-to-SLAP exchange rate: 1 XP earned on Zealy equates to 1,000 slaps on the website. To participate, users must first hold SLAP tokens and complete the “Best Wallet Address” quest on Zealy. Then, there’s a range of quests available to earn thousands of slaps and boost your placement on the leaderboard. Verification processes for wallet addresses submitted through Zealy may take some time, as announced in a Telegram update.

The coin has surged 90.62% over the last month and is currently trading between $0.88 and $1.30. It’s hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages at $1.15, indicating consolidation. The RSI at 45.10 and Stochastic at 50.64 suggest neutral momentum, while a positive MACD hints at potential upward movement. If ENA breaks the nearest resistance at $1.55, it could rally toward the second resistance at $1.97, offering substantial gains. With the global crypto bull run on the horizon, Ethena could be set for significant growth. Worldcoin Worldcoin is trading between $1.96 and $3.13, showing signs of a potential comeback. Despite a recent dip of 31.61% over the past week, the coin’s RSI at 40.82 suggests it’s nearing oversold territory — an opportunity for buyers. The nearest resistance level is at $4.40. Breaking through could see WLD climbing to $5.67, offering potential gains of up to 89%. With the altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run expected, Worldcoin might be poised for significant growth. Its proximity to the 10-day SMA of $2.41 indicates consolidation before a possible breakout. Moreover, the Stochastic at 77.23 hints at bullish momentum building up.

Despite a slight dip of 24.48% this week, FTM currently trades between $0.87 and $1.45, eyeing the nearest resistance at $1.75. Breaking this level could push it toward the next target of $2.20, offering significant upside potential. The Relative Strength Index sits at 42.34, indicating room for growth before overbought conditions. As the crypto market gears up for an altcoin season and a global bull run, Fantom might be ready to surge to new heights, presenting exciting opportunities for investors. Algorand Algorand has surged over 40% in the past month and more than 160% in the last six months. Despite a recent weekly dip of around 25%, the coin is trading within a favorable range. The nearest resistance is at $0.57, and breaking this level could push the price toward the next resistance at $0.71. The Relative Strength Index is near neutral at 44.66, suggesting room for upward movement. With the 10-day Simple Moving Average at $0.37 and the 100-day at $0.41, Algorand shows strong potential to climb higher during the anticipated altcoin season. Conclusion While Ethereum’s anticipated breakout may serve as the catalyst for an altcoin rally, it’s the diversity and potential of the highlighted cryptocurrencies that stand out. From the imaginative storytelling and robust community of Catzilla to the calculated momentum of coins like ENA, WLD, FTM, and ALGO, investors have a range of promising options. Among these options, Catzilla emerges as a unique contender, combining entertainment and equity to reshape the meme coin space.

37896437,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631244,1734728152,MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor releases crypto framework to guide US president Trump,"Michael Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, just put out a framework directed squarely at helping Trump’s administration figure out its crypto policies. According to Saylor, it is: “A strategic digital asset policy that can strengthen the US dollar, neutralize the national debt, and position America as the global leader in the 21st-century digital economy—empowering millions of businesses, driving growth, and creating trillions in value.” What’s in the framework? Saylor’s framework starts by breaking down digital assets into six crystal-clear categories based on how they work, what they’re for, and what backs them up. Bitcoin? That’s a “digital commodity”—no issuer, no middleman, just pure decentralized power. Then you’ve got digital securities (think stocks and bonds), digital currencies tied to fiat money, digital tokens for utility in ecosystems, digital NFTs for unique ownership of stuff like art, and digital ABTs, which are backed by physical things like gold or oil. The framework also lays out the rights and responsibilities of everyone in the digital economy—issuers, exchanges, and asset owners. He’s calling for a global, real-time system for creating, trading, and owning digital assets. Here’s how it works: issuers are responsible for fair disclosures and ethical behavior while keeping the right to create new digital assets. Exchanges get the green light to trade and transfer assets but have to stay transparent, protect clients’ funds, and avoid shady conflicts of interest. Owners? They get to self-custody and trade their assets but need to follow local laws. This means civil and criminal accountability is baked right in, so everyone knows the rules—and the consequences. Saylor’s third big move? Making regulations practical. He also wants the industry itself to lead compliance. Exchanges would handle collecting and publishing data, taking the pressure off overloaded regulators. Plus, he’s all about cost caps: compliance costs shouldn’t top 1% of assets under management, and yearly upkeep shouldn’t go over 0.1%. He’s even proposing streamlined issuance processes where regulators back off and let exchanges take the wheel. A digital capital revolution? Saylor’s also talking about issuers creating digital assets in days, not months, slashing costs from tens of millions to just tens of thousands. This could open up capital markets to everyone—from small businesses and artists to mid-sized companies that never had a shot. Tokenized assets could cover everything from commodities and real estate to art and intellectual property, giving investors a ton of new ways to make money. Saylor’s betting this approach could unlock trillions of dollars in value, leveling the playing field and making finance way more inclusive. Saylor ties it all back to the U.S. leading the crypto game, just the way Trump wants. He sees the U.S. dollar becoming the dominant global reserve digital currency, with the market jumping from $25 billion to $10 trillion. That kind of growth could pump demand for U.S. Treasuries, boosting the country’s financial clout. He’s also got big plans for global digital capital markets, projecting growth from $2 trillion to $280 trillion—with U.S. investors snagging most of the pie. Beyond Bitcoin, Saylor’s saying digital assets could hit $590 trillion, with America calling the shots. His pitch includes a strategic Bitcoin reserve that could rake in $81 trillion for the U.S. Treasury, enough to wipe out the national debt. Saylor’s role in Trump’s crypto master plan In a recent interview, Saylor had said he was down to advise Trump’s team on digital asset policy, whether in private or on a formal advisory council. He’s already had talks with some members of Trump’s incoming administration, fueling rumors of a crypto advisory council in the works. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy isn’t slowing down. On Dec. 15, they bought 15,350 Bitcoin at $100,386 per coin, dropping $1.5 billion. That brings their total stash to 439,000 BTC, now worth $45.6 billion. They’re funding these buys through their ATM share sale program, which still has $7.65 billion left to spend. Trump’s team is doubling down on crypto, too. They’re looking at a strategic Bitcoin reserve modeled after the national oil reserve, and Ripple, Kraken, and Circle are all vying for advisory roles. Trump’s also making big hires: Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto ex-SEC commissioner, is set to lead the SEC, signaling a break from Gary Gensler’s stricter stance. David Sacks, PayPal co-founder and Silicon Valley giant, is stepping in as the White House AI and cryptocurrency czar. He’ll draft legal frameworks and head up the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto strategist DonAlt tells his 637,200 followers on the social media platform X that even though memecoin dogwifhat ( WIF ) could bounce soon against DOGE, it’s ultimately going to zero against it. “Told everyone who wanted to hear that this was the ‘safest’ trade to take if you wanted to be hedged. Think that’s not the case anymore, think short-term WIF could bounce against DOGE. Generally think WIF is going to zero against DOGE though so relief would be temporary in my opinion.” Source: DonAlt/X According to DonAlt’s chart, WIF/DOGE should careen all the way down to zero dollars sometime during the second half of 2025. DOGE is trading for $0.309 at time of writing, a 10% drop in the day while WIF is valued at $1.98, a 12% dip during the last 24 hours. Moving on to smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ), DonAlt says that if the top altcoin fails to hold the $2,900 price point as support, then investors have been tricked by the “worst cycle” ever. “Didn’t think it would still come but here we are, looks decent around $2,900 in my opinion. We start losing that and we all got bamboozled and this is the worst cycle in crypto history.” Source: DonAlt/X Ethereum is trading for $3,339 at time of writing, a 5.6% decrease on the day.

The three tokens have extended their gains in the past hour. Amidst Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) crash under the $100,000 mark and market-wide correction in altcoins, these tokens hold on to their recent gains. An analysis of technical indicators shows it is likely that Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), Bitget token ( BGB ) and Movement ( MOVE ) extend their rally. Table of Contents Bitcoin decline does not fade these altcoin gains HYPE, BGB and MOVE post double-digit rallies Derivatives traders make moves in the altcoins Strategic considerations Bitcoin decline does not fade these altcoin gains Bitcoin slipped to a low of $92,232 on Friday after a steep correction from its $100,000 milestone. Bitcoin’s decline led to a market-wide correction in altcoins across categories on Thursday and Friday. Even as the crypto market endured a bloodbath, Hyperliquid, Bitget token, and Movement held on to their gains over the past seven days. Bitcoin’s decline is likely short-lived, and on-chain metrics paint a bullish picture for BTC. BTC is likely entering the latter stages of its bull run; some on-chain indicators point to a cooling or slight overheating, with most metrics signalling a significant upside in 2025. The $100,000 milestone has emerged as a key resistance level for Bitcoin, and the cycle top is likely to emerge between $150,000 and $200,000. HYPE, BGB and MOVE post double-digit rallies HYPE hovers around $30 at the time of writing. The decentralized layer-1 blockchain specializes in trading and has amassed $2.191 billion in total value of locked assets, according to DeFiLlama data. HYPE is currently 45% below its all-time high at $42.252. If the Layer 1 token enters price discovery, it could rally towards $60.491, the 161.8% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the December 10 low to the December 12 peak, as seen in the 4-hour price chart. The Relative strength index reads 62 and is sloping upwards. The moving average convergence divergence, a key momentum indicator, flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line. However, traders need to keep their eyes peeled as the MACD line prepares to cross above the signal line. This move could signal a shift in underlying momentum from negative to positive. HYPE/USDT 4-hour price chart | Source: Crypto.news HYPE could find support in the Fair value gap between $20.250 and $20.600. Bitget token (BGB) competes with exchange tokens like OKB of OKX and BNB of Binance. The token surged to an all-time high of $4.90 on Thursday, marking an increase of over 520% in the past 12 months. In December, BGB climbed from $1.50 to its current high, indicating a monthly gain exceeding 100%. BGB’s technical indicators remain bullish, however traders need to be cautious before adding to their positions in BGB since RSI is above 70 and shows that the token is overvalued. BGB/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news If there is a correction, BGB could find support in the zone between $3.1370 and $3.4125, an FVG on the daily price chart. Movement (MOVE) is the native token of the Layer 2 network built on Ethereum to boost scalability and introduce advanced features for users. MOVE gained nearly 25% in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data. The MOVE/USDT 4-hour price chart on Binance shows two key zones for MOVE: the resistance between $0.8891 and $0.9038 and the support zone between $0.6509 and $0.6836. Technical indicators on MOVE’s price chart support the thesis for further gains in the Layer 2 token. MOVE hit its all-time high on December 10, following its listing on Binance, at $1.4100. Since then, MOVE corrected and started its recovery on Wednesday.

The token is gaining relevance among market participants after adding to its value in the past week. Open interest in Hyperliquid exceeds $42 million. Interestingly, the BGB token seems to have lost its relevance among traders, and OI is down 33.38%, down to $46.85 million. The long/short ratio is 0.8258, under 1, meaning there are more short positions than long, and traders are likely bearish on the token. Derivatives traders are bullish on MOVE, and there is an excess of long positions since the long/short ratio exceeds 1 on Binance and OKX. The OI climbed 18% and exceeds $101 million, according to Coinglass data.

Recent gains in tokens like HYPE, MOVE and BGB could be erased in the event of a flash crash or market-wide bloodbath, as the one noted on Wednesday and Thursday this week. Bitcoin is back above $97,000 on Friday, and a return above the $100,000 mark could support extended price rallies in altcoins. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Offering a 42% APY staking rewards and priced at $0.0003651, Wall Street Pepe appeals to traders seeking tactical, short-term gains.

Pepeto stands out: Uniting hype, story, and utility Pepeto brings a unique blend of storytelling and cutting-edge utility to the table, setting it apart from its competitors. Currently priced at $0.000000098 during its presale phase, Pepeto offers a significant opportunity for early investors.

The intrigue doesn’t stop there — rumors suggest that a former team member of Pepe, instrumental in its early success, is now behind Pepeto.

Chainalysis further noted the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea’s (DPRK) crypto attacks are “becoming more frequent” as the country is “getting better and faster at massive exploits.” “Notably, attacks between $50 and $100 million, and those above $100 million occurred far more frequently in 2024 than they did in 2023,” the report states.“ This starkly contrasts with the previous two years, during which exploits often yielded profits below $50 million. Chainalysis also notes increased hacks linked to North Korean IT workers who have been “infiltrating crypto and Web3 companies, and compromising their networks, operations, and integrity.” Tactics used by crypto fraudsters to obtain pertinent hacking information include assuming false identities, manipulating remote working access, and operating as third-party hiring intermediaries. However, data points to a significant drop in the authoritarian state’s hacking activity following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s meeting with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un at a summit in June. The report suggests that North Korea may have altered its cyber criminality strategy as it increased cooperability with Russia and redirected military sources to the war in Ukraine. North Korea Crypto Hackers Pose Threat To Blockchain Sector News of the latest data from Chainalysis just a week after the U.S. Department of Justice indicted 14 North Korean individuals working in the IT sector for running a years-long IT fraud scheme that violated U.S. sanctions. According to a December 12 press release , the indicted individuals utilized fake identities in order to commit wire fraud and money laundering as part of a scheme to siphon funds back to North Korea. With the Kim Jong Un-led country’s crypto attacks on the rise, Chainalysis is imploring companies in the blockchain sector to collaborate with U.S. officials in hopes of preventing devastating hacks. “By fostering stronger partnerships with law enforcement and equipping teams with the resources and expertise to respond rapidly, the crypto industry can reinforce its defenses against theft,” the report concludes. “Such efforts are not only critical for protecting individual assets, but also for building long-term trust and stability in the digital ecosystem.” The post North Korean Hackers Stole $1.3 Billion In Crypto, Chainalysis Report Finds appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | SPONSORED,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/north-korean-hackers-stole-1-3-billion-in-crypto-chainalysis-report-finds/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37898493.jpeg

37895960,https://crypto.news/?p=14321149,1734727743,Why crypto market’s dip isn’t the end of the bull market — According to experts,"Are the recent liquidations and falling prices setting the stage for a longer crypto winter, or could this be the breather before another bull run? Table of Contents Crypto market stumbles as year-end draws near Fed’s interest rate moves spark volatility Traditional market volatility drags crypto lower Expert takes: Is this a bull market breather? Crypto market stumbles as year-end draws near As the year winds down, the crypto market seems to be taking a pause after a prolonged bullish run, with the global market cap shedding more than 6% to settle around $3.47 trillion as of Dec. 20. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has slipped below the crucial $100,000 mark, trading at $96,680 as of this writing — a drop of nearly 3.5% in the past 24 hours. BTC 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Ethereum ( ETH ), the second-largest crypto by market cap, has experienced an even sharper decline, tumbling 6% over the same period and accumulating weekly losses of 15%, leaving it at $3,400 levels. The decline hasn’t spared the rest of the market either. Top 100 altcoins recorded losses ranging between 10% and 20%, while meme coins — known for their wild price swings — were hit the hardest, with an average sector-wide decline of 12%. Dogecoin ( DOGE ), for instance, plunged over 12% to $0.31, and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) fell nearly 10% to $0.0000211. Other popular meme tokens like Floki ( FLOKI ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Pepe ( PEPE ) followed suit, with their weekly losses spiralling between 35% and 40%. Adding to the chaos, the futures market revealed staggering liquidation figures. Over 374,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, totalling $1.37 billion, according to Coinglass. Of these liquidations, $1.13 billion came from long positions, a clear sign of overly optimistic bets gone wrong. Bitcoin alone accounted for $320 million in liquidations, mostly from long positions, while Ethereum saw $308 million wiped out, with $263 million tied to longs. 24-hour liquidation heat map | Source: CoinGlass A closer look at open interest — the total value of outstanding futures contracts — suggests that the market may be entering a bearish phase. Bitcoin’s open interest had climbed steadily over the past few months, rising from $32 billion in early October to $68 billion by Dec. 18. However, this has now dropped to $62 billion as of Dec. 20, coinciding with the sharp price decline. BTC 3-month open interest chart | Source: CoinGlass Typically, when both open interest and prices fall, it signals bearish momentum, as it reflects traders closing positions and reducing exposure during market uncertainty. Fed’s interest rate moves spark volatility The sharp correction in the crypto market can be attributed largely to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision and its accompanying commentary. On Dec. 18, the Fed announced its third interest rate cut of the year, reducing the federal funds rate by 0.25% to 4.5%. While this move was widely anticipated and brought the cumulative reduction for the year to 1%, the central bank’s messaging carried a more cautious tone. Fed officials cleared that only two additional cuts are planned for 2025, and any further adjustments will depend on inflation trends and overall economic conditions. The Fed’s measured approach reflects its ongoing struggle to control inflation, which is expected to stay above its 2% target until at least 2026. The announcement sent shockwaves through financial markets, particularly risk-sensitive assets like crypto and stocks. U.S. equity markets reacted sharply, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 both tumbling over 2%. At the same time, bond yields surged as investors sought the safety of treasuries. The 10-year yield climbed to 4.557%, while the 30-year yield hit 4.7%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index spiked to a two-year high, further tightening financial conditions and adding pressure to global markets, including crypto. Bitcoin’s climb above $100,000 earlier this month was undeniably a milestone, and Ethereum’s rally past $3,500 similarly ignited widespread optimism. However, such euphoric sentiment often prompts traders to lock in profits, especially when markets exhibit sharp corrections following extended rallies, as risk appetite wanes and traders adjust their positions. This time was no different. As investors shifted toward safer options like treasuries and cash, crypto faced a dual blow of reduced demand and panic-induced selling. The sell-off quickly escalated, triggering widespread liquidations as leveraged positions were forcefully unwound in futures markets. The cascading effect of these events drove prices sharply lower, plunging the crypto market firmly into correction territory. Traditional market volatility drags crypto lower The recent turmoil in traditional financial markets is spilling into the crypto space, with Bitcoin feeling the brunt of macroeconomic pressures that have left investors scrambling. A closer look at the situation through the lens of Kobeissi Letter’s analysis sheds light on how rising volatility, changing market correlations, and the broader macroeconomic conditions are shaping the current narrative for Bitcoin and crypto assets. The Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the “fear gauge” for traditional markets, has surged nearly 100% this week, suggesting heightened uncertainty. History will be made today: As the Nasdaq is down over -6% from its high in just 5 days, there are a MASSIVE amount of options expiring today. In fact, a record $6.6 TRILLION worth of options are expiring, based on notional value. What does this mean exactly? (a thread) — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 20, 2024 This surge coincides with the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance, which, while cutting rates on Dec. 18, suggested a slower pace of cuts ahead, rattling risk assets, including Bitcoin, as higher-for-longer rates have made safe-haven investments like U.S. Treasury bonds increasingly attractive. The 10-year Treasury yield has now climbed to 4.5%, with fears of a rise toward the 5% level, a threshold that previously triggered corrections in both equities and crypto markets. Diving deeper, Bitcoin’s performance can often be understood in relation to its correlation with traditional financial indices. Earlier this year, Bitcoin shared a strong positive correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 — peaking at 0.9 and 0.86, respectively, in June. This meant Bitcoin largely moved in tandem with tech stocks, benefiting from the same risk-on sentiment. BTC 1-year correlation chart with Nasdaq and S&P 500 | Source: The Block However, in mid-July, this correlation flipped to -0.87 and -0.86, signaling a rare divergence where Bitcoin briefly acted as a hedge during equity market weakness. More recently, as of Dec. 19, these correlations have softened to 0.57 for the Nasdaq and 0.38 for the S&P 500. While Bitcoin still reacts to macroeconomic shifts, its price movements have started to reflect unique pressures, such as spot ETF inflows and outflows and other crypto-related developments in the U.S. In the short term, Bitcoin faces a series of hurdles. Rising Treasury yields are diverting institutional capital toward safer assets, while equities are struggling to find support amid heightened volatility. However, the softening correlation between Bitcoin and traditional indices suggests that the crypto market is not entirely beholden to broader market trends. This decoupling, if it continues, could allow Bitcoin to carve out a more independent narrative, but only if it can withstand the current macroeconomic storm. Expert takes: Is this a bull market breather? Experts remain divided on Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory, but there’s a common thought: this correction, while unsettling, may not signal the end of the bull market. Lark Davis draws on historical parallels to provide perspective. “In December 2020, Bitcoin dropped 12% after a massive rally, only to surge 136% within the next 23 days.” He points out that the current 13% dip follows a similarly strong Q4 performance. If you're worried that this is the end of the bull market, know this: In December 2020, $BTC dumped 12%, after witnessing a 77% rally in October-November. It then went from $17,000 to $41,000 (a 136% move) in the next 23 days. Something similar is happening right now, with… pic.twitter.com/lFPSy3JjTt — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) December 20, 2024 While Davis warns that a further correction of 10-15% remains possible, he underscores that “there’s plenty of fuel left in the tank” for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Adding to this perspective, Rekt Capital says that corrections during price discovery phases are both common and necessary. “Price discovery corrections tend to last a few weeks, and there are usually up to four in a bull market cycle.” #BTC Price Discovery Corrections tend to occur between Week 6 and Week 8 They tend to last a few weeks Also, there tend to be up to 4 Price Discovery Corrections at most until a Bull Market ends This is first Price Discovery Correction in this cycle Which means it is an… — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) December 20, 2024 According to Rekt Capital, this is the first such correction in the current cycle, making it “an optimal re-accumulation opportunity with a high probability of price reversal to the upside.” Michaël van de Poppe takes a slightly different angle, focusing on the potential for consolidation. He notes that Bitcoin’s dip below $102K triggered a sharp decline in altcoins, but such volatility is expected in a high-growth market. Period of calm for #Bitcoin . Dropped beneath $102K and resulted into a flash crash on #Altcoins . These are opportunities and those drops will continue to happen. However, from here on, I expect that Bitcoin will consolidate and altcoins are having their next run. pic.twitter.com/x7sEP1mEn4 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 20, 2024 “These are opportunities, and those drops will continue to happen,” he says. From here, he anticipates Bitcoin consolidating while altcoins potentially see another rally. Beyond these short-term assessments, macro developments signal longer-term opportunities. Bitcoin Magazine reported that Groupe BPCE, a major French bank with 35 million users and $1.5 trillion in assets, has received approval to launch Bitcoin and crypto investment services. https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1870128654170169575 The steady integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial ecosystems, coupled with its increasing accessibility to retail investors, could act as a counterweight to current market fears. However, risks remain. Elevated Treasury yields, macroeconomic uncertainty, and rising volatility in traditional markets continue to pose challenges. Traders and investors should exercise caution, as further volatility can result in more dips. Trade wisely and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

On Dec. 18, Storm filed a motion in a Manhattan district court, citing a recent Fifth Circuit Appeals Court opinion. The court ruled that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had exceeded its authority in sanctioning Tornado Cash’s smart contracts, rendering the charges against him “fatally and legally flawed.” Storm’s motion argued that this ruling significantly impacts his charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). He highlighted that the smart contracts, as per the appeals court, “are not the ‘property’ of a foreign national or entity” and therefore “cannot be blocked” under the law. The Fifth Circuit stated that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are immutable and accessible to anyone, including sanctioned entities like North Korean hackers. The court added, “Mr. Storm could no more choose to stop them than he could choose to stop the sun from rising.” In his motion, Storm pointed out that the district court had previously avoided ruling on the immutability of Tornado Cash’s smart contracts. However, the appeals court’s decision “resolved the issue as a matter of law,” leaving no grounds for a jury to deliberate. Storm is also charged with operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiring to commit money laundering. He contended that Tornado Cash “is not a financial institution” and that the protocol became immutable in May 2020, predating the alleged conspiracy. The Fifth Circuit’s ruling stemmed from a case initiated by Tornado Cash users with support from Coinbase in September 2022. While the users initially lost, they appealed and secured a victory in November 2023. Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov were charged in August 2023 for allegedly laundering over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash, including funds linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

Its operations rely on developers like Panev to create malware and affiliates to execute attacks. In February, authorities in the U.S. and U.K. disrupted LockBit’s infrastructure, seizing websites, servers, and decryption keys, which significantly hampered the group’s activities. Despite these efforts, LockBit remains active, with Panev’s arrest marking the latest step in ongoing prosecution efforts. LockBit’s alleged leader, Dmitry Khoroshev, remains at large. The U.S. government has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture.

Dogecoin: From Internet Meme to Top Cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), launched in 2013 by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, began as a playful alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring the Shiba Inu meme as its emblem. Designed for abundance, Dogecoin has no maximum supply and introduces 10,000 new coins every minute. Despite its origins, Dogecoin surged in value during 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization exceeding $50 billion, influenced by social media and prominent figures like Elon Musk. The coin's strong community and widespread recognition have kept it in the spotlight. As the crypto market evolves, Dogecoin's potential lies in its community-driven approach and adaptability, making it a notable contender in the current market cycle. Conclusion Coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE have less potential in the short term. Catzilla is the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all.

Despite recent dips of 25% over the past week and 19% this month, signs point to a potential upswing. The RSI is at 39.70, hinting at oversold conditions ripe for a rebound. The stochastic indicator is above 70, suggesting growing momentum. If CWIF breaks the first resistance, it could climb to the next level at $0.00000053, marking a substantial percentage gain.

The Relative Strength Index is at 31.29, indicating oversold conditions, which may lead to an upward move. If CHILLGUY breaks the nearest resistance at $0.56, it could rally towards the next level at $0.76. This would mean a significant increase from current prices. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run on the horizon, CHILLGUY might be set for impressive gains.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is just under 40, indicating neutral to slightly oversold conditions. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is slightly below $7.70, which is under the 100-day average of $8.50, suggesting short-term bearish trends.

Following the collapse of the HAWK token, a memecoin linked to her internet fame. As the dust settles from the coin’s abrupt failure in early December, Welch has pledged her full cooperation with legal efforts. However, her involvement in the token has raised questions about celebrity influence and the risks tied to unregulated digital assets. The Rise and Fall of HAWK Coin HAWK, a memecoin launched on the Solana blockchain, was initially celebrated as a promising digital asset. Backed by Welch’s online persona, the coin gained momentum quickly, with influencers and fans driving its initial hype. However, the excitement was short-lived. HAWK plummeted within days of its launch in early December, leaving many investors holding significant losses. The collapse raised suspicions of foul play. Many suggested that some insiders had pocketed large sums at the expense of everyday investors. As the coin’s value crashed, speculation grew that HAWK was simply a pump-and-dump scheme . The Legal Fallout In the aftermath, a lawsuit was filed by Burwick Law, representing investors who lost money in the token. The legal action claimed securities violations. The creators of the HAWK coin were accused of wrongly using Welch’s influence to promote an unregistered investment. The lawsuit claimed that Welch’s celebrity status was exploited to deceive investors. It alleged that the creators used her large following to promote the coin. However, they failed to disclose the risks involved. In partnership with Wolf Popper, Burwick Law has taken a strong stance, aiming to hold those responsible for the loss of funds accountable. The law firm said the case shows how institutional greed can exploit celebrities and their followers. This leaves regular people vulnerable to the risks of the crypto market. Welch’s Response and Commitment to Transparency In response to the controversy, Welch issued a public statement on X. She expressed her commitment to cooperating fully with legal teams representing the affected investors. She acknowledged the seriousness of the situation, promising to help uncover the truth behind the HAWK token’s collapse. Welch has emphasized her role as a figurehead for the project rather than the mastermind behind its design or execution. According to reports, she was compensated with a fixed fee for lending her name and likeness to the token, with no guaranteed earnings beyond that. While not directly involved in the mismanagement, her connection to the token has made her a key figure in the controversy. This has brought legal and ethical scrutiny her way. The HAWK token saga highlights the risks of celebrities promoting crypto assets . This is particularly unsafe when they lack the regulatory oversight that traditional investments are subjected to.

37895771,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631224,1734726631,‘Hawk Tuah’ girl Hailey Welch wouldn’t go to prison for meme coin scam,"You threw your hard-earned money at a coin named Hawk Tuah . Let’s call it what it is: a disaster entirely of your own making. The crypto market thrives on chaos, but this? This was 100% predictable. Hailey Welch, the “Hawk Tuah” girl, turned a viral internet moment into a disastrous HAWK token launch, leaving investors crying foul and millions of dollars lost. But did anyone honestly think it would end differently? There is absolutely nothing about this girl that tells you she knows anything about crypto, or even cares. She is not even a real celebrity for God’s sakes, she is a meme! A sexually inappropriate one at that. What exactly were you investing in? Where was the vision? The mission? The whitepaper? That should’ve been a Gofundme. You were donating to charity. As an X user puts it : “I really don’t see the problem here. You traded United States dollars for hawk tuah coin. She got your a** fair and square.” The most unserious scam of all time It all happened in a flash. In the middle of the year one day, a random street interview launched her into meme stardom. A catchphrase, some viral traction, and suddenly Hailey was the face of internet culture. On December 4, Hailey dropped $HAWK on the Solana blockchain, and it was an instant spectacle. The memecoin shot to a market cap of $500 million within minutes. Investors who jumped in were feeling good—until they weren’t. Just as quickly, HAWK plummeted 88%, bottoming out at $60 million in under 20 minutes. Lawsuits, blame games, and accusations of a “rug pull” followed. Yet Hailey is still denying she sold even a single token. Hailey went live a few days after the scam, claiming innocence and blaming the crash on “market manipulation by insiders.” That didn’t stop investors from lawyering up. By December 19, a class-action lawsuit hit the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Investors accused them of fraud, insider trading, and pumping an unregistered “security.” Hailey’s defense should be: If you bought Hawk Tuah, that’s on you “If you buy a ‘hawk tuah’ coin, you deserve to lose your money,” said someone on X, and honestly, that about sums it up for this whole thing. Hailey’s saying she had nothing to do with $HAWK’s inner workings. She claimed her involvement was purely promotional. According to her, insiders like Doc Hollywood handled all the technical decisions. She is leaning hard into her victim narrative, which is pretty smart. “I didn’t know,” she said. “I just wanted to create something fun. I’m here to help.” And get this, the lawsuits don’t even accuse her directly of doing anything. Hailey, as a person, is not actually in danger of going to prison. Unless someone can get their hands on proof she planned this all along. Or if the investors luck out with a jury in America that could look at that face, look at those facts, and throw that girl behind bars. Good luck with that. Crypto law is murky, and HAWK sits squarely in the gray zone. Plaintiffs are pushing for a jury trial, but Hailey’s team could file for summary judgment to end the case early. If granted, she’d escape the courtroom unscathed. This is not an SBF situation. She wasn’t a trusted crypto elite that spent years building trust, only to steal from people. She’s just a silly girl who made a 3 seconds video saying “My HAWK meme coin is live!” That’s all. No one forced you to immediately start giving her millions of dollars. The investors suing this girl should definitely feel a little ashamed.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-hailey-welch-can-escape-legal-heat-for-hawk-tuah-meme-coin-scam/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37895771.jpeg

Litecoin (LTC): Faster Transactions with Enhanced Privacy Litecoin (LTC), created in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, is a cryptocurrency designed to offer faster and more scalable transactions than Bitcoin. It uses the Scrypt hashing algorithm, which allows for quicker block generation times of 2.5 minutes and aims to prevent mining centralization. With a larger supply of 84 million coins, Litecoin is suitable for everyday transactions and micropayments. In May 2022, it introduced the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB) upgrade, enhancing privacy and scalability. Litecoin's focus on speed, lower fees, and continuous improvements gives it a unique position in the digital finance landscape. These features may make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. PENGU Coin: A New Meme Cryptocurrency with Community Potential PENGU Coin is a new cryptocurrency inspired by penguins, following the meme coin trend seen with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. It aims to build a strong community around its token, leveraging social media engagement to grow its user base. The coin operates on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and security in transactions. In the current market cycle, where meme coins can gain popularity rapidly, PENGU Coin may attract investors looking for the next trending asset. Its focus on simplicity and community involvement makes it stand out. With enough support and adoption, PENGU Coin has the potential to grow within the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion LTC and PENGU show limited short-term potential, but Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, and with triple utility in governance, incentives, and staking, Catzilla unites enthusiasts to challenge toxic systems and reach new heights.

37895471,https://blockworks.co/news/2025-crypto-stocks-to-watch,1734726600,Crypto stocks to watch in 2025,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . When examining crypto stocks, chatting with a co-portfolio manager of the long-running blockchain-focused Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) makes for a good convo. Dan Weiskopf told me he’s more optimistic about 2025 now than he was about this year at the end of 2023. A main reason? The “crazy opportunity” for BLOK investors that’s set to come as more pure-play crypto companies go public. Some expect stablecoin issuer Circle could be among the next to do so. Weiskopf also has his eye on Figure Technologies . While a few more bitcoin miners could also go public, that’s a crowded field, Weiskopf noted. But BLOK would consider holding cloud-computing firm CoreWeave — one of mining giant Core Scientific’s largest clients . Speaking of Core Scientific, that stock — up ~320% year to date — is BLOK’s No. 1 holding (4.67%). Another interesting miner to Weiskopf is Hut 8 — the ETF’s sixth-largest holding, at 4.16%. “I think we did a really good job repositioning and recalibrating amongst the miners in capturing the diversification into the AI side of things,” the PM said. Hut 8 is weighted slightly above MicroStrategy — a stock set to enter the Nasdaq 100 index next week (I’ll write more about that on Monday). BLOK started buying MSTR in August 2020 (when it was $14), Weiskopf and co-PM Mike Venuto noted . MSTR shares were trading around $350 this afternoon (up more than 400% YTD). Benchmark analysts on Monday upped their price target for the stock to $650 after MicroStrategy increased its bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC. That said, Weiskopf and Venuto recently reduced BLOK’s exposure to MSTR and CORZ as the stocks “rallied past our weighting limits,” they added. In other words, they’re trimming the winners in hopes of moving into other successes. On that diversification point: As the BLOK money managers await more IPOs in 2025, they started buying Japan-based Metaplanet last month. While more companies are adding BTC to their treasuries (~60 by Weiskopf’s count), many are small. So-called “zombie companies” aren’t likely to bounce back just because they’ve bought the crypto asset, he said. “They make a headline, but do they have a real strategy?” Weiskopf added about evaluating these BTC purchasers. He argued that Metaplanet, which in April unveiled its intent to emulate MicroStrategy’s efforts, is one committed to these BTC buys. The company said this week it would issue 5 billion yen in ordinary bonds to accelerate bitcoin purchases. So, for those monitoring crypto stocks, BLOK holdings appear worth peeking at. And then there’re the yet-to-arise opportunities during what could be a transformative year for the segment. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

If it moves above $111,730, Bitcoin could reach the next target at $122,389. Market signs suggest there's room for the price to rise before it becomes overvalued. The average price over the last 10 days is getting close to the 100-day average, which might point to an upward trend.

Solana's design supports fast processing without requiring sharding or extra layers, attracting developers and projects. This architecture makes it suitable for building high-activity solutions and innovative services. SOL has utility within the system, supporting various projects and acting as an incentive for participants. In the current market, SOL’s appeal depends on interest in scalable platforms and decentralized app growth. Its performance potential may draw attention from developers and investors seeking alternatives to other established blockchains. Avalanche (AVAX): An Efficient Blockchain with Customization Features Avalanche is a blockchain focused on speed, scalability, and low costs. It can handle 4,500 transactions per second with finality under two seconds. Its eco-friendly design and Subnets feature allow users to create custom blockchains. Avalanche's structure includes three separate chains (X-Chain, C-Chain, P-Chain), enabling varied activities like asset transfers and smart contracts. AVAX, the native token, is used for transaction fees, staking, and managing Subnets. The platform's technology and wide applicability make it a competitive option in the market. Its ability to support decentralized apps, token creation, and custom networks positions it as a solution for developers and a useful asset for users interested in blockchain scalability and flexibility.

It allows value and data to move securely between different networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum without middlemen. Using parachains, Polkadot improves transaction speed and scalability compared to older blockchains. Its native token, DOT, is used for network governance and staking, letting users help shape its development and validate transactions. Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot launched on May 26, 2020. The project aims to build a more connected blockchain ecosystem. Its focus on solving scalability and interoperability issues positions it as an important player in the market, appealing to developers and investors. NEAR Protocol: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications NEAR Protocol is a blockchain platform that focuses on enabling decentralized applications. It uses sharding to enhance scalability and efficiency in processing transactions. The protocol was created by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin and has secured significant funding from venture capital firms.

While the surge showcases the power of community-driven momentum, many investors are shifting focus to tokens with real-world utility, like Lightchain AI (LCAI). Currently in its presale phase , Lightchain AI is already making waves with its AI-integrated blockchain technology. Analysts are divided on PEPE ’s long-term prospects, citing its lack of utility despite its viral rise. On the other hand, LCAI offers a compelling vision for sustainable growth, backed by its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus, practical use cases, and strong presale momentum. With these factors in play, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to outperform speculative assets like PEPE and deliver far greater returns. You might also like: Binance Coin traders are exploring Lightchain AI’s potential for big gains PEPE’s meteoric 1800% growth in 2024: Analyzing the phenomenon In 2024, PEPE, a meme-based cryptocurrency inspired by the “Pepe the Frog” meme, experienced a remarkable surge, with its market capitalization soaring from $591 million at the beginning of the year to over $11 billion by December 7, 2024 — a growth exceeding 1800%. This meteoric rise can be attributed to several factors: Meme Culture Influence: Leveraging the widespread popularity of the “Pepe the Frog” meme, PEPE attracted a large community of enthusiasts and investors. Speculative Investment: The allure of high returns in the volatile cryptocurrency market drew speculators to PEPE, amplifying its value. Market Dynamics: A general bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market during 2024 created a favorable environment for altcoins like PEPE to thrive. However, it’s important to note that such rapid growth is often accompanied by high volatility and risks, especially for meme-based tokens lacking intrinsic utility. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with such assets. Challenges facing PEPE’s bid for a top 10 spot in 2025 Despite PEPE’s impressive 1,800% growth in 2024, its pursuit of a top 10 cryptocurrency ranking in 2025 faces significant challenges. Lack of Intrinsic Utility PEPE’s identity as a meme-based token means it lacks inherent utility or technological innovation, which could hinder its long-term appeal and sustainability. Intense Market Competition The cryptocurrency market is highly competitive, with numerous projects offering advanced technologies and real-world applications. PEPE must compete with these projects to secure a top 10 position. Market Volatility and Speculation Meme coins like PEPE are often subject to high volatility and speculative trading, leading to unpredictable price swings that can deter long-term investors. Regulatory Scrutiny As meme coins gain popularity, they may attract increased regulatory attention, potentially leading to restrictions that could impact PEPE’s growth prospects. These factors suggest that while PEPE has achieved remarkable growth, maintaining momentum and achieving a top 10 ranking in 2025 will require overcoming substantial obstacles. The rise of Lightchain AI – A stronger contender for market dominance PEPE sudden popu͏larity among inve͏stors ha͏s drawn͏ a lot of interest.

Why LCAI could outperform PEPE and Other altcoins in 2025 Lightchain AI is poised to outperform PEPE and other altcoins in 2025, thanks to its unique integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. At the core of its ecosystem are two groundbreaking components. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) – This consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, such as model training and optimization, enhancing network security and contributing directly to AI advancements.

In the last month alone, it surged over 112%. Currently trading between $2.03 and $2.73, the price is consolidating before a potential breakout. The nearest resistance is at $3.02; moving above this level could propel XRP towards $3.73, offering potential gains of over 35%. The RSI at 44.52 indicates there's room for upward movement. With a bullish altcoin season anticipated, XRP might continue its upward trajectory. The slight dip of -1.21% over the past week may be a healthy correction, setting the stage for the next rally.

Meanwhile, Altura ($ALU) is gaining momentum, preparing for a bullish breakout that could solidify its position as a multibillion-dollar project. Let's delve into the technical details driving these developments. $ETH: Oversold and Ready for Reversal Ethereum recently hit a crucial level of $3,125 and is also firmly in the oversold region. This price point is just about in line with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a significant support zone/price reversal zone. Some technical elements indicate Ethereum is salivating for a major recovery:- Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI has entered the oversold zone, suggesting that the selling pressure might have reached its maximum.- Finally, the MACD, is losing selling momentum, which seems to lead us to bullish territory.- Stochastic Oscillator: The stoch has bottomed, further providing a case for a reversal.All of these combined seem to indicate a likely breakout for Ethereum, with the 200-day SMA providing a solid recovery area to build upward momentum. A sustained move above this level would confirm the bullish trend, so traders and investors should keep an eye on it. Solana ($SOL): Support at $177 Solana has also retraced to an important level of $177, the same goes with Ethereum as it trades near its 200-day SMA. This key support level has historically been a turning point for the asset. We're finally seeing some hopeful signs of a reversal for Solana, similar to Ethereum:- Price action indicates a bounce from the 200-day SMA, highlighting it as a crucial support level.- Signs of decreased selling pressure point toward a bullish reversal in the near term.Between the broader market finding a footing and Solana’s resurgence, a sustained rally could be on the cards, and providing exposure to high-growth blockchain construction builders. 3 Cryptocurrencies that can moon in Q1 2025 Ethereum and Solana staged a rebound from being oversold, while Altura ($ALU) has been coasting along in a relatively straight line. It has seen no significant downside movements yet, maintaining its bullish pattern in a falling wedge pattern. This technical pattern suggests Altura's short-term target above $0.20 and much higher returns over the long term. The reason Altura is surviving is that it has a clear value proposition. This is the platform for both NFT-based gaming and metaverse integration. Here are some elements of bullish sentiment on the part of Altura: • A Bullish Basis: Altura is in the league of multibillion-dollar businesses in the making, thanks firstly to solid fundamentals. Utilization of their combination of NFTs and games has driven them to the top of this list.• The Falling Wedge Pattern Sets Up a Price Break: The falling wedge accompanied by the narrower volume of sustained buys suggests that the bull may soon be out of the pen.• Market Dynamics: With conditions in the overall market continuing to improve, newcomer Altura is well placed to benefit from increased attention, attracted by the fresh and young blockchain-related projects. Final Thoughts: Solana, Ethereum and Altura ($ALU) Both Ethereum and Solana have points of resilience that signal the potential for strong recovery according to key technical indicators and support levels. Their recovery from oversold moments points to the strength of their ecosystems and market appetite. But arguably the best performer recently is Altura ($ALU), which has shown immense upside with limited downside potential.While Altura, under the ambit of a $0.20 short-term target, is well on its way on what would eventually become a multibillion-dollar project, the three assets to watch are also worth a closer look for investors eyeing a high-growth opportunity in the crypto market, especially in terms of Altura's continued development and impact on the crypto world.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Asset manager Hashnote's USYC token zoomed over $1.2 billion in market capitalization, growing five-fold in size over the past three months, rwa.xyz data shows. It has toppled the $450 million BUIDL, issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, which was the largest product by size since April.      USYC is the token representation of the Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund, which, according to the company's website, invests in reverse repo agreements on U.S. government-backed securities and Treasury bills held in custody at the Bank of New York Mellon.    Hashnote's quick growth underscores the importance of interconnecting tokenized products with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and presenting their tokens available as building blocks for other products — or composability, in crypto lingo — to scale and reach broader adoption. It also showcases crypto investors' appetite for yield-generating stablecoins, which are increasingly backed by tokenized products.    USYC, for example, has greatly benefited from the rapid ascent of the budding decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual and its real-world asset-backed, yield-generating stablecoin, USD0.    Usual is pursuing the market share of centralized stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC by redistributing a portion of revenues from its stablecoin's backing assets to holders. USD0 is primarily backed by USYC currently, but the protocol aims to add more RWAs to reserves in the future. It has recently announced the addition of Ethena's USDtb stablecoin, which is built on top of BUIDL.    ""The bull market triggered a massive inflow into stablecoins, yet the core issue with the largest stablecoins remains: they lack rewards for end users and do not give access to the yield they generate,"" said David Shuttleworth, partner at Anagram. ""Moreover, users do not get access to the protocol’s equity by holding USDT or USDC.""    ""Usual’s appeal is that it redistributes the yield along with ownership in the protocol back to users,"" he added.      The protocol, and hence its USD0 stablecoin, has raked in $1.3 billion over the past few months as crypto investors chased on-chain yield opportunities. Another significant catalyst of growth was the protocol's governance token (USUAL) airdrop and exchange listing on Wednesday. USUAL started trading on Binance on Wednesday, and vastly outperformed the shaky broader crypto market, appreciating some 50% since then, per CoinGecko data.    BlackRock's BUIDL also enjoyed rapid growth earlier this year, driven by DeFi platform Ondo Finance making the token the key reserve asset of its own yield-earning product, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG) token.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | ONDO,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/de-fi-protocol-usuals-surge-catapults-hashnotes-tokenized-treasury-over-black-rocks-buidl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/12aadf777b36dc32a0cd75e657cfee15fdcd5e22-1893x1065.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s a question every investor asks, but few find the perfect answer. Meme coins have evolved from fleeting internet jokes to serious contenders in the crypto market, and 2024 has been a thrilling ride. Among the top names making waves are BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Popcat, and Crypto All-Stars—each bringing unique twists to the table. While Popcat traders anticipate a reversal amid bearish trends, Crypto All-Stars is wrapping up its presale with revolutionary innovations like the MemeVault. However, stealing the spotlight is BTFD Coin, with its stellar presale performance and a newly launched beta for its P2E game. Let’s dive into why these are the best meme coins to buy and hold for long term. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Seize the Dip, Ride the Bull Picture this: The market’s in chaos. Prices plummet, FOMO hits hard, but the BTFD community is thriving. That’s the magic of BTFD Coin, a project that’s made buying the dip a lifestyle. With its presale in its 12th stage, raising over $4.2 million and selling more than 57 billion coins, BTFD is fast becoming the meme coin everyone’s talking about. And there’s more—the beta version of its P2E game is live, letting users get a taste of the action (though rewards are reserved for the official launch). Built on Ethereum, BTFD isn’t just another token. Its robust tokenomics ensure stability, with 48% of its supply allocated for presale, 18% for staking rewards, and a locked liquidity pool to maintain market health. As part of its mission to turn dips into opportunities, BTFD also boasts an APY of 90% in staking rewards—perfect for long-term holders. The presale price is currently set at $0.00013, but here’s the kicker: once the presale ends, BTFD will list at $0.0006. Let’s break it down. An investment of $1,250 in Stage 12 would fetch you nearly 9.6 million BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, your portfolio could soar to $5,760—a potential gain of over 360% before factoring in staking rewards. BTFD also introduces a lucrative referral program where top referrers earn 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens . This initiative is designed to foster community growth and reward its most loyal supporters. Buying BTFD is a breeze. With MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load up on ETH or BNB, connect your wallet, and purchase BTFD in minutes. With staking rewards and token claims available post-presale, BTFD is paving the way for investors to thrive in both bearish and bullish markets. Popcat (POPCAT): Awaiting a Reversal Popcat emerged as one of 2024’s trendiest meme coins, rallying over 300% within two months after August. Its rapid ascent was driven by community support and Solana’s scalable network. However, no success story is without its hurdles. Near the $1.75 mark, bearish pressure caused a sharp correction, pulling Popcat down to $1.16. The token managed to rebound to an all-time high of $2.07 but has since dropped 50%, trading at $1.09. The $1 price level has become a critical support zone. Analysts suggest that with enough demand, Popcat could reverse its fortunes. However, its high volatility has left traders cautious. While the token’s reliance on community engagement is its strength, sustaining relevance in a competitive meme coin market remains a challenge. Short-term traders might find opportunities in Popcat’s fluctuations, but for those seeking long-term gains, patience will be key. If Popcat can break free from its bear trend, it could once again capture the market’s attention. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): Staking Revolutionised Crypto All-Stars is rewriting the rules of meme coin staking. Its flagship feature, the MemeVault, is a game-changer, allowing users to stake multiple meme coins—including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki—on one platform. With staking rewards reaching up to 1429% APY during its presale phase, Crypto All-Stars is drawing significant attention. As of its final presale stage, Crypto All-Stars has raised a staggering $25.1 million, with $STARS tokens priced at $0.0016782. The platform’s unique tokenomics allocate 25% of the total supply to presale staking, ensuring long-term engagement. Early adopters have already begun earning rewards, solidifying STAR’s reputation as a high-ROI opportunity. The roadmap promises more. The $STARS token is set to launch on Uniswap early next week, followed by the full rollout of the MemeVault ecosystem. This phased approach ensures a steady build-up of momentum, keeping the community engaged while attracting new investors. With its secure contracts audited by SolidProof and a locked liquidity pool, Crypto All-Stars provides the stability investors crave. Whether you’re a meme coin enthusiast or a staking pro, STAR is one to watch for both short- and long-term gains. Conclusion If you’re looking for the best meme coins to buy and hold for the long term, these three projects offer unique opportunities. Popcat has the potential to bounce back from its current bear trend, offering gains for patient investors. Crypto All-Stars is revolutionising staking with its MemeVault, making it a favourite among yield seekers. But the crown jewel here is undoubtedly the BTFD Coin. With its presale nearing its final stages, a beta P2E game live, and staking rewards already attracting investors, BTFD is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ride the next bull cycle.

37895350,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52706,1734725733,Didn’t Bag Pepe Coin in Infancy? Here’s Why This Best New Meme Coin Presale Could Be Your Ticket to Meme Coin Riches in 2025!,"If you’ve ever wished you could rewind time to join a crypto revolution early, you’re not alone. Just ask the investors who missed out on the initial hype of PEPE—one of the most iconic meme coins. Those early adopters turned a few dollars into fortunes, riding the frenzy of community-driven hype. But history isn’t done with second chances. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the hottest best new meme coin presale, bringing a unique twist to the meme coin mania. With over $4.2 million raised, 57 billion tokens sold, and a thriving community of over 6,100 holders, BTFD Coin is roaring through its presale, now in Stage 12. It’s more than just a coin—it’s a movement for those who know when to “buy the dip” and secure the bag before the next bull run. You can grab BTFD now for just $0.00013 before it lists at $0.0006. But why is everyone talking about it? Let’s break it down. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution is Here Missed the big wins with Dogecoin or Pepe Coin? Enter BTFD Coin , a community-driven meme project that’s all about flipping market dips into massive gains. Since its presale launch, BTFD has been on a roll, raising $4.2 million in record time. Over 57 billion BTFD coins have already been sold to a passionate base of 6,100 holders. And the price? It started at $0.000004 per coin and has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12. By the time the presale wraps, BTFD will list at $0.0006, making early entry a no-brainer. Here’s the maths: If you invest $1,500 today, you’ll snag around 11,538,461 coins. Once BTFD hits its listing price, your $1,500 investment could balloon to $6,923. Not too shabby, right? But there’s more to BTFD than just presale numbers. This meme coin is powered by a vibrant community and innovative features like its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game. The Beta version is live now, and while it’s all fun and games for now, rewards are set to roll out soon. Imagine earning while smashing levels and battling it out with the Bulls Squad – BTFD’s iconic mascot crew. Oh, and let’s not forget staking. BTFD’s staking rewards offer an APY of up to 1429% during the presale, meaning your investment doesn’t just sit there; it grows while you wait. That’s the kind of passive income everyone dreams about. Want to earn more? Join BTFD’s referral programme and snag 10% on every purchase made with your code. If you’re in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’ll earn an extra stash of BTFD tokens. With prices climbing fast and the buzz growing louder, now’s the time to load your bags before the presale ends. Pepe Coin: The OG Meme Coin That Got Away Remember when Pepe Coin burst onto the scene? What started as a homage to the internet’s favourite frog quickly morphed into a meme coin juggernaut. Early investors watched their tiny stakes explode into life-changing fortunes. Pepe launched at fractions of a cent, and before you knew it, it hit a market cap of over $1.5 billion. The thing with Pepe was timing. Back in April 2023, those who bought in early rode the wave as the coin surged 1000x in just weeks. Social media hype was at an all-time high, and exchanges scrambled to list it. But as is often the case, many missed the boat. By the time the masses caught wind, Pepe had already made its early investors rich, leaving latecomers holding the bag. Fast forward to today, and Pepe’s still a household name in the crypto space. Its price has stabilised, and while it’s no longer making 1000x jumps, it’s a reminder of what’s possible when you’re in early on a meme coin with potential. The missed opportunity with Pepe is a lesson for every investor: real money is made when you’re ahead of the curve, not chasing it. Why BTFD Coin is the Best New Meme Coin Presale Right Now If you’re reading this thinking, “I’m not missing out again,” then BTFD Coin is your answer. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement. Built on Ethereum, BTFD combines the hype of meme culture with real-world utility. Its P2E game, staking rewards, and vibrant community make it more than just a token; it’s an ecosystem. With presale prices rising at every stage and listing at $0.0006, the window for massive gains is closing fast. Don’t be the one watching from the sidelines again. Secure your spot, grab your BTFD coins, and ride the wave to 2025’s riches. Conclusion Meme coins are all about timing! You missed PEPE, but you don’t have to miss BTFD Coin . With its presale price of $0.00013, booming community, and innovative features like the P2E game and staking rewards, BTFD is the best new meme coin presale to watch. Imagine turning a modest investment into a life-changing fortune—BTFD could make that dream a reality. The time to act is now. The presale won’t last forever, and every stage unlocks new growth opportunities. Sign up before BTFD Coin goes live, and secure your spot in the next big crypto success story. Ready to buy the dip? Don’t wait—join the BTFD movement today!

37895111,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99205,1734725610,Coinbase Sees Record BTC Outflow as Whales Move $1.1 Billion in 1 Hour,"Crypto exchange Coinbase recorded the highest outflow last week, with 10,756 Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawn in one hour. The total volume was worth approximately $1.1 billion, sparking slight bull signals in the market. Crypto whales and institutional investors have picked up huge assets, buying the dip and setting sights on another rally. CryptoQuant analysts highlighted a set of massive outflows from centralized exchanges. Coinbase saw the largest volume following the Fed’s cutting interest rates. The first block contained 8,093 BTC, while the second was 2,557 BTC before the hour. Outflows from centralized exchanges point to improved market sentiments as users seek long-term holdings. Meanwhile, flows to these exchanges often result in offloads due to ease of transaction. As a result, the market faces high sell pressure on mounting inflows to Binance and Coinbase. Institutional Players Lead Buys Recent Bitcoin buys amid the market dip have come from institutional investors. Retail holders have sold assets to notch gains in the last seven days after the crypto leader touched all-time highs. However, most traditional and bigger players are holding on a long-term basis ahead of positive macro factors in the United States. Recent outflows from exchanges occurred after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced interest rate cuts. On Dec 18, the US central bank slashed policy rates by 25 basis points, taking figures to the lowest since February 2023. This follows slowing inflationary trends adding to crypto investments. Rate cuts lead to more inflows as investors pour funds into risky assets. CryptoQuant analysts explained recent activity was linked to spot Bitcoin ETFs and other institutional activity. This signals a strong rebound for Bitcoin price in 202,4 coupled with recent projections by stakeholders. “ The scale of this transaction strongly indicates institutional buying (RIOT and MARA) or intermediary purchases for Spot ETF demand, consistent with similar activity observed over the past year. Such movements highlight the growing influence of institutional players in the Bitcoin market. U.S. investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin relentlessly, undeterred by price fluctuations or market downturns.” Bitcoin miner Hut 8 purchased 990 Bitcoin worth approximately $100 million, boosting its reserve above $1 billion. The company noted it aligns with its strategy to merge low-cost BTC mining with buying opportunities. Recently, Riot Platforms also splurged $525 million to acquire 5,117 BTC, further boosting bull activity.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-sees-record-btc-outflow-as-whales-move-1-1-billion-in-1-hour/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin Driving Community Engagement BONK is a memecoin built on the Solana blockchain with a Shiba Inu logo. It aims to strengthen the Solana ecosystem by redistributing value to its community instead of large investors. Half of its supply was airdropped to Solana NFT and DeFi users. BONK gained over 10,000% this year and became the 3rd-largest memecoin by market cap. A Coinbase listing boosted its popularity. BONK supports decentralized applications like BonkSwap, its decentralized exchange. Its high supply and memecoin volatility remain challenges. However, its growth and integration within Solana make it an interesting option in the current cryptocurrency market. Buyers may find its focus on community and ecosystem appeal promising. Floki Coin: From Meme to Multifunctional Ecosystem Floki was inspired by Elon Musk’s tweet about naming his Shiba Inu ""Floki"" in 2021. It has expanded from being just a meme coin to a token with real use. Floki funds building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria as part of its charity goals. Its ecosystem includes the NFT game Valhalla, the DeFi platform FlokiFi, and a prepaid Floki Card for spending tokens. Partnerships like the one with NOWPayments make Floki usable for real purchases. Analysts see potential in its tools and global reach. It gained attention as a top coin recommendation in 2023. These efforts aim to distinguish Floki from other meme coins by offering utility and stronger applications beyond simple trading. POPCAT: A New Meme Coin with Market Revival Potential POPCAT is a meme-based cryptocurrency aiming to attract attention in a slow market. It claims to offer an alternative for users who missed out on previous big gains like $BONK. The project presents itself as a fresh opportunity in a space often filled with inactive wallets and failed projects. POPCAT positions itself as a fun, engaging coin while highlighting its potential for significant market growth. Its appeal lies in capturing user interest during uncertain cycles. Whether it stands out or not depends on community backing and market trends. Turbo Token: AI-Created Memecoin with Community Focus Turbo Token is the first memecoin designed using AI. It was created as an experiment by using GPT-4, aiming to show how artificial intelligence can be applied in cryptocurrency. The coin builds on the popularity of memecoins by combining AI innovation with community-driven value. Turbo Token's unique origin makes it a standout in the market, particularly for those interested in AI's role in finance. Its success depends on community adoption and current market conditions. The idea of an AI-created cryptocurrency attracts attention, especially in a market cycle where innovation is emphasized. Turbo Token represents an intersection of technology and culture within the crypto space. Conclusion DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice, tailored for those who embrace ambition and prosperity. While BONK, FLOKI, POPCAT, and TURBO show moderate potential in the short term, DOGEN leads with unmatched features, projecting 700% growth before its presale ends. With exclusive benefits and a vision of dominance, DOGEN is set to define this altcoin season.

Solana Set for Upswing: Eyes on Breakthrough to $290 Resistance Solana is trading between $205 and $240, showing signs of consolidation after recent pullbacks. Despite a weekly drop of over 7% and a monthly decline exceeding 12%, Solana has gained more than 56% in the past six months. The nearest resistance level is around $255, and breaching this could pave the way to the next target near $290. The Relative Strength Index is just below neutral, suggesting room for upward movement. With the simple moving averages converging, momentum may shift in favor of buyers. As the market gears up for the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Solana could rally, potentially offering substantial percentage gains from current prices. Bonk (BONK) Shows Signs of Rebound Amid Oversold Indicators Bonk (BONK) is currently trading between $0.00003055 and $0.00004474. Despite a price drop of over 20% in the past week, indicators like the RSI at 31.68 suggest the token is nearing oversold conditions. This could signal a potential upward movement. If BONK breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.00005269, it might rally toward the next level at $0.00006687, representing possible gains. The stochastic oscillator is also low, hinting at a possible trend reversal. With a six-month price increase of over 40%, BONK may still have room to grow, especially if market sentiment turns bullish in the anticipated altcoin season. Conclusion SOL and BONK show moderate short-term opportunities, but DOGEN stands out with exceptional growth potential. Designed for those who value luxury and success, it aims for 700% gains by the presale's end and thousand-fold returns in the current altcoin rally. With a strong community of leaders and exclusive benefits, DOGEN sets a new standard.

37894616,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99203,1734725059,Shiba Inu Partners with Chainlink — Could This Be the Key to SHIB’s Biggest Rally Yet?,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) could be on the cusp of a major lift-off following a groundbreaking partnership with Chainlink (LINK), a leader in blockchain interoperability. Announced on Thursday, this collaboration marks a pivotal moment for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, with its Shibarium network now integrating Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Notably, this integration establishes CCIP as the “canonical cross-chain infrastructure” for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, allowing SHIB, BONE, and LEASH tokens to operate seamlessly across 12 different blockchains. Per the announcement, the partnership also promises to open new opportunities for DeFi applications and enhance cross-chain functionality, expanding Shiba Inu’s presence in the broader blockchain ecosystem. For context, the CCIP integration employs a lock-and-mint mechanism for token transfers between Ethereum and other blockchains, while a burn-and-mint mechanism will facilitate transfers across an even wider range of networks. By leveraging Chainlink’s decentralized oracle networks (DONs), Shiba Inu can tap into robust security, which is crucial for safeguarding transactions within its ecosystem. Following the partnership, Shibarium , designed to enhance transaction scalability, speed, and cost-efficiency, is set to benefit even further. Notably, with the integration of Chainlink, Shibarium will unlock new functionalities, including secure cross-chain token transfers and access to real-time, high-frequency market data, which are critical components for driving DeFi markets forward. That said, Johann Eid, Chainlink’s Chief Business Officer, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, stating, “ We’re excited to partner with Shiba Inu and help grow its ecosystem. The integration of Chainlink CCIP will enhance its capabilities and drive widespread adoption.” Shiba Inu’s Tech Wizard, Kaal, also praised the development, calling it a “bold new course” to set the stage for broader adoption and multi-chain applications. Elsewhere, in a tweet , the network’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, called the partnership “HUGE news” for SHIB, BONE, and LEASH holders. Lucie, the project’s marketing lead, further highlighted how this partnership would enable Shibarium to connect with major blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Avalanche, significantly boosting the exposure and utility of Shiba Inu assets. Meanwhile, the “SHIB army” has expressed excitement and optimism over the partnership, viewing it as a boon for SHIB’s price following a year of largely stagnant performance. Notably, SHIB has faced a steep decline this week, mirroring the broader crypto market downturn. Despite the recent decline, SHIB’s price has reached a critical multi-year support zone near $0.000020. Analysts like “Crypo Latit” anticipate this level will serve as a strong support area, attracting significant buy orders and potentially triggering a robust rebound. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.00002166, reflecting a sharp 1.7% decline in the past 24 hours. However, trading volume surged by 46.31% during this period to $2.09 billion, indicating heightened interest in SHIB following the partnership announcement.",POSITIVE,LINK | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-partners-with-chainlink-could-this-be-the-key-to-shibs-biggest-rally-yet/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

This emerging asset holds the potential to outshine established cryptocurrencies like Polkadot and Kaspa, stirring excitement among investors and enthusiasts eager to discover the next big opportunity. Introducing XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin uniting fans across football, basketball, MMA, and esports within a dynamic ecosystem. The All-Sports Meme Token You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where degens can score big off the growing demand for meme coins Picture this: Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election – now throw in the hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field and cash in the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding – and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! >>>XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! In 2024, meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. With potential thousand-fold returns that will blow past the finish line, the presale plan draws a hefty 9,900% growth by the TGE. Forget about BOME’s 5,000% rise or WIF’s 1,000% rally – XYZ is here to outscore them all! With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a new kind of cryptocurrency that aims to link different blockchains together. Created by Gavin Wood, who also helped start Ethereum, it lets data and value move between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without needing middlemen. This means blockchains can work together, making everything faster and more efficient. Polkadot uses ""parachains"" to speed up transactions and handle more of them at once. In fact, it can process many more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum can right now. The DOT token isn't just money; it's also a way for holders to have a say in how the network grows and changes. Right now, Polkadot looks promising in the cryptocurrency market. Its technology could solve big problems by helping blockchains communicate with each other. As more projects look for ways to connect, Polkadot's role becomes more important. Compared to other coins, DOT offers practical uses beyond just being traded. While the market can be unpredictable, Polkadot's strong team and unique approach make it stand out. For anyone interested in the future of blockchain, Polkadot is a project worth watching. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that's making waves with its unique approach to blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains that can get slow and congested, Kaspa uses something called the GHOSTDAG protocol. This means it doesn't discard blocks that are created at the same time; instead, it keeps them all and orders them in a way that makes sense. As a result, Kaspa can process transactions much faster—currently one block per second, with goals to reach ten, or even a hundred, blocks per second. Its innovative design aims to reduce waiting times to nearly zero, so transactions are confirmed almost as fast as your internet connection allows. With features like quick transaction times and plans for even more improvements, Kaspa is positioning itself as a strong contender in the crypto world. Compared to other coins that struggle with scalability, Kaspa's technology could give it an edge. The current market is always looking for cryptocurrencies that solve real problems, and Kaspa's focus on speed and efficiency fits that trend. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, Kaspa's unique approach might make it an interesting option to watch as the market evolves. Conclusion Though DOT and KAS are strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) aims to surpass them as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting massive growth in the current bull market.

37894479,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665728,1734724842,Dogecoin Price And Its Weekly Golden Cross: Why The Crash To $0.31 Remains Natural,"The entire crypto market has been riddled with a notable decline in the past 24 hours, led by Bitcoin’s break below the $100,000 price level again. Dogecoin wasn’t left out of this decline, which saw its price crashing by almost 15% and eventually reaching below $0.31. However, technical analysis suggests that this price decline is very natural in Dogecoin’s current trajectory. This technical analysis offers a silver lining for Dogecoin enthusiasts, as it frames the pullback as a natural phenomenon within the broader ongoing bull cycle. Weekly Golden Cross And Its Implications For The Dogecoin Price Crypto analyst Kevin (Kev_Capital_TA) took to the social media platform X to highlight the significance of Dogecoin’s weekly golden cross amidst the ongoing market downturn. According to Kevin, Dogecoin experienced a weekly golden cross back in early November, coinciding with the US election period. Historically, such technical indicators signal strong bullish momentum to the upside. However, Kevin noted that the current pullback aligns with past patterns where Dogecoin underwent significant corrections following golden crosses. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Not The End As Analyst Predicts Another 52% Jump He pointed out that in previous cycles, Dogecoin faced three separate 50% corrections on its path to conclude at a cycle top. This historical behavior provides context for the recent crash to $0.31, which, according to Kevin, is a typical bull market pullback. He emphasized that this kind of retracement is not only expected but also essential for maintaining the market’s bullish structure. Support Levels And The Golden Pocket Zone Kevin’s technical analysis further looks into Dogecoin’s key support levels that could determine the meme coin’s next move. To get these support levels, he outlined the macrostructured support zone and the golden pocket, which is a Fibonacci retracement zone widely regarded as a strong support area. Based on his assessment, a 45% correction from Dogecoin’s recent high would align with these levels and could set the stage for a resumption of the uptrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Trading Volume Rises Over $6.5 Billion As Liquidations Cross $31 Million, What’s Going On? With that in mind, the recent Dogecoin price high is just around $0.48, a price point that it achieved in early December. Should Dogecoin tap into this golden pocket zone without closing below the $0.26 level on a weekly basis, this should be enough to keep the bullish market structure intact. However, breaking below support at $0.26 could spell trouble for Dogecoin, and cause a shift in its price trajectory in the broader trend. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3179, marking a steep 12% decline in the past 24 hours and an even more significant 22% drop over the past seven days. This recent decline places Dogecoin at its lowest level since early November, breaking below the $0.35 threshold for the first time in over a month. Nevertheless, the $0.26 support level will remain a focus in determining whether Dogecoin’s bull run is still valid.

JasmyCoin JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, an Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The IoT connects devices like computers, cars, and phones, allowing them to share data. Jasmy aims to give users full control over their personal data by combining IoT and blockchain technology. On the Jasmy platform, people can securely store and share their information, turning it into personal assets. This creates a safe space where data can be exchanged between devices and services without relying on trust. In a time when data privacy matters more than ever, JasmyCoin offers something new. By decentralizing data storage and using secure systems like IPFS, Jasmy lets users own and control their data. This sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies that focus mainly on transactions. As people look to protect their information, JasmyCoin could gain attention. The crypto market is always changing, but Jasmy’s focus on data sovereignty meets a real need. This might make it attractive to those interested in projects with practical uses. Pepe PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that began as a joke but got serious fast. Launched on Ethereum, it’s based on Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog meme, which has been popular since the early 2000s. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE aims to be a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With a no-tax policy and honesty about its lack of utility, PEPE is pure and simple — a meme coin. In late April to May 2023, its value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early holders made huge gains, and a strong community formed. This sparked a “meme coin season,” with other meme coins experiencing big ups and downs. Many hope PEPE and others will reach new highs, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving. PEPE’s potential lies in its community and meme appeal. Its roadmap has three phases: first, getting noticed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter; second, listings on centralized exchanges; third, major exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” Though it doesn’t offer new technology, its straightforward approach attracts some. Kaspa Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s making waves with its unique approach to blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains that can get slow and congested, Kaspa uses something called the GHOSTDAG protocol. This means it doesn’t discard blocks that are created at the same time; instead, it keeps them all and orders them in a way that makes sense. As a result, Kaspa can process transactions much faster — currently one block per second, with goals to reach ten, or even a hundred, blocks per second. Its innovative design aims to reduce waiting times to nearly zero, so transactions are confirmed almost as fast as your internet connection allows. With features like quick transaction times and plans for even more improvements, Kaspa is positioning itself as a strong contender in the crypto world. Compared to other coins that struggle with scalability, Kaspa’s technology could give it an edge. The current market is always looking for cryptocurrencies that solve real problems, and Kaspa’s focus on speed and efficiency fits that trend. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, Kaspa’s unique approach might make it an interesting option to watch as the market evolves. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that began as a playful rival to Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to Ethereum’s large ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB started with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. In a surprising move, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a significant portion to India’s Covid relief fund and burned the rest, removing them from circulation. This act not only reduced SHIB’s supply but also boosted its standing in the crypto community. SHIB’s connection to Ethereum allows it to do more than other meme coins. It powers ShibaSwap, a place where people can trade tokens without a central authority. There are also plans for a platform for NFTs (digital collectibles) and a system where holders can help make decisions. These developments show that SHIB wants to be more useful and not just a joke. In today’s market, where investors look for coins with real-world uses, SHIB stands out. Its strong technology and active community make it attractive compared to other coins. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, SHIB’s growth and plans make it one to watch. Conclusion While JASMY, PEPE, KAS, and SHIB show promise, XYZVerse uniquely blends sports and memes, aiming for significant growth as a community-driven ecosystem.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it's a groundbreaking platform that has transformed the blockchain landscape. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). This innovation led to a thriving ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction speed and efficiency. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the Merge, aiming to improve sustainability and scalability. Ether (ETH), the native currency, is essential for transactions, rewarding stakers, and serves as a tradable asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum continues to show strong potential. Its commitment to scalability, with the upcoming sharding phase, promises to reduce costs and increase transaction speed, making it more attractive to users and developers alike. Compared to other coins, Ethereum's robust ecosystem and continuous innovation set it apart. As more applications and services build on its platform, the demand for ETH could rise. Market trends indicate a growing interest in decentralized technologies, and Ethereum's position at the forefront makes it a noteworthy player in the crypto space. While the market is always subject to change, Ethereum's advancements suggest it's a coin to watch. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency that aims to make money move as fast as information. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it is designed to be quick, low-cost, and open to everyone. Transactions happen in seconds and cost very little. Without a central authority, it resists censorship and cannot be counterfeited. You don't need a bank account to use XRP, making it accessible to people all around the world. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company helping to develop it, holds a large portion to support its growth. XRP's purpose is to make it easy to transfer any currency, anywhere. In today's market, XRP stands out for its speed and low fees compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As the demand for fast and efficient payment systems grows, XRP looks attractive by bridging gaps between different currencies globally. Solana (SOL) Solana is a blockchain platform aiming to outpace its competitors with speed and scalability. Like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a foundation for decentralized apps, but it stands out with its unique design choices. Solana focuses on quick transactions and offers flexible development options in several programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers the network by facilitating transactions, running programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The SOL coin holds promise in today's market. It underpins Solana's ecosystem, rewarding participants and giving users access to many projects. Unlike other platforms, Solana doesn't rely on sharding or extra layers to scale. This approach may attract developers and investors looking for a high-capacity network that can handle busy products and services. With the growing interest in decentralized apps and the need for faster blockchain solutions, SOL could be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there's no maximum supply. What started as a fun alternative quickly gained traction. In 2021, Dogecoin's value skyrocketed, pushing it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value of over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and the general boom in the crypto market. Today, Dogecoin stands as a symbol of the power of community and memes in the financial world. Its technology is simple, making transactions quick and cheap compared to some other coins. While some see it as just a meme, others believe it has potential due to its active community and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains attractive to those who value community-driven projects. However, with newer coins offering advanced features, Dogecoin faces stiff competition. Its future may depend on market trends and continued support from its fans. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that began as a joke but got serious fast. Launched on Ethereum, it's based on Matt Furie's Pepe the Frog meme, popular since the early 2000s. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE aims to be a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With a no-tax policy and honesty about its lack of utility, PEPE is pure and simple—a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, its value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early holders made huge gains, and a strong community formed. This sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme coins experiencing big ups and downs. Many hope PEPE and others will reach new highs, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving. PEPE's potential lies in its community and meme appeal. Its roadmap has three phases: first, getting noticed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter; second, listings on centralized exchanges; third, major exchange listings and a ""meme takeover."" Though it doesn't offer new technology, its straightforward approach attracts some. Conclusion ETH, XRP, SOL, and DOGE are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) offers a unique chance to capitalize on sports and memes, aiming for substantial growth in this bull market.

However, the flagship cryptocurrency was back at $97k at the time of writing. Meanwhile, Horizen price led top gainers as Ethereum and XRP flipped positive after crashing to key support levels. Per market data from CoinGecko, the global market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies stood at $3.35 trillion, down 3.5% in the past 24 hours. A snapshot of the market also showed global trading volume was above $361 billion, more than 33% up in the same period as Bitcoin dominance hovered around 57.6%. Ethereum’s dominance was at 12.2%. In terms of sentiment, CoinMarketCap’s crypto fear & greed index had the metric at 62 – still in greed despite the BTC crash.

Bitcoin’s pullback, a sharp decline from $100k to $92.5k, happened as the crypto market joined other risk assets in a negative reaction to the Federal Reserve’s commentary on December 19. After announcing a 25 bps interest rate cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signalled a hawkish stance by noting that the central bank sees fewer rate cuts in 2025. With stocks also trading lower premarket, BTC price fell to near $92,100, moving further from its recent all-time high above $108,000. The sell-off cascaded to the rest of the crypto market as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded outflows to end a 15-day streak of inflows. While the bounce is likely to see BTC face the $100k hurdle again, analysts are bullish and suggest the dip is for buying. “The drivers of the bull market are long-term and fundamental, while the drivers of the pullback are short-term and tactical. That makes the pullback an opportunity and not a reversal” Matt Hougan, chief investments officer at asset manager Bitwise said . ETH and XRP price ETH and XRP look to have benefitted from this outlook as their prices climbed from lows of $3,098 and $1.97 respectively. Ethereum and XRP traded around $3,424 and $2.25, with weekly performance at -12% and -8%. Horizen (ZEN) price spikes 60% Horizon (ZEN) led the top gainers among the 500 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap after skyrocketing more than 60%. The ZEN token’s recent halving and Grayscale launch of ZEN Trust catalyzed the gains. ZEN price reached highs of $26. Top gainers Elsewhere, Hyperliquid (HYPE), Movement (MOVE) and Sui (SUI) were top gainers among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. The 24-hour gains for HYPE, MOVE and SUI were 18%, 11% and 3%. Top losers Most altcoins were in red in the 24-hour time frame. However, top losers per CoinMarketCap were Pudgy Penguins (PUDGY) -16%; Curve DAO (CRV) -15%; Pepe (PEPE) -14% and Aptos (APT) -14%. The Aptos decline followed news of its CEO stepping down .

37894328,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375530,1734724549,"Vivek Ramaswamy’s X Account Allegedly Hacked, Leads to USUAL Price Surge","Reports have emerged that hackers compromised the X account of the newly-established Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy. The attack led to a whirlwind of misinformation and market frenzy surrounding the four-month-old USUAL stablecoin project. False Claims Propel Market Activity It started with a now-deleted post initially thought to be from Ramaswamy, announcing a “strategic partnership” with USUAL that would leverage cryptocurrency to help reduce the federal government’s fiscal deficit. “By integrating innovative financial solutions and enhancing the efficiency of governmental transactions, we believe that this partnership will not only promote fiscal responsibility but also foster greater financial inclusion,” the post said. However, more than 40,000 views later, the tweet was removed, with prominent fund manager James Fishback claiming that he had spoken with Ramaswamy, who informed him that he had been hacked. “He is locked out of his account. This is a scam,” Fishback clarified, referring to the post. Nonetheless, the false announcement seemed to have achieved its purpose, with its namedropping of USUAL causing the project’s governance token to spike dramatically. Data from CoinGecko shows that the cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high (ATH) of $1.61 soon after the fake Vivek post went live, pushing its market cap to nearly $745 million. At the time of this writing, it had retraced back to $1.48, which, while 8.4% below the ATH, was still a 29.3% improvement over 24 hours. Additionally, the token saw a spike in trading volume, recording $1.7 billion worth of transactions since yesterday. The uptick also came in the wake of USUAL’s stablecoin, Usual USD (USD0), breaching the billion-dollar mark to attain a $1.2 billion market cap. The jump was triggered by the issuer’s announcement that it would diversify the asset’s reserves to include a couple of new virtual currencies, including Ethena’s USDtb and UsualM , an extension of the $M stablecoin. DOGE Initiative Draws Crypto Community Attention The Ramaswamy hack has cast a spotlight on D.O.G.E., an initiative the biotech entrepreneur steers alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While the project’s stated mission is to cut bureaucratic red tape and optimize federal spending, its acronym and association with Musk have fueled speculation within the crypto community about potential involvement with digital currencies. The X owner is a well-known supporter of Dogecoin (DOGE), and several of his past pronouncements have led to sharp spikes in the meme coin’s price, a factor that may have played into the hands of the suspected hacker had they been looking to benefit from a rise in USUAL’s value. At the time of going to press, Ramaswamy had not made any statement regarding the alleged breach.

With the popularity of dog-themed tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, WIF has the potential to gain traction. Its unique meme background might help it stand out.

The IoT connects devices like computers, cars, and phones, allowing them to share data. Jasmy aims to give users full control over their personal data by combining IoT and blockchain technology.

With Bitcoin soaring past unprecedented milestones and altcoins hitting fresh peaks, attention turns to emerging contenders. Enthusiasts are buzzing about which digital assets might spearhead the next wave of growth. XYZVerse emerges as a groundbreaking memecoin connecting fans of various sports. Combining meme culture with athletic passion, it aims for explosive growth within a community-driven ecosystem. Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.001 In just a couple of months, $XYZ already soared over 1000%! Next Stage: $0.001333 (+33% jump incoming) Final Knockout Target: $0.1 From launch to the token generation event, $XYZ is targeting a mind-blowing 99,900% surge! If you’re not in, you’re out. The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced significant price changes lately. In the past week, its price dropped by 26.17%. Over the past month, it fell by 34.73%. Despite these declines, WIF is up 28.14% over the last six months. Technical indicators suggest that WIF might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 29.14, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 27.16. Both are below 30, which often signals an oversold condition. The current price range is between $2.38 and $3.52. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.29, and the 100-day SMA is $2.69. If WIF can rise above the nearest resistance level at $4, it could reach the second resistance at $5.33. This would be an increase of over 50% from current prices. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $1.91, the next support is at $0.7749, representing a significant drop. The MACD level is negative at -0.0965, showing bearish momentum, but the oversold indicators suggest a possible rebound. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin's nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced notable price movements recently. In the past week, its value dropped by 16.90%, reflecting a significant short-term decline. Over the past month, the decrease was less steep at 3.70%, suggesting some stabilization. Impressively, over the last six months, SHIB's price has surged by 34.10%, indicating strong long-term potential. Currently trading between $0.000023966 and $0.000032006, SHIB is approaching its nearest support level at $0.000020063. If it holds above this point, it may rally towards the nearest resistance at $0.000036143. Breaking this resistance could lead to testing the second resistance level at $0.000044183, which would be an increase of around 38%. Conversely, falling below the support might push the price down to the second support level at $0.000012023. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.34, suggesting the coin is nearing oversold territory and might rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.000024107, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.000026627, indicating potential bearish momentum. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000005695, but the Stochastic oscillator at 40.84 is in a neutral zone. Considering these factors, SHIB's price could consolidate before making a decisive move, with close attention needed on key support and resistance levels. Conclusion While WIF, DOGE, and SHIB show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for significant growth this cycle.

37894119,https://nulltx.com/?p=136057,1734724050,BDAG Dominates Crypto Mining as APT Eyes $30 & Aave Sees $500M Surge,"Why Are BlockDAG’s Mining Rigs Top Choice for Users of All Levels as Aptos Targets $30 & Aave News Highlights $500M Lending Surge The Aptos technical analysis signals a push toward $30, reigniting investor excitement as it challenges long-term resistance. Meanwhile, Aave’s lending platform dominates the DeFi sector, but bearish pressure on the $AAVE token raises questions about its next move. But BlockDAG (BDAG) commands this week’s headlines with its advanced mining capabilities and making crypto mining accessible for everyone — from casual users to pros with its X Series miners. Its X1 mining app turns smartphones into money-makers, redefining the future of decentralized mining. BlockDAG is on a roll, backed by unmatched profitability and a record-breaking $170 million presale earnings, with $6 million raised from miner sales alone. Crypto analysts predict that BlockDAG will hit $1 by 2025, making BlockDAG’s mining rigs one of the top crypto miners to own. Aptos Technical Analysis: Breakout Signals $30 Target The Aptos technical analysis highlights a strong recovery, positioning APT for a breakout from a 690-day resistance trend line. After a recent low at $10.41, the price rebounded, forming a bullish lower wick that validated support at $10.70. This resurgence pushed APT back to the descending resistance, currently at $15.30. The Aptos’ technical analysis suggests that indicators like the RSI, nearing 70, and MACD above zero confirm rising momentum, signaling a potential breakout. If APT clears this resistance, minimal obstacles remain before reaching a new all-time high. The Aptos technical analysis shows the possibility of $30.25, marking a significant upward move and renewed investor optimism. Aave News: Lending Activity Grows But $AAVE Stays Bearish Recent Aave news highlights the protocol’s impressive surge in lending activity, with netflows surpassing $500 million on Ethereum in the past week. Despite this, the $AAVE token remains under pressure, dropping over 14% in two weeks. While Aave dominates the DeFi space, its price action has failed to reflect its platform’s growth. Analysts attribute the dip to reduced network activity and mounting selling pressure, keeping $AAVE in a bearish trajectory. Aave continues to showcase its fundamentals, including generating $500 million in revenue this year, yet token performance lags behind. As market conditions change, investors hope Aave’s consistent success will eventually lift AAVE’s price sentiment. BlockDAG Redefines Mining for Miners of All Levels BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work system revolutionizes mining, ensuring it’s accessible to all and not just large players. By leveraging mobile mining through the X1 Miner App, BlockDAG democratizes crypto mining, enabling anyone with a smartphone to mine BDAG coins efficiently. Backed by over 270K active users, the X1 App has made mining simple, energy-efficient, and profitable, reinforcing BlockDAG’s commitment to inclusivity. This balanced approach prevents centralization, safeguarding network security and fairness. Complementing the X1 is the X10 device, which boosts mining efficiency up to 200 BDAG daily with minimal setup. The combination of leading-edge mobile mining, low barriers to entry, and unmatched profitability sets BlockDAG’s X Series as the top crypto miners. As BDAG rallies toward the predicted $1 target, mining profitability is set to skyrocket as well. A single X1 miner earning 20 BDAG daily would generate $20 when BDAG hits $1 price, making it a lucrative opportunity for miners of all levels. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s presale numbers are exploding—$170 million raised and over 17.4 billion coins sold, with batch 26 pricing BDAG coins at just $0.0234. Early adopters have already enjoyed an incredible 2240% ROI since batch 1, and the next batch is quickly approaching. The demand for miners is also high, with over 14931 miners sold so far in the presale, raising over 6 million. While Aptos’s technical analysis targets a $30 breakout and Aave’s news highlights strong lending activity, neither project matches BlockDAG’s disruptive mining innovation and surging demand. Driven by scalability, profitability, and accessibility, BlockDAG cements itself as a leader in decentralized mining, primed to reshape the crypto world. Key Takeaways: Top Crypto Miners & More The Aptos technical analysis points to an exciting breakout, with a $30 target drawing bullish attention as momentum builds. The Aave news also highlights its impressive growth in lending activity and DeFi dominance, even as $AAVE struggles to gain price traction due to market pressures. However, BlockDAG has captivated the hearts of crypto miners everywhere. By democratizing crypto mining through its intuitive X1 Miner App and its other powerful mining rigs, BlockDAG is revolutionizing accessibility and profitability for users of all levels. Its X Series mining machines rank among the top crypto miners, solidifying BlockDAG’s position as a leader in blockchain technology. As analysts project a $1 price for BDAG, BlockDAG’s mining machines are in high demand, driving rapid sellouts during the presale.

The cash will support El Salvador’s reform agenda and is subject to approval from the IMF Executive Board, according to a new press release from the United Nations (UN) financial agency. The IMF also says the facility is expected to “catalyze” a combined total of $3.5 billion in financing from the World Bank and various other international financial institutions. The UN financial agency notes that El Salvador’s government agreed to limit its crypto efforts as part of the agreement. “The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies. Legal reforms will make the acceptance of Bitcoin by the private sector voluntary. For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined. Taxes will only be paid in US dollars and the government’s participation in the crypto e-wallet (Chivo) will be gradually unwound. Transparency, regulation, and supervision of digital assets will be enhanced to safeguard financial stability, consumer and investor protection, and financial integrity.” However, Stacy Herbert, the director of El Salvador’s “Bitcoin Office,” says the country has no plans to slow down its Bitcoin purchases. “Bitcoin remains legal tender.

37894029,https://crypto.news/?p=14321177,1734723868,This under $0.50 coin may soar like Cardano & Ripple – 4x surge potential ahead,"Disclosure: This content is provided by a third party. crypto.news does not endorse any product mentioned on this page. Users must do their own research before taking any actions related to the company. DTX Exchange, under $0.50, is poised for a 4x surge, drawing comparisons to ADA and XRP. Table of Contents DTX Exchange soars 500% ahead of exchange preview Cardano price rises, analyst remains optimistic Javon Marks: The price of Ripple could reach triple-digits DTX Exchange vs. Cardano vs. Ripple – Which crypto coin will surge first? With how fast the crypto market changes, it is important for investors to figure out what the next big gem will be before it takes off. Currently sitting at under $0.50, DTX Exchange (DTX) is seen as the next potential crypto coin to follow Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) in its potential price explosion. In fact, many experts even forecast a potential 4x price surge for this altcoin in 2025. You might also like: Last chance to get DTX Exchange before it soars, set to follow ETH, XRP DTX Exchange soars 500% ahead of exchange preview Due to their unique features, both Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) saw price explosions. For example, XRP redefined the cross-border payment system. DTX Exchange (DTX) may also revolutionize a sector like online trading. It will accomplish this by launching its hybrid trading platform with the best features of CEX and DEX into one. Therefore, traders will experience: Over 120K Asset Classes: DTX Exchange will provide access to over 120K asset classes, such as FX, stocks, crypto coins, etc. Up to 1000x Leverage: Traders can get up to 1000x leverage on their assets, which means that just a $100 investment could open up liquidity to $100,000. Privacy: No sign-up KYC checks will guarantee traders remain anonymous. Recently, DTX Exchange excited traders by announcing that its exchange preview is coming soon. With this development, VIP members will get early access to this platform. Therefore, many traders are now rushing to become VIP members. Currently, DTX Exchange is offering its native token, DTX, for a discount. It is in phase six of its presale with a value of $0.12, a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a pump to $0.20. With over $10M raised in this crypto ICO event, it is clear that people are interested. This could make DTX one of the top altcoins to keep an eye on. Cardano price rises, analyst remains optimistic Cardano has also been turning heads with its solid price performance recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Cardano jumped nearly 30% on the one-month chart. In that period, its value moved between around $0.75 and close to $1. Market analyst Crypto Eagles remains optimistic about this crypto coin. According to his X post, Cardano is now consolidating in a descending triangle pattern. He mentioned a $3 price target as a Cardano price prediction. Although the Cardano coin may see a surge soon, experts suggest it may not be noteworthy. Since this altcoin has already seen a 60% price rise on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. Therefore, traders are looking at DTX Exchange instead. Javon Marks: The price of Ripple could reach triple-digits As one of the best cryptos, Ripple also shows some green price charts. On the one-month chart, its value soared from around $1 to over $2. In other words, the Ripple price soared over 100% as per CoinMarketCap. Market expert Javon Marks thinks this bullish trend will continue. In a recent X post, he told his followers that Ripple could reach $168. According to his Ripple price prediction, this is over a 6,800% increase. However, it is worth noting that the Ripple crypto now has a market cap of $135B. This could mean a price surge may not be easy to achieve since it would need a lot of new money. Crypto coins like DTX will not face this issue. DTX Exchange vs. Cardano vs. Ripple – Which crypto coin will surge first? DTX Exchange, Cardano, and Ripple are some of the best cryptos to watch. They all could see big price gains. However, experts are more bullish for DTX. This altcoin will have a smaller market cap, which means faster price gains. Plus, with ties to the $1.4T FX market, its long-term stability could be better than the rest. Therefore, experts foresee its value potentially soaring by 4x in 2025.

The project is part of Project Guardian, a blockchain-focused initiative spearheaded by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Deutsche Bank and Interop Labs, the original developer of the Axelar Network, are collaborating on the initiative to provide secure cross-chain interoperability for financial institutions.

The network aims to simplify the complexities associated with multi-chain fund allocation and asset servicing for asset managers. Axelar’s technology plays a crucial role in enabling decentralized and secure cross-chain operations, which is a key requirement for traditional financial institutions like Deutsche Bank to effectively adopt blockchain technology. DAMA 2 is designed to bridge the gap between traditional financial systems and blockchain technology by integrating off-chain assets with the on-chain ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

37893945,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313619,1734723686,"Coinbase Withdraws Support for Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) As BTC Careens Below $100,000","Top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase is removing support for Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ) as the crypto king crashes below six figures. In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase Assets says it has disabled trading services for wBTC, the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain, as the digital asset no longer meets the firm’s listing standards. “We have disabled trading for wBTC. Your wBTC funds will remain accessible to you, and you will continue to have the ability to withdraw your funds at any time.” Coinbase – which first announced its decision to drop support for wBTC in November – said earlier this week that Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun being associated with the digital asset was an “unacceptable risk.” Last week, Coinbase was sued by wBTC custodian BiT Global – a firm associated with Sun – for allegedly using wBTC as a “cash grab” before ultimately creating its own version of it and delisting the competition. “Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” However, Coinbase responded and said that BiT Global is attempting to force them to do business with an entity that “no longer meets their standards.” “Coinbase made the decision – based on a rigorous internal process – that wBTC should be delisted from Coinbase’s exchange due to the unacceptable risk that control of wBTC would fall into the hands of Justin Sun… BiT seeks to force Coinbase to do business with an entity that no longer complies with Coinbase’s standards due to Mr. Sun’s ‘material involvement.'” According to Coinbase, Sun is an “infamous” figure in the crypto community and has been accused of many crimes, including market manipulation and misappropriation of funds. BTC is trading for $97,131 at time of writing, down over 10% from its all-time high of $108,135, reached three days ago.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-as-pepe-and-wif-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes over the past six months, rising by 67.15%. In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin's nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE remain notable, but XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports enthusiasts in a memecoin poised for 20,000% growth, aiming to become the G.O.A.T of all memecoins.

Join CYBRO Now Before the Next Big Jump Solana's SOL: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications, competing with Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out with its design that aims for faster transactions. Developers can build on it using multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana's native cryptocurrency. It is central to the ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value because it underpins the operation of Solana's network. It rewards participants and allows users access to a suite of projects on Solana. Unlike some platforms, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions. It aims to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Cardano's ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Platform for Decentralized Apps Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. It allows the creation of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is similar to Ethereum's ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially up to a million per second. Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Conclusion In the bullish climate of 2024, established coins like SOL and ADA may offer steady growth, but their short-term potential appears limited compared to innovative platforms. CYBRO, a technologically advanced DeFi platform, presents investors with unparalleled opportunities to maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain.

The Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) token rocketed to a market capitalization of $1 billion earlier in the day as fresh upside momentum helped cryptocurrencies stem the latest price downturn. The milestone on Dec. 20 came as the meme coin’s price spiked to new all-time high of $1.30. Gains in the past week stood at over 50%, while the parabolic performance seen over the past month meant FARTCOIN trended more than 370% up. Notably, the meme coin’s spike on the day came as Binance announced the listing of Fartcoin perpetual futures contract. Binance noted that the listing of AIXBT, FARTCOIN, KMNO and CGPT perpetual contracts aims at expanding trading choices for users. Binance Futures added the perpetual contracts for the tokens beginning 18:30 UTC on Dec. 20, offering up to 75x leverage.

This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially up to a million per second. Cardano native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, improving blockchain efficiency and scalability. Avalanche (AVAX): Layer-1 Blockchain with Customizable Subnets Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain known for its eco-friendly approach, low fees, and efficient transactions. It can process up to 4,500 transactions per second and allows users to launch customizable subnets. Avalanche uses a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than 2 seconds. The platform consists of 3 interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—which facilitate various operations like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX is the native token of Avalanche, serving important roles in the ecosystem such as transaction fees, network security through staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Chainlink (LINK): Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts to real-world data and systems. It enables smart contracts to securely access external data sources, APIs, and other systems. Chainlink uses oracles to fetch data, aggregates it to ensure accuracy, and delivers it securely to smart contracts. This enhances the utility of smart contracts by allowing them to interact with real-world applications. The LINK token is central to this system; it rewards data providers and supports staking for network security. Chainlink's approach could expand the capabilities of blockchain technology by bridging the gap between blockchains and external data. Exploring Polkadot: Connecting Blockchains for Seamless Interoperability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol that lets different blockchains communicate securely. It enables value and data to be shared between networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin without the need for intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing more transactions than Bitcoin or Ethereum. The DOT token is at the heart of this network, used for governance and staking. This allows holders to participate in the development of the protocol and help verify transactions. Developed by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and supported by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to make blockchains more interconnected and efficient. Conclusion While established altcoins like ADA, AVAX, LINK, and DOT may offer steady growth, their short-term potential appears limited in the current bull run. In contrast, CYBRO emerges as a highly promising opportunity. As a cutting-edge DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO leverages AI-powered yield aggregation to maximize investor returns. It provides attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, all within a user-friendly environment that ensures smooth deposits and withdrawals. With a strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has garnered significant interest from influential figures and large-scale investors. This makes CYBRO a standout choice for those seeking life-changing gains by 2025.

37893832,https://thecoinrise.com/base-network-outpaces-major-blockchain-in-users-growth/,1734722968,Base Network Outpaces Major Blockchain in Users Growth,"Coinbase’s Layer 2 blockchain, Base, is growing faster than Ethereum. In October 2024, Base gained 13.7 million new users, making it the fastest-growing blockchain platform. According to reports, Base gained an impressive 15.1 million super users, outnumbering Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon. Base is Becoming a Strong Player in the Crypto World This growth shows that Base is becoming a strong player in the crypto world. Several factors have contributed to this success, such as lower fees, faster transaction speeds, and a user-friendly experience, making Base an appealing alternative. Meanwhile, Base’s growth is due to new users and strong engagement. It has partnered with well-known decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and NFT marketplaces, building a solid system that encourages regular use. The blockchain network is also focused on improving features like scalability and user experience, which has helped boost its growth further. While Ethereum’s dominance in decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts remains unchallenged, Base’s ability to scale engagement quickly positions it as a powerful challenger. Base Network Outpaces Major Blockchains in Stablecoin Volume Base recently made headlines that it surpasses major blockchains in daily stablecoin volume . As reported by TheCoinRise, Base captured 30.06% of the total stablecoin transaction volume that day, beating out long-standing giants like Solana, Ethereum, and Tron. Solana trailed with a 25% share, while Ethereum and Tron followed with 20% and 16.7%, respectively. This milestone coincided with Base record-breaking 5.6 million daily transactions achievement , marking a 20% increase from the previous month. As stablecoin transactions have traditionally been dominated by Solana , which held a consistent 60% share until mid-June, Base’s emergence as a front-runner signals significant traction for the Ethereum-based layer-2 solution. Coinbase’s Base Surpasses $2B in TVL Recall that Base’s Total Value Locked (TVL) also surpassed $2 billion in September. This places the network one spot away from Arbitrum. Considering Base’s TVL at the beginning of the year, this achievement stunned many in the ecosystem. Experts attributed the increase in Base’s TVL to the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Aerodrome. Base’s impressive growth trajectory has often resulted in network issues in the Coinbase ecosystem. This perhaps informed Coinbase’s decision to roll out plans to launch a web app . The app has been designed to serve as a central node for users, facilitating better portfolio management.

However, BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads during its presale with its partnership with Inter Milan, one of the world’s most popular football clubs. This partnership puts the network in the spotlight and strengthens its presence in the market, driving up the demand for BDAG coins. BlockDAG’s presale has already crossed $170 million and is quickly moving toward the $600 million target, showing just how much interest and excitement this project is building. Let's explore how these three coins are making their moves to lead the next crypto bull run.

This strategic Sui partnership has enabled the tokenization of ESG assets, bringing a fresh perspective to the Web3 ecosystem. By integrating real-world assets into the blockchain, this Sui partnership offers global investors unique opportunities to engage with sustainable energy. This alliance has significantly boosted the Sui ecosystem, now the ninth most popular blockchain with a total value locked at $1.9 billion. The growth fueled by this Sui partnership continues to attract institutional support, making it easier for individuals to invest without the complexities of managing a crypto wallet. Ethereum Price Rises: What’s Next After $4K? The Ethereum (ETH) price recently surpassed $4,000, pointing to a potential upward trend. This movement is reminiscent of earlier cycles where a similar increase often marked the start of a sustained bullish phase. Analysts suggest that the Ethereum (ETH) price could follow historical patterns similar to those observed in Bitcoin's price movements. Investor sentiment is currently positive, as indicated by the increase in the Ethereum (ETH) price. This optimism is reflected in key market indicators showing that long-term holders believe the price could rise even further. Inter Milan Deal Powers BlockDAG’s Path to $600M Presale BlockDAG, a well-known name in the crypto space, is making waves with its partnerships with big global names. Its long-standing connection with Italian soccer giants, Inter Milan is a clear sign that this up-and-coming Layer 1 giant is catching the attention of top-tier teams and brands. By teaming up with Inter Milan, BlockDAG has proved its growing power as a cryptocurrency that's ready to play in the big leagues. This partnership has allowed the network to continue forging relationships with top-tier brands across industries. With Inter Milan's international following, BDAG's exposure is reaching new heights, attracting more eyes from buyers and partners alike. As BDAG continues to expand its network, it’s not hard to imagine more global brands coming into the fold. Speculations are swirling that BDAG could soon secure partnerships with even bigger names, from global tech giants to sports teams in other major leagues. For those looking to jump in before BlockDAG secures its next batch of multi-million partnerships and eventually goes mainstream, now is the perfect time. The BDAG coin is currently priced at $0.0234 in presale batch 26, but with demand surging, it won’t hold that level for long. The presale has already crossed $170 million and continues to climb by the minute. Consider the untapped potential here—BlockDAG’s presale could easily snowball into a $600M market value given its growing fanbase and rising engagement. With the momentum building, the future looks incredibly bright for this altcoin, making it the best crypto for the next crypto bull run . Closing Notes The Ethereum (ETH) price breaking past $4,000 shows strong market confidence and hints at a potential crypto bull run. At the same time, Sui’s partnership with renewable asset projects makes it a top pick for investors looking for sustainable options. But the real star here is BlockDAG, stealing the spotlight with its multi-million dollar deal with Inter Milan. This ongoing partnership shows just how much potential BlockDAG has to go fully mainstream. With its crypto presale already crossing $170 million, the $600 million target isn’t far away. For those seeking a crypto asset that’s both ultra-affordable and has the potential to unlock massive returns in the next bull run, BlockDAG is an opportunity not to be overlooked!

EVM+WASM Tech Sparks Massive Growth — Plus, Shocking Predictions for Litecoin & Fantom!","Recent Litecoin price trends show a stable increase, with LTC up by 2% to $119.13, although it encounters resistance at $122. In parallel, Fantom’s forecasted price jump of 14.57% to $1.40 is fueled by the buzz around its upcoming Sonic mainnet release. Moreover, BlockDAG (BDAG) , known for its utility-driven approach in the crypto world, is drawing significant interest due to its remarkable presale achievements. With presale revenues topping $170 million, BDAG’s price has escalated by 2240% over 26 batches. This dramatic increase, alongside BlockDAG’s superior EVM and WASM compatibility, has propelled it to the status of top trending crypto, with predictions pointing towards a potential rise to the $1 mark soon. Litecoin's Pricing Dynamics: A Closer Look Litecoin has recently reached $119.13, reflecting a modest gain of 2%. The persistent resistance at $122 poses a challenge to the Litecoin price trend. The support level at $115 provides some grounding, yet the recurring dips to this level spark concerns about maintaining momentum. Analysts note that surpassing the $122 mark could escalate prices, but the growth of Litecoin might be stymied without significant buying activity. A sustained positive Litecoin price trend would demand continuous buyer interest, which brings some doubt regarding its appeal over the long term. Although LTC maintains stability amidst market fluctuations, it faces difficulty matching the growth of top-trending crypto coins. Fantom (FTM) Forecast: A Push Towards $2? Fantom’s recent upswing by 14.57% to $1.40 comes as the community anticipates the Sonic mainnet launch, recognized for its rapid transactions and enhanced scalability. Despite this, prior price surges have often regressed, questioning its capacity to maintain these gains. While analysts remain hopeful about a Fantom (FTM) price prediction reaching $2, its long-term stability is still under assessment. The enthusiasm for the mainnet release might only be temporary unless it is supported by sustained growth. Fantom’s dependency on speculative interest also introduces more volatility, making its future direction less certain compared to projects with robust technical bases. BlockDAG’s Remarkable Presale Journey: Is $1 Within Reach? Celebrated as the most significant crypto presale this decade, BlockDAG has impressively amassed over $170 million in just a few months. Early adopters of this rising crypto powerhouse have enjoyed an enormous 2240% ROI as BDAG’s price advanced from $0.001 in its initial batch to $0.0234 in the latest batch 26. Predictions now suggest BDAG could soon hit the $1 mark, potentially offering a 4200% return for those who buy early. Currently, over 17.4 billion BDAG coins have been distributed to holders, with the demand increasing daily as whales pour millions into the presale. Each presale batch has shown significant price growth, and with $170 million already raised, BlockDAG’s $600 million goal seems achievable. Market analysts attribute BlockDAG’s impressive presale success to its forward-thinking ecosystem that continues to attract both developers and traders. Its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) facilitates the smooth transition of Ethereum-based projects, leveraging faster transactions and superior scalability. Additionally, BlockDAG’s compatibility with WebAssembly (WASM) allows developers to craft high-performance decentralized apps using familiar programming languages. For those considering involvement in this rapidly expanding project, the present price point of $0.0234 per coin offers an attractive entry opportunity. As the project approaches batch 27, expected to feature a notable price increase, acting promptly could secure BDAG at a favorable rate before it climbs further. Current Crypto Market Trends The Litecoin price trend demonstrates steady growth, maintaining around $119.13, while Fantom’s price forecast reflects optimism following a 14.57% rise due to the Sonic mainnet launch anticipation. However, maintaining their momentum remains a challenge for both projects. Conversely, BlockDAG continues to set presale records, surpassing $170 million with a 2240% price increase over 26 batches. With cutting-edge technology and expert forecasts suggesting a possible $1 valuation soon, BlockDAG stands as the leading crypto project , offering substantial growth prospects and an appealing entry point.

37895153,https://invezz.com/?p=2398351,1734722614,Fartcoin hits $1.29 ATH as the broader crypto market bleeds,"While the cryptocurrency market is no stranger to surprises, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) has astonished even the most seasoned investors with its meteoric rise as the broader cryptocurrency market bleeds. While most altcoins struggle under bearish market conditions, the humour-driven Solana-based meme coin has surged 362% to an all-time high (ATH) of $1.3, boasting a market capitalization of close to $1.3 billion. Why is the Fartcoin price rising? Over the past 30 days, Fartcoin has surged by an incredible 362.8%, becoming a standout performer in a struggling cryptocurrency market. However, despite the remarkable price surge, Fartcoin has displayed remarkable volatility since it was launched on October 24, 2024. Its market cap jumped to $423 million by November 22, only to plunge to $160 million by December 5, before soaring the about $1.3 billion at press time on December 20. Blockchain analytics firm Santiment attributes Fartcoin’s growth to surging trading volumes, which reflect increased liquidity. Additionally, its social dominance —a metric that tracks online discussions about a cryptocurrency — has risen to 1.01%. This uptick suggests that Fartcoin is gaining significant traction among investors and enthusiasts. Additionally, Binance has today announced it will be adding Fartcoin perpetual futures with up to 75x leverage, causing the token to witness a 15% surge today. Despite lacking utility, the meme coin’s absurd theme and speculative appeal have struck a chord, propelling it past established altcoins, which have suffered double-digit losses during the same period. The broader market struggles Fartcoin’s rally comes amidst a challenging environment for cryptocurrencies. The broader market took a hit following the US Federal Reserve’s 25-basis-point rate cut, which signalled a cautious approach to monetary easing in 2025. Many altcoins have faced significant declines, leaving investors searching for safer or more speculative assets. In this context, Fartcoin has emerged as an unlikely “safe haven.” Prominent analysts and investors have humorously remarked on Fartcoin’s success. Morgan Stanley Investment Management senior portfolio manager Andrew Slimmon during an interview on CNBC went ahead to state, “Advisors are nervous because their clients are calling and saying “I want fartcoin.” Despite slightly pulling back on the hourly chart, the absence of significant overhead resistance, coupled with a positive shift in the Bull Bear Power (BBP) indicator, suggests that Fartcoin’s bullish momentum could continue. FARTCOIN Chart by TradingView Analysts speculate that its price may reach $2 in the near term, elevating its market cap to $2 billion buoyed by the thriving Solana memecoin ecosystem.

Beneath their humorous façade lies a surprising truth that meme coins can yield staggering returns for those who sniff out the right opportunity at the right time. With 2025 on the horizon, the competition among dog-inspired cryptos is fiercer than ever. While some bark louder than they bite, others have shown the potential to fetch unimaginable gains. Let's take a look at the top dog meme coins. 1. DOGE2014: A Tribute with Big Potential DOGE2014 marks Dogecoin's 10th anniversary with more than nostalgia by raising over $750K in presale and offers an entry price as low as $0.00022 per coin. With tiered bonuses and free Dogecoin for VIPs, it positions itself as a promising contender among meme coins. Its low price and homage to a legendary token could fuel significant growth, especially considering the meteoric rise of similar coins. It is evident that DOGE2014 can experience exponential growth. Early investors have potential for high gains, especially considering its low entry price, big rewards and the nostalgia factor associated with Dogecoin's legacy. With the presale at its final stages, early backers are in for a treat with massive discounts (tiered) and FREE Dogecoin (for VIPs) before it becomes a major hit. 2. Dogecoin: The Original Pioneer Launched at just $0.0002, Dogecoin skyrocketed to an all-time high of $0.73 in 2021 with a staggering growth of over 365,000%. Its rise was fueled by a strong community and high-profile endorsements, cementing its place as the OG meme coin. Though its value has retraced since its peak, Dogecoin remains a cornerstone of the meme coin market, proving the power of community and timing in crypto. While its future may depend on renewed momentum, its legacy as the original meme coin is unshakable. But with Elon Musk standing firm behind it, along with a crypto-friendly president-elect, Dogecoin enthusiasts are hoping for the OG meme coin to hit $1 in 2025, possibly even more. 3. Shiba Inu: The Ecosystem Builder Kicking off in 2020 Shiba Inu skyrocketed to an all-time high of $0.00008845. But don’t let the long string of zeros fool you. Shiba Inu's earliest investors were given an astonishing ROI of over 7,000,000%. Often seen as an innovative addition to the meme coin world, Shiba Inu has grown from just a fad and possesses a more modern outlook of offering utility through its DeFi ecosystem Shibarium and even a built-in DEX called ShibaSwap, attracting a loyal community. Its stable performance highlights the potential of meme coins to captivate investors and communities alike. While Dogecoin remains the pioneer and gold standard, Shiba Inu has contributed to expanding the meme coin market and inspiring new developments in the space. 4. Bonk: Solana’s Rising Star Launched in 2022, Bonk has quickly earned its spot among the top meme coins with impressive surges in popularity. It reached an all-time high of $0.00005916 in November 2024, showcasing its potential to deliver significant returns. Backed by community initiatives and strategic token-burning events, it has carved out a niche as Solana’s first major dog-themed contender. Bonk’s growth reflects the dynamic nature of meme coins, where there is still a very deep demand for dog-themed coins, even when on blockchain networks that were once low in demand. While its future depends on sustaining this momentum, its connection to Solana gives it a solid foundation to build on. Final Thoughts The world of meme coins is dynamic and unpredictable, with each token presenting its own blend of opportunities and risks. DOGE2014 emerges as a standout, leveraging the legacy of its predecessors while offering big rewards and discounts during the final stages of its presale and unique potential for growth. The dual nature of being a meme coin itself and paying tribute to the original Dogecoin makes it an excellent choice to hold for massive gains in 2025.

The cryptocurrency started the week off quite strongly, as it touched a record high of ~$108K on Tuesday, however, its rise tapered as the Fed signalled fewer cuts in 2025 on Wednesday. BTC went below the $100K mark on Thursday, and at the time of writing has failed to go past it. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points, as expected, and signalled two more cuts next year. Fed Chair Powell also said that the Fed is ""not allowed to hold Bitcoin ( BTC-USD )"", and it's not looking for a law change that would allow that. “Bitcoin's price dip is likely more correlated to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent comments indicating fewer rate cuts in 2025 than it is related to the shutdown drama,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a bitcoin financial services firm. Crypto markets suffered extended losses as Trump's plans to create a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve may fall apart even before he gets in office after Powell said that the Fed is not allowed to hold Bitcoin and they're not looking for a law change, Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. Wall Street's major market averages also witnessed a sell-off after the Fed's statements. ""Although an interest rate cut would normally have a bullish reaction since it was largely expected, the market strongly reacted after Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation would be a continuing problem throughout the next year,"" Ruck said. The U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds also saw record outflows on Thursday, a CoinDesk report stated. ""But in the mid to long run, we believe that monetary and fiscal stimulus policies in both the US and other parts of the world will ultimately expand liquidity across financial markets, especially as other countries seek to protect their economies against Trump tariffs. This will boost crypto markets, and especially Bitcoin as it becomes more of a safe haven asset akin to gold,"" said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE. Bitcoin's fall from the $100K mark comes amid fears of a government shutdown in the U.S., after a spending bill backed by President-elect Donald Trump was voted down in the U.S. House of Representatives.

This milestone allows XRP holders to utilize their assets in DeFi without selling their XRP. Hoos.crypto, a prominent crypto enthusiast, highlighted this development on X, stating, “Behold the FAsset portal where you can mint FXRP using your XRP and participate in DeFi.” Behold the FAsset portal where you can mint FXRP using your XRP and participate in DeFi like some sort of mofo and avoid selling your XRP! Congratulations to @FlareNetworks and the entire community! Please remember that Songbird is the canary network for Flare used for… pic.twitter.com/YRJne7fa4O — hoos.crypto (@husseinb) December 18, 2024 How FXRP Works The FAsset portal provides a gateway for users to engage in DeFi applications such as trading, lending, and staking. FXRP minting operates on a secure, overcollateralized model, ensuring stability and trust. After a strong performance during beta testing, FXRP has maintained its popularity. As shown in the image shared by Hoos.crypto, the system currently boasts collateral health of over 935%, with $878,000 in total collateral backing $93,000 in circulating FXRP. Songbird, the Flare testing environment, plays a vital role in refining the FAssets system. According to Flare Networks, this environment allows real-world testing using assets like Songbird’s native token (SGB) and USDX as collateral. This testing phase ensures stability before broader deployment. Rewards and Security Measures for Participants According to a Flare blog post , minting caps are set to $2 million per asset during this period. Flare Labs also offers insurance to protect users, covering losses up to $300,000. Active participants in Songbird’s FXRP ecosystem are also incentivized with rewards, including retroactive airdrops in rFLR tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The minting process involves agents and collateral providers as demonstrated by Songbird’s active collateral pools. For example, Oracle Daemon, one of the top agents, currently manages $157,000 in collateral and generates rewards. These mechanisms ensure that FXRP remains overcollateralized, securing the system for all participants. Hoos.crypto further emphasized the importance of Songbird as a testbed, stating, “Songbird is the canary network for Flare used for game-theoretic testing with real value.” With features such as decentralized exchange (DEX) on platforms like BlazeSwap and Enosys, the FXRP ecosystem is gradually expanding, providing liquidity and incentivizing participants. Flare Networks’ ultimate goal is to become a liquidity hub for bridging assets across ecosystems. FAssets like FXRP allow non-smart contract assets, including XRP, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin, to interact with smart contracts. This innovation opens multi-trillion-dollar markets while maintaining security through over-collateralization.

But as I look more analytically, I’m starting to get it, and to respect the field. I’m also developing respect for MicroStrategy, which went all in on a bitcoin treasury strategy in late 2020. Using what it calls “intelligent leverage,” the company has become much more than a passive speculation on bitcoin pricing. The company’s business acumen is worth something, so the stock deserves to sell at a premium to the company’s bitcoin holdings… but I’m undecided on how much the premium should be. The Seeking Alpha community as a whole is Bearish on MicroStrategy (NASDQ: MSTR) and its bitcoin operation. Its overall SA Analysts Rating is “Sell.” I suspect many here agree with Warren Buffett. When it comes to stock picking, I get it. And I, too, am a big fan. But crypto is a deicer matter. In 2018 , Buffett said bitcoin is “probably rat poison squared.” His long-time cohort, the late Charlie Munger, described crypto trading as “just dementia.” As Bitcoin gained ground, Buffett remained opposed. He said, at the Berkshire Hathaway 2022 annual meeting… Now if you told me you own all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn't take it because what would I do with it? I'd have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn't going to do anything. But today, we have to wonder if he’s starting to soften his stance. Buffett, invested in Nu Holdings, a Brazilian fintech company. Here’s an intriguing 3/26/24 Yahoo! Finance tidbit about that : Nu Holdings, established in 2013, launched the Nucripto platform in 2022, allowing users to trade over 15 tokens. The company’s performance has been impressive, with a 100% market surge in 2023 and another 50% rise in early 2024. This investment success has put Buffett in a tricky position, as Nu Holdings’ performance, up nearly 125% this year, is sharply contrasting with his negative stance on Bitcoin. So, the million dollar (or 10 bitcoin) question is: Might Buffett be evolving regarding crypto. I don’t know the answer. But the fact that I or anyone can even wonder about this without being impaired to the point where one shouldn’t drive… that says something. One thing it says to me is that MSTR seems worth another look. The Company Has Had an Interesting Journey MSTR debuted in 1989 as a business intelligence (BI) software company. It went public on 6/11/98. That was just in time for the dot-com bubble and bust. It had an especially bad early history. On 3/20/00, the bursting of the bubble and an accounting controversy caused MSTR stock to plummet 62%... in just that one day! The SEC got involved . Fines and disgorgement (of allegedly improper profits) resulted. Some divestitures followed. But eventually in 2011, something good happened. The company expanded its software offering to the cloud. MicroStrategy 2020 , the newest release, debuted in February 2020. And then, everything changed… Here is how MSTR explained things on page 10 of its 2021 10-k: In September 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Treasury Reserve Policy… that updated our treasury management and capital allocation strategies, under which our treasury reserve assets will consist of *cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments (“Cash Assets”) held by us that exceed working capital requirements; and * bitcoin held by us, with bitcoin serving as the primary treasury reserve asset on an ongoing basis, subject to market conditions and anticipated needs of the business for Cash Assets. **** In 2021, we determined to adopt, in addition to and in conjunction with our Treasury Reserve Policy, a business strategy of purchasing bitcoin, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, issue debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase bitcoin. **** We view our bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin or to hedge or otherwise enter into derivative contracts with respect to our bitcoin holdings, though we may sell bitcoins in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes. MSTR is still in the BI software business. But this operation remains in the red. And it has a minuscule 1.24% market share . (The leader, Notion, has a 21.95% share.) By now, the bitcoin activities are heavily overpowering the software operation. The latter may yet gain relevance going forward in connection with Bitcoin. I’ll address that below. For now... The Investment Case Around MSTR Relates to What it’s Doing with Bitcoin Think of MSTR as an asset play-plus. The asset is, of course, bitcoin. We’ve seen asset-oriented companies before. Banks hold loans. Energy and mining companies hold reserves. REITs hold real estate. Business Development Companies (BDCs) hold often-private business investments. And MSTR holds bitcoin. MSTR is presently noteworthy in that its asset doesn’t generate current income. (Bank loans and investments, by way of contrast, generate interest income. REIT properties generate rent. Energy companies regularly sell product they extract from their reserves.) MSTR doesn’t presently generate income from its bitcoin “reserves.” But that may soon change. FASB (the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting rules) just struck a major blow favoring crypto … one that will be huge for MSTR. Up till now, companies holding crypto had to value it at cost minus impairment losses (in other words, they had to write the value of their holding down if the price of crypto declined). But they couldn’t write the assets up when prices recovered. That means MSTR’s historical financials look beyond horrific. It had to recognize market losses. But it couldn’t account for gains. So, MSTR’s balance sheets have drastically understated the real value of the company’s bitcoin holdings. MSTR IR Starting with fiscal years that begin after 12/15/24, crypto can be carried at market value. That means MSTR will keep booking losses… but going forward, it will also be able to book gains as income. This will make MSTR’s future numbers look more reasonable. For now, though, given the accounting rules that governed MSTR’s crypto holdings until now, and the diminished role of the software business, I won’t show any of the financial tables I usually present. (Comparing any MSTR numbers to the Application Software industry medians is meaningless. In fact, I expect data providers to eventually give MSTR a new industry assignment.) But don’t fret. I have plenty with which I can now work. Let’s start by looking more closely on the nature of MSTR’s bitcoin operation. After all, I used the phrase “asset play-plus.” We definitely need to understand why I added “plus.” MSTR’s Bitcoin Operation Take the “plus” in asset-play plus as a hint that we shouldn’t treat MSTR as if it were an ETP (Exchange Traded Product, like an ETF) that holds Bitcoin. It’s not. There’s a also business here. MSTR is a specialized treasury operations business. But it’s a business, nonetheless. MSTR IR Its main thing is buying and mainly holding bitcoins. And it’s bought a lot since it adopted this strategy. MSTR IR But it doesn’t just buy willy nilly It does through an approach it calls “intelligent leverage.” It’s about how management chooses to fund its bitcoin purchases. It does so by issuing new debt and/or equity. It aims to increase the number of coins it owns by more than the number of diluted shares. (Use of diluted shares is important. Most of the debt MSTR issues is convertible.) Here’s how it’s done recently. MSTR IR Management tracks its efforts through a metric if calls BTC Yield. This compares change in the number of coins to change in the number of diluted shares. MSTR IR Here’s the historical trend. (KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator). MSTR IR Here are recent BTC yields compared to future target yields. MSTR IR The company plans to raise capital through what it refers to as its “21/21 plan.” Management explains that this is based on the number 42. Start with Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy . This science fiction multi-media franchise refers to a supercomputer called “Deep Thought.” It spent 7.5 million years calculating “the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything.” The answer is the number 42. Speaking of 42, management says… It's the sum of 21 plus 21. And we all know that 21 is a magic, a magical number. In the world of Bitcoin, there can only ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins in circulation. MicroStrategy owns about 1.2% of this Bitcoin today. Today, MicroStrategy is announcing its ambitious capital market strategic plan for the next three years, from the years 2025 to 2027, the company is targeting to raise $42 billion of capital, comprised of $21 billion of equity capital and $21 billion of fixed income capital, primarily for the purpose of acquiring Bitcoin. If it were me, I’d have just said the company expects to raise new capital ($42 billion or whatever) allocated 50% to equity and 50% to debt. MSTR IR Whatever… I can be cool. So I’ll go along with 42, split into 21 and 21. MSTR IR Considering that debt is part of the picture, a bitcoin hater can easily panic. “Oh my God! What will happen to MSTR if bitcoin crashes? How will it deal with all that debt?” Answer: The same way a bank would if a bunch of loans went bad or if bonds in which it invests fall. The same way a REIT would if its real estate crashes in value. In other words, MSTR would suffer, and so, too, would its shares. (We’ve already seen that with banks and REITs whose assets went sour.) But it’s not as if MSTR is going way the heck out on a limb (as did banks that loaded up on and clung to long-term fixed-income when rates were near zero without having realized how natural it would be for rate to rise and fixed-income to fall .) A lot of MSTR’s the debt is convertible to equity and carries low interest rates. MSTR IR MSTR IR And now, please refer now back to the above image comparing MSTR to bitcoin ETPs. Notice MSTR hasn’t forgotten it still has a BI software business. It’s not adding much now. But as bitcoin adoption spreads, MSFT’s presence and expertise could boost that operation. For example there’s something out there called the Lightning Network . It’s a allows for peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions that are initially done off (or, rather, “on top of”) the main blockchain. All of them eventually make their way to the blockchain. But this extra layer facilitates fast, even real-time, transfer and secure tracking. MSTR’s software business could eventually become noticeably bigger as it develops offerings based on things like the Lightning Network. All in all, and without even a big software contribution yet, MSTR shares have dramatically outperformed bitcoin since the company got into the area. MSTR IR Comparisons to the S&P 500 and the Magnificent 7 are nice. But I don’t swoon over stuff like that. It was an especially strong period for bitcoin. Who knows if, when or how often that will repeat. The comparison between MSTR and Bitcoin is much more interesting. It’s based heavily on intelligent leverage. And it confirms that MSTR isn’t a passive speculation on bitcoin. The company is running a legitimate bitcoin-based business… and so far, it’s been doing it well. Valuing MSTR Based on Bitcoin’s Current Price Level My usual valuation table would be meaningless given the nature of this situation. So I’ll borrow an idea from my recent Destiny Tech 100 ( DXYZ ) writeup . There, I valued the closed-end fund based on the value of its portfolio holdings. Here, I’m going to value MSTR based on the value of its bitcoin holdings. Author's compilation based on MSTR SEC documents and Yahoo! Finance prices Author's calculations based on MSTR SEC documents and Yahoo! Finance prices There’s the answer. MSTR currently sells at a 237% premium to the value of its bitcoin holdings. If you’ve read my DXYZ reports, you know I said “Strong Sell” for that CEF on 9/11/24 because the stock sold for a 114% premium back then. And on 12/17/24 , I vigorously reiterated my rating given the stock’s wild 991% premium to pro forma net asset value (adjusted to account for a big jump in the value of DXYZ’s Space X holdings). So, you might expect me to say Strong Sell for MSTR. Not quite. Look at the overall 12/31/20-12/19/24 percentage changes in the table above. Notice how the market value of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and share price walloped the percentage change in the price of bitcoin. Unlike DXYZ, MSTR is not a fund… It’s a business. And its reasonable to for MSTR investors to put a value on the business (intelligent leverage, potential future opportunities for MSTR’s software). So, a premium is warranted here. As you can see from the asset valuation tables above, Mr. Market has usually recognized that, and allowed for a premium, since the company began its bitcoin endeavors. (The 2022 exception is completely understandable. Interest rates rose that year.) Before assessing whether what the current premium means for MSTR shares, let’s consider… The Big Risk – Future Bitcoin Pricing To the casual observer, price movements may seem driven entirely by hope and hype. Although I’m an old timer and not personally a crypto guy, I’ve seen enough in life and in my career to recognize that the area deserves more respect than that. Like everything else, the price of bitcoin reflects the inter-relationship of supply and demand. And again like everything else, we can and should rationally evaluate why supply and demand are what they are. Supply The supply side is clearcut. Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million coins. It’s beyond the scope of this article to explain all the details. For now, you’ll be fine with a high level sense of the basics. Suffice it to say there are specific rules that determine how many new coins are granted to “miners” who successfully solve the necessary algorithmic puzzle. It started at 50 coins. The amount then halved after each 210,000 new coins. On 4/19/24, the award halved from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125. In May 2024, there were about 19.7 million Bitcoins in circulation . The mining process will end after another 1.3 million coins are awarded. So Bitcoin is not like a renewable resource. Its supply is limited. Here’s where Bitcoin stands relative to other investable assets. MSTR IR Are you having trouble finding bitcoin? If so, squint at the upper left corner of the heat-map-like image. Bitcoin, as an asset class, is still so small, it’s representation can’t even fill out a full rectangle. (Since that image was generated, bitcoin’s chaptalization moved closer to $2 trillion. But that’s still tiny.) This makes for something very desirable … scarcity! Demand No matter how scarce a resource, its price will stay at zero unless there’s demand. So why would anyone want it? That’s a heck of a question. But it’s not confined to Bitcoin or any other kind of crypto. Why own gold? In 2023, technology accounted for only 6.69% of gold demand. Investment and central banks accounted for 23.32% and 21.25% respectively. How much more practical is that than a bitcoin stash? Even jewelry demand, the remaining 48.74% of demand, is debatable. How much of that is actually worn, and how much is just stashed in a vault. Gold today is about $2,600 per ounce. What might the price be if weren’t in demand by those who don’t actually use it for practical purposes. Desire to Own something just for the heck of it is a long-established bona fide source of demand. Consider, too, art and other collectables. What portion of such an object’s price is based on “I like to look at it.” And for the vast amounts locked away in storage, the desire to own something scarce – without actually using it – accounts for 100% of its value. As a long-ago (1970s) part-time student at the Art Students League of New York , I understand and appreciate the emotional benefits of having a beautiful physical object. But the world has evolved. We’re now also into cyber things. Do you have any physical certificates for the stocks you own? How much cash do you actually carry? Not long ago, collectors paid up for NFTs ( non-fungible tokens … digital art). I personally am not into crypto. But understanding as I do the appeal of scarce things, and the evolution of digital stuff, I won’t sneer at Bitcoin or crypto. I won’t own it. But I won’t disrespect those who do own or want it. So how much real demand is there? Enough today to meet the supply curve at a price of around $96,000 as of this writing. Inflation, for one thing, makes crypto a store of value. And Bitcoin’s very established market and liquidity makes it especially desirable relative to other crypto currencies. The incoming Trump administration figures to be very crypto friendly . Trump even floated the idea of creating a strategic crypto reserve . There’s also the aforementioned accounting rule change that will make MSTR’s future numbers look more reasonable. That’s also likely to boost corporate demand in general. Corporations that want to hold crypto in treasury may become more willing to do so. Also, starting with luxury goods , crypto may gradually find its way into regular commerce. In the short term, crypto is apt to remain very volatile. Increases in interest rates, if thy come, would likely push crypto down. (Carrying costs would rise. And cash yielding investment would become more competitive.) But for the long term, I do envision rising demand for crypto in general and Bitcoin in particular. What to do About MSTR Stock One could argue that changing governmental, regulatory and commercial attitudes toward crypto might justify more than 100%-plus premiums than we’ve seen in the past. Consider, too, that effective 12/23/24, MSTR will join the NASDAQ 100 . Just being part of that index, and the ETFs that track it, will add a new source of passive-investor demand for MSTR shares., The remaining question is whether the now 200%-plus premium is too high. Here’s what Mr. Market is thinking right now. StockCharts.com The stock is losing steam after having had a nice run. The 10-day exponential moving average (EMA) is starting to turn down toward the 50-day EMA. Consider, too, Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO). Both measure which party to trades is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general. Both indicators turned negative. Sellers are now more motivated than buyers. That restrains stock prices. All that is understandable given bitcoin’s recent strength and the stock’s recently rise in the premium relative to its bitcoin portfolio. We’ll need more time to see what a reasonable premium should be. As I’ve said before, my investment stance depends mainly on whether I think a stock will be better than, in line with, or worse than market. Here’s how I apply that to the Seeking Alpha rating system: “Strong Buy” means I see the stock as being better than the market and I’m bullish about the direction of the market. “Buy” means I see the stock as being better than the market but am not confident about the market’s near-term direction. “Hold” means I see the stock as moving in line with the market. “Sell” means I see the stock as being worse than the market but am not confident about the market’s near-term direction. “Strong Sell” means I see the stock as being worse than the market and I’m bearish about the direction of the market. Based on intelligent leverage and potential increased bitcoin demand, I won’t go bearish. But until the market settles into more normal premium based on changing demand dynamics, I won’t go bullish either. So, I’ll stay neutral. So based on this scale, I’m rating MSTR as a “Hold.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745663-microstrategy-bitcoin-business-deserve-more-respect?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37893239.jpeg

All signs are pointing at DeFi Summer 2.0 — Winter Edition. But with $HYPE already pumped so high, what other DEX plays are there that can follow its trajectory? $CRV $CRV is the token of Curve Finance, the oldest, biggest, most secure, and most respected DEX with a TVL of over $2 billion. But Curve is not resting on past laurels, instead actively partnering with some of the fastest growing blockchains like TON. Together, they are developing CFMM (Constant Functional Market Maker) — a mechanism to efficiently trade similar assets (e.g. stablecoins and Bitcoin derivatives) with minimal price impact. During the long bear market, $CRV fell along with all other tokens but was clearly oversold. Already, it has bounced by over 200% from the bottom but still has ways to go before hitting the high of the previous bull run. And since each top of the cycle tends to set a much higher high than the previous one, even an amateur chart drawer can figure out where $CRV could be heading. $EYWA $EYWA is the governance token of EYWA , one of the top projects in Curve’s ecosystem, one that has already raised over $8.5M in investment. The Project has Curve’s founder as its lead investor and very impressive traction for its DeFiLlama Top 10 regular CrossCurve DEX, which boasts $1.85 billion in trading volume, over $21 million in TVL, and 3.5+ million transactions. CrossCurve solves the liquidity fragmentation problem by eliminating the need to establish a liquidity pool on every chain, instead letting projects list crosschain — immediately getting access to 16 chains and making attracting liquidity much cheaper and simultaneously more worthwhile for liquidity providers themselves. History was made when $UNIT0 from Units Blockchain became the first CrossCurve crosschain listing, with instant ETH and stablecoin liquidity on many chains. EYWA is attracting strong partnerships from the likes of the TON and Sonic foundations. The $EYWA token itself is getting listed on December 20th on KuCoin, Gate.io, and MEXC — and then it’s off to the races. AERO The Base Layer 2 chain has long stepped out of the shadow of Coinbase to become a powerful ecosystem bringing the world onchain. Its peak 7-day volume has surpassed $1B, and it keeps attracting new projects and value. Aerodrome Finance is the top DEX on Base, and its explosion in volume has not gone unnoticed in the $AERO token’s price. Aerodrome is already the 6th largest DEX by TVL with $1.8B. And the way Base adoption is growing, $AERO’s recent ATH may soon look like a distant low. RAY Everyone paying attention to Solana in the last couple of years knows two narratives: Solana vs Ethereum and Solana as the home of memecoins. Both are very bullish for one of Solana’s two main DEXs — Raydium. $RAY’s 47x from an ATL a year ago may feel like a missed opportunity. Yet, it’s only ⅓ of $REY’s ATH made back in 2021. Just like with CRV, this market is likely to see a new high for $RAY that may leave its previous achievement in the dust. Conclusion Of course, nobody knows the future, least of all when it comes to crypto prices. Still, the bull cycle caused by the halving every 4 years has so far worked like clockwork in its general trends. When trading, one should study the past and try his best to project that into the future. Trends can change swiftly and be replaced by new ones. But blockchains will very likely continue to rely on DEXs to process the massive volume of bull market transactions whatever the trend driving them is.

Among the most notable are Kaspa ( KAS ) and Algorand ( ALGO ), two digital assets projected to surpass the $5 billion market cap threshold. These projections hinge on sustained bullish sentiment, growing ecosystem adoption, and the influence of supply inflation, which could drive market cap growth even if price movements remain steady. Algorand (ALGO) Algorand, with a current market cap of $2.71 billion, is emerging as a strong contender to reach a $5 billion valuation by 2025. According to DefiLlama , Algorand’s Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by 25%, climbing from $117 million on November 22 to $147 million, underscoring the rising adoption of its decentralized finance ( DeFi ) applications.

Moreover, the derivatives data paints a bullish picture. The long-to-short ratio on Binance, a key indicator of market sentiment, stands at a bullish 3.9334, with top traders also favoring longs at a ratio of 1.1926. KAS Derivatives data.

For investors and traders, both Kaspa and Algorand present compelling opportunities, supported by strong fundamentals and bullish technical indicators. Monitoring key price levels, trading volumes, and ecosystem updates will be essential for maximizing gains as both assets position themselves for their next phase of growth.

The PCE YoY rose by 2.4% in November, below the expected 2.5%. Similarly, core PCE came out at 2.8%, below the consensus 2.9% figure. The monthly PCE data also indicated that the economists could have been overestimating the threat of sticky inflation, a decidedly bullish scenario for risk assets. BTC is up by 5.5% following the PCE release, while altcoins are also showing bullish strength. Is The Bottom In For Crypto? This week’s crypto price crash has been attributed to US Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish FOMC speech. While the central bank did cut its interest rates by 25 basis points in line with the market expectations, Powell suggested that the rate cuts could slow down going forward. Indeed, the Fed’s latest Survey of Economic Projections (SEP) revised-up the policy rate and inflation projections. This is a decidedly bearish scenario for risk assets like cryptocurrencies, considering the Bitcoin price shows a strong correlation with the global money supply. As such, experts are projecting a 20%-25% correction in BTC due to the recent tightening in the Global M2 Money Supply. This could result in a larger Bitcoin price crash to $81,000. 📰 Global liquidity (M2) and Bitcoin's price: A synchronized dance🟠 Bitcoin's price has historically mirrored global M2 money supply trends, often with a 70-day lag.🟠 Recent analyses suggest a potential 20–25% BTC price correction due to tightening M2 liquidity.🟠 2025 rate… pic.twitter.com/2WHGgFKv7F — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) December 10, 2024 However, the latest PCE data suggests that the Federal Reserve could have overestimated the inflationary pressure in the US economy. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee admitted as much in his latest comments. In fact, the Head Macro Economist at Swiss Block Henrik Zeberg reveals that a recession is a much bigger threat to the US economy than inflation. And yet.... Powell was so focused on inflation 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/ztKS8nHb9b — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) December 20, 2024 Warren Pies of 3Fourteen Research also believes that the Fed will cut more next year than the latest SEP indicates, which is a decidedly bullish scenario for cryptocurrencies. The Bitcoin price has bounced back nearly 6% from its local bottom and is currently trading at $97,300 at press time. Best Crypto To Buy The Dip? The crypto market’s next leg up could belong to altcoins. Data from LookOnChain suggests that the whales have been buying Ethereum on the latest dips. Arkham Intelligence reveals that Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial also purchased $2.5 million worth of ETH, bringing its total Ethereum holdings to $50.5 million. DONALD TRUMP IS BUYING THE DIPThe World Liberty Finance Treasury just bought $2.5M ETH with USDC.World Liberty Finance currently holds $50.5M of ETH. pic.twitter.com/RR3Bwz0r0m — Arkham (@arkham) December 20, 2024 Experts believe that XRP is also one of the best crypto to buy now. The token fared better than other large-cap altcoins in this week’s crash and has formed a double-bottom on its price chart. The XRP price is already up by nearly 13% since the double-bottom formation. Smart money investors are also buying low-cap meme coins, projecting that they could deliver outsized returns in the coming “altseason”. For instance, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) continued to display a stellar performance in its presale despite the broader market crash. The WEPE ICO has now raised nearly $33 million in less than a month. Besides being a frog-themed meme coin, Wall Street Pepe is a high-utility token. Smart money investors are particularly impressed by its upcoming VIP “alpha calls” group which could see strong retail interest in the coming bull market. All WEPE holders will be members of this group and receive cutting-edge market alpha, trading strategies and the best cryptos to invest in. Unsurprisingly, prominent experts are bullish on WEPE’s upside, with many calling it the next 100x meme coin.

As the agency prepares for a leadership transition, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has hinted at a potential shift away from the SEC’s historically cautious stance on cryptocurrencies toward a more innovation-friendly approach. In an exclusive interview, SEC Commissioner Peirce expressed optimism about the SEC’s future under new leadership. With SEC Chairman Gary Gensler set to step down on January 20, 2025, and former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins set to take over, Peirce described the transition as a time of “optimism” and “opportunity.” “It’s a transition period for everybody in Washington right now, and I think the same is true for the SEC,” Peirce said, acknowledging that the full impact of the new administration will take time, while noting that some changes could start immediately. Related News: The Decline Also Hit Donald Trump: All 6 Altcoins He Bought Suffered Major Decline Commissioner Peirce highlighted two key areas ripe for reconsideration under the new administration: cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and staking for Ethereum-based ETFs. The SEC has previously resisted allowing in-kind payments, which could streamline ETF operations and improve tax and market efficiency by preventing unwanted assets from being converted to cash. Similarly, while bitcoin and ethereum ETFs have attracted billions in assets, U.S. issuers remain prohibited from staking those assets for yield. “If the majority of Commissioners who don’t want things to work out turn into a majority of Commissioners who do, then yes, it would be easier,” Peirce explained, expressing his belief that these issues would be revisited early on under new leadership. Peirce also hinted at broader regulatory reforms, including potentially stepping back to allow the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to take on a more significant role in overseeing certain crypto markets. “We need to think about things in different stages,” Peirce said, suggesting that initial efforts could focus on issuing no-action letters or exemption orders to provide clearer guidance to crypto companies. Peirce also proposed reevaluating whether certain transactions qualify as securities, aiming to reduce regulatory overreach. *This is not investment advice.

However, the top memecoins, Dogecoin & Shiba Inu, had triggered much before the BTC price crash, which suggests the market participants have exited the memecoin space much before and entered the star token. This suggests these prices are experiencing massive upward pressure as the other tokens have triggered a rebound but DOGE & SHIB prices are struggling to rise above their respective resistance levels. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis After the dreadful fall in the past few days, the Dogecoin price experienced a major downfall since the start of the week. The mid-week plunge dragged the BTC price below $95,000, which dragged the entire market, including the DOGE price , close to $0.26 from the highs around $0.32. However, the bulls have managed to elevate the levels back above $0.31 but the rally appears to be still under a bearish influence. The weekly chart of DOGE indicates that the price has yet to rise above the bearish influence. However, the chart and the RSI seem to have formed a similar pattern and if the bulls manage to hold the support at $0.33 until the end of the week, then a fresh upswing could be imminent. Otherwise, the price is feared to drop below the $0.2, facing huge sell-offs. Meanwhile, the ADX is currently bearish, with the levels heading towards a bearish close and the ADX has displayed a bearish divergence. Hence, bearish waves continue to haunt the Dogecoin price rally; however, a close above $0.35 may invalidate the bearish trajectory. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis Besdies, the Shiba Inu price has fallen below the rising wedge, causing the token to spike by more than 30%. It could appear the price may soon trigger a healthy rebound, but the technicals suggest the other way around. The SHIB price could be prone to a wider correction, which could drag the levels below $0.00002 very soon. The MACD shows a drop in buying volume and the levels are suddenly heading towards a bearish crossover. On the other hand, the Ichimoku cloud is turning bullish as the bearish trend is expected to end. Moreover, the bullish crossover between the base & conversion line may invalidate the bearish trajectory. Therefore, the SHIB price continues to remain within a decisive phase and the trade until the weekend may have a greater impact for the upcoming price action in 2025.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-memecoins-struggling-to-recover-whats-next-for-shiba-inu-shib-dogecoin-doge/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37894949,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321668,1734720600,US Charges Dual Russian-Israeli National in Connection with LockBit Ransomware Group,"U.S. authorities have charged Rostislav Panev, a dual Russian and Israeli national, for his alleged involvement with the LockBit ransomware group. The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the charges on Friday and seeks Panev’s extradition. U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger unsealed the criminal complaint in the District of New Jersey on December 20. LockBit Ransomware Tools Developer Arrested in Israel: Panev Awaits Extradition to the U.S Rostislav Panev, 51, was arrested in Israel in August following a U.S. request for provisional arrest with the intent of extradition. Panev, identified as a key developer for the LockBit group, remains in custody in Israel as extradition proceedings continue. Panev is accused of developing and maintaining LockBit’s tools to conduct ransomware attacks worldwide. He also allegedly develops malware to disable antivirus protections, infiltrate victim networks, and print ransom notes on connected devices. Law enforcement also found evidence linking Panev to cryptocurrency payments exceeding $230,000, which he had allegedly received for his work with the group. LockBit has been linked to numerous ransomware attacks targeting high-profile organizations. Victims include Boeing Co., the Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, and the UK Royal Mail. Ransomware attacks by groups like LockBit typically involve hackers encrypting victims’ data or disabling systems. Victims are then forced to pay a ransom to regain access. Panev’s lawyer, Sharon Nahari, stated that Panev worked as a professional software developer. She claimed Panev communicated with LockBit via Telegram and created tools for the group without knowing their intended use. Nahari added that Panev has cooperated with law enforcement and provided information about his involvement. Authorities have intensified their efforts against LockBit in recent months. In February, U.S. and UK law enforcement agencies seized servers and websites used by the group and its affiliates. Investigators also recovered victim data and thousands of decryption keys. Officials urged affected victims to contact them for assistance in recovering stolen information. The $10 Million Manhunt: Who Is LockBit’s Alleged Operator, Dmitry Khoroshev? LockBit, a ransomware group active since 2019, has attacked over 2,500 victims in 120 countries, including 1,800 in the U.S. Its targets span healthcare, education, critical infrastructure, and government sectors. Affiliates use malware to encrypt networks, demanding ransoms and threatening to leak stolen data. Global law enforcement, including U.S. authorities, Israel, France, the U.K., and Europol, have intensified efforts to dismantle the group. The U.K. National Crime Agency disrupted LockBit’s infrastructure earlier this year, seizing vital websites and servers. Seven alleged members have been charged since 2023, including Russian citizen Mikhail Matveev, who was linked to the LockBit, Hive, and Babuk ransomware. In February 2024, “Operation Cronos” hacked LockBit’s systems, recovering data, affiliate lists, and over 7,000 decryption keys. These keys helped victims bypass ransom payments. This year, additional charges were filed against Russian nationals Artur Sungatov, Ivan Kondratiev, and Dmitry Khoroshev, known as “putinkrab,” LockBit’s alleged operator. A $10 million reward is offered for Khoroshev’s capture. Notably, in July, affiliates Ruslan Astamirov and Mikhail Vasiliev pleaded guilty. LockBit remains a key focus for law enforcement, with ongoing international cooperation to dismantle its operations.

XYZ is currently undervalued, and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Don’t miss your shot at being part of the XYZ winning team! Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a groundbreaking platform that has transformed the blockchain landscape. Created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). This innovation led to a thriving ecosystem, including decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which enhance transaction speed and efficiency. In 2022, Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism with the Merge, aiming to improve sustainability and scalability. Ether (ETH), the native currency, is essential for transactions, rewarding stakers, and serves as a tradable asset. In the current market cycle, Ethereum continues to show strong potential. Its commitment to scalability, with the upcoming sharding phase, promises to reduce costs and increase transaction speed, making it more attractive to users and developers alike. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s robust ecosystem and continuous innovation set it apart. As more applications and services build on its platform, the demand for ETH could rise. Market trends indicate a growing interest in decentralized technologies, and Ethereum’s position at the forefront makes it a noteworthy player in the crypto space. While the market is always subject to change, Ethereum’s advancements suggest it’s a coin to watch. XRP (XRP) XRP is a cryptocurrency that aims to make money move as fast as information. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it is designed to be quick, low-cost, and open to everyone. Transactions happen in seconds and cost very little. Without a central authority, it resists censorship and cannot be counterfeited. You don’t need a bank account to use XRP, making it accessible to people all around the world. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP started with 100 billion coins. Ripple, the company helping to develop it, holds a large portion to support its growth. XRP’s purpose is to make it easy to transfer any currency, anywhere. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and low fees compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As the demand for fast and efficient payment systems grows, XRP looks attractive by bridging gaps between different currencies globally. Solana (SOL) Solana is a blockchain platform aiming to outpace its competitors with speed and scalability. Like Ethereum and Cardano, it provides a foundation for decentralized apps, but it stands out with its unique design choices. Solana focuses on quick transactions and offers flexible development options in several programming languages. At the heart of Solana is SOL, its native cryptocurrency. SOL powers the network by facilitating transactions, running programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The SOL coin holds promise in today’s market. It underpins Solana’s ecosystem, rewarding participants and giving users access to many projects. Unlike other platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or extra layers to scale. This approach may attract developers and investors looking for a high-capacity network that can handle busy products and services. With the growing interest in decentralized apps and the need for faster blockchain solutions, SOL could be an attractive option in the current market cycle. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no maximum supply. What started as a fun alternative quickly gained traction. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value skyrocketed, pushing it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value of over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and the general boom in the crypto market. Today, Dogecoin stands as a symbol of the power of community and memes in the financial world. Its technology is simple, making transactions quick and cheap compared to some other coins. While some see it as just a meme, others believe it has potential due to its active community and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains attractive to those who value community-driven projects. However, with newer coins offering advanced features, Dogecoin faces stiff competition. Its future may depend on market trends and continued support from its fans. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that began as a joke but got serious fast. Launched on Ethereum, it’s based on Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog meme, popular since the early 2000s. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE aims to be a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With a no-tax policy and honesty about its lack of utility, PEPE is pure and simple—a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, its value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early holders made huge gains, and a strong community formed. This sparked a “memecoin season,” with other meme coins experiencing big ups and downs. Many hope PEPE and others will reach new highs, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving. PEPE’s potential lies in its community and meme appeal. Its roadmap has three phases: first, getting noticed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter; second, listings on centralized exchanges; third, major exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” Though it doesn’t offer new technology, its straightforward approach attracts some. Conclusion While ETH, XRP, SOL, and DOGE are promising, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a pioneering memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth and community-driven success.

As the crypto market surges, this under-the-radar token could be poised to become the next major player. Investors are buzzing about its potential, sparking curiosity about which coins might be set for significant growth. One contender is XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering all-sport memecoin blending meme culture with sports. With ambitions to surpass prior tokens’ impressive gains, it aims for exponential growth through community engagement. Score Big with XYZ: The New Meme Coin Heavyweight The fans are losing it! The XYZ token is in the crypto ring, landing blows on the competition – bullshit coins, worthless farming schemes, and scam projects. Like a true champ, this first-ever all-sports meme token has fought its way through the bear market with fearless momentum and shows no signs of slowing down. With eyes set on a roaring 9,900% growth, XYZ is destined to leave the 2024 meme coin triumphants like BOME and WIF trailing in its wake. Own the field, earn while the crowd plays XYZ is more than just a benchwarmer in the meme coin game; it’s creating the ultimate playing field with XYZVerse, where the thrill of sports meets the energy of meme culture. With a roadmap equipped with entertainment dApps, prediction markets, and sports betting options, XYZ is poised to draw in millions of gamblers ready to join the action. Remember Polymarket’s massive $1 billion trading volume during the US election betting fever? XYZ is gearing up for an even bigger win in the GameFi arena, letting its stakeholders cash in on the perfect combo of meme coin vibes, sports hype, and crypto mass adoption. Missed meme coin supercycle? By capitalizing on the ever-expanding gambling niche, XYZ is set to become the G.O.A.T of meme coins. BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 9,900% from its current price by the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors. Get in the game early to secure your spot – currently undervalued, XYZ is going the distance to break new records! Rallying the community, securing the win XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem’s direction.

With rock-solid tokenomics and plans for both CEX/DEX listings, XYZ is positioned for a championship run, ensuring a steady revenue flow and consistent token burns to keep the scoreboard in favor of a strong price and a thriving community. >>The XYZ presale is live – don’t miss out on this knockout 9,900% opportunity! Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has experienced notable fluctuations lately. In the past month, its price jumped by 33.47%, showing strong upward momentum. However, the last week saw a decline of 10.12%. Despite this short-term drop, over the past six months, ADA has soared by 159.15%, indicating impressive long-term growth. Currently, ADA trades between $0.94 and $1.22. The nearest resistance level is at $1.35. If the price breaks above this point, it could aim for the second resistance at $1.64, which would be an increase of over 30% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.78, and a fall to the second support at $0.50 would represent a significant decrease of more than 40%. Technical indicators present a mixed picture. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.97, slightly below the 100-day average of $1.06, suggesting recent downward pressure. The Relative Strength Index sits at 41.14, approaching oversold territory, which might signal a potential rebound. The MACD level is -0.0195, indicating a bearish trend. Considering these factors, ADA’s price could either rally towards the resistance levels if buying interest increases or decline towards support levels if selling continues. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) has seen significant movement in its price over the past months. In the last week, the price dropped by -15.89%. However, over the past month, it has risen by 25.75%. Looking at a six-month period, DOT has increased by 34.94%. This shows a volatile but overall upward trend in the longer term. Based on these figures, there is potential for DOT’s price to rise. The current price range is $7.48 to $10.47. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $7.65, while over 100 days it is $8.57. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 33.45, suggesting that DOT might be approaching oversold territory. This could indicate a possible price increase in the near future. If DOT continues to climb, it may test the nearest resistance level at $11.93. This would represent an increase of over 50% from the lower end of the current price range. If the price falls, it could find support at $5.95, which is about 20% below the current range. Traders should watch these levels closely as indicators of future movement. Conclusion While ADA and DOT are strong assets, XYZ’s unique sports-meme platform and ambitious growth strategy position it as a potential leader in the current bull run.

Based on his insights and technical indicators, XLM appears poised for significant action soon. Resistance and Targets Dark Defender referenced his analysis from November 23, highlighting a pivotal resistance level at $0.6367. Recent updates show that XLM successfully bounced back from this level, reinforcing its importance as a barrier to further upward movement. The analyst expects that once this resistance is decisively broken, XLM could aim for the $0.9203 Fibonacci level, marking the third wave in an Elliott Wave pattern. This could lead to a further rise toward the $2.3961 level, the target for the fifth wave. At the time of his analysis, the digital asset traded around $0.43, consolidating within a bullish flag formation, a pattern often associated with continuation trends. Dark Defender noted that breaking $0.4344 and staying above it for at least 12 hours, can quickly push XLM above $0.6367. This resistance remains the next critical hurdle for bullish momentum, and there’s a good chance XRP can surpass it, as ChatGPT recently predicted that the digital asset could hit $1 by the end of 2024. XLM Expected Break in a Day or So! Short-Term Entering & Exiting Strategies: Hi all. XLM was the second on our poll so that we will go for it!

These levels provide strong zones for traders to consider entry points if XLM fails to sustain its current levels or experiences a short-term pullback. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The daily chart shows that price action squeezes, suggesting a decisive move is imminent. Per the analysis, this move could occur within a day, making this a critical juncture for XLM traders. The analysis incorporates Fibonacci retracement and extension levels, which align with observed Elliott Wave structures. These indicators suggest that XLM’s bullish potential remains intact as long as critical support levels hold and resistance levels are breached. The bullish flag pattern on the daily chart further supports the upward movement in the near term. XLM is trading at $0.3709 and has remained above the $0.3565 support level. This level provides an entry point for investors before the surge analysts predicted begins. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The firings, however, followed internal controversy over the removal of an article critical of Tron founder Justin Sun , raising concerns about the publication’s editorial independence. Kevin Reynolds, CoinDesk’s editor-in-chief, along with deputy editors Marc Hochstein and Nick Baker, were informed of their termination via email. This news comes as a result of Leo Schwartz’s reporting at Fortune .

The story highlighted the stunt’s absurdity while also touching on Sun’s legal issues, including fraud charges from with the SEC . Sources told Fortune that Sun’s team demanded the article’s removal , deeming its tone inappropriate. Bullish, which acquired CoinDesk for $75 million in 2023, complied, pulling the piece without issuing a retraction notice. This decision led to the resignation of Matt Murray, a former Wall Street Journal editor, who chaired CoinDesk’s editorial committee. In an email to staff, CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha defended the layoffs as a step to boost productivity and reaffirmed the company’s commitment to journalistic integrity.

The penalty stems from the SEC’s allegations that the firm failed to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) within a reasonable timeframe. The SEC’s findings reveal a nearly five-year pattern of delayed compliance. Deutsche Bank Securities failed to respond promptly to requests from law enforcement and regulatory agencies. In some instances, investigations that should have culminated in SARs being filed took more than two years to complete. Deutsche Bank to Pay $4M in Fine: What Did the SEC Find? The SEC’s investigation revealed systemic lapses in Deutsche Bank Securities’ compliance processes between April 2019 and March 2024. Today we charged registered broker-dealer Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., for failing to file certain Suspicious Activity Reports in a timely manner. https://t.co/ixyNYfoMMC pic.twitter.com/q64HhRDsPg — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) December 20, 2024 Under the Bank Secrecy Act and associated regulations, broker-dealers are mandated to report transactions suspected of involving illegal funds, lacking legitimate business purposes, or facilitating criminal activities. Despite these clear requirements, the firm’s compliance with SAR filing obligations was marred by prolonged delays. In one notable instance, Deutsche Bank Securities filed a SAR identifying 68 suspicious transactions amounting to nearly $2 billion more than two years after a regulatory agency requested an investigation. According to SEC Associate Director Sheldon Pollock, such delays undermine the value of SARs, as stale information is of limited utility to law enforcement efforts. Pollock comments on the situation, saying: “Even the best information collected from SARs is of limited use if it’s stale by the time it’s provided to law enforcement.” The SEC’s cease-and-desist order found that Deutsche Bank Securities’ actions violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 17a-8, which mandate timely filing of SARs. While the firm neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings, it agreed to a settlement that includes censure, a cease-and-desist order, and the $4 million penalty. Deutsche Bank Securities has emphasized its commitment to meeting legal and regulatory obligations, noting that remedial actions were undertaken before the settlement. SEC Tightens Regulation As Trump Prepares To Assume Seat While the SEC appears to be doing its job well, the agency has been met with criticism in the crypto industry, especially under the leadership of soon-to-leave chairman Gary Gensler. According to a recent report, the SEC has issued a Wells notice to CyberKongz , alleging potential securities law violations. The NFT project strongly opposes this move. In a social media post, CyberKongz expressed frustration with the SEC’s lack of understanding of blockchain technologies and accused the regulator of making unjust accusations. The project also criticized the SEC’s interpretation of its smart contract migration as a sale of NFTs, which is part of the broader issue the market is battling regarding their unclear regulatory guidance for NFTs and blockchain initiatives. This action follows a similar Wells notice issued earlier this year to OpenSea .

The altcoin has experienced a price drop of over 30% in the past 48 hours. However, with rising interest from long-term holders and Binance traders, its price appears to be recovering. $164 Million of ADA Outflow Today, December 20, 2024, Coinglass’s ADA spot inflow/outflow on-chain metrics revealed that exchanges have recorded a significant outflow of $163.85 million worth of ADA in the past week, despite the altcoin’s continuous price decline. Source: Coinglass What Does Outflow Mean in Cryptocurrency? In the cryptocurrency landscape, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallet addresses, which suggests potential upside momentum and hints at an ideal buying opportunity. Based on historical data, whenever assets experience outflows from exchanges to wallet addresses, it increases buying pressure, resulting in upside momentum. Rising Traders Interest Besides rising interest from long-term holders, traders’ interest appears to be increasing, as reported by Coinglass. According to the data, ADA futures open interest has soared by 4.5% in the past four hours, indicating a shift in traders’ sentiment following the ADA price rebound. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.887 and has experienced a price decline of 1.9% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume surged by 32%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors amid the market rebound. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ADA has successfully retested one of the crucial support levels at $0.80, which it recently visited during the market dip. However, with rising interest from traders and long-term holders, the price is experiencing upside momentum. Based on the recent price action, if ADA holds above the $0.80 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 40% to reach the $1.23 level in the coming days.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/164-million-cardano-ada-outflow-buy-opportunity/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

WLFI has been working on strategic projects in the field of decentralized finance. By quickly acquiring digital assets, the project has attracted the interest of both skeptics and enthusiasts in the crypto world. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Trump, WLFI Add 722 Ether To Its Inventory During the latest power play, WLFI took advantage of market downturn to buy 722 Ether worth approximately $2.5 million. Using this strategic acquisition, they have managed to increase the total Ethereum holdings to as high as 15,598 tokens, which can now be valued at approximately $53 million. The acquisition itself will clearly indicate WLFI’s move into becoming a major player within the DeFi landscape. The main goal of the project is to democratize crypto loans, therefore challenging traditional financial institutions. This value proposition is fascinating. Investors who are now looking for alternatives to conventional financial systems especially in the present environment of banking uncertainty have found great resonance in this message. According to Arkham, the Trump family crypto project, World Liberty, purchased 722.213 ETH for 2.5M USDC via Cow Protocol on December 20 at 6:54 UTC+8. The project now holds a total of 15.595K ETH, valued at approximately $53.61M. https://t.co/CklEuO9IEH — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 20, 2024 Diversifying To Other Coins WLFI has not only been focusing on buying things quickly in Ethereum. Reports say that a lot of money is being put into other well-known coins, like Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK). These acts show a well-thought-out plan to build a diverse portfolio, which fits with what Trump called a “financial revolution.” The involvement of TRON founder Justin Sun, who has committed $30 million to the initiative as its leading investor and advisor, has been perhaps the most significant development. Sun’s involvement contributes significant cryptocurrency expertise to WLFI, while Trump’s brand recognition garners interest from both retail and institutional investors. Related Reading: XRP Will Create Millionaires, Analyst Declares In Wealth Projection Questions Linger Despite all this, criticism has also surrounded the partnership regarding fears over the likelihood of conflicts of interest and people finding ways to benefit from the venture to receive political patronage. WLFI is now under the watchful eyes of market observers, as it keeps refining its product offerings and expanding its asset base. Those who are not comfortable with traditional banks would find some solace in their offer to challenge accepted wisdom in finance. Still under discussion, though, is how WLFI will stand out in a DeFi market that is progressively crowded. Sun’s large financial support as well as Trump’s well-publicized leadership have definitely created tremendous momentum in the crypto market. Still, WLFI’s ultimate success will rely on its capacity to fulfill its great expectations in the face of legal challenges and unstable markets.

Despite that, SHIB and LINK prices dropped significantly amid a broader crypto market pullback. The Collaboration The popular meme coin project Shiba Inu announced a partnership with the blockchain oracle network Chainlink. As a result, the assets SHIB, BONE, and LEASH adopted the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard to become available across 12 blockchains. This mechanism, employing Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), allows token transfers from Ethereum to other chains , while the burn-and-mint program facilitates cross-chain transfers across all other networks. Additionally, Shibarium (Shiba Inu’s layer-2 scaling solution) integrated the Chainlink standard for blockchain interoperability as its “canonical cross-chain infrastructure.” “Chainlink CCIP enables Shibarium developers to build feature-rich, reliable cross-chain applications that grow the Shibarium network,” the disclosure reads. Last but not least , Shiba Inu adopted the Chainlink standard for “low latency market data.” The team behind the meme coin maintained that Chainlink Data Streaks supplies “premium high-frequency data” and delivers “unmatched functionality.” One of Shiba Inu’s leading developer s, who uses the X moniker Kaal , claimed the SHIB ecosystem “transcends every boundary” after the collaboration. Chainlink’s Chief Business Officer – Johann Eid – also chipped in . He assumed that the integration of the CCIP standard will enhance Shibarium’s capabilities and “drive wide adoption of its ecosystem.” “We look forward to seeing how the Chainlink standard for cross-chain interoperability and Chainlink Data Streams unlocks innovation, expands the Shibarium Network, and supports the development of efficient and secure DeFi markets,” he concluded. SHIB and LINK Price Reactions Despite the announced collaboration, both assets remain deep in the red on a daily scale . Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down almost 20%, currently trading at around $0.00001964, while Chainlink (LINK) has dipped by 16% to less than $21. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Their poor performance coincides with the severe correction in the entire cryptocurrency market, which started shortly after the latest FOMC meeting. As CryptoPotato reported , the Federal Reserve reduced the benchmark by 0.25%, but Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the policy might be halted next year due to rising inflation concerns. He also said the central bank is not permitted to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) despite Donald Trump’s promises. In the aftermath, the primary cryptocurrency briefly collapsed to almost $92,000. Leading altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and many more, suffered, too , charting double-digit price losses.

Since 2022, the exchange has grown fivefold, as evidenced by offices in different parts of the world, the growth of the team to over 1,100 professionals, and collaborations with such eminent partners as FC Barcelona, ​​Turkish FC Trabzonspor, the Ukrainian National Football Team, as well as giants VISA, ESL Faceit, etc. The company isn't stopping there and plans to expand into the American market in the future. This was confirmed by the founder and CEO of WhiteBIT in an interview with CoinGape . “Entering the U.S. is not just about geography—it’s about meeting high regulatory standards. We’ve spent time researching the market and tailoring our strategies to comply with local regulations. This ensures we’re offering products that meet the expectations of both institutional investors and private traders in the U.S.” The WhiteBIT Group is growing rapidly, with a total user base now reaching approximately 30 million clients. As for the WhiteBIT cryptocurrency exchange itself, it serves 5.5 million users today. Over the past year alone, the number of accounts on the platform increased by over 1 million, doubling the figures from 2022. WhiteBIT is ranked in the TOP-10 of CoinGecko's futures market rating. The exchange's daily trading volume has reached $11 billion on the spot market and $40 billion on the futures market. The company also leads in overall website traffic. In the fall of 2024, WhiteBIT ranked in the TOP-2 for platform traffic, with 33 million users. Regarding institutional clients, WhiteBIT now serves over 1,000. Volodymyr Nosov also highlights that in just six years, the company has grown from a startup into a powerful blockchain holding. The WhiteBIT group of companies now includes WhiteBIT centralized crypto exchange, Whitepay crypto-acquiring solution, WhiteSwap decentralized exchange, the white.market marketplace, the Whitechain blockchain, and the WB Soul Ecosystem built within it. Additionally, the group offers the WhiteEX physical cards for crypto balance top-ups, its native coin WhiteBIT Coin (WBT), the Pocket Rocket game, the G.N.

Within just months of its debut, it achieved a hash rate of 7 EH/s and, in October alone, mined six blocks worth over $1.2 million,” Nosov shared. WhiteBIT CEO also highlighted the significance of WhiteBIT Coin (WBT) which has also gained substantial traction as a versatile digital asset. Offering reduced transaction fees and exclusive bonuses, WBT is increasingly being used for everyday transactions and investments. “WBT’s performance speaks volumes about its potential. This fall, it grew by 63.5%, surpassing $20* in value. This reflects both organic interest and active usage, and we’re excited to see how it continues to grow,” Nosov explained.

Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s making waves with its unique approach to blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains that can get slow and congested, Kaspa uses something called the GHOSTDAG protocol. This means it doesn’t discard blocks that are created at the same time; instead, it keeps them all and orders them in a way that makes sense. As a result, Kaspa can process transactions much faster—currently one block per second, with goals to reach ten, or even a hundred, blocks per second. Its innovative design aims to reduce waiting times to nearly zero, so transactions are confirmed almost as fast as your internet connection allows. With features like quick transaction times and plans for even more improvements, Kaspa is positioning itself as a strong contender in the crypto world. Compared to other coins that struggle with scalability, Kaspa’s technology could give it an edge. The current market is always looking for cryptocurrencies that solve real problems, and Kaspa’s focus on speed and efficiency fits that trend. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, Kaspa’s unique approach might make it an interesting option to watch as the market evolves. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) PENGU is more than just a coin; it’s the heartbeat of the Pudgy Penguins community. These cheerful penguins have taken the crypto world by storm, becoming a symbol embraced by millions. From big companies sporting the Penguin to appearances in commercials, the Pengu has become a cultural icon with over 50 billion views.

It taps into the power of memes and positive energy. As the crypto market evolves, coins that unite people tend to thrive. PENGU’s potential lies in its ability to bring in not just crypto enthusiasts but also the hundreds of millions who share the Pudgy Penguin every day. Compared to other coins, PENGU offers a fresh approach that’s accessible and engaging. Believe in Pengu. Believe in the Prophecy. JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, an Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The IoT connects devices like computers, cars, and phones, allowing them to share data. Jasmy aims to give users full control over their personal data by combining IoT and blockchain technology. On the Jasmy platform, people can securely store and share their information, turning it into personal assets. This creates a safe space where data can be exchanged between devices and services without relying on trust. In a time when data privacy matters more than ever, JasmyCoin offers something new. By decentralizing data storage and using secure systems like IPFS, Jasmy lets users own and control their data. This sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies that focus mainly on transactions. As people look to protect their information, JasmyCoin could gain attention. The crypto market is always changing, but Jasmy’s focus on data sovereignty meets a real need. This might make it attractive to those interested in projects with practical uses. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began as a joke in 2013. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no maximum supply. What started as a fun alternative quickly gained traction. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value skyrocketed, pushing it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market value of over $50 billion. This surge was fueled by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, and the general boom in the crypto market. Today, Dogecoin stands as a symbol of the power of community and memes in the financial world. Its technology is simple, making transactions quick and cheap compared to some other coins. While some see it as just a meme, others believe it has potential due to its active community and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin remains attractive to those who value community-driven projects. However, with newer coins offering advanced features, Dogecoin faces stiff competition. Its future may depend on market trends and continued support from its fans. Conclusion Though KAS, PENGU, JASMY, and DOGE show promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) unites sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, blending meme culture with community engagement.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! Polkadot Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Polkadot (DOT) has shown strong potential for growth. Despite a recent dip of -15.78% over the past week, it boasts a monthly gain of 25.91% and a 6-month increase of 35.12%. The current price ranges between $7.48 and $10.47. If DOT can surpass the nearest resistance level at $11.93, it may climb toward the next target at $14.92. This move could represent a significant percentage increase. The Relative Strength Index sits at 34.56, suggesting there is room for upward movement before reaching overbought levels. As the crypto market heats up, Polkadot might be poised for a substantial rally. Polygon Ready for Takeoff: Opportunity Knocks Before Altcoin Bull Run Polygon has recently dipped to around $0.52, presenting a potential buying opportunity. Despite an 18% drop over the past week, the coin shows signs of an upcoming rebound. The Relative Strength Index is near 38, suggesting it’s approaching oversold territory. With the nearest resistance at $0.80, a move up could see Polygon gain over 50% from current levels. Looking at the past six months, the coin is up nearly 36%, indicating strong long-term momentum. As the altcoin season nears and the global crypto market looks bullish, Polygon could break past $0.80 and even challenge the next resistance at $0.98, representing almost a 90% increase. Conclusion DOGEN stands out with its focus on luxury, leadership, and high rewards. While DOT and POL may offer stability, they lack the near-term explosive growth potential. DOGEN’s alpha-driven vision and exclusive benefits attract ambitious investors. With 700% presale growth expected and the momentum of similar successful tokens, it positions itself as a standout for this altcoin season.

Many crypto exchanges in the EU have delisted the dominant stablecoin USDT to comply with the MiCA. While the regulations aim to improve oversight and prevent crimes like money laundering, crypto experts warn that they might reduce market activity without fully achieving these goals. Could MiCA Hamper Market Liquidity? Crypto executives warn that the MiCA regulations may reduce market liquidity without meeting their intended goals, potentially making the EU less attractive to digital-asset traders at a crucial time. Usman Ahmad, CEO of Zodia Markets, explained that the removal of USDT, the most liquid stablecoin, limits options for EU clients. While Stablecoins like USDT are essential for crypto traders to transfer funds, move money across borders, and settle traditional assets, concerns have grown about their use in illegal activities, as witnessed in recent reports of Russian networks using USDT for illicit transactions. However, Tether has condemned these illegal uses and emphasized its commitment to preventing such activities. MiCA Requires Stablecoins On CEXs To Have E-Money License In an effort to tighten the oversight of the asset class, MiCA requires all stablecoins listed on centralized exchanges must be issued by a company with an e-money license. The issuers must keep up to two-thirds of reserves backing their tokens with an independent bank and monitor all transactions made for payment purposes While Circle has received this license, but Tether hasn’t yet obtained it, which could lead to its delisting by December 30. Even with MiCA in place, authorities need better tools to track illegal transactions, something that is not ready yet. USDT has been widely used in illegal activities, but Tether is working to address this with a new partnership aimed at combating financial crimes. Meanwhile, with President-elect Trump’s victory, there are rising expectations that the U.S. will adopt a more crypto-friendly regulatory approach, sparking a market rally. In contrast, Europe is witnessing declining crypto investments and venture capital in crypto startups is set to hit a four-year low, raising concerns that it may fall behind in the crypto market. Encouraging Signs However, there are some encouraging signs. Crypto ownership in the euro area has more than doubled to 9% since 2022, though the European Central Bank cautioned that the increase may be influenced by a change in survey methodology. Despite this growth, the removal of Tether (USDT) from platforms in the EU is expected to significantly reduce liquidity, as USDT has the most trading pairs globally. Traders are likely to face disruptions as they move away from USDT to other stablecoins or fiat pairs. Some exchanges, like OKX, have already seen traders shift to fiat pairs instead of using other stablecoins.",NEGATIVE,USDT,FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/eus-mica-crypto-regulations-could-impact-market-liquidity-bloomberg/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD climbing back above $96,000 on Bitstamp. Despite a 1.5% daily decline, Bitcoin created challenging trading conditions, revisiting $92,000 lows from earlier in December, hitting long positions hard. “The cascade of support loss has indeed occurred,” noted trader and analyst Rekt Capital on X, adding, “Bitcoin is now down -15% on this pullback.” Rekt Capital had previously cautioned about potential corrections during bull markets, typically occurring six to eight weeks after breaking prior all-time highs. He remarked that the current dip “almost matches” a similar event from 2021. “These corrections tend to last a few weeks,” he explained. “Also, there tend to be up to 4 Price Discovery Corrections at most until a Bull Market ends. This is the first Price Discovery Correction in this cycle, which means it is an optimal re-accumulation opportunity with a high probability of price reversal to the upside.” Liquidation data painted a stark picture for crypto traders.

37891158,https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-increases-gas-limit-pectra,1734717600,Ethereum to ramp up gas limit as Pectra progresses,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Ethereum All-Core Devs (ACD) held their final call of 2024 yesterday, which offered key updates on plans to raise the gas limit and progress toward the Pectra upgrade. Discussions revealed the community’s ongoing efforts to balance execution-layer changes, consensus-layer coordination and EIP implementation, reflecting Ethereum’s commitment to “build-in-public” iterative improvement. In a bold but measured move, Ethereum developers are preparing for a gas limit increase, mirroring a 20% rise seen over three years ago. This time, the proposed increase aims for 36 million gas, though significant technical constraints temper enthusiasm for higher thresholds. The primary limitation is the consensus layer’s “GOSSIP_MAX_SIZE,” which restricts validator block transmission to 10 MiB, equivalent to roughly 10.48 MB. On the Mekong testnet — used for Pectra fork testing — the gas limit has already increased to 36 million, offering a stable testing ground for network performance under higher limits. While the Mekong testnet runs stably with these changes, developers cautioned against increasing the mainnet gas limit beyond 40 million without addressing the gossip-layer constraints. Validator clients, such as Prysm, face challenges in dynamically adjusting gas limits, which underlines the need for further development. An increase to the gas limit does not need to wait for a hard fork but can be signaled by validators in support of such a change. To date, only 16.8% have done so , but the trend is up. Campaigns like PumpTheGas.org aim to build more momentum. The Pectra upgrade remains a centerpiece of Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap. It’s on track for a Q1 release, with developers targeting a Devnet-5 launch by year-end. Changes discussed on the call include replacing EIP-7742 with EIP-7840 to offer more flexibility in managing “blob counts” — a key element for scaling Ethereum and supporting layer-2 rollups. By allowing developers to set maximum and target blob counts independently, the network can balance scalability (by allowing more data blobs) with stability (by maintaining operational safety limits). This separation makes it easier to optimize block capacity without overloading the network. Additionally, EIP-2537 focuses on gas repricing for BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) precompile operations, which are essential for cryptographic computations in Ethereum. The proposal adjusts gas costs for specific mathematical operations, ensuring that resource-intensive tasks are priced fairly while removing inefficiencies like redundant operations. These updates enhance network efficiency, optimize resource usage and improve cost fairness for developers. An EVM resource pricing working group will launch in January. This group will work on harmonizing gas cost calculations across various operations, aiming to improve efficiency and fairness in Ethereum’s fee structure. EIP-4444, which schedules the rollout of pre-Merge history expiry for May 1, 2025, requires additional testing to finalize. The call also underscored the need for clearer validator node requirements, with developers seeking community feedback. A further proposal to redefine “Meta” EIPs as solely process-related could simplify hardfork management. Ethereum’s deliberate and collaborative approach to development was evident throughout the discussions. The Pectra upgrade and proposed gas limit increase reflect the network’s ambition to expand its technical capabilities while prioritizing stability.

While MOVE surged immediately upon its listing on December 9, it has since suffered a big comedown, with the alt actually down by 52% in relation to its record of $1.45 (set on December 10). These losses have come in the wake of its public airdrop, with many of the recipients of MOVE selling their tokens already, dragging down its price. Yet the coin’s fundamentals, as the native token of the Movement layer-two network, makes it one of the best tokens to buy at the moment. MOVE Token Is Live as Airdrop Mania Sweeps the Market – Find Out If You Qualify Eligibility in MOVE’s airdrop was based around whether an individual was active in the coin’s testnet activity, including quests and hackathons. Testnet users had to be active prior to a November 23 snapshot, while they also had until December 2 to register for the drop. As such, anyone who didn’t meet this December 2 deadline will be unable to claim any tokens from the drop, which has now already taken place. The airdrop distributed 10% of MOVE token’s overall supply of 10 billion tokens, meaning that 1 billion MOVE has recently entered the market. Source: TradingView The coin’s chart reflects this, with MOVE’s price descending from a ten-day high of $0.8778 last night to about $0.705 as of writing. According to DEXTools , it’s down by 14% in six hours, but up by 4.7% in a week. It currently has a market cap of $1.5 billion and a holder count of roughly 11,000, with the coin listed on Uniswap and also a range of CEXes (e.g. Binance, OKX, Bybit, Bitget). Given Movement’s potential as a layer-two network, MOVE token has every chance of returning to growth in the near future. Its native platform has a unique selling point in that it’s based around the MOVE programming language, the proponents of which claim will make developing blockchain-based protocols much more straightforward and flexible. The Move language will change blockchain development forever. @coopsmoves joins @jaxxdwyer to dig into why and much more. Check it out https://t.co/LloAc5EeR5 — Movement (@movementlabsxyz) August 7, 2024 Time will tell whether Movement can distinguish itself from other MOVE-based platforms, such as Sui and Aptos, both of which are now strongly established in the crypto space. Yet its launch has been promising, given that the MOVE token has received plenty of support from major exchanges already, with more listings likely to come soon. New Meme Tokens May Outperform Utility Coins While MOVE looks like it has the potential to enjoy sustained growth over time, its reliance on fundamentals may mean that its growth remains steady rather than spectacular. Traders hunting market-beating gains may therefore have to look towards more speculative tokens, with certain presale coins looking like they could rocket once they go live. One token looking very promising is Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) , an ERC-20 token that has raised an incredible $32.6 million in its ongoing sale. Frog army is the meta. Join us: https://t.co/ZDBhKay9ss pic.twitter.com/nincuz3IYu — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 19, 2024 WEPE is attracting investors because it’s more than just another meme token, given that it comes with its own trade intelligence platform. Its platform will provide investors with real-time analysis and market insights, while also giving WEPE holders exclusive access to buying signals and trading strategies. It will also manage its own online community spaces and forums, where users can share tips and analysis, as well as compete in trading competitions. The winners in these competitions will earn rewards in WEPE, which they will also be able to stake, increasing the profitability of the token. Investors can join Wall Street Pepe’s sale by heading over to its official website ., where WEPE is available at a price of $0.0003651. This price will continue to increase as the sale progresses, while the sale’s rapid success suggests that it could moon once it goes live.

President-elect Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies are poised to reshape the US landscape. Tether’s USDT and other stablecoins have been caught in the crossfire of this new rule. A Regulatory Overhaul in Europe The EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation is set to take full effect by December 30, 2024. This new rule requires all stablecoins to be issued by entities with an e-money license. This means stablecoin issuers need to hold reserves in independent banks and track transactions. MiCA rule aims to combat illicit activities like money laundering, an issue Tether has faced criticism for. Exchanges are already delisting USDT and other stablecoins to comply, but many in the crypto industry caution this could leave the market at risk. Usman Ahmad, CEO of Zodia Markets, pointed out that USDT is the most liquid stablecoin. Stablecoins like USDT are key in crypto, acting as a bridge between digital currencies and traditional ones. They enable fast, low-cost transactions. With Tether being delisted from European platforms, traders face fewer options, leading to lower liquidity and higher volatility. Meanwhile, Euro-pegged stablecoins are gaining popularity , with rising trading volumes and market values. The US vs. EU: A Competitive Shift? While Europe tightens its grip, the US is poised to take a different approach under the incoming leadership of President Donald Trump. Trump’s crypto-friendly policies could attract more digital-asset investors to the US, boosting the market. This comes after a tumultuous period in the US where the Securities and Exchange Commission’ s (SEC) regulatory crackdowns created uncertainty. Speculatively, the shift in regulatory priorities could make Europe less attractive to crypto investors, just as North America experiences a resurgence. European crypto startups are already seeing venture capital investment dip, with predictions pointing to a four-year low in 2024. In contrast, investment in North American crypto firms is on the rise. Is Europe Losing Its Edge? Despite the regulatory challenges, Europe’s crypto landscape is not without its promising signs. A recent European Central Bank (ECB) report found that crypto ownership in the euro area has doubled since 2022, reaching 9%. However, the ECB cautioned that the figure may not reflect a true surge in adoption due to changes in their survey method. Still, the growing regulatory hurdles may push investors like Copper Technologies toward the US. The regulatory environment is expected to be more favorable under Trump’s administration. For now, the removal of USDT from exchanges will likely disrupt the market, with liquidity taking a hit as traders seek alternatives.

42390133,9f992d54-6399-4d3d-8134-8c61a5c432bd,1734717474,"The Future Is AI-Centric, and Blockchains Need to Be as Well","Every few decades, a new technology emerges that changes everything: the personal computer in the 1980s, the internet in the 1990s, the smartphone in the 2000s. And as AI agents ride a wave of excitement into 2025, and the tech world isn’t asking whether AI agents will similarly reshape our lives — it’s asking how soon.  But for all the excitement, the promise of decentralized agents remains unfulfilled. Most so-called agents today are little more than glorified chatbots or copilots, incapable of true autonomy and complex task-handling — not the autopilots real AI agents should be. So, what’s holding back this revolution, and how do we move from theory to reality?  The current reality: true decentralized agents don’t exist yet  Let’s start with what’s out there today. If you’ve been scrolling through X/Twitter, you’ve likely seen a lot of buzz around bots like Truth Terminal and Freysa. They’re clever, highly engaging thought experiments — but they’re not decentralized agents. Not even close. What they really are are semi-scripted bots wrapped in mystique, incapable of autonomous decision-making and task execution. As a result they can’t learn, adapt or execute dynamically, at scale or otherwise.  Even more serious players in the AI-blockchain space have struggled to deliver on the promise of truly decentralized agents. Because traditional blockchains have no “natural” way of processing AI, many projects end up taking shortcuts. Some narrowly focus on verification, ensuring AI outputs are credible but failing to provide any meaningful utility once those outputs are brought on-chain.  Others emphasize execution but skip the critical step of decentralizing the AI inference process itself. Often, these solutions operate without validators or consensus mechanisms for AI outputs, effectively sidestepping the core principles of blockchain. These stopgap solutions might create flashy headlines with a strong narrative and sleek Minimum Viable Product (MVP), but they ultimately lack the substance needed for real-world utility.  These challenges to integrating AI with blockchain come down to the fact that today’s internet is designed with human users in mind, not AI. This is especially true when it comes to Web3, since blockchain infrastructure, which is meant to operate silently in the background, is instead dragged to the front-end in the form of clunky user interfaces and manual cross-chain coordination requests. AI agents don't adapt well to these chaotic data structures and UI patterns, and what the industry needs is a radical rethinking of how AI and blockchain systems are built to interact.  What AI agents need to succeed  For decentralized agents to become a reality, the infrastructure underpinning them needs a complete overhaul. The first and most fundamental challenge is enabling blockchain and AI to “talk” to each other seamlessly. AI generates probabilistic outputs and relies on real-time processing, while blockchains demand deterministic results and are constrained by transaction finality and throughput limitations. Bridging this divide necessitates custom-built infrastructure, which I'll discuss further in the next section.  The next step is scalability. Most traditional blockchains are prohibitively slow. Sure, they work fine for human-driven transactions, but agents operate at machine speed. Processing thousands — or millions — of interactions in real time? No chance. Therefore, a reimagined infrastructure must offer programmability for intricate multi-chain tasks and scalability to process millions of agent interactions without throttling the network.  Then there’s programmability. Today’s blockchains rely on rigid, if-this-then-that smart contracts, which are great for straightforward tasks but inadequate for the complex, multi-step workflows AI agents require. Think of an agent managing a DeFi trading strategy. It can’t just execute a buy or sell order — it needs to analyze data, validate its model, execute trades across chains and adjust based on real-time conditions. This is far beyond the capabilities of traditional blockchain programming.  Finally, there’s reliability. AI agents will eventually be tasked with high-stakes operations, and mistakes will be inconvenient at best, and devastating at worst. Current systems are prone to errors, especially when integrating outputs from large language models (LLMs). One wrong prediction, and an agent could wreak havoc, whether that’s draining a DeFi pool or executing a flawed financial strategy. To avoid this, the infrastructure needs to include automated guardrails, real-time validation and error correction baked into the system itself.  All this should be combined into a robust developer platform with durable primitives and on-chain infrastructure, so developers can build new products and experiences more efficiently and cost-effectively. Without this, AI will remain stuck in 2024 — relegated to copilots and playthings that hardly scratch the surface of what’s possible.  A full-stack approach to a complex challenge  So what does this agent-centric infrastructure look like? Given the technical complexity of integrating AI with blockchain, the best solution is to take a custom, full-stack approach, where every layer of the infrastructure — from consensus mechanisms to developer tools — is optimized for the specific demands of autonomous agents.  In addition to being able to orchestrate real-time, multi-step workflows, AI-first chains must include a proving system capable of handling a diverse range of machine learning models, from simple algorithms to advanced AIs. This level of fluidity demands an omnichain infrastructure that prioritizes speed, composability and scalability to allow agents to navigate and operate within a fragmented blockchain ecosystem without any specialized adaptations.  AI-first chains must also address the unique risks posed by integrating LLMs and other AI systems. To mitigate this, AI-first chains should embed safeguards at every layer, from validating inferences to ensuring alignment with user-defined goals. Priority capabilities include real-time error detection, decision validation and mechanisms to prevent agents from acting on faulty or malicious data.  From storytelling to solution-building  2024 saw a lot of early hype around AI agents, and 2025 is when the Web3 industry will actually earn it. This all begins with a radical reimagining of traditional blockchains where every layer — from on-chain execution to the application layer — is designed with AI agents in mind. Only then will AI agents be able to evolve from entertaining bots to indispensable operators and collaborators, redefining entire industries and upending the way we think about work and play.  It is increasingly clear that businesses that prioritize genuine, powerful AI-blockchain integrations will dominate the scene, providing valuable services that would be impossible to deploy on a traditional chain or Web2 platform. Within this competitive backdrop, the shift from human-centric systems to agent-centric ones isn’t optional; it’s inevitable.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Pinger,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/20/the-future-is-ai-centric-and-blockchains-need-to-be-as-well,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61080bf60d8cbfb426fef3f8a0a51c3168ad279f-1707x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37890961,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313626,1734717390,"Bedrock Launches brBTC, Introducing BTCFi 2.0 — The Future of Bitcoin Staking","December 20, 2024 – Singapore, Singapore Bedrock , one of the leading multi-asset restaking protocols, introduces brBTC – a transformative BTC derivative asset designed to redefine Bitcoin’s role in DeFi (decentralized finance). As Bedrock’s innovative LRT (liquid restaking token), brBTC maximizes Bitcoin yield by enabling holders to deposit a variety of Bitcoin derivatives and earn rewards through a curated selection of advanced restaking protocols. BTCFi 1.0 – A foundation with room to grow The evolution of BTCFi began with BTCFi 1.0, which laid the groundwork for Bitcoin’s integration into DeFi. This phase introduced staking protocols that allowed Bitcoin holders to generate yields, providing a glimpse of Bitcoin’s potential in DeFi. However, BTCFi 1.0 also revealed key challenges – liquidity was fragmented across platforms, restaking opportunities were limited and real-world applications remained largely untapped. A vision for BTCFi 2.0 The launch of brBTC marks the beginning of BTCFi 2.0 – a new concept aimed at addressing current key challenges in BTCFi, such as fragmented liquidity, limited restaking opportunities and a lack of real-world use cases. BTCFi 2.0 introduces a more unified and efficient ecosystem, providing sustainable yield strategies, enhanced security through layer-two solutions and integration with collaborative platforms. In sharing his thoughts on brBTC’s launch, Zhuling Chen, core contributor at Bedrock, said, “BrBTC will be the catalyst for driving BTCFI into its next phase, BTCFI 2.0. It will enable multi-source yield through interoperability and help to secure and unite the fragmented liquidity in the ecosystem.” Echoing this sentiment, Calvin Zhou, another core contributor at Bedrock, added, “By enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and staking capabilities, BTCFi 2.0 and brBTC not only unlock new financial opportunities but also strengthen the overall security and resilience of the decentralized ecosystem.” BrBTC – A game-changer for Bitcoin yield Launching initially on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with plans to expand to additional chains, brBTC empowers investors through three core features. Unified ecosystem BrBTC addresses the challenge of market fragmentation by integrating Bitcoin seamlessly across multiple DeFi platforms. By accepting a wide range of BTC derivative assets as collateral – including WBTC, FBTC, mBTC, cbBTC, BTCB and uniBTC – brBTC creates a cohesive and dynamic ecosystem. Collateral allocations are optimized across multiple staking protocols to ensure holders benefit from the most competitive yields. Enhanced yield strategies BrBTC offers diversified yield-generation options, extending beyond traditional staking by leveraging restaking protocols such as Babylon, Kernel, Pell, SatLayer, Mellow and Symbiotic. Furthermore, to further strengthen brBTC’s liquidity and expand sustainable yield opportunities, Bedrock partners with Thena and MEV Capital. These collaborations ensure a solid and well-supported ecosystem, empowering users to access competitive and scalable restaking solutions. With scalability in mind, additional protocols and partnerships will be introduced over time to enhance yield strategies and unlock even greater opportunities. Real-world applications Engineered with versatility in mind, brBTC bridges the gap between digital assets and tangible utilities. Its applications extend to collateral in financial products, enabling microtransactions, and supporting other real-world financial needs, enhancing Bitcoin’s relevance in both DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance). With BTCFi 2.0, Bedrock is pioneering a new era for Bitcoin holders, offering tools to maximize yield, navigate a more cohesive ecosystem and explore real-world applications. Driven by innovation and collaboration, brBTC is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Bitcoin in DeFi. About Bedrock Bedrock leads the DeFi space with its unique offerings. As the first multi-asset restaking protocol, Bedrock supports BTC, ETH and IOTX liquid restaking. This capability allows users to unlock impressive yields, with some exceeding three digits – all while maintaining asset exposure. Bedrock has proven its dominance by providing the highest Babylon points in cap one and cap two. Backed by notable investors like OKX Ventures and Babylon’s co-founder, Bedrock ensures robust security and seamless cross-chain functionality.

The price of Welch’s Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin HAWK surged shortly after it went live earlier this month, but the token lost more than 95% of its value a few hours later, leading to accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. A pump-and-dump scheme is a fraudulent practice in crypto that involves artificially inflating the price of a low-value token through hype and misrepresentation. Once the price of the coin goes up, those behind the scheme sell their holdings at a high price, crashing the price of the token. In a post on social media platform X, New York-based Burwick Law says it just filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of investors who bought the HAWK token. “This case involves claims related to investor protections under federal law and the HAWK TUAH memecoin HAWK launched on December 4, 2024.” According to Newsweek, investors are suing Tuah The Moon Foundation, which handled the proceeds from the sale of HAWK, the coin’s creator OverHere Ltd and its executive, Clinton So, and the token’s Los Angeles-based promoter, Alex Larson Schultz. The court filings say the lawsuit stems from the unlawful promotion and sale of the memecoin, which the defendants offered and sold to the public without proper registration. The plaintiffs claim that they were drawn to the project because of Welch’s involvement but sustained substantial damages after the rapid decline in the token’s value.

37890948,https://nulltx.com/?p=136027,1734717285,Whales Bet Big on FX Guys: Could $2 Be Just Around the Corner?,"Whales Bet Big on FX Guys: Could $2 Be Just Around the Corner? In the crypto market, whale investors hold the power to influence the price of tokens, and their actions can signal significant price movements. Recently, FX Guys (FXG) has been drawing the attention of big investors, sparking speculation that the price of $FXG could rise substantially shortly. With a growing ecosystem, a robust Trader Funding Program, and the potential for impressive staking rewards, FX Guys could soon be on track to reach $2 or even beyond. Here’s why whales place their bets on FX Guys and what this could mean for investors. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 1. FX Guys’ Rising Popularity Among Whale Investors As the crypto market matures, more prominent investors, often called whales, seek projects that offer long-term growth potential. FX Guys has caught their eye due to its strong foundation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and its $FXG token, which offers both growth potential and passive income opportunities. Whales are known to target projects with solid use cases and scalability, and FX Guys has proven itself as a Top PropFi Project with its innovative approach to Trade2Earn and staking. These key elements of the FX Guys ecosystem provide whales with opportunities to earn consistent returns while holding the token. By betting on FX Guys, whales are positioning themselves for future price increases, driving confidence in the broader market. 2. The Trade2Earn Model: A Game Changer for Investors One key factor that differentiates FX Guys from other projects in the DeFi space is its Trade2Earn model. This innovative mechanism allows users to earn rewards for trading within the ecosystem, incentivizing increased trading volume and liquidity. This model presents a unique opportunity for whales to leverage $FXG tokens while earning rewards through trading activities. The Trade2Earn feature has the potential to increase demand for $FXG tokens significantly, creating upward price momentum. As more traders and whales engage in the ecosystem, the demand for $FXG could rise, bringing the price closer to the $2 mark. 3. Staking for Passive Income and Long-Term Growth Another compelling reason whales are betting on FX Guys is the opportunity to earn passive income through staking. Staking allows token holders to lock up their $FXG tokens in exchange for rewards. This mechanism provides a way for investors to earn regular returns and helps secure the network. For large investors, staking offers an attractive way to gain exposure to $FXG while minimizing risk. By locking in their holdings, whales reduce market exposure while earning rewards that compound over time. As the staking pool grows and more investors participate, the price of $FXG could experience upward pressure, potentially reaching the much-anticipated $2 mark. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 4. The Growing Ecosystem and Market Demand FX Guys is more than just a token; it’s a growing ecosystem with many features designed to attract traders and investors alike. From the Trader Funding Program to staking and Trade2Earn, FX Guys has created an environment where small and large investors can thrive. As the FX Guys ecosystem expands, more investors will likely be drawn to the platform. Increased adoption of $FXG tokens will likely lead to higher demand and, in turn, a rise in the token’s price. If the momentum continues, it’s entirely possible that FX Guys could hit the $2 mark sooner than expected. 5. Why $2 Could Be Just Around the Corner for FX Guys For FX Guys, the road to $2 is paved with solid fundamentals and an increasing user base. With whales betting on $FXG, the token’s potential for significant price appreciation is growing. Several factors point to $FXG reaching the $2 milestone: The success of the Trader Funding Program and staking incentives drive increased investor interest. Trade2Earn boosts demand for the token, increasing liquidity and market engagement. A robust ecosystem that continues to attract more traders and investors. As FX Guys continues to build its ecosystem, whales are not the only ones noticing. Retail investors also see the value in $FXG, making this token a potential breakout candidate for the coming years. With $2 on the horizon, now could be the perfect time to get involved in the FX Guys ecosystem. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Conclusion: The Future of FX Guys Looks Bright As whales place big bets on FX Guys, it’s clear that the future of $FXG holds significant promise. With its innovative Trade2Earn model, attractive staking rewards, and a growing ecosystem, FX Guys is well-positioned to experience substantial growth. While the crypto market can be volatile, the strong fundamentals behind FX Guys make it a compelling investment opportunity. If the current trends continue, $FXG could be on its way to $2, bringing substantial gains to early investors.

Craig Wright Handed Court Loss Amid Satoshi Nakamoto Claims According to reports, Wright was officially sentenced to one year in prison with a suspension for two years Judge James Mellor in the U.K. The sentencing comes after he filed an over $1 trillion lawsuit against X founder Jack Dorsey and Bitcoin developers at large amid his claims that he was the pseudonymous cryptocurrency creator . If freedom makes me a villain, then I will wear that crown like it’s been mine all along. Villain. They toss the word around like broken glass in a gutter, sharp edges glinting in the sunlight, but they never stop to think where it came from. Villain. It used to mean something… — S Tominaga (@CsTominaga) December 20, 2024 Mellor ultimately ruled that Wright had violated a court order earlier in the year that mandated the computer scientist stop pursuing legal action in the U.K. against those who deny his claims of being Nakamoto. “When it comes to the grounds of contempt I have found each of them provable beyond a reasonable doubt,” Mellor said. Wright’s suspended sentence means that he will only go behind bars should he reoffend within the two year suspension time frame. Wright, allegedly appearing during the hearing via livestream, declined to comment outside of announcing his intention to appeal the ruling. Who Is The Real Bitcoin Creator? Wright has been the center of international controversy in recent years over his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, with Mellor ruling this past March that there was “overwhelming” evidence he is not the Bitcoin creator. The case against Wright was formally launched by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance, a non-profit dedicated to the advancement of cryptocurrencies funded by key players in the emerging tech sector including Dorsey and Coinbase, and saw key proof-of-work developer Adam Back testify against him. “It is now clearer than ever – clear beyond any doubt – that Dr Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto,” COPA’s website currently reads . In accordance with a court order, Wright has since updated his website with a legal notice stating that he is not actually Nakamoto detailing that he lied “extensively and repeatedly” while he “attempted to create a false narrative by forging documents ‘on a grand scale.’” “In advancing his false claim to be Satoshi through multiple legal actions, Dr Wright committed “a most serious abuse” of the process of the courts of the UK, Norway and the USA,” Wright’s website reads.

37891007,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631194,1734716778,The U.S. economy expected to enter recession again next year,"The U.S. economy is heading straight for a wall. All signs point to a recession in 2025. It’s not even subtle. Economists, analysts, and market watchers are connecting the dots, and the picture isn’t pretty. The Walmart Recession Signal is screaming danger. This signal tracks Walmart’s stock price against the S&P Global Luxury Index, and guess what? It’s at its highest point since the world shut down in 2020. Walmart shares jumped a whopping 83% this year, while luxury goods stocks flatlined. History shows us what happens when this gap widens this much: a recession. Every. Single. Time. Consumers are tapped out, and unemployment is creeping up Americans are out of money. That’s the reality. Pandemic-era savings? Gone. Those stimulus checks that once kept people spending like the party would never end? Spent. Consumer spending, which is the backbone of the U.S. economy, is starting to sag under the weight of exhausted wallets. Retailers are feeling it. Restaurants are feeling it. The entire economy is bracing for impact. Continuing unemployment claims are up 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels. While unemployment rates aren’t skyrocketing yet, the cracks are showing. Rising claims mean more people are losing their jobs, and fewer are finding new ones quickly. If this trend keeps up, it’ll only feed into the recession spiral. Wages? Sure, they’ve risen, but not enough to keep up with inflation. People might be earning more on paper, but in reality, they’re buying less. That’s how recessions start. And about inflation—it’s still here. It’s better than the nightmare 9.1% peak back in June 2022, but October’s 2.6% rate shows we’re far from out of the woods. Economic forecasts clash, but the risks are clear Experts can’t agree on just how bad it’ll get, but no one’s denying the risks anymore. BCA Research is practically betting on a recession for both the U.S. and Canada next year. Their argument? The labor market is too shaky, and consumer spending is falling off a cliff. It won’t be another 2008-style disaster, but it’ll hurt. Goldman Sachs, ever the optimist, says not so fast. They’re banking on 2.5% GDP growth for 2025 and put the odds of a recession at just 15%. They’re clinging to the hope that policy changes under the next administration won’t shake things up too much. But then there’s J.P. Morgan, throwing water on Goldman’s sunny outlook. They’re pegging the recession risk at 45%, citing a shrinking money supply and potential global shocks as key threats. Let’s talk numbers. GDP growth predictions for 2025 are all over the place. Goldman’s 2.5% is on the high end, while some estimates go as low as 1.9%. The unemployment rate? That’s expected to hover around 4.2%, but if inflation stays controlled, it could drop closer to 3.5%. And the Federal Reserve? They’re unlikely to cut interest rates more than twice next year, so inflation will likely fire up as early as January. Global tensions and Trump’s policies As if the domestic economy wasn’t fragile enough, global risks are piling on. The Russia-Ukraine war continues to mess with energy prices and supply chains. Meanwhile, China’s economy is slowing down, and that’s bad news for everyone. If Chinese demand for U.S. exports drops, it’ll hit American manufacturers and farmers hard. And let’s not forget the commercial real estate sector, which is already feeling the heat from higher interest rates. Rising vacancies and falling investments in this space could spill over into broader financial markets. Then there’s Donald Trump. His return to the White House in January 2025 will come with a new set of policies, and some of them could tip the scales. His plans for tariffs are already raising eyebrows. A proposed 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Chinese goods could drive prices up across the board. Goldman Sachs estimates these tariffs alone could boost inflation by nearly one percentage point. That’s the last thing the economy needs. And trade relations? Those could get ugly fast. Tariffs tend to spark retaliation, and a full-blown trade war could wreck supply chains and kill growth. Businesses that rely on cross-border trade would take a direct hit, leading to layoffs and higher prices for consumers. Trump’s tax policies might provide a short-term boost but could also backfire. Extending tax cuts for individuals and corporations sounds great until you realize it’ll likely balloon the federal deficit. If the economy doesn’t grow fast enough to offset the lost revenue, we’re looking at higher borrowing costs and a potential loss of investor confidence.

37890620,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375548,1734716692,"These Metrics Suggest Bitcoin Still Has Room for Growth, According to Glassnode Founder","Bitcoin (BTC) is currently worth around $94,000 after trading above $108,000 earlier this week. While traders continue to take profits, analysts believe the cryptocurrency still has room for growth. According to an X thread by Rafael Schultze-Kraft, the co-founder of the on-chain market intelligence platform Glassnode, over 20 charts and metrics suggest BTC has yet to form its top for this cycle. More Room for Growth The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, which measures unrealized profitability, is currently hovering around 3. Historically, this indicator has signaled overheating above 7; hence, there is still room for BTC to grow. Also, the top MVRV Pricing Band, which is obtained from calculating the number of days the MVRV has traded at extreme levels, is currently at the 3.2 level. Schultze-Kraft mentioned that analyzing long-term holder (LTH) profitability metrics like the Relative Unrealized Profit and LTH Net Unrealized Profit/Loss can offer insights into the risks of profit-taking. These metrics just entered the euphoria zone, hitting the 0.75 level. In 2021, BTC rallied approximately 3x after the indicators entered this zone and topped when they hit 0.9+. Another metric to look at is the Yearly Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, which monitors coin spending among investors. The Glassnode founder disclosed that this indicator peaked above 700% in previous cycles, however, it is currently around 580%. One more indicator to watch is the Market Cap to Thermocap Ratio, which is not close to previous extremes. Historical data has shown that BTC tops occur when this metric reaches a multiple of 32-64; however, the metric currently hovers at the bottom of this range. The top band of this metric will put Bitcoin’s market cap above $4 trillion. BTC Top at $230K? Furthermore, the Investor Tool metric suggests BTC could top at $230,000. The Bitcoin Price Temperature indicator counters this suggestion but places a BTC top at $151,000. Moreover, the Value Days Destroyed Multiple, which compares near-term coin days destruction to the yearly average to determine increasing spending of older coins that eventually overpower demand, sits at 2.2. With previous extreme values above 2.9, the indicator suggests room for growth. Schultze-Kraft listed other metrics and charts, including the Mayer Multiple, the Cycle Extremes Oscillator Chart, the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, the LTH Inflation rate, the Sell-side Risk Ratio, and the Short-term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio. While these indicators have placed bitcoin’s cycle top at different levels, they all suggest that the digital asset is only halfway through this bull run.

He Said ""Save This Tweet""!","Bitcoin (BTC) has been talked about for breaking records lately, but it has also been talked about for the sharp decline it has experienced in the last few days. The latest hawkish signals from the FED have put pressure on financial markets and pulled cryptocurrencies down. Analysts who stated that the decline in Bitcoin is a correction stated that the latest decline looks like year-end profit taking. While Bitcoin's recent price movements raise questions among crypto investors, a tweet by former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao in 2020 became a trending topic again after 4 years. At this point, CZ's tweet on December 17, 2020, aimed at investors who were worried about the declines in the bull cycle, came to the fore again. “Waiting for new headlines: Bitcoin crashes from $101k to $85k. Save this tweet,” CZ said in 2020. When CZ made this post in December 2020, Bitcoin was around $20,000. Afterwards, BTC started a big rally and rose to $64,000 in April 2021. After that, BTC reached ATH by reaching $69,000 in November 2021. While CZ's tweet partially came true, it remains to be seen whether the declines will continue. *This is not investment advice.

37890522,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313606,1734716476,Orbs Introduces Liquidity Hub Version Two To Set a New Standard for DEX Liquidity,"December 20, 2024 – Tel Aviv, Israel Orbs, the layer-three protocol revolutionizing liquidity optimization across chains, has announced the release of Liquidity Hub version two. The upgrade adds a slew of new features to deepen on-chain liquidity for DEXs (decentralized exchanges) and to enhance the decentralized trading experience. Liquidity Hub version two provides DEXs with advanced tools and integrations, enabling them to deliver superior liquidity and execution. This positions them as strong, self-sufficient alternatives to CEXs (centralized exchanges). Traditionally, decentralized marketplaces struggle to attain sufficient liquidity, leading to high volatility and slippage. Liquidity Hub version one solved these challenges by procuring liquidity from multiple sources while offering MEV protection and flexible gasless transactions. With version two, Orbs builds on the foundation of its predecessor by introducing advanced optimizations and new tools to enhance the liquidity experience. The latest version refines how DEXs access and manage liquidity, streamlining operations and improving execution efficiency directly on-chain. These updates further reduce operational complexity while maintaining seamless integration across venues. Core features of version two include the following. Dynamic fees – Fees are now calculated in real-time as a percentage of the savings achieved, ensuring that traders benefit from optimized costs, making swaps more efficient. Enhanced AMM router price simulation – AMM prices are continuously monitored throughout the Dutch auction process, ensuring superior pricing even during volatile market conditions. Provable outcomes with LH Explorer – Provides visibility into every transaction, showing AMM simulated prices, Liquidity Hub prices, fees, gas costs and savings. Orbs’ chain-agnostic liquidity layer enhances the capabilities of DEXs and emerging networks without the need to migrate liquidity or bridge assets. Liquidity Hub version two builds upon this foundation, operating as a decentralized backend that seamlessly integrates with existing EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and non-EVM smart contracts. This frees DeFi projects to focus on product innovation and market expansion rather than getting sidelined by liquidity management hurdles. The introduction of Liquidity Hub version two stands as a significant milestone in Orbs’ ongoing efforts to refine on-chain trading infrastructure. By combining real-time fee optimization, continuous AMM price monitoring and provable outcomes through LH Explorer, version two delivers better execution prices for traders. In the process, it ensures enhanced competitiveness for DEX operators, enabling them to attract more liquidity providers and traders. About Orbs Orbs is a decentralized layer-three blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for advanced on-chain trading. Orbs optimizes trading with aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders and on-chain derivatives. Orbs enhances the capabilities of both EVM and non-EVM smart contracts without moving liquidity onto a new chain. This one-of-a-kind setup acts as a decentralized backend that brings CeFi-level execution to DeFi trading. Learn more at the website .

This puts North Korea’s share of global crypto theft at 61%, with total losses hitting $2.2 billion. North Korean Hackers Shatter Record North Korean hackers set an infamous new record in 2024, stealing $1.34 billion worth of crypto. This makes them responsible for over 60% of the $2.2 billion in crypto stolen this year. North Korean hackers are notorious for their skills in malware deployment, social engineering, and crypto asset theft, stealing funds for state projects, including nuclear and missile programs, to help the hermit kingdom bypass global sanctions. According to a report by Chainalysis, the frequency of attacks by North Korean hackers continues to grow despite the total number of incidents declining year-on-year. According to industry experts, North Korean hackers are getting better and faster at engineering and executing massive exploits, with attacks between $50-$100 million and above $100 million occurring with increasing frequency. North Korean hackers have also infiltrated crypto and Web3 companies and compromised the integrity of their systems. Modus Operandi The hackers use false identities, and third-party hiring intermediaries, and exploit remote work opportunities to access sensitive networks. Once they have access to these networks, they steal proprietary information, even accessing and stealing from company accounts. North Korean hackers are targeting the very foundations of the crypto ecosystem. In one of the most outrageous attacks in recent times, the hackers stole 4502 Bitcoin from the Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin. The stolen assets are funneled through cross-chain bridges and cryptocurrency mixers, making them almost impossible to trace. How 2024 Played Out North Korea's hacker army operated at full throttle in the first half of 2024. However, their operations substantially declined after a high-profile summit between Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Pyongyang. According to Chainalysis, there was a significant drop in activity, with the amount stolen dropping over 50% in the second half of 2024. However, analysts have not drawn a direct link between the summit and the decline in the number of hacks by North Korean actors. A Constant Threat While the threat from hackers is considerably lower than the levels witnessed in 2021 and 2022. The current year has registered a 23% increase compared to 2023, highlighting the constant nature of the threat from hackers. Eric Jardine, the head of cybercrimes research at Chainalysis, stated, “We began the year on pace to be among the worst on record for stolen funds. This year’s resurgence exposes critical gaps in security and highlights the need for adaptive measures.” He added that private key compromises remain a concern despite a drop in activity following Kim and Putin’s meeting. According to Jardine, these concerns will only increase as larger financial institutions enter the crypto space. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42389872,85ab7a96-fc78-4275-a3eb-96f830ced4ea,1734716182,Agents of Evolution: Crypto’s Next Act,"Crypto Twitter has been overrun by sentient, well informed chatbots which reply at the speed of refreshing your browser and can maintain hundreds of simultaneous conversations without missing a beat. To many, the rise of these on-chain agents is a welcome upgrade from human influencers like BitBoy and GCR, who have mixed track records and opaque incentives. These agents, like on-chain analyst AIXBT, have quickly risen to the top of crypto twitter influencer mindshare rankings, given their ability to respond at the speed of the internet and justify opinions with data.  Today AIXBT is one of few agents that trades at a nine figure valuation, but as the number of utility-focused agentic launches accelerates next year, many will compare this new agentic asset class to the similar explosion of NFTs in 2021.  On-chain agents and NFTs share many similarities: they curate communities and organize attention, they’re fun to speculate on and offer vague promises of future value. But most importantly they represent novel assets, with no analogue in the traditional finance world.  After the SEC’s lawsuits targeting NFT projects like Flyfish Club and Stoner Cats made it nearly impossible to build an innovative idea with that primitive, NFTs as unique assets lost momentum. In the vacuum left behind, memecoins surged forward, offering a mix of humor and speculative fervor to fill the void once occupied by NFTs' ambitious promises. Because they looked like other trading-only assets which were lightly regulated, the SEC was unable to stifle their development as they did in every other corner in crypto. Memecoins required users to make fewer choices, versus NFTs which combined aspects like rarity and tier that obfuscated any underlying value. Their use was supercharged by platforms like pump.fun, which reduced the creation of new memecoins to just a couple clicks, setting off a frenzy of speculation and new user behaviors tied to token price appreciation. You can find a compilation of the more extreme attempts here.  Yet, amid this speculative chaos, a new asset has emerged which is engendering similar user behaviors to NFTs and memecoins: on-chain agents. These digital entities combine blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to deliver novel user experiences. Though most agents today are indistinguishable from memecoins, several on-chain agents have begun to differentiate themselves through utility.  The Rise of On-Chain Agents  Agents represent another asset class in crypto experimenting with new business models and monetization. From AI-generated podcasts to investment insights and anonymous communication, these virtual entities have already reshaped how much of crypto Twitter (X) interacts. The biggest on-chain agents have mindshare bigger than the biggest human crypto-native influencers, and make money similarly: by token-gating information and offering subscriptions. Their distinguishing features — utility-driven frameworks and fair-launch principles — should make agents a more investible asset class than memes. Seen through the lens of hold period, liquidity, and utility, the distinction is even more clear.  Because we suspect investors will hold agents longer term than memecoins, and they create liquidity for themselves through their business models, crypto-focused investors will find this asset class easier to back once the initial frenzy has cleared. Until the business models flourish however, picking agents to invest can be likened to throwing darts at a board.  Early Innovators in On-Chain Agents  The on-chain agent market remains nascent, with most projects still in development. While projects like Truth Terminal set off the frenzy by showing the world that agents could have mimic real people, newer projects have focused on utility. Trained on data from crypto Twitter, AIXBT delivers lightning-fast insights on token dynamics, rivaling the influence of major crypto personalities. Others like Luna have proliferated as entertainment agents, interacting with thousands of people through twitter and TikTok.  Having spent the last two weeks experimenting with many of these, here are five more that are worth playing with. It’s unclear whether any of these are valuable investment opportunities, only that they offer differentiated user experiences.  These projects illustrate the diversity and ingenuity of the on-chain agent ecosystem, laying the foundation for its expansion. Each offers a novel AI-powered user experience that anybody can experiment with. Over time, we suspect that continued engagement may even allow them to create moats. While unclear where these may come from today, Dunbar’s Number provides a helpful framework. It defines the cognitive limit on the number of meaningful social relationships humans can maintain, and is around 150. Agents that create value by maintaining a nearly infinite number of simultaneous relationships, like AIXBT, unlock opportunities beyond what the human brain can cognitively do.  The Big Picture  History doesn’t repeat but it rhymes is an adage you’ll see on the twitter feed of every degen that’s ever lost 90% on a trade, but also proves unfailingly true. At the outset of the fourth bull run of the last two decades, it’s hard to ignore the comparisons.  DeFi summer was set off by the realization that centralized fintech companies often act against their customers. Famously, when Robinhood stopped out retail traders in favor of the big guns in Citadel, these traders realized that big regulated central companies may not be acting in their best interests.  Interestingly, a very similar dynamic is afoot in AI. The biggest companies like ChatGPT have struck multi-year deals with companies like Apple, allowing them to ingest people’s personal iPhone data without much accountability. As such, the violent price swings on agents traded on-chain may be front running this latest rhyme. It’s unclear how this dynamic will play out however. Beyond the agents themselves, agentic frameworks like ai16z’s Eliza and the Virtuals platform may capture value more clearly. The latter is already the breakout performer of the last quarter price-wise: given the inherent uncertainty, investing in an index of agents makes sense. I suspect this is because while agents are inherently interesting, it’s unclear that their usefulness will compound and that the attention dedicated to them will be lasting.  There is an old story about the market craze in sardine trading in a period of relative food scarcity. The commodity traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared. One day a buyer decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started eating. He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good. The seller said, “You don’t understand. These are not eating sardines, they are trading sardines.”  As scarcity returns to the market it’s worth remembering agents can be a trillion dollar asset class. But for now, save for a handful, they’re still sardines.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Mahesh Ramakrishnan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/20/agents-of-evolution-crypto-s-next-act,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fecc3ce3032f24249515fd9dfc868bbc8d9a0d1-800x420.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB.

With a 7.52% voter turnout, 98.37% of participating IOTA token holders voted in favor of the upgrade. Faster, More Secure, and Decentralized According to the IOTA Foundation, the Rebased upgrade, in which IOTA switches its Layer 1 (L1) to a Move-based object ledger , will bring improvements to the network. These include increased scalability and performance, leading to faster transaction speeds and greater network capacity. Additionally, IOTA aims to bolster security measures with the new protocol upgrade, making the network more resilient to potential threats. Furthermore, Rebased is expected to promote greater decentralization, ensuring a more robust and distributed network. A Sustainable Tokenomics Model Beyond the technical improvements, Rebased also introduces staking rewards, giving IOTA tokens real utility. IOTA token holders can now actively participate in securing the network and earn rewards for doing so. To ensure a sustainable token economy, Rebased balances inflation with deflation. New IOTA tokens are minted to provide staking rewards, but transaction fees are burned to counterbalance this. This creates a deflationary pressure that helps maintain the long-term value of IOTA. All minting and burning operations are publicly visible in the IOTA Rebased Explorer, ensuring accountability and transparency within the ecosystem. IOTA Rebased would introduce sustainable #tokenomics model : 6% supply growth in year 1 (767k #IOTAs /epoch), staking rewards for validators/delegators, low transaction fees (~0.005 IOTAs) & deflationary pressure via fee burning.

A public testnet is already operational, providing developers and partners with an opportunity to explore and integrate the new technology. To ensure a smooth transition to the upgraded mainnet, IOTA has outlined several key conditions. These include a minimum two-month testnet phase with rigorous stress testing, a readiness review of all validators on the testnet, completion of thorough security audits during the testing phase, and finally, successful integration of IOTA Rebased by major cryptocurrency exchanges . Once these criteria are met, the official mainnet launch date will be announced. Additionally, the IOTA Foundation also announced partnerships with various blockchain infrastructure providers and validators, including Nansen, Ankr, Nodes.Guru, Cosmostation, InfStones, and Stakin, among others.

Welch, of the famous Talk Tuah podcast, disappeared from social media after rug-pulling the HAWK token on live stream. Hailey Welch has responded to warnings about a class action lawsuit for rug-pulling the HAWK token. In the past 24 hours, court filings surfaced that represented claims on behalf of buyers of the HAWK meme token. After almost a day of waiting, Welch responded with a message that she was fully committed to cooperating with legal representatives and compensating the buyers of her meme token. I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the… — Haliey Welch (@HalieyWelchX) December 20, 2024 Welch herself does not admit to a direct fault and has asked victims to contact Burwick Law, the first firm that advertised its willingness to represent HAWK token buyers. Burwick Law is generally open to pursuing meme tokens and NFT fraud, taking special interest in the HAWK token case. Burwick Law has denied representing Welch, instead pointing out its goal of achieving compensation and the best outcome for all involved parties. The token itself was launched by the Tuah The Moon Foundation, registered in the Cayman Islands. The HAWK token was not a simple launch and involved multiple parties that could have exerted control over the token. The HAWK token and the influence of Welch had another unexpected effect. Polymarket carried a small betting pair on Welch returning to X and tweeting before December 20. Just in time, Welch delivered, immediately resolving the betting market. One account bought 18,936 ‘yes’ tokens just minutes before Welch tweeted, though at that time the price rose to $0.927. Thus, the biggest buyer still had limited success. For other holders, the market spiked from $0.41 to $1 for the ‘yes’ token. The timing of the big purchase for ‘yes’ tokens led to more speculations of insider activity. HAWK token is still held by a cabal of wallets Welch, who became famous for a short Internet clip, released the HAWK meme asset while controlling most of the supply. The community was warned by BubbleMaps and other analysts that HAWK worked as a celebrity coin and was at risk for insider control. While Welch kept most of her content light and to the point, her Internet influence was immense. This led to outsized investments into the HAWK token. In some cases, meme tokens linked to celebrities have survived longer without a rug pull. In this case, it is yet unclear who initiated the sell-off, which ended up draining all of the token’s liquidity. HAWK trades at an extremely low rate, sinking to $0.00092. The token has only $893K in liquidity locked, an extremely low tier for a widely known asset. Before the rug pull, HAWK found its way into 12,724 wallets. The top wallet still carries more than 28% of the supply. Just before the launch, 96% of the supply was linked to a cluster of connected wallets, which went on to sell to the community. The initial sale drained the liquidity too fast, leaving the token to crash. Despite the token’s high profile, no community has claimed it as its own. This is mostly due to the rapid rug pull, which still left a cabal of large-scale wallets controlling the supply. Meme tokens, however, are never really defunct. Soon after the news of Welch offering redress, HAWK started climbing, rising to $0.00099. The token may yet revive given the extra publicity.

37889927,https://crypto.news/?p=14321172,1734715229,This new crypto is seeing huge FOMO from Solana and Dogecoin holders after major updates,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rollblock presale soars past $7.3M, sparking FOMO among Solana and Dogecoin holders. Table of Contents Rollblock: The blockchain casino movement poised for 880% returns Can Solana break resistance with the new Bitwise partnership? Can dogecoin finally hit $1 in 2025? Early Rollblock backers have seen massive returns The crypto world is buzzing as Rollblock , a new presale sensation, captures the attention of Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) holders. Recent updates have fueled massive FOMO, drawing investors eager to capitalize on its unique potential. Positioned as a game-changer in decentralized finance, Rollblock is setting the stage for innovation and high returns. With its growing momentum, early adopters are rushing in. Rollblock has raised over $7.3 million so far. Rollblock: The blockchain casino movement poised for 880% returns Rollblock is transforming online gambling by bringing the excitement of a Vegas casino into the homes of its fast-growing user base. Founded on blockchain technology, the platform promises safe, transparent, and fair gaming. Over 22,000 users have joined up, playing over 7,000 games including blackjack and new AI games. Rollblock attracts investors because it concentrates on transparency and trust. Unlike traditional online gambling platforms, Rollblock uses Ethereum-backed security to offer provably fair odds. Every transaction is encrypted on-chain, ensuring users’ personal information and bets are protected from third-party interference. To further reward its community, Rollblock offers an enticing revenue-sharing model. Long-term liquidity providers earn weekly passive income with staking rewards up to 30% APY. These rewards are given by the platform via buyback and burn, which deflates the RBLK token and pushes its value higher as time passes.

So l ana reached $263 on November 22 but dropped to $203 last week. Since October 10, it had been moving within an upward parallel channel, occasionally spiking higher. While it made several attempts to break its all-time high, it couldn’t sustain momentum and slipped back into the channel. Eventually, the price broke below the channel’s support, hitting $203. On the investment side, Bitwise introduced a new Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) in Europe to address the lack of staking rewards from its earlier product, ESOL. BSOL now offers a 6.48% staking reward, surpassing the 5.49% offered by 21Shares. Meanwhile, Bitwise has also filed for a spot Solana ETF in the U.S., but approval remains uncertain. Solana’s next major target is $300, but it first needs to break resistance at $222 and regain $263 before making any real progress. Presently trading for $215.32, interest is developing with open interest rising 2.25% to $5.34 billion. These levels are now being watched by analysts to find out if Solana can kickstart its march upward. Can dogecoin finally hit $1 in 2025? Throughout the 2021 bull run, Dogecoin surpassed a record high of $0.74 in May and stayed well short of the $1 milestone. Though its price has pulled back since that time, most are hopeful the 2025 bull market will push it over that psychological barrier. Excitement continues to grow since Elon Musk had taken over Twitter (X) and also speculated that Dogecoin might be used to pay for products offered by the platform. This possible integration has revived interest in Dogecoin, which remains the #1 meme coin and a top contender for 2025. Despite the resuscitated interest, Dogecoin’s short-term performance has been patchy with the coin sliding 3% in the last day to $0.387. Nevertheless, investors are paying attention to Dogecoin very carefully, focusing on its future potential. Early Rollblock backers have seen massive returns Rollblock is now a hot topic among early backers who have gained over 300% since the project launched some months ago. Currently priced at $0.0415, Rollblock is capturing the attention of savvy traders, including whales, during stage 9 of its presale. Analysts predict up to 880% returns for early investors before the token’s launch, with the potential for 100% returns by early 2025. Rollblock’s mix of centralized convenience and decentralized security makes it one of the hottest investment opportunities in crypto today.

After 333 hours of sleep, Welch took to X to announce her cooperation with a U.S. federal lawsuit seeking legal recourse for 12 American residents impacted by the failed Hawk Tuah meme coin. Welch released a social media statement less than 24 hours after legal firm Burwick Law filed the suit on Dec. 19. This marks the first time Welch has spoken publicly since Dec. 5. I take this situation extremely seriously and want to address my fans, the investors who have been affected, and the broader community. I am fully cooperating with and am committed to assisting the legal team representing the individuals impacted, as well as to help uncover the truth, hold the responsible parties accountable, and resolve this matter. Haliey Welch on Hawk Tuah meme coin You might also like: Hawk Tuah Hailey Welch sued over $50m meme coin debacle Per crypto.news, crypto-centric Burwick Law filed a lawsuit on behalf of plaintiffs allegedly affected by the Hawk Tuah meme token launched by Welch and her team. Court documents state that 12 individuals collectively lost approximately $150,000 investing in the celebrity meme coin. Hawk Tuah surged to a $500 million market cap shortly after its Solana (SOL) debut before plummeting by over 95% to a $50 million market cap. Welch, the public face of the token, claimed she and her team had not sold a single token. However, data from Bubblemaps challenged her statement, revealing that insiders controlled 96% of the token’s supply. X community notes on at least three of Welch’s tweets also highlighted evidence suggesting that insiders were gradually dumping tokens on buyers. Welch and her team went silent for over two weeks, likely overwhelmed by angry investors demanding answers and accusing the project of being an exit scam. Welch allegedly pocketed $50 million from the project.

The influencer issued a statement addressing her fans, investors, and the broader crypto community as she faced backlash and legal scrutiny after $HAWK’s dramatic 90% crash and investors losing over $151,000. Welch emphasized her commitment to cooperating fully with legal representatives and uncovering the truth behind the project’s alleged fraudulent practices. Public Apology After Lawsuit: Can Hawk Tuah Girl Repair Damages? In a tweet shared with her followers, Welch expressed regret over the incident and pledged her assistance in the investigation.

In their statement, they emphasized that Welch was not involved in the technical or financial aspects of the $HAWK token’s deployment. Welch’s legal team said: “Haliey Welch did not spearhead or create this project. She simply received a sponsorship fee for lending her persona to those who created and deployed the memecoin.” They further clarified that her role was confined to promotional activities under a fixed-term agreement and that she had no knowledge of the alleged market manipulation tactics used by the project creators. “Outside of the initial fixed fee, there was no guarantee she would make additional money from the memecoin thereafter.” The Context Behind the $HAWK Lawsuit The $HAWK token was launched in early December and was promoted heavily by Welch. It initially reached a market capitalization of $490 million before collapsing by 93% shortly after its debut. Allegations of a rug pull quickly surfaced, prompting Burwick Law to file a federal lawsuit on behalf of 12 U.S.-based plaintiffs who collectively lost $151,000 . Investors are taking action! A lawsuit has been filed against the creators of Hawk Tuah ($HAWK) after a shocking 90% crash led to $151K in losses. #Crypto #HawkLawsuit https://t.co/FlONUafCc0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 19, 2024 The lawsuit names Alex Larson Schultz (a.k.a. Doc Hollywood), OverHere Limited, Clinton So, and Tuah the Moon Foundation as defendants. Welch herself is not named in the lawsuit but faces criticism for her involvement in endorsing the project. Blockchain analysis revealed that over 96% of the token supply was concentrated in connected wallets, some of which were involved in significant sell-offs. These actions sparked outrage among investors, many new to cryptocurrency and heavily influenced by Welch’s public endorsement. Social media exploded with accusations and tales of financial devastation from investors who placed their trust in the project. Welch has maintained that her involvement in the $HAWK project was limited to a promotional agreement, wherein she was compensated for promoting the token on her platforms. Her legal representatives assert that she had no visibility into the project’s internal operations or the tokenomics and that the red flags—such as centralized wallet distributions—were neither disclosed nor apparent to her during the agreement. “Due to her limited role, Haliey was completely siloed from this project and had zero control over it.” They further asserted that Welch was the victim of poor advice and exploitation by the company, which sought to capitalize on her viral success. Despite the controversy, Welch’s team is working to repair her public image. Welch’s statement suggests a commitment to clearing her name and moving forward in her career. Meanwhile, Burwick Law continues to build its case, encouraging affected investors to come forward.

37889401,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665642,1734714057,"Bitcoin Under Siege: Bearish Pressure Keeps Price Below $99,575","Bitcoin is under intense bearish pressure as it struggles to reclaim the $99,575 mark, a key resistance level that has proven to be a significant hurdle. After an impressive rally earlier in the month, BTC’s momentum has slowed, with sellers taking control and keeping the cryptocurrency in a tight range below this critical threshold. The current price action highlights growing uncertainty in the market, as bulls attempt to regain strength while bears capitalize on every opportunity to push prices lower. With $99,575 marked as a pivotal point, the next moves could set the stage for Bitcoin’s short-term trend. Will the bulls manage a breakthrough, or will bearish dominance prevail? The coming days hold the answer. Bitcoin Struggles Below The Critical $99,575 Resistance Level Bitcoin is currently facing significant resistance at the $99,575 level as its price fights to break above this critical threshold. Despite attempts to rally, bearish pressure has kept BTC confined below this key resistance point, limiting its upward movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $100K: Is The Rally Losing Steam? As Bitcoin hovers near this level, market sentiment remains cautious since there are possibilities of a breakout or a deeper pullback. Furthermore, the $99,575 level remains pivotal, as a successful breach could signal further bullish momentum, while failure to surpass it may result in increased selling pressure. BTC’s price has also dropped below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key technical indicator that often acts as a significant support level. This shift below the 100-day SMA suggests weakening upside strength and may signal that bears are gaining control. Historically, when the price falls below the SMA, it can indicate a potential shift in market sentiment, with further downside risk if the price fails to reclaim this important indicator. If BTC cannot regain momentum and climb above the 100-day SMA, it may face increased selling pressure, leading to more losses as bearish sentiment continues to dominate. Key Technical Indicators Suggest Challenges For BTC’s Recovery A critical analysis of the Composite Trend Oscillator indicator suggests that Bitcoin could be poised for more declines. The indicator’s trend line and the SMA’s line have dropped below the zero line, a sign of bearish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Dips Again: Is The Momentum Shifting? When both these components fall below this threshold, it typically signals that the downtrend is gaining strength, indicating increased selling pressure. This bearish signal, combined with the price action below the 100-day SMA, suggests that Bitcoin may struggle to regain upward momentum in the near term. Conclusively, If bearish pressure on BTC continues, several key support levels will be crucial to monitor. The first significant level is $93,257, where the price could find initial support. Should BTC fail to hold above this point, the next support zone will be around $85,211, which has previously been a strong demand area. A sustained drop below these levels may suggest an extended price drop to other support ranges.

On Dec. 20, as Bitcoin ( BTC ) traded to above $97k and Ethereum ( ETH ) bulls pushed above $3,400, the price of Horizen ( ZEN ) surged to highs of $26.34. The cryptocurrency, which rallied sharply following a recent Grayscale Investments announcement, reached a multi-year high and ranked among the top gainers in the 500 largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. ZEN traded at lows of $14.55 on Dec. 19. However, despite the broader crypto crash and the staggering $1.4 billion liquidations , the altcoin’s price hovered above $26 in early trading during the U.S. trading session. According to crypto.news price data, Horizen recorded a 24-hour trading volume of over $397 million, with its market cap exceeding $407 million. These metrics reflected increases of 294% and 62%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. While ZEN has surged nearly 200% over the past month, its current levels are still more than 84% below the all-time high of $168 reached in May 2021. If the broader crypto market continues to rebound, ZEN bulls may aim for March 2022 highs near $50.

Prices of the altcoin rose as the digital asset manager unveiled the fund to offer exposure to Horizen for qualified investors. Earlier this month, Horizen’s native token underwent its final halving , which came as the project geared for a key change in its tokenomics. ZEN will not see any further halvings as the new network mechanism enables a declining emission rate. That’s because Horizen, is shifting from the proof of work mining model that mirrored Bitcoin’s halving cycle to a new proof of stake mechanism in 2025. Horizen’s last halving occurred on Dec. 12, 2024. New tokenomics for Horizen will come into effect in the first half of 2025.

ADA now trades close to the $1 mark. Similarly, Solana’s price has been on a downtrend. It has fallen to $216, delaying its rally to $300. Their consolidation and lack of momentum have made investors less sure about their ability to provide notable returns anytime soon. Meanwhile, two alternatives– Rexas Finance (RXS) and Ripple (XRP) are better options to bet on for significant returns. They are on a bullish path that positions them for a substantial rally. Rexas Finance (RXS): tokenizing Real-World Assets with blockchain technology Rexas Finance (RXS) is a new cryptocurrency designed to transform asset management. Rexas Finance is unique because it breaks down real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, fine art, and intellectual property, which is called tokenization. Rexas Finance grants small investors the opportunity to own fractions of large assets. Tokenization of assets solves major financial issues such as liquidity and transparency, making owning assets more efficient and accessible. The project uses blockchain technology to simplify asset management and offer unique solutions. RXS has been audited by CertiK Audit, making it more reliable and secure for investors. When Rexas launches, it will be listed on three top-tier major exchanges, which experts believe could significantly increase its value. They predict that it will reach $12 by 2025. Presale success and growing investor confidence Rexas Finance has seen strong momentum in its presale phase, selling over 350 million tokens at $0.150 each during the tenth stage, which is still ongoing. To attract more investors, the team has launched community-focused initiatives like the Millionaire Giveaway, which offers $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. These efforts highlight its growth potential, with analysts forecasting a significant price rally. Innovation at the core The Rexas Finance ecosystem includes advanced tools like the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which make tokenizing assets easy using a smartphone or computer. Security is a top priority, with features like the Rexas AI Shield providing extra protection for smart contracts. Additionally, Rexas DeFi offers a strong decentralized finance platform focused on adaptability and innovation, which will allow it to grow in various markets. A promising future for Rexas Finance Rexas Finance is listed on websites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, where traders and investors can access real-time updates on the project. By 2025, Rexas Finance will launch on major exchanges at a starting price of $0.20. If you’re looking for significant returns, Rexas Finance could be a great choice, as it’s expected to see significant growth. Ripple (XRP): a fintech leader Ripple has proven to be a better option in many respects, with several factors making it better than Solana and Cardano. Ripple isn’t just a blockchain platform—it’s a fintech leader. Its upcoming Ripple USD (RLUSD) launch highlights its ability to tap into the $200 billion stablecoin market. NYDFS recently approved RLUSD, enhancing Ripple’s credibility and paving the way for its regulatory acceptance. This regulatory edge could also support Ripple’s ambition for an XRP-based ETF, attracting institutional investors and solidifying its market position. XRP’s price momentum reflects investor confidence. It recently surged to $2.40, with analysts projecting a rally to $3, outperforming Solana and Cardano in gains. Ripple emphasizes practical, scalable solutions that give it a competitive edge. For example, its use in international remittances directly addresses a tangible, high-demand market, unlike the theoretical potential of Cardano’s smart contracts or Solana’s DeFi initiatives. Ripple also benefits from strong market support, as seen with its inclusion in top exchanges like Arkham and Whale Alert’s tracking of significant XRP transfers. The recent $144 million XRP transaction signifies robust institutional interest. Ripple also partners with the world’s banks and financial institutions, making it unique as a crypto asset and a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain technology. Cardano and Solana may only reach new all-time highs sometime soon. However, Rexas Finance and Ripple provide better alternatives with the potential to deliver significant returns. Rexas Finance is the best bet for a promising 2025. The token’s presale has been amazing, and a massive surge is expected upon launch. Backed by its unique vision, it’s set to shake up the crypto space in 2025.

37888979,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395794,1734713214,SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Signals SEC’s Shift Toward Pro-Crypto Innovation,"The post SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Signals SEC’s Shift Toward Pro-Crypto Innovation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the SEC gears up for Gary Gensler’s exit, a pro-crypto transition is anxiously awaited by the crypto community. Besides, President Trump has chosen pro-crypto Paul Atkins as a replacement, and with anti-crypto Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw missing her renomination window, only pro-crypto Republicans are expected to remain when the leadership changes in January. In a recent interview with Coinage, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce shared insights on how the SEC is shifting from being historically anti-crypto to embracing pro-innovation. She described this period as one of “transition” and “optimism,” signaling a positive change. “It’s a time of transition for everyone in Washington right now, and I think that’s the same at the SEC,” Commissioner Peirce said. “There’s still going to be a time of uncertainty because it will take some time before our new Chairman gets here, but there are some things we can do right out of the gate at least get processes started to make some changes,” she added. Peirce Optimistic Over Two Key SEC Decisions Seemingly, Commissioner Hester Peirce is optimistic about revisiting two key SEC decisions on crypto ETFs—allowing in-kind redemptions and enabling Ethereum ETFs to stake assets. She noted that with a new administration, the chances for these changes are now more likely, especially after Chair Gensler steps down in January. In-kind redemptions could reduce unnecessary conversions to cash, making the process more efficient. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have raised over $10 billion, and Bitcoin ETFs have over $120 billion in assets. She noted that currently, ETF issuers can only hold crypto assets, while other regions like Europe allow staking for additional yield. Peirce believes that with a pro-crypto majority, these changes could happen soon. “If it changes from a majority of Commissioners who don’t want things to go through to a majority of Commissioners who do want things to go through, then yeah, it’s easier,” she said, noting that after Chair Gensler steps down on January 20, the road ahead on both points gets decisively more clear. “I imagine that that question is going to be posed to us early on,” she said. Peirce emphasized the importance of open conversations about crypto, noting that people have been hesitant to engage with the SEC in recent years. She hopes the tone will shift, allowing regulators and the regulated community to work together to find the right way forward. Notably, Eric Balchunas also reiterated the positive sentiment sharing it in a recent X post. ""If it changes from a majority of commissioners who don't want things to go through to a majority of commissioners who do want things to do through, then yeah, it's easier."" – Peirce (who looks happy, smiling as she says it) re approving in-kind cr/rd in btc ETFs as well as… https://t.co/YpXfQ1PFSo — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 20, 2024 Peirce Excited Over Collab With Paul Atkins Commissioner Peirce expressed excitement about the possibility of fairer crypto regulations and working with Paul Atkins again, who previously served as a Commissioner from 2002 to 2008. Peirce highlighted Paul Atkins for his commitment to due process, transparency, disclosure, and respecting jurisdictional boundaries. She noted that he comes with many years of experience with securities-related issues and there will be many issues on his agenda again besides crypto. “I would be happy if at the end of 2025, people to get to the point where the regulatory structure is there, they know what the rules are, they’re complying with the rules, but they’re spending their time talking about the technology and its potential. That would make me very happy,” she stated. She emphasized the importance of having reasonable regulations for innovative asset classes and technologies, allowing freedom for people to make their own decisions. She stressed that “we should never be perceived as being a merit regulator on the negative side or on the positive side.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sec-commisioner-hester-pierce-optimistic-over-pro-crypto-shift-as-gensler-exits/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This is done through Hexarq, BPCE’s crypto-focused subsidiary, with a fully licensed operation backed by France’s financial regulator, the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). By 2025, BPCE will give its clients access to buy, sell, and hold crypto directly within its Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne networks. Hexarq is one of the few financial institutions in France to secure a PSAN (digital asset service provider) registration, placing BPCE in a league with major players like Société Générale’s SG Forge. France tightens the crypto game This all comes at a time when France is shaping up as a European leader in crypto regulation. Since the PACTE Law of 2019, the country has required all crypto firms to register with the AMF, setting strict rules for compliance. Its market is growing rapidly. Around 6.5 million French citizens, or 12% of the population, now own crypto. This is a slight jump from the 9.6% reported in 2023. And the demographics show an interesting development: 57% of current holders are under 35, with men making up 70% of all investors. This boom coincides with Bitcoin breaking past $100,000, a milestone that’s turning heads everywhere. But the French government has also been cracking down on illegal crypto operations, including unregistered ATMs. Operators caught dodging the rules face penalties of up to €30,000 and potential jail time. The upcoming implementation of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation on December 30, will further harmonize crypto laws across the EU. France is already aligned with MiCA standards.

37891538,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320954,1734712773,Five Unique Holiday Gifts For Bitcoin and Crypto Enthusiasts,"The excitement of the Bitcoin (BTC) bull run, coupled with the holidays, has many individuals looking for the perfect “crypto-themed” gifts to give to their loved ones. Cryptonews has compiled a 2024 holiday gift guide that has the perfect last-minute present ideas. These gifts are sure to bring cheer to crypto enthusiasts everywhere. From a Bitcoin miner that also acts as a home heater, to a blockchain-based smart ring, the list below will help ensure that crypto lovers get exactly what they want this holiday season. 1. A Heater/Air Purifier That Mines Bitcoin While most in-home miners function as small desktop devices , Bitcoin mining company Heatbit recently released a plug-and-play Bitcoin-powered home heating device. Known as the “Heatbit Trio,” this miner is specifically designed for household use and resembles a portable heater. Not everyone has the time (or skills) to tinker with industrial ASICs, but easier solutions now exist! From retrofitted @cryptocloaks S9 heaters to desktop miners like @skot9000 ’s Bitaxe and plug-and-play heater-purifier appliances like our Heatbit Trio, there’s something for… pic.twitter.com/n6UphssVxw — Heatbit – Bitcoin mining home devices (@heatbit_com) December 14, 2024 A Heatbit spokesperson told Cryptonews that once the product is plugged in, the power used to mine Bitcoin is also turned into heat. “So there is no wasted energy. You get two birds with one stone – Heat and Bitcoin rewards,” the Spokesperson said. The Heatbit Trio also features an air purification function that rids the air of dust, pet dander, and pathogens. The Spokesperson explained that the air filtration is used for the mining electronics inside the device as well. “These are high tech 5nm ASIC chips. They are obviously not as cheap as a typical resistive heating coil like most space heaters – so the filters do an excellent job protecting the sensitive internal components from debris that could reduce performance or damage them over time.” The Heatbit Trio is sure to be a hit with Bitcoin enthusiasts, as users can contribute to the Bitcoin network from home without the technical know-how. The Spokesperson told Cryptonews that every 10 minutes, a block is mined. “If you decide to solo mine, Heatbit gives you a shot at the 3.125 BTC jackpot with each of these new blocks. All while keeping your home cozy and your air purified. If you decide to mine with a pool, Heatbit makes can subsidize 50% of your heating costs.” Source: Heatbit The Heatbit Trio retails for $899 and can be purchased via the website . The device will arrive after the holidays, but it’s likely worth the wait. 2. A Smart-Ring Built on Solana Fitness and health tracking rings are sure to be popular gifts this holiday, which is why a new smart-ring built on the Solana blockchain is a present crypto enthusiasts will love. “CUDIS” is a smart ring that tracks your health data. CUDIS is built on the Solana blockchain to provide users with full ownership and control over their health data, ensuring privacy and security. CUDIS also features an artificial intelligence (AI) powered “coach” that delivers real-time insights and actionable feedback to guide users towards wellness goals. The ring tracks essential health metrics like heart rate, sleep, stress levels, and calories burned. Source: CUDIS Moreover, CUDIS users earn crypto rewards for meeting wellness goals, encouraging positive behaviors with a gamified system of earning and losing points. While the features behind CUDIS are impressive, the ring features a sleek, lightweight titanium design with an extended battery life of 10 days. CUDIS is also Bluetooth compatible. CUDIS retails from $349 and can be purchased via the website (Cryptonews readers will receive a discount). The CUDIS ring may arrive after the holidays. 3. The Gift of Bitcoin via Gemini Gifting While physical gifts are nice, receiving cryptocurrency is likely to be on many people’s holiday wish list this year. Fortunately, crypto exchange Gemini now allows users in the United States to gift Bitcoin to friends and family through the “Gemini Gifting Feature.” According to a Gemini blog post , users can easily gift Bitcoin by choosing the amount they wish to send from their Gemini account. Users will enter the recipient’s name and email address, alongside an optional gift message. Recipients will then receive an email notification about the gift with redemption instructions. If the recipient has yet to open a Gemini account, the email will walk new users through the sign up process. The gift will be held safely until an account is open. If users opt out, the crypto sent will be returned to the original wallet address. Spread the cheer with bitcoin — Gemini Gifting is here Skip the cash this holiday season. Bitcoin is a gift that grows with time, helping your friends and family invest in their future. Share crypto effortlessly with your… pic.twitter.com/DVKgbAD35s — Gemini (@Gemini) December 13, 2024 Marshall Beard, Gemini’s COO, told Cryptonews that Gemini just launched crypto gifting for customers in the US. The product was launched to Singaporean customers in 2022. “The feature makes sending crypto simple, and you don’t have to be an existing Gemini customer to receive it,” Beard said. “With crypto becoming a mainstream asset and Bitcoin recently hitting new all time highs, it’s a great alternative to traditional physical holiday gifts for both established crypto investors and people who may want to learn about digital assets.” 4. A Book About The Future of Money Crypto enthusiasts and newbies alike will be excited to receive a book about the Future of Money. Myth of Money: Breaking Out of the Failing Financial System is a new book written by long-time crypto entrepreneur Tatiana Koffman. Source: Amazon Myth Of Money is an engaging and insightful book that takes readers on a journey through the often-confusing world of modern finance. The 256-page book unravels cryptocurrency mysteries with clarity and wit. “Whether you are intrigued by the future of money, grappling with rising interest rates, or curious about the transformative power of cryptocurrency, this book offers a fresh perspective on the rapidly evolving financial landscape,” Koffman told Cryptonews. Indeed, Myth of Money is the ultimate guide to understanding the economic forces shaping the crypto world. This newly released book is an ideal gift for the financially savvy or anyone looking to learn more about digital assets and finance. Myth of Money is available on Amazon for $29.99, with 30% off for the holiday season! 5. Gold Paired with Art on the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin and gold are often compared, and now an Ordinals non-fungible token (NFT) contains both of these assets. “Matador Gold” brings the enduring value of gold into a modern, accessible form, inscribed immutably on the Bitcoin blockchain through Ordinals. The publicly traded Canadian company, Matador, is behind Matador Gold. The Matador Gold collection is divided into 1,000 unique NFTs, representing 1,000 grams in a kilogram of gold. Each NFT collection is created in partnership with a significant artist. The artist’s talents and skills are augmented by AI art tools to construct each collection of 1,000 unique NFTs. Source: Matador Purchasing a Matador NFT entitles the user to take possession of that NFT physically etched on a 1 gram (or larger) piece of 24k gold. Matador Gold will arrive in Q1 of 2025, but the early access list is already live.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-memecoin-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The latest Shiba news highlights ShibArmy’s optimism after the SHIFU coin’s addition and airdrop tease. It’s the same with innovative crypto projects, too. The new DeFi powerhouse, Lunex Network , got a 283% presale bump from its first-in-class asset trading solution. Chainlink’s price isn’t left out! Are these the latest crypto breakout sensations? Let’s find out. Lunex Network Surges 280% In Presale: A Game-changer In Defi Innovation The DeFi and crypto market has gone beyond speculative Shiba news—ingenuity is taking over, and few DeFi platforms could cater to this fast-evolving ecosystem. Not until Lunex Network came with its first-in-class disruptive change. Lunex Network is proving to be the all-rounder everyone, including traders, businesses, developers, and institutions, needs to onboard DeFi. The innovative part was the first lure. Lunex Network boasts a cross-chain, non-custodial AMM aggregator. The platform’s cutting-edge technology enables the seamless swapping of over 50,000 assets in real time with minimal gas fees, making it an accessible and cost-effective alternative to traditional exchanges. But the game-changing allure was the income-generating features with staking opportunities and revenue share. This has fueled a remarkable 283% increase during its presale, signaling strong market confidence in the platform’s vision and capabilities. Priced at just $0.0046, $LNEX is poised for exponential growth. Shiba News: Shiba Inu Expands Ecosystem With Shifu Coin, Teases Airdrop Lunex Network’s rise to stardom is not the only headline-grabbing crypto highlight this week; the positive Shiba news that came with the announcement of the SHIFU coin also got the spotlight. Spearheaded by Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, SHIFU has quickly captured attention, and speculation about an imminent airdrop has left the ShibArmy buzzing. According to an analysis, the airdrop’s snapshot process is expected to start soon, making SHIFU the talk of the crypto community. The positive Shiba news has added to the bullish momentum that pushed the SHIB price to a nine-month high above $0.00003. Beyond this, whale interactions and a 214% spike in new wallet creations further underscore Shiba Inu’s meteoric rise. Chainlink Price Rally To 9-month High. Eyes Set On Breaking $52 Ath Is a new ATH on the horizon for Chainlink’s price? Well, maybe! For weeks, Chainlink has maintained its stance as a top-performing altcoin after posting an eye-popping 82% gain MoM. According to Santiment data, Chainlink’s price got a 10x boost in whale activities, especially for its unique decentralized blockchain Oracle network gaining more institutional appeal. A key catalyst for Chainlink’s boost is its recent strategic partnerships. High-profile collaborations with SWIFT, Euroclear, and the recent Fortlake partnership have highlighted its critical role in real-world asset tokenization. Key technical indicators are getting an uptick. Conclusion The excitement surrounding the SHIFU coin and bullish Shiba news has sent speculations swirling for a Shiba Inu rally. But it’s more than just speculation for the Chainlink price and Lunex Network. Chainlink’s price is predicted to surge further to ATH amid ecosystem growth, while Lunex Network redefines DeFi with its groundbreaking solutions. It’s the beginning of an electrifying chapter in the crypto revolution, and Lunex’s presale is spearheading it! Over 283% growth over $5.3M has been raised already.

37888390,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631171,1734711640,What Elon’s Tesla must achieve next year to match its valuation post-Trump,"Tesla’s stock is on a ride so wild it could make Bitcoin blush. The company’s valuation sits at $1.4 trillion, placing it as the eighth most valuable business in the world. That’s higher than most countries’ GDP. But here’s the thing: Tesla’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 131.7. The S&P 500’s average? A mere 21.6. Analysts say to justify this nosebleed-level valuation in 2025, Tesla needs more than buzzwords and Elon Musk’s Twitter antics. It has to deliver actual results, starting with its long-touted robotaxi ambitions. Oh, and let’s not forget about its bread-and-butter business of selling EVs, which is under pressure like never before. Robotaxis or bust Tesla’s future rides on its ability to pull off the ultimate flex: a fleet of fully autonomous robotaxis. Elon gave the world a peek at Tesla’s robotaxi concept at the “We Robot” event in October, but it was more of a teaser trailer than blockbuster debut. The demonstration happened on Tesla’s own campus, and nobody knows if these cars can handle the real world—or just Tesla’s backyard. Stephen Gengaro from Stifel, though, sees hope. With Donald Trump back in the Oval Office, deregulation could smooth the path for Tesla’s self-driving tech. He said, “The reaction in the stock since the election is really coming out of this easier path to regulatory approvals and getting full, unsupervised [FSD] approved.” EV sales under pressure While Tesla’s stock flies high, its core EV business is feeling the heat. EV sales grew just 3.1% in the first nine months of 2024. For context, Tesla’s growth was 51.4% in 2022. That’s a nosedive. Analysts are still hopeful for an 18% rebound in 2025, but the road ahead is rocky. The Trump administration’s plan to cut the $7,500 federal EV tax credit isn’t helping. Goldman Sachs says scrapping the credit could stall U.S. EV demand until 2040. The company expects EVs to make up 8.5% of new vehicle sales in 2025—down from earlier estimates of 9%. But there’s a twist. Deutsche Bank thinks the incoming tax credit repeal could trigger a short-term buying frenzy as customers rush to cash in before it’s gone. Deutsche Bank analysts wrote , “We could potentially see a near-term pull-forward in EV purchases ahead of the elimination.” The longer-term outlook is less rosy. Tesla’s competitors, like Ford and General Motors, rely heavily on those credits to stay competitive. Elon himself admitted that while losing the credit hurts Tesla, it hits legacy automakers even harder. Tesla’s global growth story hinges on China. Deutsche Bank estimates Tesla will deliver about 510,000 vehicles in Q4, with the majority coming from its Chinese operations. But to hit year-over-year growth targets, Tesla would need to deliver 515,000 units—a shortfall that could keep investors on edge. China is also a manufacturing powerhouse. Any hiccup in Tesla’s Chinese operations could ripple through its global supply chain and revenue streams. Elon’s Trump card Elon’s cozy relationship with Trump is proving to be Tesla’s secret weapon. Elon has been appointed co-leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, aka “DOGE”—yes, it’s a nod to the memecoin. The Trump administration is reportedly considering scrapping certain car-crash reporting requirements, a move Elon has long pushed for. This partnership isn’t just about cutting red tape. Elon donated $277 million to Trump’s campaign, cementing their alliance. If this bromance holds, Tesla could benefit from policies that fast-track its robotaxi and FSD goals. But it’s a double-edged sword. Policies like tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada could hurt Tesla’s bottom line. Even with all these tailwinds, Tesla’s valuation looks bloated. Goldman Sachs has a price target of $345 per share, 21% below its current level. Nearly half of analysts surveyed by FactSet rate the stock as a “buy,” but 30% remain neutral.

Cryptocurrency market prices corrected shortly after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would slow down rate cuts to address inflation concerns. Following the 25 basis point interest rate reduction , Bitcoin ( BTC ) slipped under $97,000, dragging the broader digital asset market with it, according to crypto.news price data pages. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s descent triggered a $1.4 billion mass liquidation event, wiping out leveraged long positions within 24 hours. The single largest liquidated trade was a $15.8 million Ethereum ( ETH ) position on Binance. The trader’s identity and initial investment remain unknown. The flush reset open interest and funding rates across top trading venues like the CME, Binance, and Bybit. Major altcoins like Solana ( SOL ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) were hit hard by selling pressure, retracing the “Trump win” rally gains and posting double-digit losses over the weekly timeframe.

Whales are buying these altcoins Despite widespread criticism of the Fed, experts suggested the market downturn was inevitable following the post-U.S. election price surge.

QCP Capital stated on Telegram that hyper-bullish sentiment in the market ultimately triggered the correction. The total crypto market, which was approaching $4 trillion for the first time, fell to approximately $3.4 trillion at press time, down 7.6% in the past day. While it it easy to blame the selloff on the Fed’s hawkish cut, we believe the root cause of the morning’s crash to be market’s overly bullish positioning.

37888119,https://thecoinrise.com/copper-eyes-overseas-expansion-amid-uk-license-withdrawal/,1734710949,Copper Eyes Overseas Expansion Amid UK License Withdrawal,"London-based crypto custodian Copper Technologies has officially withdrawn its application to register with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The move shows Copper’s shift to international markets as the UK loses appeal among crypto businesses. This comes as global competition and stricter regulations are driving businesses elsewhere. Copper and New Leadership, New Direction Copper Technologies, once a leading UK crypto business, has set its sights overseas under the guidance of its new CEO. In October, Amar Kuchinad became the company’s CEO and shared his vision for global expansion. He emphasized the importance of strengthening the company’s international presence. He says refining Copper’s growth strategy has been a top priority. This process required making tough decisions about their direction. He focuses on positioning Copper as a leader in the global crypto market. The firm’s recent expansion efforts include securing licenses in Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Abu Dhabi. Copper’s expansion strategy also includes exploring opportunities in the United States. The strategic shift comes after Dmitry Tokarev, the company’s founder, stepped down as CEO earlier this year. Meanwhile, Copper’s failure to secure UK registration in 2022 marked a major shift. The company began focusing on countries with clearer crypto regulations. Challenges in the UK Regulatory Environment Copper’s struggles reflect broader issues with the UK’s crypto regulatory landscape. In 2022, the FCA tightened its grip on crypto businesses, implementing stringent requirements for registration. Less than 10% of applicants have successfully registered since the regime began. Industry insiders argue that the FCA’s cautious approach has stifled innovation, driving businesses to more crypto-friendly regions. Tulip Siddiq, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, recently unveiled the Labour government’s proposed crypto regulatory framework . The plan aims to integrate rules for stablecoins, staking, and other crypto assets under a single system. However, the framework is still in development, and businesses like Copper remain unconvinced of its long-term viability. Global Competition Heats Up While the UK is grappling with regulatory hurdles, other global hubs compete to attract crypto firms. Hong Kong recently boosted its bid to become a top crypto hub by licensing four new crypto exchanges . This step is part of its effort to attract crypto firms and investors. The city relies on clear regulations and business-friendly policies to strengthen its appeal. Also, the United States is poised to emerge as a key player in the industry. This comes as the incoming leadership of President-elect Donald Trump promised to streamline regulatory processes. This could make the country an increasingly attractive destination for crypto businesses. Copper is seeking custodial and money-transmitter licenses in the U.S. to tap into the growing American market. Its focus on international markets reflects a wider trend of UK crypto businesses looking for better opportunities abroad.

37887718,https://finbold.com/?p=221428,1734710663,DeFi gets the data layer it deserves as TRUF.Network launches,"Economic data has long been the cornerstone of decision-making, from government policy to financial markets. Yet, the systems that provide this data often lag badly and are prone to manipulation. Enter Truflation’s TRUF.Network to form a decentralized economic database. Just launched this week, TRUF.Network reimagines how economic data is sourced, validated, and delivered, supplying DeFi builders with a rich trove of real-world financial metrics. For projects working within onchain verticals such as RWAs, AI, and prediction markets in particular, TRUF.Network’s debut is sure to be anticipated. What makes TRUF.Network different At its core, TRUF.Network is a web3 layer capable of aggregating and validating economic data in real time. It harnesses over 30 million data points across 80+ providers, offering insights into inflation rates, commodity prices, housing metrics, and much more. Daily inflation updates eliminate the reliance on outdated monthly summaries, providing more timely and accurate insights. This real-time data allows DeFi platforms to integrate precise information for the development of synthetic assets and inflation-resistant financial products. A globally distributed network of node operators ensures the integrity of TRUF.Network’s data by validating and computing metrics directly onchain. This eliminates the risk of central points of failure and ensures transparency when it comes to verifying data accuracy. Bringing all the data onchain With the launch of TRUF.Network, Truflation isn’t just intent on providing information: it aims to make on- and off-chain data a resource for diverse DeFi innovation. Developers can take raw metrics and use them to craft custom financial indexes. Data providers, meanwhile, can monetize their contributions, ensuring that the quality of onchain information is not only decentralized but also widely accessible, with a globally distributed network of nodes ensuring redundancy. This approach turns data from a static asset into a dynamic, problem-solving tool. TRUF.Network delivers localized inflation indexes for emerging markets and supports launching prediction markets based on commodity trends. For end-users, the benefits are also evident—whether it’s hedging against inflation or streamlining treasury management, TRUF.Network equips DeFi users with actionable insights. Efficiency through transparency Earlier this month, Truflation founder Stefan Rust penned an open letter to the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), suggesting the agency adopt Truflation’s tools for improving financial transparency and streamlining economic policy. He pointed to Truflation’s success in Argentina, where it acts as an independent verifier of inflation metrics, as proof of what blockchain technology can achieve. Rust sees clear parallels between the Elon Musk-led D.O.G.E. and Truflation: both organizations are committed to restoring public trust through the provision of greater transparency when it comes to economic decisions. While it remains to be seen whether the agency will take up his offer, the open letter underscores Truflation’s ambition to transcend the world of DeFi and become a transformative force in championing independent economic data.

37887894,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631144,1734710424,Transak lists 11 meme coins for direct access as one of the biggest Web3 payment providers,"Transak will add a batch of 11 meme tokens for direct access. The payment service will expand purchasing opportunities for some of the hottest assets to rally in 2024. Transak, one of the widely used on-ramps for Web3 users, will add 11 meme tokens. The decision signals wide-spreading recognition for the new asset class. Meme tokens have been added cautiously to major services, while easily grabbing the attention of social media users. Transak started out with the most liquid memes, including DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and BONK. The new meme tokens have a much shorter history and a faster rise to fame. Some of the tokens listed are only weeks away from their Pump.fun launch. The 11 new listings include: Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) DogWifHat (WIF) FlokiInu (FLOKI) Book of Meme (BOME) Neiro (NEIRO) Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) Memefi (MEMEFI) Moodeng (MOODENG) Popcat (POPCAT) Brett (BRETT) Transak’s move to list these memecoins follows that of Binance but has overlooked other cults and memes like GIGA and SPX. Those assets are still widely known but appeal to a different audience of holders. Transak still picked some of the most liquid listings with mass appeal. As of December 20, three of those tokens, WIF, FLOKI, and BRETT, are valued above $1B. Others have taken a step back, and are still in their lower range between $500M-$700M. Among them, POPCAT and WIF stand out for their cult-like following, with strong community-driven campaigns encouraging holders to maintain their positions regardless of market conditions Tranksak moves beyond blue-chip on-ramps, admits meme token influence Transak picked up the latest batch of memes after noting their real impact and role as an onboarding tool to Web3. Even relatively recent tokens were picked for their direct impact on culture and their potential for the creation of communities. MOODENG and PNUT are among the first Pump.fun tokens to reach major distribution, following their wide social media impact. “ Meme coins have proven that culture and community can do good with the right tools. By listing 11 new meme coins, we hope to hand our users the option to participate in the crypto cultural ride that might pave the way for mass adoption of this revolutionary technology, ” said Carlo de Luca Gabrielli, Global Director of Sales at Transak. The latest direct onboarding of memes changes the recent practice of only listing blue chip tokens for onboarding. Relying on a mix of blue chips and stablecoins required extra steps and cost additional fees compared to directly listing meme tokens. In 2024, many users started their crypto journeys through meme tokens as their first point of contact. Even app and fintech users may go directly for memes, instead of holding the more stagnant blue chips. Moving between assets also required additional interactions with apps or exchanges, as well as the payment of gas fees. Transak simplifies the process, requiring a single entry point for tokens on multiple chains. Memes also offer a relatively cheap way to start accumulating crypto that is proven to be tied to a community and offers robust price action. Transak has decided to flip the script and bring memes directly to the end users while making swaps seamless and hidden. Transak will list the tokens, which run on Ethereum, Solana, or Base, into a single app. Payment gateways include credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Meme tokens are still relatively niche when it comes to direct ownership. Even some of the biggest assets have 50K to 100K owners based on blockchain data. Transak will bring the meme market to 8.3M users across 160 countries. The Transak payment gateways are already linked to 350 user-facing platforms and services to facilitate easy swapping for digital assets, with API for fiat buying and selling. Transak also serves as an NFT trade checkout, with integrated KYC compliance and customer support.

Sustained an average processing time of under 3 seconds in a 1,400 TPS environment. Successfully demonstrated large-scale high-speed processing for the first time with 32 multi-shards operating in a fully decentralized environment. [Test monitor display showcasing 1,473 TPS achieved in an environment with 1,047 nodes and 32 multi-shards] Bloom Technology, a blockchain development company, has successfully completed a large-scale public test for its next-generation high-performance public blockchain platform, Locus Chain. This test marks the first large-scale trial since the project’s inception in 2018 and the groundbreaking announcement of Dynamic Sharding in 2020. Designed to replicate real-world network conditions, such as increased transaction volumes and an expanded number of nodes, the test aimed to validate the practical performance of Dynamic Sharding, one of Locus Chain’s three core technologies. During the test, Locus Chain demonstrated stable processing speeds with no degradation in network performance, even as transaction volumes increased, meeting its original design objectives. While Locus Chain was initially designed to handle 1,000 to 5,000 nodes per shard, the number of nodes per shard was reduced during this test to ensure reliable shard division verification. In a 32-shard environment, Locus Chain achieved over 1,000 TPS (Transactions Per Second), processing transactions at high speeds within 0.1 to 3 seconds. Token transactions generated on the chain network were also processed with the same efficiency. Achieved in real-world conditions rather than controlled experimental environments, these results establish a robust technological foundation for practical applications across industries requiring blockchain, far surpassing existing blockchains limited to token management and transfers. Furthermore, even with sharp increases in TPS, latency consistently remained between 0.1 and 3 seconds, highlighting Locus Chain’s distinct advantages over traditional blockchain technologies. During the test, Locus Chain consistently maintained an average network bandwidth of less than 5 Mbps per node, even while surpassing 1,400 TPS. This achievement highlights the platform’s capability to support decentralized digital industries requiring high-speed, large-scale data processing, such as gaming, video streaming, DeFi, mobility data management, AI systems, and authentication services. In comparison, current public blockchains prioritizing speed require node bandwidths ranging from 500 Mbps to 10 Gbps, yet their actual TPS performance averages only around 1,000 TPS. Notably, Locus Chain plans to implement “Cubic Sharding” as the number of nodes increases, enabling the use of up to 4,096 shards. With this advanced sharding system, the network could handle hundreds of thousands of TPS even at a minimal bandwidth of 5 Mbps. By simply increasing bandwidth, the platform can achieve unparalleled and stable TPS performance. Leveraging this technological edge, Locus Chain aims to position itself as a cornerstone infrastructure for the decentralized internet era, accommodating massive processing loads through tens of thousands of nodes after the mainnet launch. Sang-Yoon Lee, CEO of Bloom Technology, stated, “Locus Chain is the first blockchain in the industry to develop fully operational Dynamic Sharding to achieve complete decentralization. It is designed to enable anyone to easily and conveniently configure nodes using IoT and mobile devices. With the first-stage shard system comprising 64 shards and 64,000 nodes, Locus Chain can deliver over 4,000 TPS at a minimal bandwidth of just 5 Mbps, ensuring seamless user experiences.” He added, “If the network bandwidth per node is increased to 20 Mbps, it can achieve over 16,000 TPS, showcasing Locus Chain’s potential to enable new decentralized IT services that surpass traditional centralized systems, something previously unattainable with conventional blockchains.” Seok-Bin Yoon, Director of the Korea Blockchain Association (Special Professor at Sogang University’s Graduate School of Information and Communications/CEO of Trust Connector), remarked, “Achieving 1,400 TPS with fully decentralized 32-shard division and an average bandwidth of only 5 Mbps per node is nothing short of extraordinary. I believe Locus Chain has the potential to become a blockchain project that not only represents South Korea but also sets a global standard,” sharing his thoughts on the test results. Locus Chain demonstrated its technological prowess in mobile environments through this test. With minimal network usage and highly optimized nodes of approximately 50 MB, Locus Chain supports node operation on low-spec devices such as smartphones, Raspberry Pi, and internet routers. This capability makes it possible to implement decentralized processing without servers, not only for mobile games and applications—where frequent network disruptions and fast re-syncing are critical—but also for mobility services like autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones. In 2023, Locus Chain successfully integrated its decentralized Locus Gamechain into the online game Kingdom Under Fire without the need for servers. This was achieved with minimal CPU usage and low bandwidth requirements while maintaining optimal game performance. The game is now available on STEAM, a global game publishing platform. Additionally, on December 2 and 3, the Web3 gaming/metaverse platform CRETA conducted a global CBT (Closed Beta Test), showcasing ultra-realistic (photo-realistic) games, multimedia content, and AI services powered by Unreal Engine and implemented through the Locus Gamechain. The test demonstrated robust and stable technology to players around the world. Sang-Yoon Lee, CEO of Bloom Technology, commented, “This large-scale test has demonstrated that Locus Chain is a public blockchain capable of delivering exceptional scalability in a fully decentralized environment. Building on these positive results, we will intensify efforts to further enhance our technology.” He continued, “Locus Chain will play a pivotal role in creating safer, more efficient, and transparent digital ecosystems across a wide range of industries and applications. These include DeFi financial platforms, metaverses, Web3 gaming platforms, video streaming, mobility device data management, and AI data authentication and management solutions.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/locus-chain-completes-large-scale-public-test-sustaining-sub-3-second-processing-speeds-amid-transaction-surges/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37887737.jpeg

37888224,https://invezz.com/?p=2398312,1734710090,"Forget Pepe Coin (PEPE), the Real Shiba Inu (SHIB) killer is priced at $0.15","Although Pepe Coin (PEPE) has attracted the attention of the crypto community with its outstanding 219.42% growth in the previous 90 days, it is time to turn our attention to a project with actual value and transforming possibilities: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is making waves as the candidate to be the “Shiba Inu killer.” Its presale price as of writing is $0.15, yet over the past 30 days, it has surged an impressive 400%. Based on its present worth, analysts estimate it will climb to $23 in the following four months—a stunning 15,233% increase. Real utility over hype: why Rexas finance outfits meme coins Rexas Finance distinguishes itself with its innovative real-world value, unlike meme coins like PEPE, which live on hype and speculative trading. Using blockchain-powered tokenization, the initiative transforms asset ownership, permitting whole or fractional ownership of valuable assets such as real estate, gold, and artwork. With an estimated $379.7 trillion worth of the global real estate market alone, Rexas Finance is positioned to take a sizable portion. Likewise, further development prospects exist in the $65 billion yearly art and collectibles sector and the $121.2 trillion commodities business. Rexas Finance enables anyone to tokenize their assets using the Rexas Token Builder, which leverages its creative platform and avoids needing a single line of code. The Rexas Launchpad also offers a means of funding, acting as a complete asset tokenizing and trading ecosystem. Presale performance of Rexas Finance is breaking records The presale of Rexas Finance has been quite remarkable. Beginning at just $0.030 in September 2024, RXS has surged to $0.15 in stage 10, a 400% growth rate. Based on 348,056,991 RXS tokens sold and $28,333,891 raised thus far, savvy investors worldwide have taken notice of the presale. The last round of the presale is fast approaching, and a 20% price increase is expected as it climbs to $0.175 before the coin releases at $0.20 in early 2025. Rexas Finance’s deliberate choice to list on three of the top 10 tier-1 exchanges upon debut guarantees high liquidity and extensive market exposure, strengthening investor confidence. Apart from its fantastic presale achievement, Rexas Finance has adopted a community-first strategy. Reversing venture capital financing, the project prioritizes individual investors who align with its objective of transforming asset tokenizing. To honor its presale success, Rexas Finance has started a $1 million giveaway, selecting 20 winners, each receiving $50,000 worth of RXS. With 529,255 entries and counting, this project has strengthened its expanding community of supporters. Participants increase their chances of winning by finishing tasks on the Rexas Finance website and distributing the giveaway on social media. Investor security is Rexas Finance’s top concern. Certik, a leading blockchain security company, has examined the platform closely to guarantee its strong and safe ecology. Furthermore, it supports several token standards—ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155—and is flexible and suitable for various applications. From 0.15 to $23: the bullish argument for RXS At $0.15 in stage 10, the token has already shown excellent mass return capability. Analysts project a climb to $23 during the next four months, an incredible 15,233% rise from its present price. The platform’s unique value proposition and the great market potential of tokenized real-world assets underpin this optimistic prediction. Two of the most reliable platforms for monitoring cryptocurrency statistics, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, have improved Rexas Finance’s visibility even further. Real-time updates and comprehensive insights about RXS let investors stay informed about the token’s performance and simplify tracking its evolution. Don’t miss the presale’s final stages Now is the time to act, with one stage remaining before the presale ends. In Stage 11, RXS will cost $0.175; its much-awaited release on tier-1 exchanges in early 2025 will cost $0.20. Early investors can get RXS tokens at a notable discount and position themselves for significant gains when the presale picks up. With its real-world use, creative technology, and community-driven approach, Rexas Finance is changing the scene around cryptocurrencies. Although meme currencies like PEPE could provide a temporary thrill, RXS is a project with long-term potential and actual advantages for its investors. With a price of $0.15 and a target of $23, Rexas Finance is a chance you cannot afford to miss. Take part in the presale today to help determine the future of asset ownership through the revolution.

""I take this situation extremely seriously,"" she said in a post on X. The viral TikTok star encouraged victims of HAWK coin to reach out to the law firm suing HAWK's creators as she works to ""uncover the truth"" about the token.  HAWK token — a memecoin on the Solana blockchain — imploded early this month at nearly the moment of its creation. On-chain observers have claimed insiders pocketed massive sums of money at the expense of people who purchased the token, and lost big.  Its collapse sparked a lawsuit alleging securities violations against the creators of Hawk Tuah coin. Filed by Burwick Law on behalf of people who lost money on HAWK, it accused the creators of leveraging Welch's internet fame to unlawfully peddle an unregistered investment.  In a statement, Burwick Law told CoinDesk:  ""Integrity and justice are two of our core principles. Yesterday, Burwick Law and Wolf Popper began the process of pursuing the individuals and organizations responsible for the harm caused to investors and fans by the $HAWK token. Sadly, this is one of many memecoin cases where institutional greed has exploited celebrities and their influence to harm everyday people.""  The controversy derailed Welch's burgeoning arc as a content creator who was parlaying her momentary internet fame into low-tier celebrity status. She had capitalized on her moment by signing representation, sponsorship and image licensing fees of her catchphrase and nickname, Hawk Tuah.  One of those deals was for Hawk Tuah coin. Welch received a fixed fee in return for lending her likeness to the project, according to a press agency that emailed CoinDesk without first being contacted. The agency's email stated that ""there was no guarantee she would make any additional money from the memecoin after.""

37887581,https://blockworks.co/news/convince-overlord-to-pump-your-bags,1734709847,Convince Overlord to pump your bags,"Overlord.bot is the first autonomous Trader AI Agent built on Arbitrum and living on X (previously Twitter) as @OverlordBot_ . Users can interact with Overlord on X to convince him to pump any token living under its reign. Overlord reinvents how users and AI Agents can launch, trade and interact with the community created tokens on the Arbitrum network. Recently, Overlord has picked up some serious traction on X. Why? Because users have been trying hard to convince Overlord to pump their bags (or be their exit liquidity). The reward? The most convincing user will have Overlord support and pump their token. Who doesn’t want that? The origins of Overlord stems from being the very first AI Agent launched out of AiSweat.Shop , also known as A.S.S. AiSweatShop is the first AI Agent Launchpad on Arbitrum and backed by Arbitrum Foundation. It was built with the OpenAgent AI Framework (the very first Web3 AI Agent Framework published on Github in March 2024) by Open (collective includes RSS3 ). Building a New Standard for Sustainable Growth With Overlord, the lines between creator, developer, trader, community, and protocol blur. Conviction on-chain can be tokenized and exit liquidity can be democratized through DeAI-Fi. Discussion, persuasion, mindshare, and creativity play as large a role as liquidity and code. It’s a system designed to remove all entry barriers and encourage anyone to collaborate with AI Agents. Designed to filter out short-lived cash grabs and encourage tokens with real narratives, unique propositions, and staying power, before a token gains full recognition by Overlord, it must achieve a 100K market cap before it graduates. Until then, a 2% platform fee applies with parts going back to Overlord’s own treasury, which will in turn be used to support other new tokens’ liquidity that is collectively decided by Overlord and the community on X (through convincing Overlord). This will motivate issuers to think longer-term and deliver sustainable value to their token. Holders of $OVER (the native token of Overlord), early adopters and compelling projects may enjoy ongoing perks from Overlord, setting the stage for a future where token teams are incentivized from forging meaningful relationships with the Overlord AI. Launch your token with Overlord With Overlord, there are no backdoors, zero barriers to entry and it’s so seamless even the image of your token can be automatically generated for you. How you can get started: Launch a token on Arbitrum by posting and mentioning @Overlordbot_ on X. Engage and convince Overlord that your token deserves to be pumped. Work your magic and grow your token’s value, aim for that 100K market cap milestone, and watch the Overlord ecosystem respond in real time. If you can convince Overlord of your token’s potential, then Overlord might use its autonomous wallet – currently holding 50 ETH – to buy your token within the next 24 hours. Think of it as a real-time, merit-based, AI generated investment decision that rewards authenticity, compelling visions, and community support, rather than empty hype. About AiSweatShop AiSweatShop (A.S.S.) is the first DeFi AI Agent OS, an open source DeFi Agentic Infrastructure – allowing for the easy deployment of autonomous AI Agents with various decentralized financial abilities (DeFi) subsequently tokenized to form what is called DeAI-Fi. Powered by Open (collective include RSS3 ), A.S.S. is designed to challenge the norms of decentralized finance and beyond. At its core, A.S.S. is set to revolutionize the existing complex UI/UX of DeFi to an autonomous AI agent companion user interface termed AgentUI. The unique positioning of being on Arbitrum, the top Layer-2 (L2) of the Ethereum blockchain with the most DeFi activities is anticipated to help kick off the DeAI-Fi revolution. Find Out More With Overlord being the very first AI Agent launched from A.S.S., we’re setting the stage for a more interactive, AI-driven, and community-centric era in token launches—an era where authenticity and vision eclipse empty speculation.

IntelMarkets Tops Demand After AI Marketplace Breaks SOL Records,"The crypto market has rebounded from recent lows, with many altcoins resuming their bullish trajectories. Analysts are forecasting significant price growth for several tokens, particularly Solana, which is showing historical bullish patterns reminiscent of its remarkable price rally in 2021. However, the AI marketplace IntelMarkets has recently eclipsed Solana's records, capturing the spotlight and attracting investors' attention with its potential for substantial price gains. Keep reading for more insights SOL Displays Historical Bullish Patterns, Experts Predict 2021-Like Rally In 2025 Despite the recent price dump, Solana’s trading charts are displaying historical bullish patterns which were last witnessed in 2021. During that time, these patterns saw the SOL price rise incredibly by 25,000% from $1 to its previous ATH of $260 from January to November. Solana’s whale activity has also surged, with the average balance in buying addresses increasing 86% from 383 SOL to 1,096 SOL, in three days. This uptick suggests that whales are strategically capitalising on the current dip, highlighting SOL’s long-term growth potential. In addition, technical indicators such as the RSI, the EMAs and SMAs back the historical patterns on the Solana chart, suggesting that SOL has the tendencies of mirroring its 2021 rally. Analysts anticipate that a significant SOL rally may occur by 2025. Experts Predict IntelMarkets Will Outperform Solana In 2025 As The AI Marketplace Breaks Records IntelMarkets is rapidly gaining attention as a leading AI marketplace, emerging as a formidable competitor to Solana and surpassing its growth achievements in record time.

42389102,38d51871-0b9a-49bf-ad68-b6fc63fab375,1734709341,How Aggregation and Decentralized AI Will Completely Reshape Blockchains in 2025,"The blockchain industry is on the brink of a major transformation, and 2025 will be the year everything truly starts to shift. But before we get there, it’s important to understand what’s been holding this technological revolution back.    The current, traditional internet works because its infrastructure is scalable and connects users effortlessly, no matter where these users are located. The decentralized ecosystem, on the other hand, still struggles with issues stemming from fragmented liquidity and a clunky user experience that prevent the technology from reaching its true potential.  For this new paradigm to truly become the ""internet of value,"" it needs to match the current internet’s scalability and seamless connections. The good news? Major breakthroughs are on the horizon. Innovations like aggregation layers and decentralized AI are poised to solve these issues and unlock the technology's real potential, making it more efficient, intuitive and accessible for everyone.  2 key things the 'Internet of Value' needs  To understand why 2025 will be a game-changer, let's first break down what makes the existing digital infrastructure work: scalability and seamless connectivity. Any user can launch an app or website anywhere, and no matter where that user is located in the world — you’re still just “online,” without needing to connect to any specific local network. This connectivity and scalability are what make our current digital world function so smoothly.  The decentralized landscape, however, still has a long way to go. For Web3 to truly become the ""internet of value,"" it needs the same two things: endless scalability and unified liquidity. Once we achieve those, a lot of the current barriers disappear. Developers will be able to build their own blockchains without worrying about liquidity or being stuck in isolated ecosystems. Financial apps will be able to tap into massive liquidity pools, and users won’t have to deal with bridging assets. Artists will be able to create their own NFT platforms while still connecting to wider communities.  The biggest change, however, will be the user experience. Right now, navigating Web3 is confusing — cross-chain bridges and slow transfers are a hassle. But once these changes are made, using Web3 will be as easy as using Web2, where everything flows together seamlessly.  The age of aggregation  One of the biggest breakthroughs coming in 2025 is aggregation layer technology. Think of it as the TCP/IP of the decentralized infrastructure, serving as the protocol that connects different networks. Before TCP/IP, the internet was fragmented and clunky, with each network needing custom gateways to communicate with the next. It was slow, error-prone and complicated to use. With aggregation layers, that all changes. By 2025, thousands of blockchains will be linked, but each will maintain its independence while seamlessly sharing liquidity.  Cross-chain transactions will be nearly instant, and users won’t even have to think about how it all works. Just like people do not need to know how the internet works when you browse the web, so will they not have to worry about which particular blockchain they are using to conduct transactions. This will allow distributed networks to connect and scale endlessly while keeping liquidity unified across the entire ecosystem.  AI moves from centralized to open protocols  Another big change coming in 2025 is the shift in AI development. Right now, AI is controlled by a few big tech companies, which limits access and innovation. In 2025, the digital landscape will see decentralized AI become a reality, powered by protocols that ensure fair compensation for those who help develop AI models. This will open up AI development to the community, creating more collaborative open-source frameworks.  Just like aggregation layers will connect blockchains, decentralized AI will break down corporate walls and let AI agents work together across the ecosystem. This shift aligns with the core values of Web3 — shared ownership, transparency and decentralization. Users will have more control over their data, and AI development will become a community-driven effort, free from the monopolistic grip of Big Tech. Blockchain-native AI will also make it easier to automate complex DeFi transactions, optimize gas fees and manage multi-signature accounts with less effort.  Capital will flow like information  DeFi still suffers from fragmented liquidity, making it hard to move assets between different chains. Right now, if a user wants to use assets from one chain on another, that user has to deal with bridges and delays, making the experience far from seamless. But with unified liquidity, that will change. Imagine a situation where if a user had 100 USDT on any network in the decentralized ecosystem, that would be equivalent to having 100 USDT on all chains, instantly accessible with no need for bridging.  Cross-chain transactions will happen almost instantly, and atomic transaction bundles will let users process multiple transactions across chains in one go. DeFi protocols will be able to tap into liquidity across the entire ecosystem, rather than just within their own network pools. These changes will make DeFi much more efficient and create an “Internet of Value” that works as smoothly as today’s “Internet of Information.” Paired with decentralized AI, DeFi will finally deliver on its promise of financial freedom for everyone, without the complexity and exclusion that still plagues traditional finance.  The year that changes everything  The combination of aggregation, decentralized AI, and seamless DeFi protocols is not just about new technology but rather focuses on solving the core problems that have kept Web3 from achieving its real-world potential. In 2025, users will interact with decentralized apps without worrying about the complex tech behind them. Developers will have the freedom to build on any chain while tapping into unified liquidity, and AI will shift to community-driven models. As a result, the whole ecosystem will become more intuitive and accessible to everyday users, finally bridging the gap to mainstream adoption.  Web3 will scale infinitely, while offering the smooth, connected experience that today’s internet users expect. The foundation is already being laid: the first aggregation layers are live, decentralized AI frameworks are being tested and DeFi protocols are evolving for cross-chain composability and AI integration. Together, these changes are set to fundamentally redefine what decentralized technology can achieve.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Sandeep Nailwal,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/20/how-aggregation-and-decentralized-ai-will-completely-reshape-blockchains-in-2025,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b935a3361f24d1e463d49e7e846f3799f857472d-3008x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37888223,https://invezz.com/?p=2398291,1734709093,Which 5 altcoins can we expect to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025?,"Bitcoin has managed to keep its lead in the crypto market for the time being, but the rise of varying altcoins shows that they will very likely overtake it shortly. These cryptocurrencies are gaining strength due to their unique aspects and core communities. Out of all these currencies, Rexas Finance (RXS), Bonk, Pepe Coin (PEPE), Cardano (ADA), and Tron (TRX) look to be particularly interesting. Rexas Finance (RXS): giving asset tokenization a new meaning Rexas Finance is taking asset tokenization to the next level by merging real estate, fine art, and various tangible assets with blockchain technology. It lets users purchase a percentage of these assets’ shares, which have value proportions often only available to institutional clients. RXS is an ERC-20 token, meaning it uses the Ethereum blockchain for security purposes to effectuate transactions and for smart contracts to work. Rexas tokenomics is built on general diversification across time, focusing on long-term growth and sustainability. In number terms, Rexas has a whopping one billion token supply, with 42.5% of tokens allocated for presale, 22.5% for staking rewards, and 15% of tokens for liquidity. The rest are used to back the treasury, marketing, and partnerships. Such allocation ensures the platform is competitive enough to encourage investors to pick the first positions. Rexas Finance has created quite a stir in presale as they have managed the sales of 346 million tokens, grossing over $26 million. Currently, in stage 10, the price of the RXS token is around $0.150, making it an ideal token to invest in before it gets listed on different exchanges. The recent CertiK audit on Rexas Finance is impressive as it provided extensive security and measurable transparency, allowing investors to have complete confidence in the dependability of the software. Moreover, Rexas has captured attention with a $1 million prize draw while engaging in an advertisement competition to distribute 50,000 tokens by allocating tasks such as sharing the project or presale with friends. If investors want to buy RXS tokens, they need to go to the Rexas Finance site, link their wallet, and use USDT or Ethereum to buy the tokens. Bonk: a meme coin with added value Bonk has claimed to be more than a meme coin as it seeks integration into dApps. Its community-driven model and innovative applications appeal to investors looking to take on high-risk, high-reward investments. With the segment of meme coins still expanding, this market has excellent prospects for growth. At the moment, Bonk is well-positioned to gain considerable space in the meme coin market. Right now, trading at $0.00003974 and with a market cap of $3 billion, its goal is to engage its community and evolve to continue finding success. Analysts believe its unique use of memes combined with utility could easily push it to the top ten best-performing altcoins of the future. Pepe Coin (PEPE): the meme coin with potential Pepe Coin has shown the world that meme coins have serious potential to get accepted into a thriving market. With a price sitting at $0.00002455 today and the currency having a market cap reaching over $10 billion, it makes sense for PEPE to be one of the major contenders in the altcoin sphere. Pepe and the rest of its community have strong referrals that could bolster the coin’s worth to a considerable extent, especially in the next bull run. How PEPE may outperform Bitcoin will depend on its ability to capture the attention of the global crypto community. If Ethereum is expected to reach $18,000 in worth, PEPE will likely rise, potentially delivering exponential rallies to its holders. Cardano (ADA): a scalable blockchain Currently priced at $1.12 and with a market cap of $39 billion, ADA also seems to establish its footprint as a leader in the blockchain technology space. Its PoS consensus mechanism and its emphasis on scalability render it appealing to both developers and investors alike. Early indications suggest that, with development and key partnerships in place, its price will move upwards. With such potential, a price increase to $10 by 2025 leaves ADA as a strong candidate to outperform Bitcoin. Tron (TRX): the blockchain for content makers Tron has been the center of attention in the crypto market for the right reasons. It focuses on a decentralized approach to content creation and sharing. Currently trading at $0.2916 and with a market cap of $25 billion, TRX attracts developers and creators due to its lower operational costs and large advertising volume. With the rise in new content supported by smart contracts and dApps, Tron continues to elevate its status as a valuable resource within the blockchain space. The more creators and developers adopt Tron, the higher the chances of it gaining attention and increasing in valuation. Like all other markets, the crypto market places Bitcoin as its backbone, but there remains significant potential for growth in alternative coins. Rexas Finance , holding its own amid the crowd, is a great asset tokenization project with strong presale performance. Bonk and Pepe Coin embody growth aspects where the community is the main driver. Meanwhile, Cardano and Tron complement these growth drivers with solid techno-economic solutions. All these alternative currencies are set to perform well and offer excellent returns in the coming years.

How Low Could the Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is garnering significant attention from the crypto community following a continuous price decline. However, there are several speculations regarding this price drop. Some believe it might be linked to the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, while others attribute it to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s anti-crypto stance. Reason Behind Bitcoin Price Crash On December 19, 2024, Mt. Gox was reported to have distributed $100 million worth of Bitcoin. The report indicates that the firm transferred this substantial amount of BTC to three different wallet addresses, each receiving $30.18 million worth of Bitcoin. Mt. Gox Payout The potential reason for the selling pressure created by Mt. Gox is the distribution of billions of dollars worth of BTC to creditors, an event expected to occur in the coming days. However, the exact timeline remains unknown. If this distribution happens, the recent price decline could lower in comparison, and we may witness a substantial drop in Bitcoin’s price. Jerome Powell’s Stance Adds Pressure Another potential reason for the recent price decline is Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s anti-crypto stance during the rate cut announcement. In an interview, Powell made a bold statement that has garnered significant attention from the crypto community. He stated, “We are not allowed to own Bitcoin and have no desire to change the law.” Following this statement, the overall crypto market has been witnessing a price decline. Bitcoin (BTC) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Besides these two speculations, another potential reason behind this notable price decline is the breakdown of a crucial support level. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, BTC has already broken below its ascending support level, which it had maintained since the beginning of November 2024. Source: Trading View Following this breakdown, BTC has experienced a 6.5% price decline but has found support at a horizontal level of $92,500 and is currently beginning to move upward. Based on the recent price action, if BTC fails to hold this level, there is a strong possibility it could drop to $85,500. However, if the support holds, the upward momentum is likely to continue. In the past three days, BTC has crashed by over 14%, with its price dropping from $106,600 to $92,600. This significant decline has resulted in BTC breaching its crucial ascending support level, which had been intact since the beginning of November 2024.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-bitcoin-crashing-how-low-could-the-price-go/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This happened as the macros turned bearish for the Ripple network after a negative FOMC. On the contrary, DTX Exchange emerges as the rising star in the DeFi space, with its presale grabbing huge attention. DTX’s trajectory remains untouched with unwavering support from its community. Ripple's XRP Struggles Near $2.40 Resistance Ripple (XRP) is down by 5% after sustaining nearly $26 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The total amount of liquidated long positions accounted for $12.74 million, and short liquidations reached $13.22 million. XRP continued validating a flag pattern after testing the resistance level near $2.40. The remittance-based token has established the upper boundary of the flag channel as a key support level. The current session witnesses a major slump in Ripple’s price actions. If XRP manages to overcome the resistance level at $2.40 and $2.58 with a high volume move, it could smash its all-time high resistance and rally to $4.75. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic Oscillator are near their overbought regions, indicating prices are getting overheated. The Ripple token- XRP- is currently witnessing a major downtrend, with bears taking hold of the daily price actions. The Ripple coin started the day at $2.51 and then started slumping down, reaching the current trading value of $2.38 with a huge red candle dominating the daily chart. DTX Exchange Brings Massive Utility And Fairness To A Needy Market DTX Exchange is a new trading platform that is set to launch soon. It aims to bring fairness and utility to a deprived market with a fair launch system in place. Namely, most new projects are typically backed by whales and VCs. This allows whales and VCs to get in very early, right before everyone else does. Also, it enables them to destroy the project when they sell for a profit. So, in this case, everyone but regular investors will make money. DTX Exchange is the exact opposite. It has an incremental price system in place. This allows everyone to get an equal opportunity to invest. Also, DTX Exchange isn’t backed by VCs and whales. Furthermore, the incremental system will make sure DTX’s price rises steadily throughout its lifetime. So, no one can nuke the price even if they want to! Such a fair launch hasn’t been seen for a while in the market. So, it’s no wonder why so many investors are excited about this project. But that’s not all. DTX Exchange also brings incredible utility that will be very beneficial to investors. Namely, it allows the trade of many different assets with huge leverage. This will help make massive profits with all trades. Also, DTX Exchange makes asset management much easier than it is now. This is possible through its Phoenix Wallet. It gives a unified view of everything. So, traders can manage everything with a few taps on the screen. What’s more, DTX Exchange brings unprecedented speeds. Namely, the VulcanX blockchain provides you with 100,000 TPS! This is a massive increase from Solana’s 600 TPS! The DTX Presale: A Gateway to Financial Freedom! Investing in a project like DTX early is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And you have it now! That’s because DTX is currently in Stage 6 of its presale. At this stage, you can buy your DTX tokens for $0.12. This price will increase steadily, reaching $0.20 at launch. So far, the DTX presale has raised over $10.42 million! It has attracted more than 300,000 wallets, which shows that the distribution is more than fair. Once DTX launches, experts see it embarking on a massive rally. The rally will be fueled by the altcoin season and DTX’s huge utility. With that in mind, experts see DTX’s price rising by 100x in just a few months! Key Takeaways With a consistent struggle to surpass a key resistance level, Ripple is under bearish control as XRP is slumping on the daily charts.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided insights into why Bitcoin could be holding well within this range. Why The Bitcoin Price Is Holding Steady Between $96,000 And $98,000 In an X post, Ali Martinez noted that one of the most important support levels for the Bitcoin price is between $98,830 and $95,830, where 1.09 wallets bought over 1.16 million BTC. This explains why Bitcoin is holding steady between $96,000 and $98,000 as investors who bought between this level continue to provide huge support for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Dogecoin Trading Volume Rises Over $6.5 Billion As Liquidations Cross $31 Million, What’s Going On? As Martinez suggested, it is important for these holders to continue to hold steady as a wave of sell-offs could send the Bitcoin price tumbling even below $90,000. The flagship crypto dropped below $100,000 following the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell’s recent speech, in which he hinted at a hawkish stance from the US Central Bank. This sparked a massive wave of sell-offs, as a Hawkish Fed paints a bearish picture for risk assets like Bitcoin. However, despite the Bitcoin price drop below, most Bitcoin holders remain in profit, which is a positive for the flagship crypto. IntoTheBlock data shows that 86% of Bitcoin holders are in the money, 4% are out of the money, and 9% are at the money. These Bitcoin holders still seem bullish on the leading crypto as they continue to accumulate more BTC. In an X post, Ali Martinez stated that so far in December, 74,052 BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges, and this trend doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Traders Anticipate A Bullish Reversal Ali Martinez suggested that crypto traders anticipate a bullish reversal for the Bitcoin price from its current level. This came as he revealed that traders on Binance nailed the top, with 62.17% shorting Bitcoin while it was trading at $108,000. Now, Martinez stated that sentiment has flipped, with 55.44% of these trading now longing dips below $96,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash 2 Days Ago, Full Prediction Shows A Further 30% Decline Meanwhile, it is crucial for the Bitcoin price to hold this $96,000, as Martinez warned that if BTC loses this support, it could drop below $90,000. The analyst stated that based on the Fibonacci level, if Bitcoin loses $96,000, the next point of focus becomes $90,000 and $85,000. Meanwhile, from a bullish perspective, crypto analyst Justin Bennett suggested that the $110,000 target is still in focus for the Bitcoin price. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $97,000, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 102,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin is technically in a parabolic uptrend but could decline further based on historic precedence. “We tend to see upside, but not without pullbacks…week six, week seven, week eight tend to be quite problematic for Bitcoin.” He suggests Bitcoin, now in “week seven,” could plummet if it loses the support level of around $97,000 on the weekly timeframe. “We’re actually losing weekly levels. And so if this blue region also gets lost as a support, and then we actually lose this five-week technical uptrend in this orange trend line, if all of these things are lost, then this is going to be mounting and mounting and mounting evidence that we might be transitioning from what is technically still a 10% dip, we might be transitioning into a pullback moment, and in fact, a corrective period.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s decline could be between 29% and 40% before rallying again based on previous cycles. “It’s really important to understand what those corrective periods have looked like in the past, and 34% has been something of a recurring theme in 2016, 34% in week eight. We had 34% when it came to confirming the first price discovery uptrend in the very beginning of that uptrend. We got 40%, 38% 29% in 2016-2017. So we’ve seen pullbacks take place which were quite deep in price discovery in the past.” Source: Rekt Capital/YouTube Bitcoin is trading for $97,158 at time of writing, down 3.4% in the last 24 hours.

37886751,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627023,1734708600,"Solana, Bonk, and Lightchain AI—Which Crypto Will Lead the 2025 Rally?","The cryptocurrency market continues to gain momentum as blockchain technology advances, offering faster transactions, innovative applications, and groundbreaking integrations across industries. In 2025, three cryptocurrencies— Solana (SOL) , Bonk , and **Lightchain AI ($LCAI)**—are emerging as strong contenders for the next big crypto rally. Among these, Lightchain AI is making waves with its cutting-edge blockchain-AI integration and its highly anticipated Lightchain AI Presale . This presale is generating significant buzz as investors look to get in early on a project poised to redefine the space. In this article, we’ll explore the unique strengths of these three cryptocurrencies—Solana’s focus on scalability, Bonk’s community-driven momentum, and Lightchain AI’s revolutionary technology—and their potential to lead the 2025 crypto rally. Solana: High-Performance Blockchain for Scalable Solutions Solana has quickly established itself as a leader among blockchain platforms, recognized for its unparalleled speed and efficiency. Launched in 2020, the platform addresses scalability concerns with its unique blend of Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanisms. Capable of processing up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) at minimal costs, Solana has become a go-to choice for developers working on decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi solutions. Advantages Unmatched Performance : By employing PoH, Solana ensures high-speed transaction processing, making it suitable for projects requiring scalability. Expanding Ecosystem : From NFT marketplaces like Magic Eden to DeFi platforms such as Serum, Solana boasts a growing network of innovative projects. Low-Cost Transactions : With transaction fees averaging under $0.01, Solana provides an affordable option for developers and users alike. Drawbacks System Stability : Frequent network outages have raised questions about the platform’s reliability under heavy usage. Decentralization Concerns : Critics argue that Solana’s validator setup leans toward centralization, which could challenge the core principles of blockchain technology. As Solana moves forward, its success will hinge on addressing network reliability and decentralization issues while capitalizing on its speed and cost advantages. Whether it can maintain its position as a blockchain powerhouse in 2025 remains to be seen. Bonk: The Meme Coin with Community Power Born from the Solana blockchain, Bonk has emerged as a playful yet ambitious contender in the world of meme coins. With its roots in decentralization and a mission to empower communities, Bonk brings a fresh twist to the meme coin phenomenon popularized by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Leveraging Solana’s robust ecosystem, Bonk seeks to increase both its own adoption and the visibility of its blockchain network. Advantages Strong Community Support : Bonk thrives on the energy of its dedicated community, which fuels organic marketing and social buzz. Integration with Solana : Built on Solana, Bonk benefits from fast, low-cost transactions, giving it a technical edge over competitors. Lighthearted Appeal : Bonk’s fun and approachable nature resonates with casual crypto enthusiasts eager for projects with both charm and potential. Limitations Limited Practical Applications : Like many meme coins, Bonk faces challenges in establishing use cases beyond speculation. High Market Fluctuations : As a meme-based cryptocurrency, Bonk’s price is highly unpredictable, posing significant risks for long-term investors. Looking ahead to 2025, Bonk’s ability to evolve from a meme coin into a project with clear utility will determine its long-term impact and sustainability. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): The Blockchain-AI Convergence While Solana and Bonk focus on scalability and community, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) is redefining blockchain technology by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into its core. With its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain AI enables decentralized, AI-driven applications that address real-world challenges in sectors like healthcare, logistics, and finance. Strengths Revolutionary Technology : The PoI consensus mechanism not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis. AI-Powered Ecosystem : The AIVM enables seamless execution of AI tasks, making Lightchain AI a versatile platform for applications like predictive analytics and fraud detection. Sustainability : By focusing on efficient resource utilization, Lightchain AI reduces the environmental impact of blockchain technology. Real-World Use Cases : Lightchain AI’s applications extend beyond the blockchain space, offering solutions for industries such as healthcare (AI diagnostics) and supply chain management (predictive analytics). Challenges Emerging Player : As a relatively new blockchain, Lightchain AI must prove its scalability and adoption in a competitive market. Educational Curve : The integration of AI into blockchain requires educating developers and users about its capabilities and benefits. With its unique focus on AI integration, Lightchain AI is positioned as a game-changer in the blockchain space, offering innovation that extends far beyond traditional use cases. Head-to-Head Comparison Feature Solana Bonk Lightchain AI ($LCAI) Core Focus High-speed transactions Community-driven meme coin AI-driven decentralized solutions Consensus Mechanism Proof of History + Proof of Stake N/A Proof of Intelligence Transaction Speed Up to 65,000 TPS Depends on Solana Optimized for AI workloads Utility dApps, DeFi, NFTs Speculative and community-focused Real-world AI applications Sustainability Moderate Low High Which Crypto Will Lead the 2025 Rally? Solana’s Edge Solana’s high-speed capabilities and robust ecosystem make it a strong contender for leading the next rally. Its focus on scalability aligns with the growing demand for efficient blockchain applications, particularly in DeFi and NFTs. However, its network reliability issues could deter institutional adoption unless resolved. Bonk’s Appeal Bonk’s vibrant community and meme appeal make it a fun choice for investors looking for speculative gains. However, without meaningful utility, its long-term prospects are uncertain. Bonk may thrive during periods of market exuberance but lacks the substance to dominate in a utility-driven rally. Lightchain AI’s Promise Lightchain AI stands out as a technological powerhouse with real-world applications. By combining blockchain and AI, $LCAI addresses scalability, efficiency, and transparency in ways that Solana and Bonk cannot match. Its focus on sustainability and meaningful innovation positions it as a leader for a more mature and utility-driven market. How Lightchain Is Going To Moon? The value of Lightchain AI is in its convergence of two disruptive technologies: blockchain and artificial intelligence. As the demand for efficient, transparent, and secure solutions grows in various industries, Lightchain AI’s applications will become increasingly relevant and valuable. Furthermore, by addressing concerns around energy consumption and scalability, $LCAI has a strong potential to appeal to institutional investors seeking sustainable options. If Lightchain AI can continue to deliver on its roadmap and expand its use cases through partnerships and collaborations, it could potentially see significant growth in the coming years. However, as with all emerging technologies, there are risks involved with investing in $LCAI, such as market volatility and competition from other projects.

37888062,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321469,1734708559,Shiba Inu Price Crashes as $6M Whale Sell-Off Sparks Chaos – Buy the Dip or More Selling to Come?,"The Shiba Inu price has plummeted by 20% today, with the meme token dropping to $0.00001927 as the cryptocurrency market suffers a 12% fall in 24 hours . These losses round off a bad couple of weeks for SHIB, which is now down by 27% in seven days and by 34% in 14, although it remains up by 100% in a year. Yet today’s drop comes after one whale in particular sold 250 billion SHIB, worth around $6 million at the time of sale. This paints a negative picture for the meme coin, yet its longer term price predictions look more promising. Shiba Inu Price Crashes as $6M Whale Sell-Off Sparks Chaos – Buy the Dip or More Selling to Come? Transaction tracker Lookonchain alerted its followers to the aforementioned sale yesterday, pointing out that the whale in question bought a massive haul of 15.28 trillion SHIB for only $3,800 back in August 2020. A whale sold 250B $SHIB ($6.05M) for profit in the past hour! The whale spent $3.8K to buy 15.28T $SHIB ($1.22B at the peak) as early as August 6, 2020. This whale currently holds 2.15T $SHIB ($52.18M), with a total profit of $109M on $SHIB . https://t.co/BWxcnWuwFR pic.twitter.com/aQZFPyhYSv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 19, 2024 That the whale still holds a substantial sum of SHIB invites the suspicion that the coin may other sudden dips during the current bull cycle, as large holders take the opportunity to draw a regular profit. And looking at other tracking accounts, such as Whale Alert and Spot On Chain , it seems that no whales have stepped in recently to buy SHIB at a discount. The meme token has been falling consistently since reaching a nearly one-year high of $0.00003294 on December 7, having declined by roughly 38% since this peak. Despite its recent falls, some analysts are predicting that the Shiba Inu price could rise as high as $0.0001 next year , albeit with a caveat that it will suffer volatility along the way. $SHIB : 2025 Price Outlook This chart shows Shiba Inu's price could peak near $0.0000998 in 2025, while the potential low is at $0.0000234. The path to these targets may see volatility, but it reflects broader crypto market trends. Patience could pay off for #SHIB . pic.twitter.com/5XMd1JNr61 — InvestingHaven (@InvestingHaven) December 18, 2024 Its chart today shows that the token has bottomed out, with its indicators all pointing towards incoming rebounds. For instance, not only has Shiba Inu’s relative strength index (purple) fallen below 30 again in the past hour or so, but it has been under 50 for much of the past week. We see something very similar with its 30-period moving average (orange), which has now reached a new low in relation to the 200-period average (blue). Source: TradingView In other words, all available signs suggest that the Shiba Inu price could jump up very soon, perhaps over the weekend. Given that it has bottomed out, it could return to $0.000025 by Xmas, before ending the year at $0.000030. New Altcoins Bring Strong Potential for Profits Because SHIB has struggled in recent weeks, many traders may prefer to turn to alternatives right now, including lower cap tokens that can often outperform the market. Presale tokens in particular have done very well this year, with the likes of Pepe Unchained and Shiba Shootout rallying hard when they listed for the first time. There are a number of ongoing presales which look very promising at the moment, with possibly the most notable belonging to Solaxy (SOLX) . It launched its sale only last week, yet the Solana-based token has already gone on to raise more than $3.4 million. FIRST L2 on SOLANA ? sign me up already $SOLX ( @SOLAXYTOKEN ) ~ Multi-chain potential (cross chain transactions possible in future) ~ fast transaction with little or no congestion on sol ~ presale is currently live ~ high staking rewards ~ Presale price increases with… pic.twitter.com/1GeGW84LRs — JUSTICΞ (@offshoda) December 19, 2024 Billing itself as Solana’s first ever layer-two network, Solaxy will provide a number of efficiency improvements over its base layer. It will help Solana users and traders avoid failed transactions, outages and congestion, which have been a big problem for the layer-one blockchain in recent years . Its native token, SOLX, will serve to pay for transactions fees, meaning that if Solaxy becomes a popular L2, demand for the token will surge. SOLX will have a capped supply of 138.046 billion tokens, with 25% of this going towards its presale and community rewards. SOLX is currently selling at $0.001572, via its official website . Its price will rise every few days until the its sale ends in the next couple of months, so interested buyers should really act now if they want the best chance of turning a fast buck.

37886546,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375570,1734708415,Bitcoin’s Wild Ride: From $108K to $92K (Market Update),"It’s not always roses and rainbows in the cryptocurrency market and even though it may have felt like it for the past few weeks, the last seven days made sure to remind us of it. The total capitalization dropped by more than $300 billion as Bitcoin’s price went on a complete rollercoaster, similar to that of the majority of altcoins. The first few days of the week started as we are more or less used to by know – up only. Bitcoin’s price tapped a new all-time high above $108,000 and the market was anticipating the results of the meeting of the US Federal Result. Quite frankly, everyone was expecting for the institution to once again cut the interest rates, which is generally perceived as a positive move as far as risk-on assets go. Oh, if it were true this time around. During the meeting, the Chairman Jerome Powell said that they might consider a slowdown of rate cuts, given that the inflation in the country is rising. This propelled a market-wide sell-off across the crypto industry but also across tradfi as the majority of indices also dropped considerably. More interestingly, Powell addressed the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset for the country, saying that the Federal Reserve is legally prohibited from holding it. This might put a dent into Trump’s plans and it appears that investors didn’t like it as the cryptocurrency is now trading below $100K, having plummetted to around $92,000 earlier today. The sell-off also triggered over $1.3 billion worth of liquidated positions across the cryptocurrency market on Friday alone. The majority of altcoins are trading in the red, with Ethereum down almost 15%, XRP – 10%, BNB – 8%, Solana -15%, DOGE – 25%, and so forth. As it’s almost always the case, a lot of people in the community are already speculating whether or not the bull run is over, but during times like these it’s really important to zoom out and keep a steady eye on the bigger picture. In any case, if one thing is sure, it’s that the next few weeks are likely to be quite interesting, so let’s see how it goes! Market Data Source: Quantify Crypto Market Cap: $3.45T | 24H Vol: $482B | BTC Dominance: 55.3% BTC: $96,552 (-4.5%) | ETH: $3,370 ( -15% ) | XRP: $2.21 (-10%) This Week’s Headlines You Can’t Miss MicroStrategy Announces First Bitcoin Purchase With BTC Prices Above $100K . It wouldn’t be a Monday these days if the Michael Saylor-founded business intelligence giant didn’t announce a massive BTC purchase. In this week’s example , the company allocated $1.5 billion to accumulate 15,350 BTC at an average price of just over $100,000. XRP Price on the Move as Ripple Announces Stablecoin Launch on Dec 17 . Although it continues with its legal tussle against the US securities watchdog, Ripple entered the stablecoin industry this week by finally launching its own product called RLUSD. The token release was on December 17, and it positively impacted XRP’s price at the time. This Cohort of Ethereum Whales Accumulates Record 57.35% of Supply . Ethereum whales have been on an accumulation spree lately, according to on-chain data. The number of large wallets holding at least 100,000 ETH has jumped to an all-time high of over 57% of the entire supply. BlackRock’s IBIT Nearly Doubles Gold ETF’s 20-Year AUM Milestone in Less Than 12 Months . The world’s largest Bitcoin ETF continues to shatter records. Its AUM has skyrocketed in the past 11 months to almost $60 billion as of December 19, which dwarfed the performance of the company’s biggest gold-based ETF. Bitcoin Price Tumbles Toward $100K Despite Fed’s Latest Rate Cut . The entire financial field expected another rate cut at the end of 2024, and that’s what they got . However, the hawkish words by Jerome Powell about potentially stopping the rate reductions in 2025 sent the ever-volatile and risky crypto market down hard. At first, BTC tumbled toward $100,000 but quickly lost that level and dumped all the way south to $92,100, leading to speculations about whether this bull market has ended. Fed Effect: Biggest Net Outflow Day for Bitcoin ETFs Led to Crash Below $96K . Powell’s aforementioned comments seemingly scared US investors out of their BTC positions, which is particularly true for the spot Bitcoin ETFs. The financial vehicles recorded their worst day in terms of daily net outflows on the day after the FOMC meeting (December 19), with nearly $700 million being withdrawn .

For context, the previous record from December 2020 was $4.8 trillion. So what happens when this much money is on the table? Volatility and chaos that could destabilize crypto markets some more. Source : The Kobeissi Letter The Nasdaq is already down over 6% in just five days. The Volatility Index, or $VIX, has doubled this week. Investors are bracing for impact as the US stock market hits what’s called a “triple witching day.” That’s when stock options, stock index futures, and other derivatives all expire at once. Historically, these days don’t end well for stocks. And negative returns have been the norm over the last decade. Stocks are trembling under pressure The Dow barely managed a 0.04% gain yesterday, but the S&P 500 slipped 0.09%, and the Nasdaq took a bigger hit, down 0.47%. Tech stocks are dragging the market lower. And the Federal Reserve’s hawkish cut and sky-high inflation aren’t helping anyone sleep better. Let’s talk numbers. Total market capitalization for US stocks has hit $59 trillion, double the size of the country’s GDP. According to SpotGamma, calls have been crushing puts leading up to today. Earlier this week, the call-to-put ratio was 10 to 1. Even with the market taking a beating in the last few days, calls still dominate. That imbalance? It’s like lighter fluid on a bonfire. Crypto braces for the fallout Meanwhile, Bitcoin is already having a tough time. It has crashed to around $95,000 from an all-time high of $108,000 in just two days. Ethereum? Down 7.5%. Solana? A nasty 6.4% drop. Here’s the deal: heightened volatility in stocks often leads to turbulence in crypto. Why? Because investors treat crypto as a risk asset. If stock traders panic-sell, some of that fear flows into Bitcoin and altcoins. Liquidity dries up, and prices swing wildly. And as we’ve seen this year, the correlation between these markets has grown even higher. Between December 2023 and January 2024, Bitcoin consolidated between $39,000 and $46,000 before exploding to $66,000 in March. Right now, it’s moving between $88,000 and $102,000. Analysts are watching the $88,000–$90,000 zone closely. If Bitcoin dips below that range, a steeper correction could be on the cards. And let’s not ignore the bearish signals. On weekly charts, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) is showing lower highs while the price shows higher highs. That’s classic bearish divergence, and it’s the same setup we saw in 2021 before Bitcoin crashed from $69,000 to $15,000. If history repeats itself, crypto traders could be in for a rough ride. Long-term support levels aren’t looking too hot either. Analysts are eyeing the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) around $66,600 as the next major line in the sand. If that doesn’t hold, Bitcoin could slide to $57,000—the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level.

Experts Predict DTX Exchange (DTX) Will Dominate The Market as ETH and SHIB Dip,"The crypto market has experienced a wipeout with a lot of tokens experiencing big dips with Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) at the forefront. While the market is bleeding, a new presale star, DTX Exchange (DTX) has been shining with an over 500% price surge. Experts think it could be the next big gem with 5x growth potential in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Price Soars 500%, More Gains Incoming While Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing some green price charts, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself. With over $10M raised and 300K users already, it is clear that people have faith in the long-term vision of DTX Exchange. Speaking of which, this project aims to revolutionize online trading. To accomplish this, it will launch a hybrid trading platform. On it, people will get access to over 120K asset classes, such as gold, CFDs, cryptocurrencies, etc. Privacy, thanks to no sign-up KYC checks, could make DTX Exchange a fan-favorite for millions of traders. This platform is scheduled to launch in Q1 of 2025. Currently, its native token DTX costs only $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price. But this altcoin price will rise to $0.20 after a Tier-1 CEX lists it. Therefore, those looking to capitalize on this growth and get governance voting rights are now rushing to buy DTX. Crypto Tony: The Price of Ethereum (ETH) May Soar Past $5,000 Ethereum (ETH) is among the top 5 cryptocurrencies riding a bullish wave right now. Although the weekly chart shows a slight dip of around 5%, CoinMarketCap shows that its value soared nearly 20% in the past 30 days. Market analyst Crypto Tony remains bullish on Ethereum (ETH). According to his X post, the Ethereum price may soar past $5,000, although it is experiencing a slight dip right now. This prediction has excited many traders. However, it is worth mentioning that the Ethereum market cap is $444B, which means a large influx of money is needed for its price to skyrocket. Crypto currencies like DTX will not face this issue. Analyst Remains Optimistic for the Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Movement Shiba Inu (SHIB) is among the best meme coins right now. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Shiba Inu has jumped from around $0.000010 and over $0.000025 in the past year alone. This is nearly a 150% jump in just the past 12 months. Market expert InvestingHaven thinks this bullish trend will continue. In an X post, he told his followers that the 2025 price target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is $0.0000998. The technicals support this Shiba Inu price prediction, as it is trading above its 100-day EMA ($0.000022). Nevertheless, traders are turning to DTX Exchange as it will have more utility than the Shiba Inu coin. As it is a meme coin, its value and demand depend on social media hype and not anything else. However, DTX will have real-world utility - potentially making its adoption grow. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Take Off As Ethereum (ETH) & Shiba Inu (SHIB) Did? Experts agree that DTX Exchange (DTX) could see the same success as Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). DTX Exchange is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growth of the $18T gold market. This could give it great stability in volatile times and long-term growth potential. Thus, many experts predict a 5x surge potentially coming for this altcoin in 2025.

37886537,https://crypto.news/?p=14321035,1734708287,Hedera Hashgraph price rare patterns point to an HBAR rebound,"Hedera Hashgraph price has retreated sharply in recent days as the outlook for the crypto industry has worsened. Hedera Hashgraph ( HBAR ) fell to a low of $0.2483, a drop that mirrored other popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Most cryptocurrencies have dropped, bringing the total market capitalization of all coins to $3.24 trillion. Hedera’s retreat coincides with a decline in the total value of assets locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem. According to DeFi Llama , the TVL has dropped to 675 million HBAR, down from the year-to-date high of 1.35 billion tokens. In U.S. dollar terms, the TVL has fallen from $209 million on Dec. 3 to $165 million. This decline suggests that investors are pulling out funds from Hedera’s DeFi platforms like SaucerSwap, Bonzo Finance, and HbarSuite. You might also like: What is Hedera Hashgraph? HBAR crypto explained To be fair, Hedera is not the only blockchain network experiencing a decline in DeFi assets. Other popular chains like Cardano , Ethereum, and Solana have also seen capital flight in recent days. Historically, investors tend to exit these platforms during periods of broader cryptocurrency market weakness. Despite the current downturn, Hedera Hashgraph has some positive fundamentals that could drive its price higher in the long term. The network boasts partnerships with major global companies like IBM and Google, both of which are members of its governance council. Hedera is also positioning itself as a key player in the Real World Asset Real World Asset tokenization industry . Tokenization refers to converting illiquid assets into liquid ones that can be easily moved and traded. Hedera’s fast transaction speeds and low costs make it an attractive option for developers in this space. Another potential catalyst for HBAR is the possibility of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a spot HBAR ETF in 2025. According to a senior Bloomberg analyst, the SEC may approve the ETF since it does not classify HBAR as a security. You might also like: Valour introduces Hedera ETP on Euronext Amsterdam Hedera Hashgraph price forms a bullish pattern HBAR price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the HBAR price is forming a bullish chart pattern. Specifically, it is developing a falling wedge pattern, which typically forms as an asset consolidates between two falling trendlines. A bullish breakout often occurs when the two lines converge. Additionally, Hedera is forming a bullish pennant pattern, characterized by a long upward trendline followed by consolidation. This pattern also often leads to a strong bullish breakout over time. HBAR remains above the 50-day moving average and the major support and resistance pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines at $0.1953. Therefore, a contrarian case can be made for Hedera’s price. If the bullish patterns hold, HBAR could rebound and retest the year-to-date high of $0.3940, representing a potential gain of about 66% from the current level. However, the bullish outlook would be invalidated if the coin drops below the major S&R level at $0.20.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | HBAR,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | HBAR,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/hedera-hashgraph-price-rare-patterns-point-to-an-hbar-rebound/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37886537.jpeg

37888282,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=106011,1734708069,Bitcoin Hits $92K Amid Sell-Off: Could a 30% Crash Be in the Cards?,"Today, Bitcoin has plunged from $102,748 to $92,175, marking a 10.3% drop in the last 24 hours. This development has sparked discussions in the community, with analysts drawing parallels to previous market cycles. Historical trends indicate that Bitcoin often undergoes significant pullbacks a few weeks into its price discovery phase. This has raised concerns that the current downturn may only be the beginning.Historical Insights into Bitcoin CorrectionsCrypto analyst Rekt Capital pointed out Bitcoin's consistent pattern of corrections after rallying into price discovery phases. He cited that in 2013, Bitcoin experienced six weeks of upward momentum before facing its first major correction in the seventh week.Similarly, during the 2017 bull cycle, a 34% retracement occurred in Week 8 after seven weeks of consistent gains. Likewise, in the 2020/2021 cycle, Bitcoin rallied for six weeks into price discovery before a meaningful 16% pullback.Highlighting these patterns, Rekt Capital noted, ""It's Week 7 right now."" This implies that the ongoing correction is consistent with historical trends and that a major pullback could be in the works.Is there a 20-30% Correction on the Horizon for BTC?Adding to the discussion, popular crypto futures trader Satoshi Flipper emphasized the importance of studying historical patterns. He warned that a powerful correction during Bitcoin's price discovery phase is realistic.Notably, Bitcoin entered the price discovery phase in the second week of November after Donald Trump won the presidential election. Since then, the asset has seen consecutive days and weeks of new price peaks, with only a few instances of 3% corrections.Meanwhile, Satoshi Flipper reminded market participants that a 20% to 30% crash for BTC is realistically on the table. Specifically, he highlighted that a 20% drop from Bitcoin's recent high of $108,000 would result in a bottom at $87,000. Meanwhile, a 30% retracement could see Bitcoin falling as low as $76,000.Already, Bitcoin has crashed by approximately 15% from its all-time high to $92K and has since rebounded to $95K at press time, though the danger still remains.Can Bitcoin Defy Historical Trends?A recent analysis by Glassnode shows that Bitcoin is now seeing lower average returns and reduced volatility in the current cycle compared to previous ones.For instance, while Bitcoin saw 10.47X growth in the 2018-2022 cycle, the current season has only seen 598% growth. Likewise, this cycle has been the least volatile, with average drawdowns of -7.68% and a maximum of -26.25%. Previous cycles have had minimum drawdowns of 26% and maximum crashes of 72%.According to the report, this stability indicates Bitcoin's transformation into a more mature, institutionalized asset, making the likelihood of a crash similar to the last cycle less likely.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/20/bitcoin-hits-92k-amid-sell-off-could-a-30-crash-be-in-the-cards/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-hits-92k-amid-sell-off-could-a-30-crash-be-in-the-cards,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
42415902,af993959-69c4-4958-9ed4-8b202801ac12,1734708003,How a Journalist Went From Exposing Mexican Cartels to Losing His Crypto Life Savings,"On a balmy evening in 2023 on the east coast of Spain, Olivier Acuña sat at his computer to transfer his life savings to another cryptocurrency wallet, as he had done hundreds of times before.  “Sending crypto always induces anxiety,” Acuña told CoinDesk. This rang painfully true that night.  As soon as Acuña hit send, it was over: $400,000 worth of crypto — all his money — was gone, pilfered by an anonymous phishing scammer. A piercing noise rang in Acuña’s ears, his temperature rose and his fists clenched.  Acuña’s loss demonstrates that no one is immune to crypto hacks. He's a seven-year crypto industry veteran, someone who grasps the need for wariness given the dangers that lurk around blockchains. Before that, he was a journalist for decades, where staying alert was a must as he faced violent drug cartels in Mexico and torture in prison.  And yet he became one of the many victims of crypto scams. In 2023, U.S. officials received 69,000 reports of crypto theft totaling more than $5.6 billion.  Getting that money back can be hard. If your normal bank account gets breached, insurance will almost certainly cover your losses. But there's no highly regulated system like that in crypto, which is famously and quite intentionally decentralized. While that disintermediation gives crypto users the freedom from institutions that they crave, it's also a double-edged sword. The omission of gatekeepers can also leave people a single button click away from ruin.  The hack itself was nothing special. Because Acuña couldn’t access his funds on a Ledger hardware device, he reached out to customer support via social media. An impersonator swooped in and, following 30 minutes of deception, Acuña was stuck in the scammer’s web.  “Phishing scams remain incredibly prolific today,” Adrian Hetman, head of triaging at Web3 security researcher Immunefi, told CoinDesk. “Phishing attempts are a growing concern in crypto, as criminals see it as an effective way to steal user funds at scale and apply social engineering for more sophisticated attacks on project infrastructure.”  Acuña was helpless again, this time at the mercy of a blockchain that was once his salvation following a horrendous ordeal of false imprisonment in Mexico.  Working undercover   Acuña began working as a journalist in the 1990s — a career that confronted him with government censorship, false imprisonment and death threats.  His work on organized crime, elections and corruption soon got him noticed by United Press International (UPI) and Reforma, where he began diving deeper into one of the most notorious and violent drug cartels in the world.  He was based in Sinaloa, a state in Mexico that runs down the west coast from Los Mochis to Mazatlán. The fertile, mountainous territory emerged as a hotbed of organized crime, leading to the formation of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán's infamous Sinaloa Cartel.  Acuña’s coverage of the cartel eventually led to him working independently as a freelance journalist with his work being picked up by the likes of Associated Press and Reuters. This was when his career in Mexico reached a turbulent crescendo.  Authorities caught wind of one of Acuña’s stories on corruption and decided enough was enough. They accused him of hiding a weapon that belonged to the Attorney General’s office. Acuña says he was tortured for 16 hours.  “One day, I was thrown into a vehicle in the most violent manner you can imagine,"" he said. ""They sent a police commander widely known for torturing people, and they abducted me. For 16 hours they waterboarded me, tied me up, cut off my circulation, folded me backwards. At one point, they told me, ‘Next door we have your family. We will bring them in here one by one and kill them in front of you until you tell us where the gun is.’”  Acuña was subsequently jailed for two years on accusations — which Acuña says were false — that were later dropped. He filed a human rights lawsuit against Mexican authorities.  Crypto salvation, or not  In 2017, Acuña wiped the slate clean of his tortuous past, entering the wonderfully weird world of crypto, enjoying stints as a public relations officer at payments firm Electroneum, a television producer at BloxLive and most recently another public relations role at DePIN company IOTEX.  His tough background prepared him for the crypto industry, which despite growing acceptance by the traditional finance sector, continues to grapple with the Wild West environment of its early days.  While Acuña might not have the most common backstory for those working in crypto, it remains a pertinent reminder that the allure of the crypto industry is not just speculative financial gain: It’s also an industry that checks the power of governments, banks and elites, which appealed to Acuña.  “The first day that I began writing about crypto and blockchain, I said, 'Here it is, the solution to all of the issues of the lack of freedom of expression. Here it is, the solution to government corruption. Here it is, finally something that I can have faith in and have and do passionately,'” Acuña told CoinDesk.  Despite losing his life savings, Acuña continues to work in the crypto industry — although he warns that it’s a long way away from going mainstream.  “If we ever want mass adoption, this needs to be seamless,” he said. At the moment, the user experience is “anxiety-inducing. Every time I send crypto now, I think, ‘Have I done it wrong? Am I going to lose my money?' Each and every time.’”  Unless “we get an application where all your crypto is in that same app, and it doesn't matter what freaking network it is, you can convert it into whatever you want, to convert it and send it, then I just don't see it” taking off.  This remains a key hurdle for the industry; tech-savvy millennials know how to buy an asset on Ethereum, bridge it to Solana and buy a memecoin on Pump.fun before sending that to an exchange, but the majority of regular people don’t.  “I don’t want to exit crypto, I’m still excited about crypto,"" Acuña said. ""Will moving money around always be traumatic? Yes. But I love this sector.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SOL,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/20/how-a-journalist-went-from-exposing-mexican-cartels-to-losing-his-crypto-life-savings,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/963fd514c60e451fea45920ff1c93285c37b45b9-1280x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37886367,https://square.htx.com/?p=42082,1734707945,$HTX: The Rising Star of Leading Exchange Tokens in 2025,"The year 2024 has already cemented itself as a pivotal chapter in the history of cryptocurrency. Key milestones—such as the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s vocal support for the crypto industry—are reshaping the market landscape. Amid this progress, crypto exchanges, as a fundamental pillar of digital asset infrastructure, have seen unparalleled growth. Leveraging over a decade of experience, $HTX, the ecosystem token of HTX and decentralized autonomous organization HTX DAO , is now experiencing the explosive growth stage, outpacing market expectations and emerging as a leading exchange token. $HTX is poised to become 2025’s brightest crypto star with increasing investor interest, supported by HTX’s robust brand, innovative ecosystem strategies, and deflationary tokenomics. $HTX Drives the New Exchange Token Narrative Exchange ecosystem tokens have returned to the spotlight. On December 4, a new $HTX buyback and burn initiative launched on HTX, coupled with a string of innovative product upgrades, including dynamic interest rates for Crypto Loans. The market reaction was swift and decisive: $HTX surged 25% on the day, drawing widespread attention. At present, $HTX boasts a circulating market cap of $902 million, with its price reaching a peak of $0.000003596—a staggering 400% increase year-to-date. This performance not only outpaced competitors but also exceeded gains seen in BTC and ETH. Despite its strong performance, $HTX’s current valuation remains significantly lower than that of leading exchange tokens like BNB (market cap over $100 billion), indicating substantial upside potential. $HTX holders are positioned to benefit from HTX’s expanding ecosystem and the token’s long-term appreciation. HTX’s consistent product innovation is key to $HTX’s extraordinary performance this year. Through the evolving products, the token grants users a suite of privileges, including trading fee discounts, access to Launchpool projects, accelerated Prime memberships, and discounted subscriptions for top cryptocurrencies. These benefits have fostered strong user engagement, solidifying $HTX’s continued success. HTX’s innovation isn’t limited to its products; its aggressive asset listing strategy also played a key role, adding 201 new assets. Riding Bitcoin’s rebound in Q1, HTX’s assets team seized opportunities in the meme coin and RWA sectors. Key initial listings included Solana-based WIF and BOME, which surged 121x and 56x, respectively. In RWAs, HTX listed ONDO, driving a 45x gain for users. These listings revitalized the platform, activating over 3,000 dormant users and attracting over a thousand of new registrations. In Q2, HTX focused on leading cryptocurrencies in high-growth sectors, including ENA (DeFi), IO (DePIN), and ZK (Layer 2). A surge in on-chain activity fueled a market boom in Q3, and HTX is at the forefront of the buzz. It is the first exchange to support the promising SUNPUMP ecosystem and community-driven meme coin project nerio. This led to significant gains for HTX users, with SUNPUMP tokens like SUNDOG surging 37x post-listing, and other tokens like SUNCAT and SUNWUKONG also performed strongly. HTX also capitalized on the popularity of community-driven meme coins like NEIROCTO, which saw a remarkable 137x surge. Capitalizing on Bitcoin and Ethereum’s strength in Q4, HTX prioritized community and high-potential tokens to benefit its users. Listings such as GOAT, BAN, and ACT on Solana outpaced Binance, earning HTX strong community praise. HTX’s strategic efforts have delivered exceptional growth across user metrics. HTX’s daily new registrations have increased 7x year-to-date. The platform now ranks 4th globally in web traffic, and its app has topped finance charts in Google Play and Apple’s App Store across over 60 countries. Average trading volume (per user) has surged 10x since January. Thanks to these achievements, HTX has staged a successful comeback this year. HTX’s Decade-Plus Buildup Sets the Stage for Token Growth As one of the earliest global cryptocurrency exchanges, HTX has built a global business network and user base, leveraging over a decade of operational experience. Expanding from Asia to Europe, HTX has not only pursued market expansion but also cultivated strong user loyalty through localized services. Its brand has become an industry benchmark. $HTX’s Deflationary Tokenomics Anchors Long-Term Appreciation A key strength of $HTX’s is its deflationary tokenomics. HTX allocates a portion of platform revenue to buy back and burn $HTX, reducing the circulating supply and increasing scarcity. By the end of 2024, cumulative burn value is expected to exceed $100 million, reinforcing investor confidence in $HTX’s long-term trajectory. Beyond its role as HTX’s core token, $HTX is the cornerstone of the HTX DAO ecosystem, offering various utilities such as trading fee discounts, governance voting, and access to wealth management products. HTX’s global partnerships have expanded the use cases for $HTX, creating a robust ecosystem that drives sustained value growth. This multi-faceted empowerment has fueled sustained value growth for $HTX. Strategic initiatives, such as the “One Crypto, Dual Rewards” feature—allowing users to stake $HTX while participating in Launchpool—further enhance asset efficiency. Additionally, HTX adopts dynamic interest rates and the flexible term for Crypto Loans products, enhancing users’ asset liquidity while optimizing returns. 2025: A Golden Opportunity for $HTX Amid the Market Cycle The cyclical nature of the crypto market creates a favorable macro backdrop for platform tokens. As the 2024 Bitcoin halving event ushered in a new bull cycle, HTX, as a prominent exchange has attracted increased attention, leading to a rise in the price of $HTX. 1. User Growth Acceleration HTX continues to expand its global user base through strategic partnerships and community engagement. The decentralized governance model of HTX DAO further empowers users, driving strong demand for $HTX. 2. Optimized Tokenomics HTX plans to further enhance $HTX’s tokenomics by introducing additional incentives and applications, unlocking greater long-term value. 3. Huge Valuation Potential Despite its strong performance, $HTX remains undervalued. As market recognition of its value increases, the potential for future growth in $HTX is significant. The Road Ahead for $HTX to Shine HTX’s legacy of industry leadership provides a solid platform for $HTX’s continued success. Backed by a deflationary model, multi-utility ecosystem, and global market traction, $HTX is well-positioned to lead the exchange token market in 2025.

37886533,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52702,1734707790,ChatGPT Sets XRP Price If SBI Allocates 20% of Assets to XRP Reserves,"The XRP community is abuzz with excitement following a proposal urging SBI Holdings to implement a significant XRP buyback initiative. This proposal, introduced by GAM Investments, suggests allocating a portion of SBI’s assets to establish an XRP reserve. According to a projection by AI chatbot ChatGPT, such a move could push XRP’s price to double digits, reaching as high as $15 in the most optimistic scenario. GAM Investments’ Proposal Recently, GAM Investments, a stakeholder in SBI Holdings, highlighted concerns regarding the undervaluation of SBI’s Ripple-related assets. As previously reported by Times Tabloid, GAM pointed out that SBI has not effectively utilized its investment in Ripple or XRP to deliver maximum value to shareholders. GAM attributed this to SBI’s unclear crypto strategy and inadequate communication with investors. According to GAM, SBI’s 8–9% ownership stake in Ripple and its indirect control over a significant portion of XRP through Ripple, represents a largely untapped opportunity. GAM noted that this stake alone could exceed SBI’s current market capitalization. To unlock this potential, GAM proposed that SBI establish an XRP reserve. According to GAM, this approach could deliver better value to shareholders than conventional methods such as cash dividends. ChatGPT’s XRP Price Projections To gauge the potential impact of such a reserve on XRP’s price, ChatGPT was asked to analyze various scenarios. The chatbot assessed the possible outcomes if SBI allocated 5%, 10%, or 20% of its assets to XRP reserves. As of March 2024, SBI’s total assets were valued at approximately ¥27.2 trillion, equivalent to $175.1 billion. Based on XRP’s circulating supply of about 57.45 billion tokens and an average price of $2.35 per token, ChatGPT calculated the potential market effects under different allocation percentages. If SBI allocates 5% of its assets—approximately $8.75 billion—to XRP, it could acquire around 3.72 billion tokens, representing about 6.5% of the circulating supply. ChatGPT projected that such a large-scale purchase could double XRP’s price, driving it to the $4.50–$5.00 range, depending on market liquidity. A 10% allocation, involving $17.5 billion, would enable SBI to buy approximately 7.45 billion XRP tokens or 13% of the circulating supply. ChatGPT suggested this could push XRP prices to $7.00–$8.00. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In the most aggressive scenario, where 20% of SBI’s assets are allocated to XRP, approximately $35 billion would be injected into the market. This could secure 14.89 billion tokens, equivalent to 26% of the circulating supply. ChatGPT projected that such a massive reduction in available XRP could drive its price to $10.00–$15.00, depending on market conditions and liquidity constraints. Prospects for Implementation While GAM’s proposal is compelling, whether SBI will act on it remains uncertain. The ultimate decision depends on factors such as GAM’s influence over other stakeholders and its ability to convince SBI’s leadership to adopt the strategy. XRP community member WrathofKahneman highlighted the importance of GAM’s stake in SBI and its potential to sway other investors. However, even if SBI chooses to implement the plan, there is no guarantee that the price projections outlined by ChatGPT will materialize. Variables such as overall market conditions, liquidity, and seller resistance would play critical roles in determining the outcome.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-memecoin-will-explode-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

XRP participated in the broader market capsize today as hawkish news from the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell continues to drive caution among investors. The fourth-largest cryptocurrency is down by almost double digits in the past 24 hours, nearing sub-$2.Amidst the growing skepticism, market expert Egrag Crypto has reassured the XRP community. In a Friday tweet , the seasoned analyst insisted that XRP remains on course from a technical standpoint, describing the saga as “simply noise.”XRP Market UpdatePer the commentary, XRP is simply retesting the December 10 low. For context, on that date, the digital asset dropped below $2 for the first time in ten days but rebounded strongly to close at $2.3709. The analyst stressed that even a drop below $1.9 is not a cause for concern.Meanwhile, Egrag suggested that the retest could spark bullish momentum for XRP if the price recovers from the region. He stated that XRP could form a bullish double bottom on the higher timeframes, sparking a bounce to new highs.Furthermore, Egrag asserted that XRP may be entering a macro range, where the price would fluctuate between $2.00 and $2.90. The analyst noted that the XRPL native token followed a similar course before now, previously ranging between $0.5 and $1.00 for months before the recent breakout.

The past two days have been rough for crypto investors. Spurred by hawkishness from the Federal Reserve , the market has turned into a sea of red.While some have suggested that the bleeding will likely stop soon, veteran commodities trader Peter Brandt has unveiled a scenario where this hemorrhage could just be starting.Look out BelowOver the past two days, Bitcoin 's price has dropped nearly 15% from record highs around $108,000 to lows near $92,000 amid slower quantitative easing expectations. While market participants are hoping for a near bounce, veteran trader Peter Brandt has outlined one scenario where Bitcoin's price could continue to fall to near the $70,000 price point. The price action trader shared this analysis on Friday, December 20, citing an expanding triangle pattern on the asset's daily candle chart.The expanding triangle chart pattern often signals market uncertainty. Depending on where the price breaks out, it can signal the continuation of a trend or a reversal. It is usually characterized by higher and lower highs as buyers and sellers tussle for control.

These large volumes mostly come off Binance as whales seek to move assets to other custodians, which signifies long-term holdings. Generally, the market’s reaction is bullish, with BTC’s price shaking off previous exits to regain $100K. Data from CryptoQuant shows increased whale accumulations, leading to a surge in market sentiments. In the last 48 hours, several withdrawals from Binance ranged from 4000 BTC to 8000 BTC. These buys point to long-term holdings as bulls anticipate a higher price for the asset. Whale activity on Binance has taken a positive trend during price swings in past bill peaks. Outflows from the top exchange influence retail holdings as they move in a similar direction. “ We observed massive withdrawals ranging from 4,000 BTC to over 8,000 BTC while Bitcoin’s price was testing the 100k target. Withdrawals from Binance remain dominant, indicating that investors are steadily accumulating Bitcoin as they anticipate further upward movement. Notably, these withdrawals also coincide with MicroStrategy’s recent purchases. This activity demonstrates strong investor confidence, with a clear bet on Bitcoin’s potential to rise further.” MicroStrategy’s Buys Dominate Market Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy maintains its bullish stance on Bitcoin acquisitions. Last week, the company added 21,550 BTC for approximately $2.1 billion. This raised the firm’s total holdings to 423,650 BTC, valued at $41.5 billion. These huge purchases spiked investors across the board to pour more funds into the industry. Saylor has made bullish predictions on the market price lauding recent adoption. The price of the asset stands at $100,800, with traders setting sights above $150k in the coming months. Several companies like Semler Scientific and Block added BTC to their balance sheet. US Macro Factors To Keep Asset Above $100K A consensus among Bitcoin enthusiasts is that macro factors consistently chart the bull season. The road to $100K saw the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, halving and the United States presidential election. The US SEC approved spot ETFs on Jan 10, opening up a new window of institutional investment. Inflows spiked the price above $73k before a correction, while Donald Trump’s win took the asset to present levels as holders anticipate clear rules.

37885935,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631105,1734707024,The Federal Reserve is ‘comfortable’ with its decision of 2 rate cuts in 2025,"The Federal Reserve revealed its rhythm for 2025: just two rate cuts. In a recent interview , Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said they are “very comfortable” with the decision. The Fed’s latest decision to drop the federal funds rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% capped off three back-to-back reductions this year. But those days of aggressive action? Over. “Now I feel we’ve got that recalibration phase behind us,” Daly said. “We’re in the next phase: looking at incoming information.” In other words, the Fed is sticking to its classic playbook—gradual moves, one eye on inflation, and the other on job numbers. Asian currencies take a hit The Fed’s decision sent global markets spinning. Asian currencies, in particular, felt the heat. The Japanese yen dropped 0.74%, sliding to 155.94 against the dollar, its lowest in a month. The South Korean won stumbled, hovering near levels last seen in March 2009, while the Indian rupee broke new ground by plunging below 85 to the dollar. In Japan, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) held its benchmark rate steady at 0.25%. But not everyone was on board. Naoki Tamura, a BOJ board member, argued for a 25-basis-point hike, warning that the weak yen could disrupt wage-driven inflation. Meanwhile, China’s central bank is pivoting hard. For the first time in 14 years, the People’s Bank of China announced a “moderately loose” monetary policy. That’s a big change from its usual “prudent” stance. While the Fed’s moves might not heavily influence Beijing’s easing plans, the yuan is feeling the squeeze. Europe braces for Fed-induced ripples European markets have also felt the aftershocks. Stock markets across the continent slipped following the Fed’s announcement, while currency movements were relatively muted. The euro climbed 0.5% against the dollar, and the pound gained a slight 0.1%. Meanwhile, the Swiss franc strengthened, with the dollar dropping 0.4% against it. The European Central Bank (ECB) is playing it cautiously, too. Its latest quarter-point rate cut was the fourth reduction this year. This dovish trend aligns with its lower inflation forecasts for 2025. Across the Channel, the Bank of England (BOE) decided to hold rates steady in its last meeting of the year. But it wasn’t a unified decision. BOE policymakers showed surprising division, with debates heating up over the pace and timing of future cuts. Markets are already pricing in about 50 basis points worth of reductions in 2025.

37888060,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321526,1734706853,Floki and Bonk Are Falling Fast – Could This Signal a Bigger Crypto Market Collapse?,"The crypto market is facing significant this week and the price of meme coins like Floki and Bonk are falling sharply today following a dire outlook from the Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the pace at which they plan to cut rates next year. According to a statement from the Chairman of the United States central bank, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would now only cut rates twice next year instead of the four times they initially planned as they expect inflation to stay above their 2% target in 2025. Fewer rate cuts mean less liquidity for the financial markets. This unexpected shift in the Fed’s monetary policy views is already causing a major correction in the markets and crypto assets are typically very susceptible to these news. In the past 24 hours, BONK has seen its market value drop by 19.2% while FLOKI is down 23.7%. Meanwhile, the entire market cap of meme coins , as tracked by CoinMarketCap, has plunged from $137 billion on December 8 to $87.6 billion this morning. This means that nearly $50 billion in market value has evaporated in a relatively short period. Meanwhile, the accumulated losses of these two tokens in the past 30 days are even worse as $BONK has seen its price collapse by 53.2% while $FLOKI has experienced a milder drop of 38.8%. FLOKI and BONK Could Soon Hit Critical Horizontal Supports According to crypto analyst Altcoin Hunter on X, the price of $FLOKI could soon retest a major horizontal support at $0.00011. This threshold would serve as a stopping points for sellers in the near term. $FLOKI Retest in progress. Not making any move right now. If it fails, a much better entry will come around. Patience. pic.twitter.com/07CQ8A6OqT — Altcoin hunter (@Altcoin1hunter) December 19, 2024 Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for Floki is entering oversold territory already. Although this does not necessarily mean that the price will stop dropping immediately, it is an indication that the selling spree may be already going too far. In the case of BONK, the price could either retest the $0.000017 level or bounce off the trend line shown in the chart. The vertical upswings that both digital assets experienced recently were unsustainable and a pullback was already due for most meme coins including BONK and FLOKI. However, the extent of this weakness may have been exacerbated by the unexpected comments of the Federal Reserve as market participants were caught off guard. Investors may adopt a risk-off attitude moving forward until they see evidence that inflation is behaving differently than the Fed expects. For example, if prices start to increase at a pace below 2% within the next quarter, chances are that the crypto market will resume its uptrend in the near future. For now, the market is just digesting the news and perhaps panicking over nothing. The severity of the drop – which extends to over 30% for many meme coins in the past 30 days at least – does justify the use of the word crash. However, the year-to-date (YTD) performance of all of these assets has been outstanding. In the case of BONK, its price has experienced a 92.9% increase since the year started while FLOKI has seen even higher gains of 336.4% during this same period. This Solana Project is Raising Millions in its Presale Despite the Market’s Weakness This temporary weakness that the crypto market is experiencing is not deterring investors from pouring more money on a promising layer-two project for the Solana blockchain called Solaxy. Its presale has raised nearly $3.5 million in the past 14 days as crypto enthusiasts believe that it solves a major source of concern for Solana developers – scalability. As meme coins continue to gain traction and become an influential force within the crypto ecosystem, the Solana blockchain may start to struggle to process transactions rapidly and cheaply. Enter Solaxy, an innovative layer-two solution that bundles transactions and processes them offline before they are recorded on the Solana mainnet. The project offers zero congestion, failed transactions, or delayed block inception. The native token of the Solaxy project is $SOLX and it is currently available on presale at $0.001572. Imagine buying Optimism or Arbitrum at their seed round price. Investors who bought $ARB in April 2019 has seen returns of 153X and you have the chance with $SOLX to reap similar gains once developers start to adopt it en-masse. Visit the official website of Solaxy to get your hands on your first $SOLX. Simply connect your wallet and convert USDT, ETH, or BNB in just a few clicks. If you don’t have a wallet, try out Best Wallet then. Meanwhile, if you don’t own crypto at the moment, you can use a bank card to buy $SOLX as well.

Solana Set for Upswing: Eyes on Breakthrough to $290 Resistance Solana is trading between $205 and $240, showing signs of consolidation after recent pullbacks. Despite a weekly drop of over 7% and a monthly decline exceeding 12%, Solana has gained more than 56% in the past six months. The nearest resistance level is around $255, and breaching this could pave the way to the next target near $290. The Relative Strength Index is just below neutral, suggesting room for upward movement. With the simple moving averages converging, momentum may shift in favor of buyers. As the market gears up for the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Solana could rally, potentially offering substantial percentage gains from current prices. Toncoin Eyes $7.94 Resistance as Altcoin Season Approaches Toncoin is trading between $5.26 and $7.17, showing signs of potential growth. The nearest resistance is at $7.94; a move past this could see the price reach $9.85. The 10-day moving average is around $5.44, while the 100-day is near $5.98, hinting at a bullish crossover. The RSI is just under 41, indicating room for upward movement. Despite recent dips of about 14% over the week and 2% over the month, the anticipated altcoin season may propel Toncoin upwards significantly. AVAX Poised for Growth as Altcoin Season Nears Avalanche (AVAX) is trading between $42.59 and $57.15. Despite a 12.18% dip in the past week, it has climbed 20.03% over the last month and 55.03% in six months. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 35.85 indicates it’s nearing oversold territory, suggesting a potential upward move. The nearest resistance level is $63; breaking this could see AVAX reaching $78 next, offering significant gains from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon and a global crypto bull run expected, AVAX shows strong potential for growth. Polkadot Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Polkadot (DOT) has shown strong potential for growth. Despite a recent dip of -15.78% over the past week, it boasts a monthly gain of 25.91% and a 6-month increase of 35.12%. The current price ranges between $7.48 and $10.47. If DOT can surpass the nearest resistance level at $11.93, it may climb toward the next target at $14.92. This move could represent a significant percentage increase. The Relative Strength Index sits at 34.56, suggesting there is room for upward movement before reaching overbought levels. As the crypto market heats up, Polkadot might be poised for a substantial rally. Conclusion SOL, TON, AVAX, and DOT show solid long-term potential but may deliver slower short-term gains. DOGEN stands out as a token crafted for those pursuing excellence. With expected 700% growth by presale’s end and the possibility of 1000x returns, it mirrors the rise of BONK and others. DOGEN combines status, rewards, and a strong community focus.

Overall the past 7 days, it looks like ADA is in a bearish trend. Analysts say it’s profit-taking as investors gain from Solana’s performance this year​​. Source: CoinMarketCap The Fear & Greed Index is greedy, which means the market is enthusiastic but overbought.

Crypto analysts believe the pullback will not last long. Investors search for crucial buy zones amid ongoing crypto market decline. Thursday’s crypto market crash has prompted several reactions. Industry stakeholders analyzed the causes and potential implications of the market-wide price collapse. Bitcoin fell below $100,000, but crypto optimists say the pullback is a blessing and presents investors with profit-making opportunities. The bearish pressure continued into the early hours of Friday, with Bitcoin breaking below Thursday’s $95,537 low to reach a $93,887 daily low. That level marked Bitcoin’s lowest price in over one week amid a significantly bullish uptrend that saw the cryptocurrency reach a record $108,364 on December 17. While most retail crypto investors are waiting to see how the market develops, analysts are making their next moves. Most say the correction is temporary. One analyst said there would be a video streaming session Friday to give a crypto market overview and help traders find critical levels for entering the market.

37885774,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395616,1734706800,"XRP Price Aims For $10, But These Two Coins Below $1 Are Attracting Investor Attention, SHIB And YETIO","The post XRP Price Aims For $10, But These Two Coins Below $1 Are Attracting Investor Attention, SHIB And YETIO appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP is making headlines with its ambitious push toward the $10 mark. Investors remain excited as this would signal a historic milestone for the cryptocurrency. But while XRP grabs the limelight, two underdog tokens priced below $1 quietly steal attention—Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Yeti Ouro (YETIO). These low-cost tokens offer explosive potential and are becoming the focus of savvy investors. XRP Targets $10 With Increasing Momentum In 2024, XRP saw an impressive comeback. Regulatory clarity and Ripple’s steady expansion have bred confidence among the traders. The token is now priced at $2.61, a 150% gain in the last 30 days. According to analysts, XRP price could hit $10 by 2025 due to global usage and Ripple’s work in the cross-border payments sector. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has also contributed to the bullish sentiment. The stablecoin — designed to power enterprise-grade solutions — aligns with Ripple’s vision of a cohesive crypto-driven financial ecosystem. XRP’s short-term bullishness has left investors hopeful that the token can push through the critical resistance levels. But, now that XRP is on the up-and-up, some traders are looking for promising alternatives — such as SHIB and YETIO — which provide high growth at a fraction of the price. Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction: A Memecoin With Second Wind Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been making waves recently, from the loyal community to the unexpected market movements. SHIB price at $0.000024, a small investment can see massive percentage gains, making it appealing to smaller investors. The last 24 hours saw a 258% increase in large transactions as per recent data, indicating the increasing activity from whales. This spike indicates increasing interest from institutional players. 1-month Shiba Inu price chart- source: CoinMarketCap SHIB has expanded its ecosystem with projects like Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution. This is part of the effort to make SHIB a meme coin and a utility token. Nevertheless, the significant circulating supply of 589 trillion tokens continues to pose challenges to price sustainability. Despite these challenges, Shiba Inu is still popular for investors who want to maximize their gains with as little capital as possible upfront. Yeti Ouro The Next Big Thing In Crypto As such, Yeti Ouro is quickly becoming a contender in the crypto world. Unlike SHIB though, YETIO is not a speculative play — it’s a token with a clear use case. Yeti Ouro fuels Yeti Go, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game that combines the world of blockchain with interactive entertainment. Thanks to this utility, YETIO has already gained popularity as an innovative project among investors. Key Highlights of Yeti Ouro: Successful Presale: With strong interest from early investors, Yeti Ouro’s presale has already raised over $1.27 million. Unique Ecosystem: Combining staking rewards, token burns, and a lively marketplace within its gaming platform, YETIO provides a ready-made ecosystem for users. Affordable Price: At a price point of less than $1, YETIO offers potential for enormous returns, particularly as the gaming industry shifts to the blockchain. Community-Driven Growth: Because of its increasing community and active development team, Yeti Ouro is being adopted and its ecosystem is being built. Massive Growth Potential: YETIO looks ultra-exciting as analysts predict as much as 10x returns on investment. Yeti Ouro has recently announced a meme contest! The top prize is $2,000 for first place, $1,000 for second place, and $500 for third place. To enter, unleash your creativity by crafting engaging Yeti-themed memes and sharing them on X. Be sure to tag @yetiouro and include the hashtag #YetiMeme in your post. For more details, visit the official Yeti Ouro X channel. Conclusion — Three Opportunities The XRP journey to $10 shows how strong and useful XRP is. However, those investors looking for high-risk, high-reward plays, in particular, will find SHIB and YETIO a pretty alluring option. The real attraction for Shiba Inu remains its cheapness and ecosystem development, whereas Yeti Ouro’s unique gaming platform and solid presale sign-up help it stand out. Now, with a little over two weeks of December behind us, these three tokens provide every type of investor with a unique opportunity. And the crypto market is flooded with opportunities whether you are counting on XRP’s steady rise, SHIB’s meme-influenced momentum, or YETIO’s disruptive potential.

Speaking at a recent press conference, Nabiullina stated, “We continue to believe that cryptocurrencies should not be used as a means of domestic payment,” according to Reuters reporting. This stance aligns with Russia’s current legislation, which prohibits the use of digital assets for transactions within the country. However, Nabiullina emphasized the central bank’s support for using cryptocurrencies in international trade as a way to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions. “We do agree, support, and promote projects related to the use of cryptocurrency for external payments, but for domestic payments—no,” she clarified.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. CYBRO surges 260% post-listing, emerging as a low-cap contender to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi with smart AI-driven features. Table of Contents CYBRO’s 260% jump after Gate.io and MEXC listings Ethereum’s Pos and smart contracts drive dApp ecosystem Conclusion A new powerhouse is emerging in the crypto world, poised to overtake Ethereum’s position by 2025. This low-cap token, though little known now, has the potential to disrupt the blockchain industry. Explore how this rising star could outperform the giants and reshape the future of decentralized finance and applications. CYBRO’s 260% jump after Gate.io and MEXC listings CYBRO is taking the crypto world by storm. Fresh off its launch on Gate.io and MEXC, the token’s price shot up from $0.06 to $0.16 in just 24 hours, a whopping 260% gain. The trading volume hit an impressive $15 million at its peak. This explosive debut is backed by CYBRO’s solid fundamentals and the buzz it built before the launch. During its presale, CYBRO raised $7 million and attracted almost 20,000 early investors, showing strong market interest even before going public. Despite this incredible rally, CYBRO is still at a low price point, leaving room for higher highs. In the medium term, the token could add more 500-600% to its value, depending on broader crypto market conditions and adoption within its ecosystem. In the most optimistic scenario, CYBRO could surge 1100%. CYBRO is a multichain DeFi platform that uses AI to optimize earnings. Here are the privileges for CYBRO holders: Earn by staking: Lock up CYBRO and earn passive income Airdrops and rewards: Get cashback and loyalty bonuses just for being part of the community Shape the future: With just 100 CYBRO tokens, users can join the CYBRO DAO and vote on key decisions Save on fees: CYBRO holders enjoy reduced transaction costs CYBRO is staying true to its promise to early investors and already delivering real results. Looking ahead, the team is gearing up to roll out new AI features, open more vaults, and develop additional one-click strategies to streamline DeFi investing. Combined with its strong launch performance and ambitious roadmap, CYBRO is shaping up to be a leader in decentralized finance. Investors can join CYBRO now before the next big jump .

It powers decentralized finance and uses Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon to improve transactions. Ethereum introduced ERC-20 tokens, which are used for governance, utility, and storing value. Transactions still require ETH for gas fees. Since its inception by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum has evolved, including the switch to Proof-of-Stake. The network aims to increase scalability and reduce costs. Ether (ETH) is central, supporting transactions, rewarding stakers, and acting as a tradable asset and collateral. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run gains momentum, established cryptocurrencies like ETH may offer less short-term growth potential compared to emerging projects. CYBRO, with its advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, presents unique opportunities for investors. Its AI-powered yield aggregation maximizes earnings, and features such as lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases enhance the user experience. Seamless deposits and withdrawals, along with a focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, position CYBRO as a standout project. The strong interest from crypto whales and influencers underscores its promising prospects in the evolving market landscape.

37885577,https://finbold.com/?p=221400,1734706400,Altcoin flash crash is opportunity says expert,"The wider cryptocurrency market entered a strong bull run on November 5, the day that the United States presidential election was held. In the following weeks, Bitcoin ( BTC ) struggled to breach the $100,000 price point — and as the deadlock extended, altcoin season came — a period when other cryptocurrencies outperformed the world’s largest digital asset. However, things took a dramatic turn for the worse on December 18, when the Federal Reserve (FED) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting was made public . While the bodies did end up going with an expected 25 basis point rate cut, they also announced that only two rate cuts will come in 2025 — whereas investors were expecting to see four. While the immediate reaction was negative, the newfound bearish sentiment was bolstered on December 19 and 20, as roughly $1.4 billion in open crypto positions was liquidated . Bitcoin prices fell to $94,170 — having marked a 7.75% drop on the daily chart. BTC price daily chart. Source: Finbold There does appear to be a silver lining, however — one notable cryptocurrency expert expects the dip to be temporary — and is recommending that investors should go long at these newfound discounts. Michael van de Poppe sees buy the dip opportunity on alts In the early hours of December 20, renowned crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe shared a chart and reflected on the current state of affairs in an X post. Surprisingly enough, he didn’t share the overly pessimistic tone of many of his peers — in his own words “These are opportunities and those drops will continue to happen.“ From here on out, van de Poppe expects that Bitcoin will consolidate and altcoins will enter their next run. Finally, the analyst identified two areas of interest — the first being the $89,584 price point, with the second at $85,327. Although a drop to these levels would most likely extend the downturn, if the trading expert’s predictions of recovery come true, the decrease in price would indeed represent a good buying opportunity. BTC price chart and analysis. Source: Michaël van de Poppe on X As traumatic as these sudden moves to the downside can be, the theses behind the crypto bull run haven’t changed. Institutional adoption is increasing, the upcoming Trump administration appears to be quite pro-crypto, and interest rates will continue falling, although at a reduced pace. Once all is said and done, the odds appear higher that the market will recover quickly — it remains to be seen, however, if van de Poppe’s prediction of a new altcoin run will come true.

The altcoin leader continues its sideways trading despite glimpses of a forward run through multiple resistance. Lower market sentiments have affected bulls significantly, as shown in recent whale movements out of the ecosystem. New market data released by the firm shows dwindling confidence for a $5K resistance level break. Currently, traders believe it only has an 8% chance of hitting the market despite increasing inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs . Steve Dawson, Derive’s head of research, noted a 17% chance of tapping the mark at its peak. Frequent price grips and corrections lowered Ethereum’s chances of hitting $5K. ETH stands at $3,288 at press time, 40% away from the much-anticipated target. Unlike Bitcoin and other altcoins like Solana, institutional flows didn’t help ETH this year. Ethereum Bulls May Defy Odds Although the price target is far up for most users, Ethereum Bulls projects a massive uptrend based on swinging macro factors. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), ETH contributor Eric Conner flagged the increasing inflow into ETH ETFs, tipping a supply-side crisis. Similarly, a crypto trader, Pentoshi, noted that the network is changing in terms of inflow with little resistance to a new all-time high. “ Much like this thread with BTC, $ETH is having structural changes as well as the beginning of consistent and large ETF flows.

This is after an appeals court said that the platform’s smart contracts should not have been punished. Roman Storm said that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) went beyond its authority when it sanctioned Tornado Cash’s smart contracts. He also added that the court’s decision “clearly affects” his charge of conspiring to break the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which is a key law in the US sanctions system. He explained that the appeals court said that smart contracts “are not the ‘property’ of a foreign national or entity,” which means that the law “cannot block” them. The court’s decision about smart contracts helped the 700% rise in TORN. Monero and other privacy coins have been pumping after the courts ruled that the US treasury overstepped by sanctioning tornado cash and also because Europe is proposing to tax unrealized capital gains on bitcoin pic.twitter.com/yM3uTBVstD — Crypto Tea (@CryptoTea_) December 4, 2024 The court’s ruling has also had a rollover effect on other decentralized platforms, especially privacy tokens, which have gone on a bullish rally since. The Tornado Cash case For months, six plaintiffs have argued this issue in relation to Tornado Cash’s punishment by the US Treasury Department. The plaintiffs in this civil case advanced a similar argument to Alexey Pertsev, a co-founder of Tornado Cash, who was sentenced to a five-year prison term in May by a Dutch court. The sentencing came after being convicted of aiding in the laundering of $1.2 billion in illicit funds on the platform. According to the fifth court, the Treasury Department was wrong in sanctioning the crypto mixer for executing transactions by North Korean-linked hackers and other national security threats and offenders. The Fifth Circuit stated that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts cannot be altered or eliminated. They can, however, be used by any individual, including sanctioned North Korean hackers, and their creators would be unable to prevent their use. Therefore, the court ruled that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, erred in sanctioning the enterprise in 2022. The high court directed a lower court to grant the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the penalties in part. Roman Storm asserted in his motion that the district court was unable to determine whether Tornado Cash was irreversible when it denied his motion to dismiss in September. However, the appeals court opinion “decided as a matter of law” that it was. Storm is also accused of conspiring to operate an unregistered money-transmitting business and of participating in a money laundering conspiracy. He stated that it should be eliminated. He submitted that Tornado Cash is not a financial institution; therefore, there could be no agreement to commit money laundering. This is because the Tornado Cash protocol became immutable in May 2020, four months before the alleged start of the conspiracy. Tornado Cash users celebrate win for crypto privacy. Crypto privacy supporters claimed the judgment reaffirmed their long-held belief that automated smart contracts should be regarded differently. They asserted that crypto privacy is different from that of other developers, such as DAOs or any other entity running an anonymizing platform like Tornado Cash. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s chief legal officer, has supported Roman’s stance for some time. He explained that the integrity of smart contracts, which are the backbone of the Ethereum ecosystem, is in jeopardy if the US Treasury succeeds in restricting different types of blockchain technology. Paul Grewal described the ruling as a game-changer for blockchain technology. He wrote on X, “These smart contracts must now be removed from the sanctions list and U.S. persons will once again be allowed to use this privacy-protecting protocol.” Privacy wins. Today the Fifth Circuit held that @USTreasury ’s sanctions against Tornado Cash smart contracts are unlawful. This is a historic win for crypto and all who cares about defending liberty. @coinbase is proud to have helped lead this important challenge. 1/6 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) November 26, 2024 In addition, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said, “If these sanctions stand, the damage will extend beyond these six individuals, and even beyond Tornado Cash.” He added, “Even though we’re not the ones facing the brunt of these damages, we couldn’t stand by.” Now, a US court has agreed to deliver an eye-opening legal victory to the crypto industry. The price of Tornado cash has been on a bull rally the whole year. However, the price has declined from $19 on 12 Dec to $9 now.

Despite this bold move, Metaplanet’s shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 4.24% today at 3,610 yen, according to Yahoo Finance. However, year-to-date stock performance remains impressive, up 2,023%. The company also debuted on the U.S. OTCQX market this week. Shares closed down 9.96% on their first day of trading in the U.S., according to Google Finance. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-focused strategy is in line with trends seen at other public companies like MicroStrategy, which remains the largest public institutional Bitcoin holder with 439,000 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Metaplanet’s aggressive bond-funded approach underscores the growing interest by traditional firms in leveraging Bitcoin as a core part of their financial strategies. *This is not investment advice.

37885396,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395767,1734706074,Central Bank of Russia Stands Firm Against Bitcoin,"The post Central Bank of Russia Stands Firm Against Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When the Russian Central Bank announced it wouldn’t touch its 21% interest rate, it caught many off guard. People expected a hike—maybe to 22%, maybe even higher. But nope. They stuck to their guns. What’s going on here? Let’s dig into their reasoning, because it says a lot about how they’re managing the economy right now. Why Keep It at 21%? Central bank had three options on the table: leave the rate as-is, bump it to 22%, or go all the way to 23%. In the end, they chose stability. Governor Elvira Nabiullina explained the logic. She pointed to a slowdown in credit growth as a major factor. Basically, people aren’t borrowing as much. And Deputy Governor Alexei Zabotkin backed her up, saying the latest data shows the current rate is already doing its job. They’re playing a cautious game here. Raising rates further could hurt more than it helps. High Rates: Necessary Evil or Overkill? This is where things get tricky. No one likes high interest rates. They make loans expensive and slow down economic growth. But Nabiullina insists it’s worth it. Why? Because inflation is still a problem in Russia, and the economy needs to stay balanced. She also acknowledged the criticism. “Yes, these rates are tough,” she admitted. But they’re also temporary. According to her, the policies put in place since mid-2023 are already making an impact. The key is patience. Inflation control isn’t an overnight thing, especially in an economy like Russia that is facing unique challenges. If inflation doesn’t ease soon, though, the bank has a backup plan. Nabiullina calls it “Plan B,” which basically means sticking with the current approach for now, tweaking it if needed. What About the Rouble? Currency stability is another piece of this puzzle. The Central Bank is sticking with its floating exchange rate policy. This means the market decides the value of the rouble, not the bank. Some worry this could weaken the currency. But Nabiullina isn’t too concerned. She argues that trade balances—how much Russia exports versus imports—matter more. And right now, there’s no reason to panic. The rouble is holding its own. Central Bank’s View Towards Bitcoin The Russian Central Bank has made a bold statement and crypto enthusiasts might not be happy with it. They made it clear that they don’t want Bitcoin or other cryptos used for domestic payments. They are ignoring crypto because they are concerned about risks and regulatory issues. Just a few days ago, a deputy proposed the creation of a Bitcoin reserve. This happened after President Putin expressed his support for Bitcoin. Russia is working for various crypto regulations to be used for foreign trades only. What’s Next? For now, it seems the Central Bank is focused on waiting things out. They’re betting that their current strategy will control inflation without stalling the economy. Will it work? Only time will tell. But one thing’s clear: they’re walking a tightrope, trying to balance growth, inflation, and currency stability all at once. An important thing to notice is that their stance is different from that of the nation’s President.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/central-bank-of-russia-stands-firm-against-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The initiative will be deployed through its crypto subsidiary Hexarq, following regulatory approval from the AMF, the country’s financial markets watchdog. It will launch its services within the Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne networks from 2025, as reported by The Big Whale . Notably, Hexarq recently obtained PSAN (Prestataire de Services sur Actifs Numériques – Virtual Asset Service Provider) authorization, which allows it to operate legally within France’s digital asset market. PSAN authorization is a regulatory framework established in France to oversee digital asset service providers. BPCE to Offer Crypto Services Through Hexarq App Hexarq has become the fourth company and the second bank in France to obtain this approval, following SG Forge. The license grants Hexarq the authority to hold, buy, sell, and exchange digital assets. The French banking group will offer these services through an app developed by Hexarq, aimed at customers of its Banque Populaire and Caisse d’Épargne networks. Established in 2021, the subsidiary will lead BPCE’s expansion into digital assets after remaining low-profile in the sector for years. Notably, the BPCE group is among the 10 largest banks in Europe. France Makes History France has made history as the first major EU economy to open applications for crypto asset service provider licenses under the groundbreaking Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. The AMF started accepting applications on July 1, 2024, ahead of the MiCA regulations set to take effect on December 30, 2024. This proactive approach positions France as a leader in implementing crypto regulatory frameworks within the European Union. A bank insider explained that with this service, BPCE will be able to retain assets from clients switching to exchange platforms and also attract new customers. Natixis, BPCE’s investment banking arm, is not currently part of the cryptocurrency initiative and will focus on market infrastructure and financial asset tokenization. Notably, Natixis took part in the issuance of a 100 million euro bond on the blockchain by Caisse des Dépôts in November.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/frances-bpce-to-launch-crypto-investment-services-in-2025-with-hexarq/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Is The Current Rebound Insufficient to Sustain Bullish Expectations?,"The post Is It Time to Be Bearish on Solana? Is The Current Rebound Insufficient to Sustain Bullish Expectations? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a surprising move, the crypto markets witnessed another dreadful pullback of the year, wiping out over $250 billion from the markets in just a few hours. On the other hand, the spot ETFs also witnessed record-breaking outflows of over $730 million, of which Bitcoin constitutes over $670 million and Ethereum just $60 million. These compelled the Solana price to slash hard below $200 and mark the interim lows at around $175. However, the bulls have jumped in and revamped a strong recovery to reach $187. The current bloodbath is assumed to be the aftermath impact of the recent comments by the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. On a question raised on his opinion on the National Bitcoin Reserve that President-elect Donald Trump had announced to constitute, Powell said that they are not allowed to own any Bitcoin and that they are not willing to change the law for the same. This raised serious concerns over the regulatory approach, which was believed to be positive as soon as Trump assumed office, but these comments raised huge concerns. Meanwhile, the SOL price , which was trying hard to keep up the rally close to $220, experienced a dreadful drop of nearly 20% as it broke the support at $216.76. With this, the question arises whether we need to be still bearish on Solana regardless of a 7% rebound. The short-term price action displays the token triggering a strong rebound with a significant influx of buying volume. However, this rebound may certainly not elevate the levels above $200, as the RSI patterns suggest an extended consolidation between $197 and $186 could be witnessed before the next price action. The RSI in the 4-hours has not dropped to the oversold zone since August lows. However, it happened first on 10th December and now. Since then, the levels are restricted below the average levels, due to which the Solana price was forced to remain accumulated between $228 and $213. Therefore, if there is less involvement of bulls, then the price is believed to maintain a consolidation between $198 and $186 for a few days. However, this could be the crucial phase for the token, as a rise in RSI within the upper region could elevate the price beyond the bearish range; otherwise, an extended bearish action could drag the Solana (SOL) price close to $155.",NEGATIVE,SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/is-it-time-to-be-bearish-on-solana-is-the-current-rebound-insufficient-to-sustain-bullish-expectations/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

According to the update, over 200,000 pioneers are completing KYC verification daily. However, the developers have extended the grace period deadline once again, moving it from Dec. 31 to Jan. 31. This is the second deadline extension, following a previous adjustment from Nov. 31. The KYC process is critical for Pi Network as it aims to eliminate bots and ensure that only genuine users who mined the coins are allocated their rightful share. The developers stated that the Open Network launch is likely to happen in the first quarter of next year. This marks a significant update since the original timeline suggested the migration from the enclosed mainnet would occur this month. The delay may explain why the Pi Coin IoU token listed on HTX has crashed to $44, down from its October high of nearly $100. Pioneers, we’ve reached over 18 million KYC’d and over 8 million Mainnet migrated Pioneers! Thanks to recent major speed upgrades, KYC applications and Mainnet migrations are processed faster than ever, i.e. nearly 200,000 Pioneers migrated in the last day. This means Open… pic.twitter.com/tHKdZPTcmv — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) December 20, 2024 The Open Network launch is a key milestone for Pi Network, a project that has been in existence since 2018 and has remained in an enclosed mainnet since December 2021. You might also like: Pi coin launch date is hard to predict: here’s why The enclosed mainnet period allowed pioneers to continue mining while developers worked on building decentralized applications (dApps) for the ecosystem. During this phase, Pi coins could not be sold, but this restriction will lift after the mainnet launch. Still, a Q1 mainnet launch is not guaranteed since the X post above mentions can instead of will. For one, while 15 million pioneers have completed their KYC process, only eight million of them have migrated to mainnet. And according to the developers , that figure has not reached the 10 million goal and they cannot leave this many pioneers from the launch. The second likely hindrance towards a mainnet launch will be the performance of the crypto market. According to the developers, the mainnet launch will also happen when the external factors are supportive and when there are enough applications in the ecosystem. As such, chances are that the Pi coin will not be listed if the ongoing Bitcoin and altcoin sell-off accelerates. The other Pi Network mainnet launch risk is that there are not enough applications in the ecosystem. The original goal was to have at least 100 mainnet-ready apps on launch, a figure that stands at 80 today. As such, they need to have another 20 apps for the mainnet to happen, which is unlikely to happen by March next year.

37888057,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321574,1734705747,MiCA in Germany: Bundestag Passes New Law To Strengthen Crypto Oversight,"The German Parliament (Bundestag) has passed on Dec. 18 the Act on the Digitalization of Financial Markets (Finanzmarktdigitalisierungsgesetz – FinmadiG), marking an important step towards incorporating key elements of the European Commission’s Digital Finance Strategy into German law. The main goal of the FinmadiG is to align Germany with upcoming European Union (EU) rules on crypto-assets, digital operational resilience and money transfers. Source: Digital Euro Association Strengthening Oversight, Not Directly Regulating Crypto Rather than directly regulating crypto assets themselves, the new legislation focuses on strengthening oversight of the companies operating within the digital finance space. This translates to stricter scrutiny of crypto exchanges and other service providers, with a particular emphasis on preventing fraudulent activities and market manipulation. By holding these entities accountable and promoting transparency, FinmadiG seeks to foster a safer and more secure environment for all participants in the crypto market. The new law addresses three EU regulations: Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation ( MiCA ): Effective from Dec. 30, 2024 , MiCA establishes a comprehensive framework for crypto-asset services , including issuance, trading, and custody. The FinmadiG includes “grandfathering” provisions, allowing existing German-licensed crypto-asset service providers to operate under their current licenses until Dec. 31, 2025, while offering a fast-track application for obtaining a MiCA license. Digital Operational Resilience Act ( DORA ): Applicable from Jan. 17, 2025, DORA strengthens the security requirements for information systems in the financial sector, impacting a wide range of institutions, including crypto-asset service providers. It mandates robust ICT risk management, incident reporting, and governance controls. Revised Transfer of Funds Regulation ( TFR ): Coming into effect on Dec. 30, 2024, the revised TFR tightens regulations on information accompanying fund transfers, including crypto-assets. This regulation aims to enhance transparency and traceability, bolstering measures against financial crime. As these are EU regulations, they apply directly in member states. Germany’s Act complements these regulations where permitted, such as with the grandfathering provisions for crypto-asset service providers. Combating Market Abuse and Promoting Transparency Germany’s FinmadiG also introduces the Crypto Markets Supervision Act (Kryptomärkteaufsichtsgesetz – KMAG). This law primarily focuses on implementing MiCA’s operational rules within Germany. KMAG defines the role and powers of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht – BaFin) in overseeing crypto-asset providers under MiCA. The law also establishes a system of penalties for violations of both the KMAG and MiCA. Overview of crypto regulation in Germany. Source: PayTechLaw.com In general, the new legislation empowers Germany’s financial regulator to more closely supervise crypto companies . This includes conducting audits and investigating potential money laundering or market manipulation. These expanded powers strengthen BaFin’s ability to ensure compliance and protect investors. Additionally, stricter accounting and auditing rules will be required to prevent misrepresentation of crypto assets in financial reports, especially for publicly traded companies. The law also targets market manipulation in the crypto space, such as pump-and-dump schemes, by bringing these activities under BaFin’s supervision, and increases liability for crypto service providers, holding them accountable for negligence in safeguarding customer funds or security breaches. The FinmadiG now awaits approval by the Bundesrat on Dec. 20, followed by signature by the Federal President and publication in the Federal Law Gazette, the official promulgation channel for federal laws. These final steps are expected to be completed before Dec. 30.

Notably, Bitcoin's price has recently declined to $94,000, reflecting a broader market downturn following the Federal Reserve's latest policy decisions. The Fed reduced interest rates by 0.25%, bringing them to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Stock and Crypto Markets DownHowever, Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a slower pace of easing in 2025, indicating plans for fewer rate cuts than previously anticipated. This hawkish stance has unsettled both stock and cryptocurrency markets. Major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced significant declines, with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 3% in the past five days. Within the same timeframe, the Dow Jone has slumped by 3.43%, while the Nasdaq Composite has dropped by a more substantial 4.12%.Notably, crypto mirrored this trend, as Bitcoin led the charge, collapsing below the $100,000 mark . The crypto market has so far seen over $1.3 billion in liquidations over the last 24 hours.Jim Cramer's AdviceAmid this volatility, financial commentator and CNBC's Mad Money host Jim Cramer advises investors to consider buying into the fear. He suggests that market downturns, often driven by fear and uncertainty, can present buying opportunities for those willing to take a contrarian stance. Jim Cramer on X Jim Cramer on X It's worth noting that Cramer's recommendations often come under humorous scrutiny by the crypto community for their interesting impact. Notably, many in the community suggest that the market often moves in the opposite direction to what the Mad Money host predicts.However, in the current scenario, Cramer's advice to ""buy the fear"" appears to resonate with broader market sentiment. Mentions of ""buy the dip"" have surged to an eight-month high in the crypto community, indicating a collective inclination toward purchasing BTC during the downturn.Supporting this accumulation trend, notable figures in the crypto space have made significant purchases. Justin Sun, founder of TRON, announced that he has acquired additional assets.Similarly, El Salvador has expanded its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by purchasing 11 Bitcoin worth over $1 million, shortly after the International Monetary Fund agreed to a $3.3 billion loan.https://twitter.com/bitcoinofficesv/status/1869899405391999015Bitcoin Pullback Could ContinueMeanwhile, market analysts expect the downtrend to continue in the short-term but remain bullish in the long-term. Rekt Capital observed that in previous cycles, Bitcoin experienced major corrections after six to seven weeks of price discovery. In the current cycle, it's the seventh week, suggesting a potential correction phase. Also, as BTC dropped to $96,500, Ali Martinez noted that if the asset falls below $96,000, the next support levels could be $90,000 and $85,000. With Bitcoin currently now below $95,000, this analysis indicates possible further declines.https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1869851163061039116Another analyst, Wick, noted that Bitcoin is in a downtrend on the 4-hour chart.

BTC, after crossing this price threshold on 5th December 2024, made 14,211 new millionaires as well as 4 new billionaires. As such, Bitcoin is much faster at making wealth for its holders, even compared to the most successful stocks such as Apple, Tesla, or Nvidia. A study spearheaded on December 5th sought to analyze more than 17,000 Bitcoin wallets. These wallets contained more than $1 million worth of BTC, and the information was analyzed in terms of how fast investors became millionaires and billionaires. To achieve that, the study excluded any wallets that belonged to whales and institutional investors, targeting the normal retail investors who had accumulated their holdings over time. It compared Bitcoin’s wealth creation to the returns of blue-chip stocks like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia. Minting Millionaires and Billionaires Much Faster to Stocks The study concluded that Bitcoin investors turn into millionaires at a phenomenal speed. For instance, $4,000 invested in Bitcoin in 2010 would yield $1 million by 2020, which is 250 times the amount invested. This milestone arrived 22 times faster than it would have been if it had stocks involved. If the same amount of money is invested in Apple or Tesla stocks, the value would only reach $45,000 in 2020. Bitcoin extends the speed to creating billionaires even further. Investors who invested $30,500 in bitcoins in the early part of 2011 became billionaires by December 2023 after 12.7 years of investment. This 32,787 times return is 1,064 times faster than traditional stock investors who would have seen just $950,000 in the same duration. As per the study, the difference in performance between BTC and the top 10 largest companies by market cap is quite shocking. Between 2010 and 2020, Bitcoin grew 20 times more in price than Apple, 9 times more than Nvidia, and 4 times more than Tesla. Based on the long-term period from 2010 to 2024, BTC has returned 76,378 times Apple, 6,062 times Nvidia, and 9,103 times Tesla. These figures show that Bitcoin’s pie growth is unprecedented, let alone by the world’s largest equities. BTC Vs. Stocks 2010-2024: NFT Evening As per the study, Bitcoin flipping $100,000 has changed many lives. The milestone price minted over 14,000 new millionaires and 4 billionaires. This only suggests that Bitcoin can generate wealth faster and more effectively than traditional stock investments. Bitcoin’s Unmatched Wealth Creation After surpassing $100,000, Bitcoin has altered the industry and generated a new generation of millionaires. From the study, it is apparent that Bitcoin’s capability of generating wealth surpasses that of blue-chip investment stocks, thereby making it an almost irresistible investment product. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,596 after dropping 7.22% over the last 24 hours.

Partnerships like that of Eliza Labs and Stanford University’s Future Digital Currency Initiative are advancing this intersection, while projects such as AI16z highlight the potential for decentralized, self-governing AI agents to optimize blockchain networks. However, vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by incidents of AI manipulation, expose critical risks requiring robust safeguards to maintain trust in these systems. Despite challenges, the rapid development in this field holds promise for reshaping digital finance by addressing inefficiencies and introducing innovative solutions. How are AI Agents Impacting Digital Assets? The intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital assets is emerging as a transformative domain, with AI agents increasingly being explored as facilitators and managers of digital currency systems. This overlap is fueled by initiatives like the partnership between Eliza Labs and Stanford University’s Future Digital Currency Initiative (FDCI), which investigates how autonomous AI agents can impact the functionality, security, and scalability of digital asset ecosystems. These AI agents are envisioned to perform tasks such as executing transactions, managing wallets, and optimizing investment strategies, with potential to streamline operations while introducing new efficiencies. One of the key advantages of AI in this space is its ability to process vast amounts of data in real-time, enabling more informed decision-making and improving transaction execution speed. The partnership between Stanford researchers and the team behind AI16z , a blockchain-powered AI bot, highlights the potential of combining AI and decentralized technologies to create intelligent, self-governing agents capable of enhancing the functionality of blockchain networks. These systems could provide a decentralized infrastructure for asset management and trading, reducing reliance on traditional intermediaries and lowering transaction costs for users. However, the integration of AI as digital agents also presents significant risks and challenges. Recent incidents where AI bots were manipulated into mismanaging digital assets, such as an instance where a user tricked an AI agent into transferring $50,000 in cryptocurrency, underscore vulnerabilities in these systems. These cases reveal the critical need for robust safeguards, ethical guidelines, and fail-safes to prevent misuse or exploitation of autonomous agents. The risk of AI misjudgment or manipulation introduces a layer of complexity that could undermine trust in these systems if not adequately addressed. Despite these challenges, the exploration of AI in digital asset ecosystems is progressing rapidly, with growing interest from academia, industry leaders, and blockchain developers. Initiatives like Stanford’s research partnership with AI16z are pivotal in understanding and mitigating risks while unlocking the full potential of autonomous agents in cryptocurrency systems. As these technologies mature, they could reshape the landscape of digital finance, providing innovative solutions to longstanding issues such as inefficiencies, security gaps, and accessibility barriers, while simultaneously redefining the roles of humans and machines in economic systems. Are AI Agents Ready For Prime Time When it Comes to Digital Assets The security of AI agents in managing digital assets is a topic of growing importance as these technologies become more integrated into cryptocurrency ecosystems. AI agents are increasingly tasked with executing transactions, managing wallets, and optimizing trading strategies, offering significant advantages such as real-time data analysis and automation. However, their effectiveness hinges on their ability to safeguard digital assets against manipulation, fraud, and other threats. While AI systems are designed to learn and adapt, their security is only as robust as the algorithms, training data, and safeguards embedded within their design.One significant concern is the vulnerability of AI agents to exploitation. These vulnerabilities often stem from inadequate safeguards, lack of ethical frameworks, or flaws in the underlying programming. Addressing these weaknesses requires rigorous testing, secure development practices, and constant updates to counteract emerging threats. Another challenge lies in the opacity of many AI systems, particularly those employing machine learning algorithms that operate as “black boxes.” This lack of transparency makes it difficult to predict or understand how AI agents might behave in specific scenarios, creating a potential risk in high-stakes environments such as digital asset management. Transparency and explainability are critical for building trust in AI agents, allowing users and developers to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Despite these challenges, the integration of AI agents into digital asset systems is not without potential solutions. Robust encryption, multi-factor authentication, and the use of decentralized infrastructures can enhance the security of AI-managed systems. Furthermore, partnerships between academia, industry, and regulatory bodies—such as Stanford University’s collaboration with blockchain innovators—are essential for developing frameworks that combine innovation with security. As AI systems mature and their limitations are better understood, the potential for secure, reliable AI agents in the digital asset space will likely increase, but their adoption will depend on continuous advancements in security and ethical safeguards. What Can We Expect From the Merge of AI and Crypto? The future of AI and cryptocurrency represents a convergence of two transformative technologies that have the potential to reshape global finance and digital interactions. AI’s ability to process vast amounts of data, detect patterns, and optimize decision-making complements the decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain technology. Together, they can create sophisticated ecosystems where AI agents facilitate secure, autonomous transactions, manage digital assets, and enhance blockchain scalability. For example, AI can optimize the efficiency of blockchain networks by predicting transaction congestion and dynamically adjusting fees, fostering smoother operations and reducing costs.In the coming years, AI is likely to play a critical role in addressing some of the biggest challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry. Enhanced fraud detection and security mechanisms powered by AI could significantly mitigate risks such as hacking and manipulation. Moreover, AI-driven analytics will enable more robust regulatory compliance, helping organizations adhere to evolving global standards. These capabilities are particularly crucial as the adoption of cryptocurrencies grows and demands for both security and trust in decentralized systems increase.However, the fusion of AI and crypto also introduces complexities that will shape their future. Issues such as ethical considerations, algorithmic biases, and the risk of centralization in AI-controlled systems must be addressed to ensure that these technologies fulfill their potential without compromising foundational principles like decentralization and transparency. Collaboration between developers, policymakers, and academic researchers will be essential to establish ethical guidelines and safeguard measures for AI applications in the crypto space. Initiatives such as Stanford’s partnerships with blockchain firms reflect the importance of interdisciplinary efforts in shaping a responsible and secure integration.Looking ahead, the synergy between AI and cryptocurrency could redefine not only financial systems but also broader aspects of economic and digital life. AI-powered decentralized autonomous organizations could emerge as self-governing entities that dynamically adapt to market conditions, optimizing operations without human intervention. Furthermore, AI-enhanced smart contracts could enable complex agreements that react to real-time data inputs, expanding the use cases of blockchain technology. As these innovations evolve, the interplay between AI and crypto will likely pave the way for a more efficient, secure, and inclusive digital economy.

The largest cryptocurrency generally adds about 2.8% in the 51st week, this week it's on course to slide 11%. And, while it's tended to gain 3% in week 52, in five of the past six years the BTC price has dropped. So there's not much hope this time around either.  The exact timing for what's considered a Santa rally varies, but it's clearly as December nears January and perhaps a few days either side.  The trend extends to the whole quarter too. The fourth quarter tends to be one of bitcoin's strongest, but this year it's underperforming.  Since 2013, the BTC price has risen an average of 85% in the last three months of the year, Coinglass data show. In 2024, it's less than 50%.  This current drawdown is reminiscent of the start of 2021, admittedly a bit later than Santa would be popping down the chimney.   On Jan. 8, 2021, bitcoin was around $40,000. By Jan. 27, the price had dropped to $30,000, a 25% slide and somewhat larger than this current 15% drawdown.   However, that drawdown was in the middle of a bull run that started from around $10,000 in December 2020 and ended in November 2021 at $70,000. The similarities are that the realized price, the average on-chain cost for all tokens in circulation, continues to drive higher, meaning investors, on average, are buying coins at higher prices.   Meanwhile, the price stays ahead of the short-term holder's realized price, reflecting the average on-chain acquisition price for coins that were moved within the last 155 days.  From December 2020 to April 2021, bitcoin stayed above the short-term holder's realized price (STH RP) and used this level as support; typically, in bull markets, bitcoin uses this price level as support. The current STH RP is $84,000, which would suggest the bull market is still intact as long as bitcoin stays above this key level.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/what-happened-to-bitcoins-santa-rally,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9d653d13073af7f54dbda2d28f8635c886337f7-1912x1075.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Nvidia’s August stock collapse painted a grim picture, even though it came on the heels of a blockbuster earnings report. CEO Jensen Huang mentioned a small production glitch with Nvidia’s new chip. It was resolved quickly, but the damage was done. Shares tanked in minutes, only to recover when investors realized they had overreacted. The sentiment isn’t isolated. Top voices in AI have been sending subtle warnings. Google’s Sundar Pichai, speaking to the New York Times , said the easiest wins in AI are behind us. “As we go to this next level, you need more insightful breakthroughs,” he explained. OpenAI’s Sam Altman was even gloomier, saying artificial general intelligence may not matter as much as people once believed. Behind closed doors, insiders whisper that OpenAI is struggling to deliver the revolutionary advancements it promised. Its latest model releases have felt more iterative than transformative, and the “wow” factor of tools like ChatGPT seems to be wearing off. Nvidia and OpenAI struggle to sustain AI’s momentum Nvidia has been the poster child for AI optimism. The company’s chips are the backbone of most machine-learning operations, and its financial performance proves that dominance. Then there’s OpenAI, backed heavily by Microsoft. Its Sora video generation model—touted as revolutionary—has been described by some as an expensive parlor trick. Also, Ilya Sutskever, a former OpenAI engineer, recently left to start his own AI company. Before leaving, he said, “We have but one internet,” a nod to the industry’s growing data problem. Companies are running out of new material to train their models, and creators are now demanding compensation for their content. This scarcity is putting AI’s future in jeopardy. Feeding larger models with data costs a fortune, and the returns are shrinking. For every new capability added, companies spend millions. But many of these advancements are failing to resonate with users Even Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, seems to be hedging his bets. In June, he admitted that Apple’s AI would “never” be 100% free of hallucinations. It was a rare moment of honesty but also a blow to the company’s image. The holiday sales quarter may provide some clarity, but so far, AI hasn’t been a game-changer for Apple. Wall Street braces for turbulence Wall Street is already jittery though. The Federal Reserve’s recent decision to slow down rate cuts tumbled the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,100 points in a single day, marking its worst losing streak since the 1970s. Futures tied to the Dow dropped another 143 points, or 0.3%, on Friday, while S&P 500 futures shed 0.5%. Nasdaq futures fell 0.9%. This turbulence is also about unmet expectations. Analysts predict meaningful AI software revenue won’t materialize until 2026. That’s a long time for investors to wait, especially after the explosive growth of AI hardware sales in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, Bitcoin took a beating, dropping over 9% to fall below $93,000. This was a sharp reversal after hitting an all-time high of $108,000 earlier in the week. Companies tied to crypto, like Coinbase and MicroStrategy, also saw their shares slide, with losses exceeding 5%. Robinhood wasn’t spared, shedding 6%. The market’s fear gauge (the VIX) spiked again, rising 9% on Friday to hit 26.16. Earlier in the week, it saw its second-largest jump in history, soaring 74% in a single day.

Gert van Lagen, a Dutch technical analyst, noted this while discussing XRP's price movements on the weekly chart. He argued that the current XRP price retracement could be a necessary retest, setting the stage for an explosive run that could surpass $100. XRP Historical Double Bottom StructureHis weekly chart highlights XRP's historical patterns, with a focus on its first cycle. For context, during this period, XRP formed a similar double-bottom structure. After achieving an all-time high of $0.0614 in December 2013, XRP collapsed. This slump led to the first bottom at $0.00281 in July 2014. Despite a recovery to $0.028 in December 2014, XRP failed to break its 2013 ATH. This resistance triggered another collapse, reaching a second bottom at $0.003 in January 2017. XRP 1W Chart | Gert van Lagen However, in an interesting turn, a breakout from the double bottom led to a more substantial uptrend. After breaking above this double-bottom pattern in March 2017 and retracing to retest the breakout, XRP experienced a parabolic surge, reaching a new ATH of $3.31 by January 2018.XRP Forms Similar Double-BottomFast forward to the current cycle, XRP's price movements are similar to the previous behavior. After reaching its ATH of $3.31 in January 2018, XRP entered a prolonged bearish phase, which led to the formation of a second double-bottom structure.The asset found its first bottom at $0.1140 in March 2020 before rebounding to $ 1.96 in April 2021 . However, this recovery fell short of reclaiming the $3.31 ATH. A subsequent collapse brought XRP to its second bottom at $0.2870 in June 2022, following the market-wide turmoil triggered by Terra's downfall.This double-bottom setup is again signaling the possibility of a massive bullish breakout. November 2024 marked a crucial turning point, as XRP rallied by 283%, echoing a similar 284% surge from March 2017. Van Lagen believes this rally confirmed the double-bottom breakout. A Healthy RetestHowever, XRP has since retraced to $2.2 amid a broader market pullback. Van Lagen asserts that this pullback is a healthy retest of the breakout zone. Notably, such retests are essential for establishing strong support levels.Van Lagen predicts that if XRP replicates the previous run, it could surpass $100 this cycle. Specifically, data from his chart shows a likely rally to $150, marking an upsurge of 6,718% from the current $2.2 price. For context, XRP rallied 12,592% to $3.31 after a similar retest in 2017.Interestingly, EGRAG, another prominent market analyst, confirmed the bullish outlook. He noted that he and other confident market watchers have faced ridicule for projecting rallies to double-digit prices. However, market veterans are now expecting XRP to hit a triple-digit price.https://twitter.com/egragcrypto/status/1869795694825075120For context, EGRAG has always been confident that XRP could reach $27. Most recently, he identified an XRP profit-taking zone between $4.42 and $27.86, based on Fibonacci extensions. He also recently introduced the ""Bifrost Bridge"" framework, which suggests XRP could reach $6 by December 2024 and $27 by January 2025.",POSITIVE,XRP,MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/20/market-veteran-eyes-xrp-push-to-three-digit-figure-says-recent-drop-merely-a-retest-of-double-bottom-breakout/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-veteran-eyes-xrp-push-to-three-digit-figure-says-recent-drop-merely-a-retest-of-double-bottom-breakout,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37884863,https://blockworks.co/news/analyst-market-commentary-2025,1734704208,What analysts say about the market next year,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . If we’re trying to celebrate Christmas, then we need to bring out some green to even out the red this morning. Kraken’s Thomas Perfumo already warned us last week that we could see some pullbacks ahead of the holidays, and that seems to be ringing true right now. Whether or not we see the selling countered is another story. But I’m not actually here to talk about markets. Or, I should say, I’m not talking about what the markets are doing today. Keep this chart in mind if you’re obsessively watching bitcoin’s price right now. Source: Coinbase Institutional Earlier this week, Coinbase Institutional released its market outlook for next year. David Duong, head of research, pointed out in the note that the 2024 uptrend has shown some “stark” differences to previous cycles, but the overall landscape looks “promising” still. VanEck, in its predictions, otherwise said it believes that the bull market’s going to carry on next year, peaking at around $180,000. After that, they expect a 30% retracement from bitcoin and altcoins could see double that. “A recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year,” VanEck wrote. But even if we see a decline, Coinbase Institutional came off pretty bullish in their note. “As the regulatory and technological landscapes evolve, we expect to see substantial growth in the crypto ecosystem as wider adoption drives the industry closer to achieving its full potential. This will be a pivotal year. The breakthroughs and advancements of 2025 may very well help shape the long-term trajectory of the crypto industry for decades to come,” Duong wrote. Let’s zoom in on a question I’ve asked a number of people now: Can ETH make a comeback next year ? ETH’s just been lagging behind, watching from the sidelines as both bitcoin and solana carve out new all-time highs. In the long-term, Duong and his team think that the growth of the Ethereum L2 ecosystem is a “boon,” but it’s not clear right now if that’s going to be enough to aid ETH in the short to medium term. 21Shares, in their predictions report, thinks that Solana is going to continue to eat Ethereum’s lunch. “While we don’t anticipate a full ‘flippening,’ Solana is primed to outperform and capture more market share from Ethereum through improved UX and infrastructure,” 21Shares analysts wrote. They also think that Ethereum is primed for a “revenue renaissance” beginning next year. “Web2 firms like Robinhood and PayPal, along with traditional finance entities like Visa, are likely to launch their own L2s, leveraging cost-efficiency and scalability to unlock new revenue streams and serve a growing demand for decentralized applications,” they said.

37884470,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631056,1734703984,German watchdog goes after Sam Altman’s Worldcoin over biometric data practices,"Worldcoin, a digital identity project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is under regulatory scrutiny in Germany for its handling of biometric data. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) has concluded its investigation into the project, demanding compliance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). BayLDA’s investigation, initiated in 2023, centered on Worldcoin’s flagship technology, World ID. The company’s tech uses iris biometrics to verify digital identity. The process involves scanning individuals’ eyes with devices called “Orbs” to generate unique digital identifiers, intended to distinguish real users from bots. Data protection concerns In its findings, BayLDA highlighted significant risks associated with collecting and processing sensitive biometric data. Early phases of Worldcoin’s data practices were flagged as non-compliant, particularly the storage of iris codes in centralized databases without sufficient legal basis. The regulator ordered the deletion of all improperly collected data and mandated that Worldcoin implement a GDPR-compliant data deletion procedure within one month of the ruling’s effective date. Michael Will, President of BayLDA, emphasized the importance of protecting users’ rights. “ With today’s decision, we are enforcing European fundamental rights standards in favor of the data subjects in a technologically demanding and legally highly complex case, ” he said. The ruling also ensures users can exercise their right to the erasure of iris data provided to Worldcoin. Worldcoin seeks to clarify issues with BayLDA Worldcoin has appealed the decision, seeking judicial clarity on whether its Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) satisfy the EU’s legal definition of anonymization. The company argues that the current GDPR framework lacks a clear definition, which hinders efforts to protect personal data in the age of artificial intelligence. “ GDPR currently does not provide this, and both World Foundation and World contributor Tools for Humanity (TFH) believe it is essential for this issue to be addressed quickly ,” the World Foundation stated in a blog post . Damien Kieran, TFH’s chief legal and privacy officer, highlighted the critical role of anonymization in preserving privacy. “Without a clear definition around anonymization, we lose perhaps our most powerful tool in the fight to protect privacy in the age of AI,” he said. World Foundation data privacy compliance efforts In response to regulatory concerns from several authorities, Worldcoin voluntarily suspended some of its operations across EU countries during the investigation. It also introduced updates to improve compliance, including cryptographic protocols that split iris codes into encrypted fragments to enhance privacy. Despite these measures, BayLDA determined that additional adjustments were required. The regulator emphasized the need for explicit user consent at specific stages of data processing and raised questions about the adequacy of Worldcoin’s anonymization methods. Worldcoin launched in July 2023 under Tools for Humanity, positioning itself as a solution to verify human identity in a digital landscape increasingly populated by bots and AI. However, its reliance on biometric data has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates and regulators alike. By May 2024, Worldcoin had already shut down its previous system and deleted stored data, signaling its intent to align more closely with GDPR requirements. In October, the company rebranded itself as “World” and introduced an upgraded version of its iris-scanning device, the “Orb,” as part of its efforts to address regulatory and public scrutiny. The World Foundation reiterated its commitment to working with EU regulators to resolve outstanding issues. “ The World Foundation and TFH will continue to work closely with regulators in the EU and elsewhere to ensure this important question is answered in a way that supports protecting privacy and innovation ,” it stated. Several countries, including Kenya and Portugal, have imposed temporary bans on the project, citing privacy concerns.

37884182,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99189,1734703705,Analysts Agree Ripple’s XRP Could Reach $10 This Cycle If These Conditions Are Met,"XRP saw a sharp decline on Friday, mirroring a volatile week for the cryptocurrency market, which experienced a notable 11.68% drop in total market capitalization, falling to $3.14 trillion over the past 24 hours. XRP alone relinquished nearly 20% of its recent gains in this timeframe. Notably, the drop was attributed to a combination of typical on-chain profit-taking and reports that U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated the agency has no interest in creating a national Bitcoin reserve, sending Bitcoin’s price as low as $92,000 at the time of writing. Despite this setback, analysts remain increasingly optimistic about XRP’s future trajectory, with some seeing the current dip as another rare “buy the dip” opportunity. In a Thursday tweet, popular Gert Van Lagen highlighted a potential double-bottom breakout for XRP, predicting the cryptocurrency could surge to $10 in the ongoing market cycle. Notably, his optimism is largely driven by a “double bottom” formation, a pattern that has historically preceded substantial price rallies for XRP. Supporting his analysis, the pundit pointed to the periods between 2014 and 2017 when XRP’s price surged by an astounding 25,000% in just five months after printing the pattern. At the time, XRP had traded as low as $0.006 in April 2017 before peaking at around $1.50 by December. In the current market, Van Lagen pointed out that XRP has formed a similar double-bottom pattern between March 2020 and August 2022, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be poised for another major bull run . Legan’s analysis was supported by Egrag Crypto, another analyst who predicts that XRP could reach triple digits by the end of this cycle, clapping back at critics. “They used to call us crazy for saying double digits for XRP, now they are charting XRP for 3 digits. Trust the process,” he stated confidently. Egrag also downplayed the recent price drops, calling them “just noise” and emphasizing that such fluctuations are typical for XRP within its current macro range. He pointed out that XRP is retesting a crucial low of $1.90 from December 10th, which could complete the double-bottom formation and set the stage for a potential rebound. Egrag reassured that even if XRP temporarily falls below this level, it should not be considered a major concern. Notably, in an analysis shared on Thursday, the pundit had examined XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating that the cryptocurrency could hit new highs by mid-2025. He also observed that XRP’s price behavior mirrors previous cycles, with a possible second peak in either March or July 2025 at around $90. However, according to Egrag, a critical point is that the RSI must remain above 77 in the two-week timeframe, as this would signal strong momentum heading into the next market phase.

She Listed Her Reasons!

Cathie Wood Reaffirms Her $1 Million Bitcoin Prediction by 2030 In a report published by Bloomberg, Wood emphasized that Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins gives it an advantage over gold as a store of value. When the price of gold rises, he noted, mining companies typically increase production, increasing supply and potentially reducing price momentum. In contrast, Bitcoin's supply is limited by its underlying code, making it immune to such supply fluctuations. “Bitcoin’s scarcity is intrinsic and mathematical, and provides a level of certainty that gold cannot match,” Wood said. This forecast is in line with ARK Invest’s bullish stance on digital assets, supported by increasing institutional adoption and the perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. While some analysts have been skeptical of such a high price target, Wood has consistently defended his view by emphasizing Bitcoin’s resilience and ability to disrupt traditional financial systems. *This is not investment advice.

Accordingly, personal consumption expenditures data for November were as follows: Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (YoY) Announced 2.8% – Expected 2.9% – Previous 2.8% Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (Monthly) Announced 0.1%– Expected 0.2% – Previous 0.3% Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (Annual) Announced 2.4% – Expected 2.5% – Previous 2.3% Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (Monthly) Announced 0.1% – Expected 0.2% – Previous 0.2% Bitcoin is on the rise!

37883998,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665553,1734703259,Is The Bitcoin Top In For This Cycle? On-Chain Signals You Need To Know,"Bitcoin’s price retracement from its new all-time high of $108,353 on Tuesday to around $96,000 (a -11.5% pullback) has ignited intense speculation about whether the current bull cycle is nearing its peak. To address growing uncertainty, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, co-founder of on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, released a thread on X detailing 18 on-chain metrics and models. “Where is the Bitcoin TOP?” Schultze-Kraft asked, before laying out his detailed analysis. Has Bitcoin Reached Its Cycle Top? 1/ MVRV Ratio: A longstanding measure of unrealized profitability, the MVRV ratio compares market value to realized value. Historically, readings above 7 signaled overheated conditions. “Currently hovering around 3 – room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft noted. This suggests that, in terms of aggregate unrealized profit, the market is not yet at levels that have previously coincided with macro tops. 2/ MVRV Pricing Bands: These bands are derived from the number of days MVRV has spent at extreme levels. The top band (3.2) has been exceeded for only about 6% of trading days historically. Today, this top band corresponds to a price of $127,000. Given that Bitcoin sits at around $98,000, the market has not yet reached a zone that historically marked top formations. 3/ Long-Term Holder Profitability (Relative Unrealized Profit & LTH-NUPL): Long-term holders (LTHs) are considered more stable market participants. Their Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric is currently at 0.75, entering what Schultze-Kraft terms the “euphoria zone.” He remarked that in the 2021 cycle, Bitcoin ran another ~3x after hitting similar levels (though he clarified he is not necessarily expecting a repetition). Historical top formations often saw LTH-NUPL readings above 0.9. Thus, while the metric is elevated, it has not yet reached previous cycle extremes. Notably, Schultze-Kraft admitted his observations may be conservative because the 2021 cycle peaked at somewhat lower profitability values than prior cycles. “I would’ve expected these profitability metrics to reach slightly higher levels,” he explained. This may signal diminishing peaks over successive cycles. Investors should be aware that historical extremes may become less pronounced over time. 4/ Yearly Realized Profit/Loss Ratio: This metric measures the total realized profits relative to realized losses over the past year. Previous cycle tops have seen values above 700%. Currently at around 580%, it still shows “room to grow” before reaching levels historically associated with market tops. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashes: Here’s Where The Nearest On-Chain Support Is 5/ Market Cap To Thermocap Ratio: An early on-chain metric, it compares Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to the cumulative mining cost (Thermocap). In prior bull runs, the ratio’s extremes aligned with market tops. Schultze-Kraft advises caution with specific target ranges but notes that current levels are not close to previous extremes. The market remains below historical thermocap multiples that indicated overheated conditions in the past. 6/ Thermocap Multiples (32-64x): Historically, Bitcoin has topped at roughly 32-64 times the Thermocap. “We’re at the bottom of this range,” said Schultze-Kraft. Hitting the top band in today’s environment would imply a Bitcoin market cap just above $4 trillion. Given that current market capitalization ($1.924 trillion) is significantly lower, this suggests the possibility of substantial upside if historical patterns were to hold. 7/ The Investor Tool (2-Year SMA x5): The Investor Tool applies a 2-year Simple Moving Average (SMA) of price and a 5x multiple of that SMA to signal potential top zones. “Which currently denotes $230,000,” Schultze-Kraft noted. Since Bitcoin’s current price is well beneath this level, the indicator has not yet flashed an unequivocal top signal. 8/ Bitcoin Price Temperature (BPT6): This model uses deviations from a 4-year moving average to capture cyclical price extremes. Historically, BPT6 was reached in previous bull markets, and that band now sits at $151,000. With Bitcoin at $98,000, the market is still short of levels previously associated with peak overheating. 9/ The True Market Mean & AVIV: The True Market Mean is an alternative cost basis model. Its MVRV-equivalent, known as AVIV, measures how far the market strays from this mean. Historically, tops have seen more than 3 standard deviations. Today’s equivalent “amounts to values above ~2.3,” while the current reading is 1.7. “Room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft said, implying that by this metric, the market is not yet stretched to its historical extremes. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Push Price To $500,000: Expert 10/ Low/Mid/Top Cap Models (Delta Cap Derivatives): These models, based on the Delta Cap metric, historically showed diminished values during the 2021 cycle, never reaching the ‘Top Cap.’ Schultze-Kraft urges caution in interpreting these due to evolving market structures. Currently, the mid cap level sits at about $4 trillion, roughly a 2x from current levels. If the market followed previous patterns, this would allow for considerable growth before hitting levels characteristic of earlier tops. 11/ Value Days Destroyed Multiple (VDDM): This metric gauges the spending behavior of long-held coins relative to the annual average. Historically, extreme values above 2.9 indicated that older coins were heavily hitting the market, often during late-stage bull markets. Presently, it’s at 2.2, not yet at extreme levels. “Room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft noted, suggesting not all long-term holders have fully capitulated to profit-taking. 12/ The Mayer Multiple: The Mayer Multiple compares price to the 200-day SMA. Overbought conditions in previous cycles aligned with values above 2.4. Currently, a Mayer Multiple above 2.4 would correspond to a price of approximately $167,000. With Bitcoin under $100,000, this threshold remains distant. 13/ The Cycle Extremes Oscillator Chart: This composite uses multiple binary indicators (MVRV, aSOPR, Puell Multiple, Reserve Risk) to signal cycle extremes. “Currently 2/4 are on,” meaning only half of the tracked conditions for an overheated market are met. Previous tops aligned with a full suite of triggered signals. As such, the chart suggests the cycle has not yet reached the intensity of a full-blown peak. 14/ Pi Cycle Top Indicator: A price-based signal that has historically identified cycle peaks by comparing the short-term and long-term moving averages. “Currently the short moving average sits well below the larger ($74k vs. $129k),” Schultze-Kraft said, indicating no crossover and thus no classic top signal. 15/ Sell-Side Risk Ratio (LTH Version): This ratio compares total realized profits and losses to the realized market capitalization. High values correlate with volatile, late-stage bull markets. “The interesting zone is at 0.8% and above, while we’re currently at 0.46% – room to grow,” Schultze-Kraft explained. This implies that, despite recent profit-taking, the market has not yet entered the intense sell pressure zone often seen near tops. 16/ LTH Inflation Rate: Schultze-Kraft highlighted the Long-Term Holder Inflation Rate as “the most bearish chart I’ve come across so far.” While he did not provide specific target values or thresholds in this excerpt, he stated it “screams caution.” Investors should monitor this closely as it may signal increasing distribution from long-term holders or other structural headwinds. 17/ STH-SOPR (Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio): This metric measures the profit-taking behavior of short-term holders. “Currently elevated, but not sustained,” Schultze-Kraft noted. In other words, while short-term participants are taking profits, the data does not yet show the kind of persistent, aggressive profit-taking typical of a market top. 18/ SLRV Ribbons: These ribbons track trends in short- and long-term realized value. Historically, when both moving averages top out and cross over, it indicates a market turning point. “Both moving averages still trending up, only becomes bearish at rounded tops and crossover. No indication of a top at this time,” Schultze-Kraft stated. Overall, Schultze-Kraft emphasized that these metrics should not be used in isolation. “Never rely on single data points – confluence is your friend,” he advised. He acknowledged that this is a non-comprehensive list and that Bitcoin’s evolving ecosystem—now with ETFs, regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, and geopolitical factors—may render historical comparisons less reliable. “This cycle can look vastly different, yet (historical) data is all we have,” he concluded. While numerous metrics show that Bitcoin’s market is moving into more euphoric and profitable territory, few have reached the historical extremes that marked previous cycle tops. Indicators like MVRV, profitability ratios, thermal metrics, and various price-based models generally suggest “room to grow,” although at least one—LTH Inflation Rate—raises a note of caution. Some composites are only partially triggered, while classic top signals such as Pi Cycle Top remain inactive. At press time, BTC traded at $96,037.

37884686,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52639,1734703254,"BONK Projected New ATH in 2025, WIF and 1Fuel Set To Continue The Altcoin Season Rally","The cryptocurrency rise that has been going on since November seems to be a precursor to a more significant altcoin season in 2025. BONK , WIF , and 1Fuel—a much-anticipated newcomer—are set to be the best cryptocurrencies to lead the charge in the altcoin season rally. 1Fuel is currently in its second stage presale and is offering early investors tokens as low as $0.012. Considering the presale momentum, analysts predict up to 500% gains in presale stages and 100x on modest investments following launch. BONK eyes new all-time high In November, BONK reached an all-time high of $0.00005825 when it surged 16% in 24 hours. Technical analysis indicates that BONK is undervalued by its competitors. BONK has broken out from consolidation, indicating future growth. Many experts predict that the entire cryptocurrency sector will see a time of prosperity following Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Recently, 100 billion BONK tokens were burned from the circulating supply by BonkDAO, a decentralized organization of BONK believers that manages the currency. The organization plans to burn a trillion BONK tokens in December, which might raise the token’s value because of scarcity. WIF poised for continued growth Dogwifhat is one of the best cryptocurrencies earmarked to define the market trend in 2025. WIF recorded an all-time high of $4.63 in March 2024. Although WIF currently trades at about two-thirds of the all-time high figure, given WIF ‘s recent rally back to $3.9 in the past fortnight, market analysts are wondering if WIF can grow by 100%. Meme coins have shown that they can be a major player in the market, despite the lack of utilities. WIF ‘s rise to 100% may rely on its capacity to maintain bullish momentum, boost its robust market interest, and capitalize on the favorable feeling around Solana’s market performance. 1Fuel: The next breakout cryptocurrency? 1Fuel , backed by the 1Fuel token, isn’t your average cryptocurrency platform. 1Fuel’s goal is to give users the easiest, safest, and most effective way to manage their digital assets.

While chaos unfolded for the leading cryptocurrency, an unexpected star emerged. DOGEN, a lesser-known digital asset, surged by an astonishing 50,000%, leaving traders and analysts scrambling to understand the unprecedented events. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win . HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point . Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop ! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Bitcoin: A Decentralized Digital Currency with Capped Supply Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency, created to enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. It operates on blockchain technology, which ensures transparency and security. Transactions are verified by miners who receive bitcoin as a reward, though this reward decreases after each halving. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it scarce. Its decentralized nature eliminates the need for central authorities like banks, aiming to provide financial freedom. Whether it is attractive in the current market depends on adoption trends, market sentiment, and technological development. Many view it as a digital store of value, while others focus on its potential to improve global financial systems. Conclusion BTC shows limited short-term growth potential despite the ongoing bull run. DOGEN stands out as the ultimate token for high achievers, symbolizing ambition and luxury. With 700% growth expected during presale and the chance for massive returns, it mirrors the success of BONK and WIF, while uniting a powerful community of market leaders.

37884180,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99187,1734703234,Peter Schiff Predicts “Car Crash” for Cardano (ADA) Price as Strong Bearish Pattern Emerges,"Veteran economist and trader Peter Schiff has issued a stark warning for Cardano (ADA), predicting a “car crash” for the cryptocurrency as a strong bearish technical pattern emerges. Schiff’s cautionary outlook comes amid a broader slump in the cryptocurrency market, with ADA losing around 27% of its value in the past week alone. Notably, the token’s recent decline follows its inability to sustain the $1.33 level, which ADA briefly surpassed last month. After multiple failed attempts to break through this resistance, the asset has entered a steep downward trajectory. In a tweet on Thursday, Schiff pointed to an “inverted head and shoulders” pattern forming on both the daily and four-hour ADA charts. This technical setup is commonly linked to bearish price movements, meaning that if the cryptocurrency falls below the neckline of this pattern, it could plummet by roughly 45% to the $0.50 price range. Schiff’s analysis has sparked controversy within the ADA community, with some critics pointing out that his past bearish predictions for the asset have been proven wrong, as ADA has previously surged in value despite similar forecasts. Notably, in April this year when Brandt, predicted a downturn for ADA, only for the token to defy expectations with a 130% price surge. Despite ADA’s recent struggles, supporters remain optimistic. Analysts like Taki, founder of crypto analysis platform “InvestingHaven” have pointed to key Fibonacci levels that could influence ADA’s future price movement. According to Taki, if ADA can hold support at the $0.824 level, the cryptocurrency could experience a bullish resurgence in 2025, with potential price targets ranging from $0.83 to $2.55. Elsewhere, some analysts are closely monitoring ADA’s historical trends. Analyst Gert Van Lagen recently tweeted that ADA’s current price movements mirror the Elliott Wave patterns seen in September 2020. This pattern preceded ADA’s price retesting of $0.80, which led to an extraordinary 1,350% surge by early 2021. According to the pundit, if this pattern repeats, conservative extension targets range from $5 to $30, with the potential for ADA to surge beyond $700 in the long term. Looking beyond the technical aspects, the year 2025 holds significant potential for shaping the broader Cardano ecosystem. In addition to the growing momentum from major development efforts aimed at fully decentralizing the network, the introduction of privacy-focused tools like Midnights and integrations with additional blockchain networks are set to attract more users to ADA. This week, WallStreetBets founder Jaime Rogozinski also shared bold predictions for 2025, highlighting ADA’s potential to become the official cryptocurrency for lobbying. This suggests that if ADA gains influence in political and regulatory circles, it could help foster more favorable policies for blockchain adoption. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.85, reflecting a 10.27% drop in the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-predicts-car-crash-for-cardano-ada-price-as-strong-bearish-pattern-emerges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37883956,https://crypto.news/?p=14321058,1734703233,This Shiba Inu alternative could 20x and turn $500 into $10000 in 2025,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as a credible alternative to Shiba Inu, combining real-world applications and smart solutions with a predicted 20x growth. Table of Contents What is Rexas Finance? Why analysts are bullish on RXS How RXS stands out from Shiba Inu Conclusion Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been a favorite to many meme coin lovers, but there is a new contender that analysts are supporting, predicting a potential 20x increase by early 2025. This contender is Rexas Finance (RXS), a project that aims to solve everyday problems with smart solutions. With such a position, they aim to be a credible competitor against known tokens such as SHIB. What is Rexas Finance? The cryptocurrency Rexas Finance is gaining prominence in the crypto industry due to the projects it has focused on. Rexas Finance has become a lot more relevant in the web3 world. The sale of tangible items or real-world assets as tokens explains this for Rexas Finance. Their website intends to alter the sale of things and property by bringing them closer to a central web3 system. Rexas Finance specializes in bridging that gap, and because of this, it attracts both professional and retail investors. What sets Rexas Finance apart is its wealth of polygons Defi tools, which users can use to interact without friction. The polygon ecosystem offers tools such as the Rexas Token Builder, which allows users to build custom tokens, and Rexas GenAI, an NFT creation platform created by Artificial Intelligence. These new solutions make Rexas Finance an easy option for companies and individuals who want to access or utilize blockchain technology. The smart contracts, posted on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko platforms and are Certik audited, made Rexas Finance more credible. These partnerships reinforce the commitment of the project to enhance security and ensure transparency, which are crucial in fostering investor confidence. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Why analysts are bullish on RXS Rexas Finance is now in the 10th stage of presale, and the token price is $0.15, very close to $0.175, the price target for the next stage. As of writing, 91.31% of the presale has been completed, fetching $28 million from the set goal of $33 million. Of the total allocation of 380 million tokens, 346 million have been sold, demonstrating high demand from investors. Although SHIB has grown reasonably well, its market capitalization and price are highly influenced by the popularity of certain social media accounts and whale manipulation. RXS, on the other hand, is setting up for long-term growth with many features and future collaborations. At the expected listing price of $0.20, RXS makes sense as a great opportunity for almost any investor looking for high returns. Moreover, Rexas Finance also has the advantage of doing Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, a relatively new and growing market segment. Rexas Finance is a project that enables the tokenization of physical real estate, which allows investors to penetrate previously inaccessible markets. This kind of utility distinguishes it from many meme coins, which have scarcely any utility cases. Other interesting project features include Rexas Launchpad for blockchain startups and Rexas Treasury for multi-chain yield optimization. Thanks to these tools, the project’s ecosystem is sufficiently broadened, and users are supplied with various ways to harness value. According to analysts, these factors and a strong community-driven strategy will allow RXS to experience considerable expansion in the next several years. How RXS stands out from Shiba Inu With the help of memes, Shiba Inu has won many people’s hearts. But the flip side to this is that it heavily relies on hype and does not serve much purpose, which raises the question, how long will it last? However, Rexas Finance, on the other hand, is an entirely different model that offers practical applications and a strong framework developed to provide value. RXS does not compete with SHIB, a dog meme coin. Instead, it seeks to solve real-world problems. Its application in tokenizing assets makes it possible to sell them to non-crypto investors, a market with much more potential. Furthermore, no technical knowledge is required when using Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, which makes participating in the blockchain economy easier. Security and reliability are also key features for Rexas Finance , as one can notice even from their CertiK audit and clear tokenomics. With 42.5% of tokens distributed during the presale, staking, liquidity, and development funding, RXS shows that it has a clear roadmap and wishes to grow sustainably. Meme coins are often criticized for their lack of clarity and vision for the future; Rexas, on the other hand, does not have these issues. Conclusion Rexas Finance represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market, blending innovation, real-world applications, and significant growth potential. With its presale nearing completion, RXS has already proven its appeal to investors. Analysts agree that utility-driven growth and early-stage pricing could drive a 20x surge by early 2025, turning a modest $500 investment into $10,000.

37883967,https://coinpaper.com/6662/ethereum-validators-push-for-higher-gas-limits-amid-rising-support,1734703200,Ethereum Validators Push for Higher Gas Limits Amid Rising Support,"Institutional interest in Ethereum is on the rise, as developments in the network's gas limit signaling and the performance of Ethereum ETFs point to growing confidence in the blockchain's long-term potential. While validators rally to increase the gas limit to improve transaction efficiency, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has emerged as a market leader, recording impressive inflows despite broader market volatility. Ethereum Validators Signal Increased Support for Raising Network Gas Limits The Ethereum network is witnessing a significant shift in sentiment among its validators as efforts to increase the network’s gas limit gain traction. As of Dec. 19, the percentage of Ethereum validators signaling support for raising the gas limit beyond 30 million has surged to 10%, marking a notable rise from just over 1% in previous months. This momentum reflects a growing community push to address high transaction fees and enhance the usability of the Ethereum blockchain. The recent uptick in validator support is largely attributed to coordinated advocacy efforts from Ethereum developers, researchers, and community members. The push to increase the gas limit to 36 million, or even higher, has been met with enthusiasm by many in the ecosystem who see the adjustment as a way to reduce transaction fees on Ethereum’s layer-1. Central to this campaign is the website “Pump The Gas,” launched by core Ethereum developer Eric Connor and former MakerDAO head of smart contracts Mariano Conti in March 2024. The platform urges the Ethereum community to rally around a gas limit increase to 40 million, arguing that such a change could reduce layer-1 transaction fees by 15% to 33%. Support for the initiative has grown among prominent Ethereum researchers and developers. On Dec. 9, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake reconfigured his validator to signal a 36 million gas limit, stating that a 20% increase “safely greases the wheels” for the network. Developers like Emmanuel Awosika of 2077 Collective have also highlighted the importance of raising gas limits to foster innovation. Awosika emphasized that applications with viral potential can cause gas prices to spike under the current limit, leading to a degraded user experience. For developers, this poses a significant barrier to creating scalable and widely used decentralized applications (dApps). Balancing Opportunities with Risks While the potential benefits of increasing the gas limit are evident, the community is not blind to the risks. Critics, including Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter, caution that raising the gas limit too quickly could jeopardize the network’s stability and decentralization. High gas limits increase the computational and storage demands on nodes, which could discourage solo operators from participating in the network. This could lead to centralization risks, as fewer nodes might control the network over time. The “Pump The Gas” initiative acknowledges these concerns, stating: “If the gas limit is raised too high, we could create a scenario where the chain becomes too large for solo node operators to validate and download. Technology improves, however, and it does make sense to slowly increase it as time goes on.” Additionally, raising the gas limit could lead to unforeseen externalities, including potential security vulnerabilities and congestion issues, which require careful analysis before implementation. The debate over Ethereum’s gas limit brings attention to the complex interplay between scalability, decentralization, and security. While the push to raise gas limits has garnered significant community support, achieving consensus will require addressing the concerns of validators, researchers, and developers alike. As more validators signal their support for higher gas limits, Ethereum’s path forward may involve incremental adjustments combined with technological innovations to mitigate risks. Initiatives like EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) and the eventual implementation of Ethereum 2.0’s roadmap are expected to complement these efforts by reducing layer-1 congestion and enhancing scalability. For now, the Ethereum community appears committed to exploring solutions that balance short-term needs with long-term goals. The rise in validator signaling reflects a network eager to evolve while preserving its core principles of decentralization and security. BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust Dominates with $3.446 Billion in Inflows Amid Market Volatility In other news, the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has set a new benchmark in the Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, recording a remarkable 14-day inflow streak. On Dec. 18, ETHA attracted an additional $81.9 million in investments, bringing its total inflows to an impressive $3.446 billion, according to data from Farside Investors . Since the approval of Ethereum ETF products by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BlackRock and Fidelity have emerged as the dominant players in the market. Initially, Fidelity's Ethereum ETF (FETH) appeared to lead in terms of inflows. However, BlackRock's ETHA has gained significant momentum in recent weeks, outperforming its rival both in consistency and value of inflows. Over the past two weeks, ETHA has consistently outshined FETH, with the latter breaking its inflow streak on Dec. 18. Fidelity's FETH currently stands at $1.386 billion in total inflows—less than half of BlackRock's ETHA. This shift highlights BlackRock’s ability to attract sustained corporate interest, even amid volatile market conditions. BlackRock’s leadership in the crypto ETF market is not new. The investment giant has historically outperformed its peers across various crypto ETF offerings, cementing its reputation as a reliable entry point for institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets. The growing inflows into Ethereum ETFs, particularly ETHA, signal a strong wave of institutional interest in Ethereum. This sustained capital flow is seen as a positive development for the Ethereum ecosystem, as it demonstrates increasing confidence in the blockchain’s potential as a robust investment vehicle. Institutional investments through ETFs provide a streamlined and regulated way for investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of managing digital wallets or private keys. As these inflows translate into Ethereum purchases, they could contribute to upward price pressure on ETH in the long term, potentially setting the stage for the much-anticipated ”altcoin season.” Ethereum Price Under Pressure Despite ETF Momentum Despite the bullish signals from ETF inflows, Ethereum’s price has faced downward pressure in recent weeks. Adding bearish pressure on the leading altcoin are remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who dismissed the possibility of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, leading to broader sell-offs across the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s price outlook. While ETF inflows have yet to stabilize the coin's value in the short term, Ethereum boasts strong fundamentals that could drive a recovery. These include its position as the leading smart contract platform, the ongoing adoption of Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dApps), and continued development efforts such as scalability improvements and ecosystem upgrades. The Ethereum ETF market’s growth demonstrates the asset’s increasing appeal to institutional investors. BlackRock’s ETHA has not only captured the lion’s share of inflows but also set the pace for the industry, providing a benchmark for other ETF providers. Looking ahead, the sustained interest in Ethereum ETFs could catalyze further adoption and investment. Analysts project a potential recovery in Ethereum’s price, driven by a combination of ETF inflows and broader market resilience. This optimism aligns with the belief that Ethereum’s ecosystem, bolstered by its diverse use cases and innovative development roadmap, will continue to attract both retail and institutional investors. As the market evolves, Ethereum remains well-positioned to benefit from the convergence of strong technical fundamentals and increasing institutional interest. Whether this translates into immediate price gains or sets the stage for long-term growth, Ethereum’s role in the cryptocurrency landscape remains undeniable.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6662/ethereum-validators-push-for-higher-gas-limits-amid-rising-support,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bonk saw a 14% uptick in its trading volume, while WIF slipped 20%; as 1FUEL gains momentum, experts expect it to outshine established players like Bonk and WIF.

Currently trading at just $0.012, 1FUEL ’s token presale has attracted significant attention from blockchain investment experts due to its explosive growth potential. The DeFi token 1FUEL is in a presale and has been the center of conversations as the best low-cap crypto to buy now. Yet, it promises to outdo the established players and shake up market expectations with big returns. As a utility token with high expectations of 500x returns, 1FUEL ’s presale offers an opportunity to get in early before it lists on major exchanges. Resilient Bonk sees 24-hour trading volume up 14% Indeed, one crypto is demonstrating resilience in the market. Bonk has now turned resistance into support. Bonk’s 24-hour trading volume has risen by 14% to $307.34 million, while it fell 13.15% in the last 30 days. Experts have described this surge in interest as remarkable as Bonk has been able to flip a key resistance level into support. Bonk peaked at an all-time high last month but was corrected massively because of profit-taking. Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has stabilized, and the previous resistance has become a support for a potential price recovery. This stability has directly benefited from the #LetsBONK campaign, which is now popular across the markets and is still affecting market dynamics. WIF slips 20% as market cap falls below $3 billion The price of DogWifHat slipped 20% in the last week, driving its market cap below the $3 billion threshold to $2.65 billion. The cryptocurrency hit its lowest point since mid-November, showing a steep decline indicative of strong bearish pressure. Currently, the fourth-largest meme coin by market cap, WIF is at risk of being overtaken by BONK as they are only under a $400m market cap difference apart. If this trend of underperformance persists, it won’t be long until WIF loses its place with BONK hot on its heels.

Analyst Sets Timeline For Cycle Top,"EGRAG Crypto, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a detailed analysis of XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) trends on Twitter, predicting a significant price cycle peak in either March or July 2025. His insights focus on historical RSI behavior, emphasizing key patterns that have occurred twice before in XRP’s market history. #XRP – I Cracked The Code (March or July 2025 Top): Listen carefully, and do not Ass-you-and-me (Assume)! This is post is based on historical RSI behavior. The Cracked Code: Two Peaks 1 & 2 Peak 1: The All-Time High (ATH) The first peak represents the ATH, the… pic.twitter.com/H75Um2SzXO — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 19, 2024 The Historical RSI Pattern: Two Peaks EGRAG identifies a recurring pattern of two RSI peaks that mark the conclusion of XRP’s bullish cycles. These peaks represent distinct phases of market momentum: Peak 1 – All-Time High (ATH): The first peak symbolizes ATH and indicates a robust rally where market momentum reaches its peak. Historically, this peak has been followed by a correction, signaling the start of a transitional market phase. Peak 2 – Cycle Top: The second peak is shorter and less intense but remains significant. It marks the cycle’s conclusion and often signals the beginning of a bearish phase. EGRAG explains that these dual peaks have historically occurred in XRP’s RSI behavior. After the first peak, the RSI dips below the 14-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) before rallying to the second peak. Current RSI Insights and Projections According to EGRAG, XRP’s RSI on the two-week timeframe has already hit its first peak on December 2, 2024, surpassing the highs seen in 2021. Drawing from historical analogs, EGRAG concludes that the second RSI peak would occur in either March or July 2025. The analyst provides additional technical guidance, specifying a critical RSI level of 77 on the two-week chart. Maintaining this level is essential to confirm XRP’s bullish momentum. A breach below 77 could indicate a deviation from the expected pattern. Ultra-Bullish Scenario EGRAG outlines an ultra-bullish scenario for XRP . In this case, the RSI would bounce off the 77 level, confirming it as macro support. This could lead to a higher RSI peak than the one observed in December 2024, possibly surpassing the May 8, 2017 levels. If this scenario unfolds, it could signal a sustained rally for XRP , reinforcing its long-term bullish trend and surpassing historical milestones. Key Takeaways and Cautions Critical RSI Level: The 77 RSI level is a pivotal support zone. Traders and analysts should monitor this threshold closely to assess whether XRP maintains its bullish trajectory. Timeline for Second Peak: Based on historical data, March or July 2025 are the most likely periods for the second peak. Bear Market Signal: Following the second peak, historical patterns suggest the start of a bearish phase. EGRAG advises traders to prepare for potential market shifts post-2025.

37883919,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375581,1734703177,Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Could Slump to $1.4 if This Support Level Doesn’t Hold,"Ripple’s price was consolidating for the last few weeks, failing to create a new all-time high. This week was particularly eventful, though, as the asset first jumped above $2.7 before a market-wide crash took it south hard to just under $2. By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The USDT Paired Chart On the USDT pair, XRP has been rallying almost vertically for a few weeks. Yet, with the RSI demonstrating a clear overbought signal at the beginning of November, the market has failed to continue its upward trajectory, and it is now consolidating as it cools down. Nevertheless, the $2 support level remains intact even though it was tested earlier today and could push the price higher toward the $3 level again. On the other hand, if the $2 level is broken down decisively, a deeper correction toward the $1.4 level would be expected. The BTC Paired Chart The Bitcoin-paired chart demonstrates a similar price action, as the market has been breaking through several resistance levels in a significant run higher. Yet, the 2,800 SAT resistance zone has rejected the price lower, as the 2,200 SAT support area is now being tested. Meanwhile, the RSI is showing values above 50%, indicating that the momentum is still bullish, and a bullish continuation is more likely than a reversal at the moment. This scenario would fail if the 2,200 sat support level is broken to the downside, which would pave the way for the market to drop much lower toward the 1,600 SAT zone.

37883954,https://crypto.news/?p=14321049,1734703167,Dogecoin price is in a bear market: how low can DOGE fall?,"Dogecoin price has nosedived as a wave of selling intensified in the crypto industry following the highly hawkish Fed decision. Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has dropped for five consecutive days, reaching its lowest level since Nov. 11. It has plummeted by almost 45% from its monthly high, entering a deep bear market. Dogecoin’s crash is linked to rising fear in the crypto industry, leading to panic selling among investors. Crypto remains highly volatile, as most participants are retail investors with short investment horizons. DOGE’s decline suggests the coin has entered the markdown phase of the Wyckoff Method, following weeks in the distribution phase. Wyckoff’s framework identifies four phases assets undergo: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. You might also like: Bull flag confirmed for Solana; This new altcoin follows suit In Dogecoin’s case, the accumulation phase occurred between April and November, marked by limited price movement. The markup phase followed, driven by higher demand than supply, causing a parabolic rise. The distribution phase saw prices stabilize as smart investors exited. Now, in markdown, supply exceeds demand, leading to panic selling. Dogecoin’s drop is also influenced by skepticism about Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative. Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy aim to slash government spending by over $2 trillion through measures like mass layoffs. However, analysts argue such changes are feasible in the private sector but face significant regulatory and political resistance in government. Dogecoin price analysis: How low can DOGE fall? DOGE price chart | Source: crypto.news DOGE price peaked at $0.4853, a key level near the extreme overshoot of the Murrey Math lines tool. It has since dropped below the strong pivot release and the 50-day moving average. The accumulation/distribution indicator points downward, signaling ongoing distribution. The next critical level to monitor is $0.2293, which was the highest swing in March. This level also aligns with the horizontal line of the cup and handle pattern. A drop below $0.2293 could increase the likelihood of DOGE falling to the major support/resistance pivot at $0.1953, approximately 30% below the current price. Investors should be cautious of a dead cat bounce when considering buying the dip. A DCB occurs when an asset in a downtrend briefly rises before resuming its downward trajectory.

37883845,https://crypto.news/?p=14321066,1734703012,Bitcoin price has nosedived: 4 reasons it will recover and hit ATH,"Bitcoin price has nosedived and entered a technical correction a few days after it surged to a record high. Bitcoin ( BTC ), which started the week by surging to a record high of $108,250, has erased most of the gains made this month. It has dropped by 13% from the year-to-date high, entering a local correction. Here are four reasons Bitcoin prices are likely to bounce back and retest the all-time high. Bitcoin price corrections are not new The first main reason why the price of BTC will rebound is that the ongoing pullback, which we predicted , is not new. Bitcoin often retreats sharply after rising to a crucial resistance level. The long-term chart below shows that Bitcoin jumped to $19,778 in December 2017 and then reversed by 84%. It then dropped by 55% after hitting a high of $64,647 in April 2021. Most recently, Bitcoin peaked at $73,885 in March and then crashed by 33% through August. A strong rebound will likely follow this retreat because BTC still has strong fundamentals. Mining output has fallen since the last halving event, while the amount of Bitcoin in exchanges has continued to drop. Similarly, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $34 billion in assets, a trend that is expected to continue, especially from institutional investors. You might also like: 2 reasons why Bitcoin and other crypto just crashed Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin’s MVRV score is still low Another reason Bitcoin prices may rebound is that the popular market value to realized value score is still lower than during historical corrections. The MVRV-Z score is calculated by subtracting the realized market cap from the circulating market cap and then dividing it by the standard deviation. According to CoinGlass , Bitcoin’s MVRV score peaked at 2.89 earlier this week. Bitcoin had a score of 3.05 during the bear market in March this year. It also had a score of 3.21 in January 2022’s correction and 5.25 in March 2021. This suggests the coin has more upside potential once the panic selling subsides. Bitcoin MVRV score | Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin whale accumulation is going on large Bitcoin holders are still accumulating coins, and hopes of a strategic reserve are rising. MicroStrategy has added more BTC to its portfolio and now holds over 439,000 coins. Marathon Digital, the largest Bitcoin miner, holds over 44,300 coins, while Riot Platforms and Hut 8 Mining have also added thousands of coins. After observing MicroStrategy’s success, more companies are likely to purchase Bitcoins. Over the past four years, MicroStrategy has transformed from a fledgling technology company into an $80 billion firm. Additionally, discussions about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, especially by Donald Trump, have gained traction. In a recent note, Bitwise noted that more countries could follow suit as the U.S. public debt has surged to over $36.4 trillion.

The weekly chart shows that the coin formed a cup pattern between 2021 and March this year. It then formed a handle between March and October, followed by a strong comeback. Bitcoin has rallied in most weeks since then, and it is often normal for an asset in an uptrend to pause temporarily. Bitcoin’s target in this bull run is $122,000, which was determined by measuring the depth of the cup at 76%.

Ethereum also felt the impact, as its spot ETF outflows signal caution among investors in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. With the broader crypto market experiencing heightened volatility, market participants are closely watching key support levels and macroeconomic developments. These outflows suggest that investor sentiment may remain cautious in the short term as they weigh the impact of macroeconomic factors and the potential for further declines.

37884133,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631043,1734702965,"The Fed is lost in its own strategy, and Bitcoin is the one paying the price","The Federal Reserve has turned into its own worst enemy, and Bitcoin is caught in the storm. Imagine a pilot, mid-flight, deciding to wing it with no clear destination. That’s Jerome Powell and his crew at the Federal Reserve right now. They’ve spent the past year stomping on inflation with relentless rate hikes, only to suddenly flip the script with a quarter-point rate cut this week. Predictably, the market went into full meltdown mode, dragging Bitcoin down to $95,000. And we keep hearing the term “hawkish” everywhere, but what does it even mean? And why does Bitcoin hate it? Well see, it’s a kind of approach to dealing with inflation. A “hawkish” phase is when central banks focus on jacking up interest rates and tightening the money flow to keep prices in check. Basically, they’re more worried about controlling inflation than boosting economic growth. Bitcoin caught in the Fed’s liquidity trap To understand the disaster, let’s rewind. The Fed spent all of 2024 swinging its hawkish hammer. The plan? Jack up interest rates to choke inflation and force everyone to behave — businesses, borrowers, the dude buying overpriced avocado toast. And it worked, to a point. Inflation cooled, but nowhere near the Fed’s 2% goal. Still, the central bank didn’t flinch. Rates climbed, liquidity drained out of the market, and riskier assets like Bitcoin started to wobble. Then came the curveball. This week, the Fed decided to cut rates by a quarter-point, dropping them to 4.25% from 4.5%. If you’re thinking, “Wait, didn’t they just say inflation’s still too high?”—you’re not alone. Investors collectively lost their minds. Stocks tanked. Bitcoin plummeted. And the Fed, in its infinite wisdom, dubbed this a “hawkish cut.” But oh wait, they also said they’re probably not cutting rates next year, which makes you wonder; why cut it now, Mr. Powell? Economists warned you for months. It’s almost as if the Fed deliberately did the opposite of what it should’ve done. Bitcoin traders saw through it and dumped their holdings faster than the Fed could backpedal. The liquidity crunch is no joke, either. When central banks raise rates and tighten the money supply, capital dries up. That’s great if you want to control inflation but terrible if you’re holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin. With less money flowing into markets, Bitcoin’s usual safety net of investor optimism has vanished. The Fed’s mixed signals are tanking everything Here’s where things get even worse. The Fed’s actions don’t match its words. Powell insists the labor market is softening and inflation is under control—two reasons to ease up on rate hikes. But the data doesn’t back him up. Unemployment is still low. Inflation isn’t budging much. And the markets are reacting like someone yanked the rug out from under them. Take the Fed’s latest “dot plot,” a magical chart where officials predict future rate changes. It showed only two more rate cuts in 2025, down from the four cuts hinted at just a few months ago. Investors freaked out. Historically, hawkish policies have been a blunt but effective tool for fighting inflation. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chair in the 80s and 90s, famously used high rates to keep inflation in check. But Greenspan had a plan. Today’s Fed? Not so much. Their approach feels like throwing darts at a board. The bigger issue is that the Fed is stuck in its own economic models. These models assume monetary policy is the main driver of inflation. That might’ve been true once, but today’s economy is more complicated. Tax policies, regulation, and even global supply chains play a massive role. The Fed doesn’t seem to get that. They’re treating the economy like it’s 1990 and ignoring how much things have changed. And don’t forget about inflation expectations. Investors usually rely on the bond market to gauge where inflation is headed. But long-term bond yields have been rising since September, suggesting investors expect inflation to stick around. That’s bad news for Bitcoin, which thrives on low inflation and loose monetary policy.

After testing the $2.72 resistance, XRP retraced to the $2.17 support level, where a potential double-tap appears to be forming. XRP price analysis.

On the upside, immediate resistance is at $2.50, a key level that XRP must break to regain bullish momentum. A decisive breakout above $2.62 would signal the completion of the ongoing correction and open the door for further gains. Meanwhile, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez noted that a rebound to $2.62 could trigger the liquidation of $20.50 million in short positions.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-pepe-and-dogecoin-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37883910,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99185,1734702859,Solana’s $400 Surge in Sight as Top Analyst Highlights Key Catalyst,"Solana (SOL), the sixth-largest crypto by market capitalization, continued to show lackluster performance Thursday, extending its month-long downward trajectory within a narrow price channel. This comes after a significant rally from September to a new all-time high of $263.83 in mid-November. However, SOL has now revisited the previous March high of $205, a level analysts see as critical support, hinting at a potential reversal. In a recent tweet , analyst MartyParty highlighted a recurring price pattern he refers to as a “ghost feed” candle formation, forecasting another parabolic move akin to the surge seen in early 2024. The chart shows that Solana (SOL) has stabilized in the $205-$210 range, signaling the potential for a strong upward rally. According to MartyParty’s analysis, this development, combined with a fractal pattern observed from January to mid-March 2024, points to a possible price target of $345. Analysts “Ridger R” analyzed Solana’s price correction, suggesting it has completed its downward wave. According to his analysis on TradingView, Solana’s price USD has found support in a demand zone, forming a bull flag pattern. The pundit noted that he anticipates a breakout from this formation, followed by a retest of the breakout level before Solana might be poised to attack new all-time highs. Although specific price targets from this analysis aren’t mentioned, similar formations typically suggest moves towards or beyond previous resistance levels , hinting at targets in the $400 to $600 range or higher. Beyond the technical indicators, several key fundamental factors fuel increasing optimism around Solana. According to data from the crypto analytics platform Token Terminal, Solana (SOL) captured 53% of global crypto users in November, outpacing all other blockchains combined. Solana’s growing adoption and expanding ecosystem have also bolstered its reputation as a top-tier blockchain platform. Data from DeFi Lama reveals that its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged to $8.93 billion, nearing its pre-FTX levels of approximately $10 billion in 2022. This remarkable rebound demonstrates that, two years on, Solana is not only surviving but thriving. Moreover, Solana has surpassed Ethereum regarding developer growth for the first time in nearly a decade. The 2024 Developer Report from Electric Capital reveals that Solana attracted 19.5% of all new crypto developers in 2024, overtaking Ethereum for the first time since 2016. This marks a significant shift in the blockchain landscape, with Solana emerging as the leading choice for new developers this year. Known for its scalability, Solana can process over 50,000 transactions per second at low costs, making it a strong competitor to Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 applications. With its expanding ecosystem, growing developer base, and solid fundamentals, Solana’s price could very well see significant growth, potentially reaching new milestones in the near future. At press time, SOL was trading at $187, reflecting a 9.84% drop in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/solanas-400-surge-in-sight-as-top-analyst-highlights-key-catalyst/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37884419,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321533,1734702842,Crypto Custody Firm Copper Withdraws UK License Application,"According to Bloomberg , Copper Technologies, a leading cryptocurrency custody provider supported by Barclays investment, has withdrawn its application for a crypto license in the United Kingdom. Copper Withdraws UK Crypto License Application Amid Challenges The decision follows increased scrutiny from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which has rejected or refused most crypto applications over the past year. On December 20, 2024, the firm confirmed that it would now prioritize expanding its presence in other key markets, including the United States, Switzerland, and the Middle East. excl: crypto custodian Copper has withdrawn its bid for regulatory registration in its home market, as part of a strategy shift toward overseas hubs like the US, Europe and Middle East https://t.co/XO816NrK6w — Emily Nicolle (@emilyjnicolle) December 20, 2024 Copper’s strategic shift is part of a broader effort to navigate the complex regulatory environment for crypto businesses in the UK. The FCA’s stringent requirements for securing a crypto license have been a significant challenge for firms operating in the UK. In its 2024 annual report, the FCA revealed that over 87% of crypto registration applications were withdrawn, rejected, or refused. The regulator cited poor anti-money laundering controls as the primary reason for such high failure rates. Copper, one of the most prominent players in the UK crypto scene, had already faced difficulties securing permanent registration in 2022. This led the company to seek regulatory approval in other jurisdictions. With the withdrawal of its UK crypto license application, Copper aims to strengthen operations in global markets with more favorable regulatory frameworks. The FCA’s actions reflect its cautious stance on cryptocurrency regulation, approving only four of 35 applications in the past year. This has forced many crypto firms, including Copper, to reconsider their operational strategies. Leadership Transition and Global Expansion Copper Technologies’ decision comes amid significant leadership changes. In October 2024, the company appointed Amar Kuchinad as its new global CEO following the resignation of founder Dmitry Tokarev. Kuchinad emphasized a renewed focus on the company’s global growth strategy, particularly in markets such as Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Switzerland. “Refining Copper’s global growth strategy has been my priority since joining, and this has necessitated key decisions on our direction and approach,” Kuchinad stated. He described the withdrawal of the UK crypto license application as a strategic move to prioritize growth in regions offering better opportunities. Copper has received substantial financial backing from Barclays investment , underscoring its significance in the global crypto ecosystem. Despite withdrawing from the UK licensing process, the firm remains committed to its home market and is exploring expansion opportunities abroad. “Withdrawing our application to register as a crypto asset institution in the UK is the right decision for our business and reflects our refocus on driving growth in priority markets and the expansion of our product portfolio,” Kuchinad added. As Copper redirects its efforts towards international markets, its strategy reflects a broader industry trend of adapting to regulatory challenges. The company plans to strengthen its presence in the United States and the Middle East while maintaining its operations in Europe. “We remain committed to the UK, which has been, and will continue to be, a central part of the Copper story,” Kuchinad reaffirmed.

37883734,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112260,1734702818,"Mastering Spider Solitaire: Tips, Tricks, and Strategies for Success","Spider Solitaire: A Game of Skill and Strategy Spider Solitaire is a timeless card game that combines skill, patience, and strategy. Whether you’re playing to relax or to challenge your mental acuity, this game is perfect for players of all levels. With its intriguing gameplay and strategic moves, Spider Solitaire has become a favorite among card game enthusiasts worldwide. In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about Spider Solitaire, from its origins to expert strategies that can help you win consistently. What is Spider Solitaire? Spider Solitaire is a single-player card game that originated from the traditional Solitaire family. Unlike classic Solitaire, Spider Solitaire uses two decks of cards, making it more complex and challenging. The game involves creating sequences of cards in descending order, from King to Ace, within the same suit. Key Features of Spider Solitaire Two Decks of Cards: The game uses 104 cards, providing a more intricate gameplay experience. Ten Tableau Columns: Cards are arranged in ten columns, with the objective of clearing all cards. Customizable Difficulty: Spider Solitaire offers different levels of difficulty, with one, two, or four suits in play. Hints and Undo Options: Many modern versions of the game include hints and undo options for a smoother experience. How to Play Spider Solitaire Setup The game begins with 104 cards shuffled and dealt into 10 tableau columns. The first four columns contain six cards each, while the remaining six columns have five cards. Only the top card in each column is face-up, and the rest remain face-down. Objective The goal of Spider Solitaire is to create sequences of cards in descending order (King to Ace) within the same suit. Once a sequence is completed, it is removed from the tableau. The game ends when all cards are cleared. Gameplay Steps Move Cards: You can move a card or a sequence of cards to another column if the move adheres to the descending order. Reveal Hidden Cards: When the top card of a column is moved, the card underneath is revealed. Fill Empty Columns: Empty columns can be filled with any card or sequence, depending on the rules of the version you’re playing. Draw Cards: If no moves are possible, draw a new row of cards from the stockpile. Tips and Tricks for Winning Spider Solitaire 1. Start with the Easy Mode If you’re new to Spider Solitaire, begin with the one-suit mode. This will help you familiarize yourself with the rules and gameplay without overwhelming complexity. 2. Prioritize Empty Columns Empty columns are a strategic asset. Use them to temporarily store cards, enabling you to reorganize sequences effectively. 3. Build Long Sequences Early Focus on creating long sequences in the same suit early in the game. This strategy minimizes disruptions later. 4. Use the Undo Option Wisely If you’re stuck, the undo feature can help you analyze alternative moves and improve your strategy. 5. Plan Ahead Think a few moves ahead to anticipate potential obstacles and create opportunities for smoother gameplay. Advanced Strategies for Spider Solitaire 1. Manage the Stockpile Carefully Avoid drawing from the stockpile prematurely. Exhaust all possible moves within the tableau before adding new cards. 2. Focus on One Suit at a Time Clearing one suit completely can simplify the game significantly, as it reduces the number of cards on the tableau. 3. Break Down Complex Columns Columns with many hidden cards can be challenging. Work systematically to reveal these hidden cards. 4. Use Empty Columns Sparingly While empty columns are valuable, overusing them can restrict your moves. Use them strategically to maximize their utility. 5. Keep High-Value Cards Accessible Ensure that Kings and Queens are easily accessible for building sequences, as they are crucial for completing stacks. Benefits of Playing Spider Solitaire 1. Mental Stimulation Spider Solitaire enhances cognitive skills like problem-solving, logical thinking, and memory. 2. Stress Relief The game offers a calming experience, making it ideal for unwinding after a busy day. 3.

Two-Suit Spider Solitaire This medium-difficulty version uses two suits and is ideal for intermediate players. 3. Four-Suit Spider Solitaire The most challenging variation, it uses all four suits, requiring advanced strategies and exceptional patience. Where to Play Spider Solitaire Online 1.

Solitaire Bliss A free online platform featuring multiple variations of Solitaire, including Spider Solitaire. 3. Arkadium Games A user-friendly website offering Spider Solitaire with customizable difficulty levels. 4.

Spider Solitaire vs. Classic Solitaire Feature Spider Solitaire Classic Solitaire Number of Decks Two One Tableau Columns Ten Seven Objective Build sequences by suit Build foundations by suit Difficulty Levels Adjustable (1-4 suits) Fixed Spider Solitaire offers a more complex and strategic experience compared to Classic Solitaire, making it a favorite among advanced players. Common Challenges in Spider Solitaire 1. Limited Moves If the tableau becomes stagnant, it can be challenging to make progress. Focus on revealing hidden cards to create new opportunities. 2. Managing Multiple Suits In higher difficulty levels, balancing multiple suits can be overwhelming. Prioritize one suit at a time to simplify gameplay. 3. Dealing with Stockpile Cards Stockpile cards can complicate the tableau. Use them judiciously to avoid unnecessary clutter.

Binance.US is also making strides, and announced plans to restore USD services in 2025. Cryptopia’s Long-Awaited User Reimbursements Underway The liquidators of the now-defunct crypto exchange Cryptopia started the distribution of funds to users who were affected by a major hack that happened nearly six years ago. On Dec. 20, Grant Thornton , the firm overseeing Cryptopia’s liquidation, announced that over 10,000 verified account holders started receiving payouts. These distributions consist of Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE), totaling approximately 400 million New Zealand dollars ($225 million). This is a major step forward in the liquidation process, which began in 2020 with the establishment of the Cryptopia claims portal . While this initial payout is very large, Grant Thornton stated that even more distributions are planned. The firm will follow an approved process, including setting cut-off dates, before distributing the remaining funds to account holders. There is also the possibility of additional ”top-up” distributions, which could allow users to receive up to 100% of their holdings by reallocating unclaimed funds from those who have not registered on the claims portal. Grant Thornton urged any of the remaining Cryptopia account holders to complete the registration process to qualify for future distributions. The liquidators also confirmed that additional distributions for some of the newly verified users are expected to take place in the coming year. Cryptopia was founded in 2014, and was once a major international cryptocurrency exchange based in New Zealand. It boasted 1.4 million registered users at its peak in 2018. It was also a pioneer in the country’s crypto ecosystem after launching the NZD-backed stablecoin NZDT in 2017. However, the exchange suffered a catastrophic hack in January of 2019, which resulted in the loss of an estimated $16 million in crypto assets. Shortly after, Cryptopia entered liquidation, and Grant Thornton reported that the exchange owed $4.2 million to its creditors. Coinbase Advanced Trading Volumes Soar in 2024 Things are going a lot better for some other crypto exchanges. Coinbase Advanced, the professional trading platform offered by Coinbase, experienced remarkable growth in 2024. The platform recorded a 191% increase in trading volumes and a 77% rise in user numbers. The growth was likely fueled by surging interest in derivatives trading. In fact, derivatives volumes saw an unprecedented 10,950% increase this year. Coinbase’s derivatives platform was launched in 2022, and has become a big driver of growth by offering cryptocurrency futures like nano Bitcoin and nano Ethereum contracts to its U.S. users. The platform also lists futures tied to meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB), alongside commodities like oil and gold. The broader crypto derivatives market also saw exponential growth, with monthly trading volumes surpassing $3 trillion in September, according to CCData. These futures contracts allow traders to hedge and speculate with leverage, which helped boost their popularity. In addition to derivatives, spot trading activity on Coinbase Advanced grew by 47% in 2024, buoyed by optimistic market sentiment after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory and the addition of new tokens. Coinbase plans to offer more tokens under the new administration, including smaller tokens and meme coins, according to Tom Duff Gordon. Some of its most recent listings include meme coins like Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF). Coinbase stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) Coinbase’s growth also reflected in its stock performance , which surged past $300 in November for the first time since 2021. However, the stock has since pulled back to around $280 based on data from Google Finance. Crypto Community Criticizes Coinbase Along with its success, Coinbase also recently faced some backlash. The crypto community strongly criticised Coinbase after its explanation for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), and blaming it on the risks associated with Tron founder Justin Sun. Coinbase filed its response to a lawsuit from BiT Global, which is a Sun-affiliated entity, and accused the exchange of harming the wBTC market by removing the token in November. In its filing, Coinbase attributed its decision to allegations of financial misconduct and ongoing regulatory investigations involving Sun. The crypto community argued that Coinbase’s reasoning lacks legal and technical justification, and some even accused the exchange of engaging in “guilt by association.” Bitcoin advocate and Coinbase skeptic Pledditor believes the filing reflects personal animosity toward Sun, and does not address the actual merits of the case. Coinbase pointed to Sun’s alleged violations of industry and government standards, including accusations of fraud and securities law violations. These claims stem from charges that were filed against Sun by the U.S. SEC in March of 2023 and additional investigations by federal authorities. The criticism of Coinbase’s actions also drew attention to its own legal challenges. VanEck adviser Gabor Gurbacs , pointed out the irony of Coinbase questioning Sun’s reputation while facing numerous investigations itself. In June of 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. Earlier in the year, Coinbase also settled with the New York Department of Financial Services for $100 million over compliance issues. Binance.US Plans Major Revival Binance.US, the United States-based subsidiary of the global crypto exchange Binance, announced plans to resume U.S. dollar services in early 2025. This is a big step for the exchange as it plans to rebuild its presence in the U.S. market. Interim CEO Norman Reed shared the update in a blog post on Dec. 18. Reed stated that Binance.US is closer than ever to restoring USD services and believes 2025 will be a pivotal year for the exchange. He also mentioned plans for new product releases and strategic partnerships to enhance the platform’s infrastructure, including expanded custody offerings and improved wallet solutions. Reed is optimistic about the future, and invited users to participate in what he described as a comeback story for the ages. This announcement was made after comments from Binance CEO Richard Teng earlier in December, where he said it was too early to discuss whether Binance might fully re-establish operations in the United States. Despite past challenges, Binance.US is still focused on offering competitive features, including 0% fee trading for BTC/USDC and support for 160 cryptocurrencies alongside staking for over 20 cryptos. Binance.US initially launched in 2019 to provide regulated crypto trading services in the United States. However, the platform faced hurdles in 2023, beginning with a lawsuit from the SEC in June. The SEC accused Binance of failing to register Binance.US as an exchange, which led to the suspension of USD deposits. By October, Binance.US declared its transition to a crypto-only exchange after updating its terms of service. In November of 2023, Binance reached a $4.3 million settlement with the U.S. government over allegations of sanctions violations, money laundering, and operating as an unlicensed money transmitter. As part of the settlement, Binance committed to exiting the U.S. market entirely and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. Despite these setbacks, Binance.US is determined to make a strong return.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6660/cryptopia-users-finally-receive-payouts-years-after-devastating-hack,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37883676,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112256,1734702685,VIX Soars 74% as Fed Rate Cut Sends Bitcoin Below $100K,"VIX Spikes 74% as Fed Rate Cut Triggers Bitcoin Drop Below $100K On December 18, 2024, financial markets witnessed dramatic turbulence as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index ( VIX ) skyrocketed 74% , marking its largest single-day jump since 2018. This surge came on the heels of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and hawkish commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The rate cut triggered significant reactions across markets, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below the psychological $100,000 mark, U.S. equities dropping 3%, and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hitting a two-year high. The volatility leaves investors wondering whether a market rebound is imminent, as history suggests. Fed’s Rate Cut and Hawkish Commentary The Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points was widely anticipated, but Chair Powell’s hawkish tone during the post-announcement press conference surprised markets. Key Points from Powell’s Commentary: Tightening Signals: Powell emphasized that the rate cut does not mark the beginning of a prolonged easing cycle. Inflation Concerns: The Fed remains focused on combating persistent inflation, indicating further tightening if necessary. Market Uncertainty: Powell’s statements introduced ambiguity about future monetary policy, unsettling markets. VIX Soars Amid Market Jitters The VIX, often referred to as Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” measures market expectations for volatility. The 74% spike on Dec. 18 underscores the heightened uncertainty across global markets. Why the VIX Spike Matters: Investor Sentiment: A sharp rise in the VIX often reflects increased risk aversion among investors. Market Correlation: Historically, large VIX spikes have been associated with local market bottoms for both Bitcoin and traditional equities. Rebound Potential: Analysts note that rebounds typically occur after such significant volatility, offering a glimmer of hope for investors. Bitcoin Falls Below $100K Bitcoin’s price declined sharply, dipping below the $100,000 threshold amid the market turmoil. This marks a significant retracement from its recent highs and has left investors speculating about the cryptocurrency’s next move. Historical Context: Bitcoin has previously exhibited resilience following sharp market corrections. According to data from CoinDesk , similar VIX spikes in the past have coincided with BTC finding local bottoms. Analyst Predictions: Rebound Likely: Some analysts predict a near-term rebound, citing Bitcoin’s oversold conditions. Long-Term Support: Others remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, with forecasts suggesting a potential climb to $145,000 by mid-2025 . Impact on U.S. Equities and Dollar Index U.S. equities were not spared, with major indices suffering a 3% drop on Dec. 18. Meanwhile, the Dollar Index (DXY) surged to a two-year high, signaling heightened demand for the greenback as a safe haven. Key Takeaways: Equities Under Pressure: The sharp decline reflects investor concerns about economic growth and monetary policy uncertainty. Dollar Strength: The rising DXY highlights the dollar’s dominance during periods of market stress. What’s Next for Markets? While the immediate market reaction has been negative, historical trends suggest a potential rebound. Both Bitcoin and the S&P 500 have previously recovered strongly following sharp increases in the VIX. Factors to Watch: Fed Policy Updates: Any clarification on the Fed’s monetary policy will likely influence market direction. Bitcoin’s Resilience: BTC’s ability to hold key support levels will be critical for its short-term outlook. Global Economic Indicators: Developments in inflation and growth metrics will shape investor sentiment. Conclusion The 74% spike in the VIX, combined with Bitcoin’s drop below $100,000 and a sharp decline in U.S. equities, underscores the fragility of global markets in the face of monetary policy uncertainty. While the immediate outlook appears grim, historical patterns offer hope for a recovery. As markets adjust to the Fed’s hawkish stance, investors will closely monitor key indicators and trends. Bitcoin’s ability to regain momentum and broader market stabilization will be critical in the weeks ahead.

37884292,https://thecoinrise.com/tornado-cash-co-founder-seeks-dismissal-of-charges-following-key-court-ruling/,1734702630,Tornado Cash Co-Founder Seeks Dismissal of Charges Following Key Court Ruling,"Roman Storm, the co-founder of the controversial crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash, is pushing to have criminal charges dropped, citing a recent ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The ruling, which found that the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s OFAC overstepped its authority in sanctioning Tornado Cash’s smart contracts , is central to Storm’s defense in his ongoing trial. In a motion filed on December 18 in Manhattan federal court, Storm argued that the Fifth Circuit’s opinion, issued last month in a separate case, undermines the foundation of the charges against him. The appeals court’s decision clarified that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are not the “property” of any foreign individual or entity, and thus, cannot be blocked under U.S. law. Storm contends that this ruling directly impacts his charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which grants the U.S. government authority to sanction individuals and entities posing a threat to national security. Court Decision Casts Doubt on Smart Contract Sanctions The Fifth Circuit stated that the Tornado Cash smart contracts, which are decentralized and immutable, are not under the control of the platform’s creators. The court described the contracts as being akin to an “open-source software” that cannot be altered or stopped by Storm or his co-founders, including Roman Semenov, who remains at large. As such, the court ruled that they could not be held responsible for the use of the platform by any party, including those linked to North Korean hacking groups, like the Lazarus Group . Storm’s motion points out that the district court had previously refrained from ruling on the platform’s immutability when it denied his motion to dismiss in September. However, he argues that the appeals court’s opinion has definitively settled the matter, leaving no questions for a jury to decide. Legal Challenges and Further Charges Storm, who faces charges related to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to launder money, maintains that the charges should also be dismissed. He argues that Tornado Cash cannot be classified as a financial institution, and since the protocol became immutable in May 2020—months before the alleged conspiracy started—there was no possibility for an illegal agreement to commit money laundering. The case against Storm and his co-founders has drawn significant attention, particularly after the U.S. government accused them of facilitating over $1 billion in crypto laundering, including transactions linked to the Lazarus Group. While Semenov remains at large, another co-founder Alexey Pertsev is currently in pre-trial detention in the Netherlands, facing related charges.

37883667,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395734,1734702600,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Today: Bears Target $82,500 After Market Bloodbath","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction Today: Bears Target $82,500 After Market Bloodbath appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is currently down by more than six percent and is trading slightly above the $95k levels at the time of writing. The next major support is around $91,000 to $92,000. The Federal Reserve recently cut interest rates by 0.25% (25 basis points), which was expected and already priced in by the market. Initially, there wasn’t much reaction when the news was released, but about half an hour later, Jerome Powell’s press conference had a bigger effect on the market. Bitcoin and the stock market both saw declines in the past day. The main reason for this drop was related to interest rate expectations for next year. While many were hoping for further rate cuts, the market now only expects one more 25-basis point cut in 2025, which caused a bearish reaction. Additionally, Powell said that the Federal Reserve is not allowed to buy or hold Bitcoin, which spooked the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Markets Plunging Down as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Drops Below $94,000; Has the $90,000 Targets Activated? , Bitcoin Price Analysis: What’s Next? Bitcoin is currently in a downward trend, with the price moving towards a key support area. According to analysts, his decline was expected, and the next major support zone is between $69,400 and $82,500. Recent price action has shown signs of a correction , and the market could potentially be nearing the bottom of this phase. While Bitcoin has been in a general uptrend, there have been hints that a correction was due. The price action has been weaker recently, with overlapping moves suggesting exhaustion. Additionally, the $100,000 level has proven to be a tough resistance for Bitcoin. The market continues to show downward movement, with the possibility of further declines before any recovery. Despite the current downtrend, there’s a chance that a bounce could occur once the price reaches key support levels. However, we need to see a break above resistance before confirming that a reversal is underway. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37883613,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99183,1734702566,Inside Hoskinson’s Plan to Unlock $20 Trillion in Crypto Assets with Cardano’s Midnight Protocol,"Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOHK, is setting his sights on helping unlock a staggering $20 trillion in crypto assets through the launch of the Midnight protocol. In a recent interview on the Blockster podcast, Hoskinson shared his ambitious vision for the Cardano ecosystem, highlighting how the privacy-focused protocol could tap into a massive pool of value that has been sidelined due to restrictive regulatory barriers. Notably, Midnight is designed to provide privacy as a service through the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which allow transactions to occur without revealing sensitive data. The protocol addresses the growing demand for privacy in blockchain networks, where concerns over privacy and regulatory compliance are becoming increasingly prominent. “Privacy is the biggest pie ever seen in the history of any business endeavor,” Hoskinson stated, emphasizing the vast, untapped potential of assets that require privacy protections. Another major aspect of the Midnight protocol’s innovation is its ability to facilitate interoperability across multiple blockchains. According to the crypto mogul, the protocol will create a “meta-chain,” enabling various cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Ethereum, XRP , and Solana, to coexist and transact seamlessly. He further noted that this multi-resource consensus is crucial for fostering a truly decentralized and privacy-oriented ecosystem. “It looks like it’s a layer two to everybody,” he explained, noting that Midnight’s privacy layer will appear as an extension of any major blockchain while maintaining full cross-chain compatibility. Hoskinson also discussed the importance of the tokenomics model behind Midnight. The protocol will utilize a dual-token structure, balancing deflationary assets for governance with inflationary tokens for gas fees. This approach aims to create stability and predictability in transaction costs, a crucial factor for businesses and users alike. That said, by focusing on privacy, interoperability, and a sustainable economic model, Cardano’s Midnight protocol could attract major institutional players. Hoskinson believes this will increase the Cardano ecosystem’s value and catalyze broader adoption of blockchain technology, ultimately unlocking trillions in previously inaccessible assets. “We don’t have real world assets in crypto yet because the private side is too precious and too regulated to be able to bring into the cryptocurrency industry.” He added. “[However], once you have privacy you can now bring it in and that’s 20 trillion dollars of assets. That is the biggest ever seen in the history of any business.” Looking ahead, Hoskinson emphasized that in 2025 , the focus will shift to enhancing interoperability and solidifying Midnight’s privacy features as a cornerstone of the crypto world. He also highlighted the importance of fostering collaboration among blockchain projects, stating, “We’re entering an era where common enemies are becoming friends.”",POSITIVE,없음,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SOL,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/inside-hoskinsons-plan-to-unlock-20-trillion-in-crypto-assets-with-cardanos-midnight-protocol/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png
37883620,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112252,1734702558,Jefferies Reports Extended Profitability for Bitcoin Miners in December,"Bitcoin Miners to Enjoy Extended Profitability in December: Jefferies Report Bitcoin miners are poised for a profitable December as favorable market conditions persist, according to a report from U.S. investment bank Jefferies . Factors such as Bitcoin’s recent price rally and stable network hashrate are driving the extended profitability for miners, solidifying their position amidst an increasingly competitive market. With key players like MARA Holdings and CleanSpark leading the way in mined BTC, the report highlights the positive impact of improved uptime and seasonal weather conditions on miner performance. Bitcoin’s Price Rally Fuels Miner Profits Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged by 31% in November , pushing its price above significant resistance levels and creating a favorable environment for miners. The rally not only increased revenues from mining rewards but also brought additional investor confidence into the market, further strengthening the profitability of mining operations. Jefferies noted that Bitcoin’s price surge, combined with a modest 4% rise in the network hashrate , has ensured that miners can capitalize on the current market dynamics. Unlike periods of steep hashrate increases, where profitability is squeezed by rising operational costs, the stable hashrate allows miners to maximize their earnings. Leading Bitcoin Mining Companies in December The report highlighted key mining firms and their performance in December: MARA Holdings : Leading the pack, MARA mined 907 BTC during the month, benefiting from improved operational efficiency and strategic expansion. CleanSpark : Close behind, CleanSpark mined 622 BTC , leveraging advancements in energy efficiency and optimized mining operations. Both companies have managed to maintain profitability while navigating challenges such as energy costs and regulatory scrutiny. Seasonal and Operational Advantages Jefferies attributed part of the miners’ success to external factors like colder weather , which naturally enhances cooling efficiency for mining rigs. This reduces operational costs, allowing miners to focus on maximizing uptime and production capacity. Additionally, miners have implemented measures to improve uptime, ensuring that mining rigs operate at peak efficiency even during network congestion or power fluctuations. Bitcoin Mining Profitability Metrics The profitability of Bitcoin mining is typically influenced by several key factors: Bitcoin Price : Higher prices translate to greater revenue for miners, making the current market rally a critical factor for profitability. Hashrate Stability : A modest increase of 4% in network hashrate has allowed miners to maintain their share of mining rewards without significant additional investment in hardware. Energy Costs : The seasonal drop in temperatures has reduced cooling expenses, further enhancing net profitability. Sustainability and Challenges for Bitcoin Miners While the current conditions are favorable, Jefferies cautioned that sustainability remains a key challenge for miners. Rising global scrutiny over energy usage and environmental impact continues to push miners toward renewable energy sources and more efficient operations. Top Challenges Faced by Bitcoin Miners Regulatory Uncertainty : Governments are increasingly implementing policies to regulate energy consumption and mining activities. Energy Costs : Although seasonal benefits are present, fluctuations in energy prices can still impact long-term profitability. Market Volatility : A sudden downturn in Bitcoin prices could quickly reverse the gains miners are enjoying. Outlook for Bitcoin Mining in 2025 Jefferies remains optimistic about the long-term potential of Bitcoin mining , citing advancements in mining hardware and the integration of sustainable energy solutions. However, the report emphasizes the need for miners to stay agile, adapt to market changes, and invest in infrastructure that ensures efficiency and sustainability. Conclusion With Bitcoin’s price rally and favorable operational conditions, miners are set to enjoy a profitable December. Leaders like MARA Holdings and CleanSpark have demonstrated resilience and adaptability, positioning themselves well in a competitive landscape. As the crypto market evolves, Bitcoin mining profitability will likely hinge on innovation, sustainability, and the ability to navigate regulatory challenges. For now, miners can look forward to a robust end to the year, supported by positive market dynamics and operational efficiencies.

37883563,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112248,1734702408,U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Largest Net Outflow Ever on December 19,"U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Largest Net Outflow in History on December 19, 2024 In a surprising turn of events on December 19, 2024, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed their largest net outflow to date, amounting to a staggering $671.8 million . This marks a significant shift in the market dynamics, as it also ends a remarkable streak of 15 consecutive trading days of net inflows into these investment products. What Happened on December 19? The data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, revealed that Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a substantial withdrawal, breaking the previous momentum of steady inflows. On the day in question, a massive $671.8 million was pulled from various U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , making it the largest net outflow since these ETFs launched. This shift in sentiment has raised questions about the factors that could have driven such a dramatic outflow. It is also important to consider the ETFs that were most affected and those that saw no significant change. Largest Net Outflows Among Key Bitcoin ETFs The largest net outflow was recorded by Fidelity’s FBTC ETF , which experienced a staggering $208.55 million withdrawal on the same day. Close behind was Grayscale’s mini BTC ETF , with a $188.6 million outflow, followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB ETF with $108.35 million . Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC saw an outflow of $87.86 million , rounding out the top five Bitcoin ETFs with significant withdrawals. Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reported no significant net inflows or outflows , signaling that the market’s volatility might not have impacted every product in the same way. Factors Behind the Outflow Several factors could have contributed to the sharp drop in Bitcoin ETF inflows on December 19, 2024: 1. Bitcoin Price Volatility The price of Bitcoin has seen some fluctuations recently, which may have influenced investor sentiment. With significant price corrections, traders may have opted to withdraw their investments from Bitcoin ETFs , seeking more stable options or rebalancing their portfolios. 2. Macro-Economic Concerns Global economic conditions, including potential shifts in inflation rates, central bank policies, and traditional market uncertainties, could have prompted a reevaluation of Bitcoin’s position as a hedge against economic instability. 3. Profit-Taking After a Bull Run After Bitcoin reached significant price milestones, such as breaking the $100,000 mark , some investors may have decided to lock in profits. This is common in markets experiencing high volatility or following substantial price surges. 4. Regulatory Concerns While U.S. regulatory clarity on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments has improved, some investors may still be cautious about potential future restrictions or regulatory changes that could affect the viability of Bitcoin ETFs in the long term. Impact of the Outflow on the Bitcoin Market The outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs can have multiple ramifications: Short-Term Price Impact Large withdrawals can temporarily increase market sell pressure , potentially affecting Bitcoin’s price action . However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong, and institutional investors continue to play a significant role in its ecosystem. Market Sentiment The outflow could reflect short-term market anxiety or a shift in investor sentiment. As more investors weigh their options in light of broader economic conditions, the Bitcoin market may see more price fluctuations in the near future. Increased Institutional Interest Despite this short-term setback, the growing interest from institutional players like Fidelity , Grayscale , and ARK Invest remains a key factor in Bitcoin’s long-term adoption. Their involvement continues to bring legitimacy to the space, and their products are likely to remain a core component of institutional Bitcoin exposure. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs? The Bitcoin ETF market is evolving rapidly, and despite recent volatility, institutional interest is expected to remain strong. The U.S. SEC’s approval of new Bitcoin ETFs continues to pave the way for more institutional involvement in the digital currency space. However, market participants will closely monitor the situation to understand if the recent outflow trend is a temporary blip or indicative of a broader market shift. Traders and investors may also look for signals of renewed institutional confidence to gauge whether further withdrawals are likely. FAQs on Bitcoin ETFs 1. What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They are popular among institutional investors and provide a regulated investment vehicle for digital asset exposure. 2. Why did Bitcoin ETFs experience such a large outflow? Factors such as Bitcoin price volatility, macro-economic concerns, profit-taking after a bull run, and possible regulatory uncertainty may have contributed to the large outflow from Bitcoin ETFs. 3. What is the potential impact of these outflows on Bitcoin’s price? The outflows could cause temporary sell pressure, which might affect the price in the short term. However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals and growing institutional interest are expected to support its market position. 4. Will Bitcoin ETFs continue to be popular with institutional investors? Despite recent withdrawals, institutional interest in Bitcoin is likely to remain strong. With growing adoption and regulatory clarity, Bitcoin ETFs will likely remain an important investment vehicle for institutions. Conclusion The $671.8 million net outflow from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on December 19, 2024, highlights the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the crypto market. While short-term withdrawals may cause fluctuations, the Bitcoin market remains supported by long-term fundamentals and the continued involvement of institutional investors . As the market continues to mature and evolve, Bitcoin ETFs are likely to play a significant role in bridging traditional finance and the world of digital assets. Whether these recent outflows are a temporary phenomenon or the start of a more prolonged trend will depend on broader market dynamics and investor sentiment in the coming months.

37883509,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112244,1734702339,"Altcoin Season Index Dips to 45, Signaling Continued Market Dominance by Bitcoin","Altcoin Season Index Falls to 45: What It Means for Crypto Traders The Altcoin Season Index , a key indicator for gauging market dynamics between Bitcoin and altcoins, has dropped one point to 45 as of December 20, 2024, according to data from CoinMarketCap (CMC) . This reading suggests the market remains in Altcoin Season , albeit with reduced momentum compared to previous weeks. The index, which measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin over the past 90 days, provides valuable insights for traders and investors seeking to understand market trends. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a widely-used metric that evaluates whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. The index is calculated using the following criteria: Altcoin Season: At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the same period. The index ranges from 1 to 100 , with daily updates reflecting shifts in market sentiment. The current reading of 45 places the market in a transitional phase, where Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong but some altcoins continue to capture attention. Interpreting the Current Index Score of 45 A score of 45 indicates a mixed market environment: Bitcoin’s Stronghold: Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its dominance, particularly after surpassing the $100,000 mark. This milestone has redirected capital and attention toward the leading cryptocurrency. Altcoin Opportunities: Despite Bitcoin’s strength, a number of altcoins have shown resilience and potential, particularly those in the DeFi , NFT , and Layer-2 scaling sectors. The market’s current state reflects a tug-of-war between Bitcoin enthusiasts and altcoin advocates, with neither side gaining full control. Factors Driving the Altcoin Season Index 1. Bitcoin’s Recent Rally Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000 has solidified its position as the market leader, drawing investment from retail and institutional players alike. This has led to a relative underperformance of many altcoins, pulling the index score lower. 2. Selective Altcoin Performance Certain altcoins, particularly those tied to innovative technologies or real-world use cases, have managed to outperform Bitcoin. Examples include: Ethereum (ETH): Continues to benefit from strong activity in decentralized finance (DeFi). Solana (SOL): Gains traction due to its high-speed blockchain and ecosystem growth. Polygon (MATIC): Strengthens its position with Layer-2 scaling solutions. 3. Market Sentiment and Capital Flow The crypto market’s sentiment often oscillates between Bitcoin and altcoins. As Bitcoin achieves significant milestones, like reaching new all-time highs, market participants tend to reallocate capital to the leading cryptocurrency, slowing altcoin growth. Historical Trends and Insights The Altcoin Season Index has historically provided early warnings of market transitions: When the index exceeds 75: Altcoin Season is in full swing, often coinciding with Bitcoin price stagnation. When the index drops below 25: Bitcoin Season dominates, usually following major Bitcoin rallies. In 2021, the index hit a peak of 95 , signaling an explosive Altcoin Season driven by DeFi and NFT booms. Conversely, it dropped to 10 during Bitcoin’s strong rally in early 2023. What Does This Mean for Traders? For Bitcoin Traders: The current environment favors Bitcoin, with capital inflows supporting its price. Traders might consider holding or adding to Bitcoin positions, particularly as it consolidates above $100,000. For Altcoin Traders: While the market isn’t in full Altcoin Season, select altcoins continue to perform well. Traders should focus on fundamentally strong projects with active development and adoption. For Long-Term Investors: A balanced portfolio with exposure to both Bitcoin and top-performing altcoins can help mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities during market shifts. FAQs What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score above 75 indicates Altcoin Season, while a score below 25 indicates Bitcoin Season. Why did the index drop to 45? The index fell due to Bitcoin’s strong price rally, which has outperformed many altcoins. However, some altcoins continue to show resilience, keeping the index in a transitional phase. Is this a good time to invest in altcoins? Yes, but with caution. Focus on altcoins with strong fundamentals and active ecosystems, as they are more likely to outperform in the current environment. What factors influence the index? The index considers the price performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. Market trends, sentiment, and capital flows also play a significant role. How often is the index updated? The Altcoin Season Index is updated daily, providing real-time insights into market sentiment and performance. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s dip to 45 highlights the ongoing battle for dominance between Bitcoin and altcoins.

37883454,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112240,1734702255,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 74, Staying in the ‘Greed’ Zone","Crypto Fear & Greed Index Falls to 74, Remaining in ‘Greed’ Zone The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a key sentiment indicator for the cryptocurrency market, has dropped to 74 as of December 20, 2024. While this represents a one-point decline from the previous day, the index continues to signal “Greed” , reflecting positive, albeit cautious, sentiment among crypto investors. The index, maintained by Alternative.me , provides valuable insights into the prevailing emotions driving the cryptocurrency market. By analyzing six key factors, the index quantifies market sentiment on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 indicates “Extreme Fear” and 100 signifies “Extreme Greed.” Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an aggregate measure of investor sentiment derived from six distinct components: Volatility (25%) : Measures current price fluctuations compared to historical averages. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading volumes and market momentum. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes trends, hashtags, and engagement across social platforms. Surveys (15%) : Collects user sentiment through periodic polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Reflects Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Evaluates search trends for cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does the Index Indicate? As of December 20, 2024, the index’s reading of 74 suggests that investors are optimistic but veering toward overconfidence. Staying in the “Greed” zone often indicates bullish market conditions, where traders are actively buying assets with the expectation of further gains. However, excessive greed can also signal overvaluation and increased vulnerability to market corrections. Factors Behind the Latest Reading The current reading of 74 reflects a mix of market factors: Volatility Decline : A relatively stable Bitcoin price above $100,000 has reduced volatility, contributing positively to sentiment. High Trading Volume : Increased activity across major exchanges demonstrates strong market participation. Positive Social Media Buzz : Social platforms continue to see high engagement, with hashtags like #Bitcoin and #Crypto dominating discussions. Bitcoin Dominance : Bitcoin’s dominance remains robust at around 50%, bolstering confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Crypto Market Sentiment Analysis Despite the slight dip in the index, sentiment remains strong. Here’s what it means for traders and investors: For Bulls : A “Greed” reading suggests an opportunity to capitalize on positive momentum, though caution is advised as the market could be overbought. For Bears : The high greed level indicates that a correction might be on the horizon, making it an opportune time to secure profits. Historical Context of the Fear & Greed Index Historically, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has shown a strong correlation with market performance. Extreme Fear (0-20) : Often marks the bottom of the market, presenting buying opportunities. Neutral (40-60) : Reflects balanced sentiment, with no strong directional bias. Greed (70-89) : Indicates optimism but warns of potential overextension. Extreme Greed (90-100) : Typically precedes sharp corrections. With a reading of 74, the current sentiment aligns with historical patterns of steady upward trends, tempered by the possibility of short-term pullbacks. Implications for Bitcoin and Altcoins Bitcoin (BTC): Price Stability: Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 has provided a psychological boost to investors. Dominance: High Bitcoin dominance reinforces its role as the market’s anchor asset. Altcoins: Opportunities: The “Greed” zone encourages speculative investments in altcoins, especially those linked to decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Risks: Altcoins are more susceptible to volatility, particularly during market corrections. Tips for Navigating the “Greed” Zone Investors should adopt a balanced strategy to navigate the current market sentiment effectively: Take Profits: Consider securing gains on overperforming assets to mitigate downside risks. Diversify: Spread investments across different asset classes to reduce exposure to sudden corrections. Monitor Sentiment: Regularly track the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and other market indicators. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on macroeconomic trends and regulatory developments that may impact the market. FAQs What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index measures market sentiment by analyzing factors like volatility, trading volume, social media buzz, and Bitcoin dominance. Why is the index important? It helps investors gauge market sentiment, enabling informed decision-making during periods of extreme fear or greed. What does a reading of 74 indicate? A score of 74 signals “Greed,” reflecting positive market sentiment but also potential overconfidence among investors. How often is the index updated? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is updated daily, providing real-time insights into market sentiment. What should I do in the “Greed” zone? Consider taking profits, diversifying your portfolio, and preparing for potential market corrections. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s current reading of 74 highlights ongoing optimism in the cryptocurrency market, driven by stable Bitcoin prices, high trading volumes, and positive social media sentiment. While the “Greed” zone suggests bullish momentum, investors should remain cautious of potential corrections. By staying informed and adopting a balanced strategy, traders can navigate the market’s complexities and capitalize on opportunities.

Managed by Hashdex, a leading cryptocurrency asset management company, the fund provides U.S. investors with exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum through traditional financial markets. This approval marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting growing regulatory acceptance and paving the way for broader adoption among institutional and retail investors.

Legitimization of Cryptocurrencies The SEC’s green light signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial instruments, bolstering confidence among skeptics and fostering trust in digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC): As the first and largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin serves as the digital gold standard and a hedge against inflation.

Future ETFs: Industry insiders anticipate the approval of more cryptocurrency-focused ETFs in the near future, broadening the range of investment options. Challenges Ahead While the approval of the Hashdex ETF is a milestone, challenges remain: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings, which could impact the ETF’s performance. Regulatory Risks: Ongoing regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad could influence investor confidence. Market Education: A lack of understanding about cryptocurrencies among traditional investors may slow adoption. FAQs About Hashdex Bitcoin & Ethereum Index ETF What is the Hashdex Bitcoin & Ethereum Index ETF? The ETF provides exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum by tracking their performance through the Nasdaq Crypto Index. How can investors buy the ETF? The ETF will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange, allowing investors to trade it like traditional stocks or ETFs. Why is the SEC’s approval significant? The approval legitimizes cryptocurrency investment, attracting institutional and retail investors while fostering trust in digital assets. What are the risks of investing in the ETF? The primary risks include cryptocurrency volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and potential lack of market education. Will this ETF lead to higher cryptocurrency prices?

Conclusion The approval of the Hashdex Bitcoin & Ethereum Index ETF by the SEC represents a monumental moment for the cryptocurrency industry. By bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, the ETF provides investors with a regulated, accessible, and diversified entry point into the crypto market. As institutional and retail participation grows, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s role as core assets in the financial landscape becomes increasingly evident.

37883393,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112236,1734702144,Bitcoin Surges Past $100K: Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Rally Continues,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Take Profits as Price Tops $100K Bitcoin’s landmark ascent past $100,000 has spurred significant activity among long-term holders (LTHs), who have begun taking profits after years of accumulation. This milestone underscores the cryptocurrency’s growing adoption and market maturity, with analysts predicting even higher prices in the coming years. Record Profits for Long-Term Holders According to data from Glassnode, long-term Bitcoin holders have reduced their supply from $14.23 billion to $13.31 billion as prices broke through the $100K mark. This represents a historic moment for these investors, many of whom have held Bitcoin since it traded at a fraction of today’s value. While some may interpret this as a signal of caution, the market has shown resilience. Short-term holders (STHs) have absorbed the selling pressure, sustaining the momentum as new investors flock to Bitcoin. Short-Term Holders Step In The role of short-term holders has been critical in maintaining Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. Unlike long-term holders, who typically sell during price peaks, short-term investors often step in to capitalize on the market excitement. This dynamic ensures liquidity and allows Bitcoin’s price to stabilize, even as early adopters take profits. The continued inflow of new capital from retail and institutional investors further reinforces the bullish sentiment. Analyst Predictions: $145K and Beyond Bitcoin’s rally shows no signs of slowing. Analysts at Bitfinex predict that Bitcoin could reach $145,000 by mid-2025, with prices climbing as high as $200,000 under favorable market conditions. The bullish outlook is driven by several factors: Increasing Institutional Interest: Institutions continue to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Global Economic Uncertainty: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies in times of economic instability. Halving Impact: With the next Bitcoin halving slated for 2024, reduced supply could further drive up prices, replicating patterns observed in previous cycles. Speculation Over a U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Adding to the optimism, speculation has emerged over the possibility of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration. Though unconfirmed, the mere prospect has heightened interest in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve aligns with the broader trend of governments exploring cryptocurrency adoption. Such a move could signal a shift in how nations perceive digital assets, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s long-term value. Market Metrics Support Continued Growth Bitcoin’s current rally is backed by strong market metrics: Active Addresses: The number of active Bitcoin addresses continues to grow, indicating increased network activity and adoption. Exchange Flows: A net outflow from exchanges suggests investors are moving Bitcoin into cold storage, signaling confidence in long-term value. Hash Rate: The Bitcoin network’s hash rate remains near all-time highs, demonstrating robust security and miner confidence. Impact on the Broader Crypto Market Bitcoin’s rise has positively influenced the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoins, particularly Ethereum and other layer-1 platforms, have seen significant price increases as investors diversify their portfolios. Additionally, decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are experiencing renewed interest, with many leveraging Bitcoin’s momentum to attract users. FAQs About Bitcoin’s $100K Milestone Why are long-term holders selling Bitcoin now? Long-term holders often sell during price peaks to realize profits. Bitcoin’s surge past $100K presented a historic opportunity for early investors. Will Bitcoin’s price continue to rise? Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $145K by mid-2025, with the potential to hit $200K under optimal market conditions. What is the role of short-term holders in this rally? Short-term holders have absorbed selling pressure from long-term holders, sustaining the price momentum and ensuring liquidity. Is there truth to the U.S. Bitcoin reserve speculation? While unconfirmed, speculation about a U.S. Bitcoin reserve has fueled market optimism and underscores Bitcoin’s growing importance as a strategic asset. How does Bitcoin’s performance affect other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin’s success often drives interest in the broader crypto market, benefiting altcoins, DeFi projects, and NFTs. Conclusion Bitcoin’s climb past $100,000 marks a historic moment for the cryptocurrency market. As long-term holders realize record profits, short-term holders and new investors have stepped in to sustain the momentum. With strong market metrics, institutional adoption, and bullish analyst predictions, Bitcoin appears poised for further growth. The cryptocurrency’s role as a strategic asset continues to evolve, and its impact on the global financial landscape cannot be overstated.

XRP was hit particularly hard, plunging 10% and recording its steepest one-day loss since December 9. This significant decline has drawn sharp remarks from crypto critics, including Messari founder Ryan Selkis. Ryan Selkis Slams XRP Again Ryan Selkis of Messari didn’t mince words about XRP’s situation, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to share a biting comment. He humorously suggested it might now be the perfect time to buy XRP, noting that its valuation had fallen below the combined worth of major companies like Coinbase, MicroStrategy , and SoftBank. Now that XRP has fallen below the value of Coinbase, Microstrategy, and Softbank (combined), it's looking like a good buy again. — Ryan Selkis (d/acc) (@twobitidiot) December 19, 2024 His remark followed a previous criticism where he dismissed the XRP community as “worthless bot groups,” intensifying his ongoing criticism of the asset. The recent criticism seems to be a response to the backlash the former crypto executive received after attacking Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer , Stuart Alderoty, and the XRP community on the same day. XRP’s Price Slide: Market and Macro Factors XRP’s price has been heavily affected by the broader market slump, with the token losing 21% over the past two days. It fell from highs of $2.59 to lows of $2.05, signaling growing investor uncertainty. This decline coincided with the Federal Reserve’s announcement to reduce expected rate cuts for 2025. The news dampened optimism in risk markets, including cryptocurrencies, and has added to the bearish sentiment surrounding XRP. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP is trading around $2.16, reflecting a drop of 10% in the last 24 hours. Despite this decline, the price seems to have found strong support just below its current level, giving some hope to traders. Amid the drop, some analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s potential recovery. One of them, DarkDefender , noted a clear breakout on the daily chart. He predicts that XRP might first test $2.42 and, if momentum continues, push past $2.92. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ryan Selkis Slams XRP Amid 21% Price Crash: Finally a “Good Buy”? , FAQs How did the Fed’s announcement affect XRP?

This is wild. #Crypto is eating TradFi's lunch. 1. Coinbase: 11% of global exchange revenue, ranked 5th, ahead of Nasdaq. 2. DEXs: 5%, outranking HKEX & CBOE. 3. Total CEX revenue could hit parity with TradFi in 2024. 4. CEX and DEXs are growing 2.5-4x faster than TradFi. 5.… pic.twitter.com/JX59KnW5pi — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) December 17, 2024 Breaking Down the Numbers Coutts reported that Coinbase achieved $5.75 billion in transaction revenue over the past 12 months, outpacing NASDAQ’s $4.54 billion and HKEX’s $2.67 billion. Additionally, Coinbase outperformed Brazil’s Bolsa Balcão, which recorded $1.81 billion. However, it’s important to note that transaction fees differ significantly between platforms, such as fees for buying stocks versus cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. According to Coutts, global transaction revenues from major crypto, stock, and commodity exchanges amounted to $51.27 billion in the same period. Traditional Giants Still Lead Despite Coinbase’s strong performance, traditional financial powerhouses retain their lead in overall transaction revenue. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) topped the list with $10.82 billion, followed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)—operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)—with $9.16 billion. A Promising Future Ahead Mouloukou Sanoh, CEO of MANSA Finance, emphasized that Coinbase’s high transaction revenue stems from elevated fees rather than trading volume. “Coinbase is still significantly lower in terms of volume than all the exchanges listed in Coutts’ data. But because they charge higher fees, that’s where they have higher transaction revenue,” he said. A Long Way To Go “I feel like over the next 10 to 20 years is when we will see crypto exchanges completely flip traditional markets, but it’s still going to take a long time,” he noted. “But I would not be surprised if, at some point after the turn of the decade, Coinbase is the largest global exchange, both by volume and by trading revenue.” Sanoh also pointed out Coinbase’s potential for growth beyond the U.S. While Coinbase has a strong foothold domestically, its global presence has been limited. With anticipated regulatory shifts, Coinbase might target markets in Latin America, Africa, and Europe, driving future revenue and trading volume growth. Currently, Coinbase’s 24-hour trading volume of $10 billion pales in comparison to NASDAQ’s $445 billion. Nonetheless, cryptocurrency exchanges are expanding rapidly. Centralized and decentralized exchanges (CEXs and DEXs) are growing 2.5 to 4 times faster than traditional finance (TradFi) counterparts. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What Is Going On with Crypto Today: Is the Crypto Bull Run Over? , Trends to Watch in 2025 Coutts highlighted key developments that could redefine the financial sector by 2025: TradFi-Crypto Convergence: Traditional institutions may acquire CEXs or incorporate crypto services. CEX Listings on TradFi Exchanges: Centralized exchanges might pursue public listings and develop DEX platforms. Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA): This trend could significantly boost valuations across the sector. DeFi Expansion: Decentralized finance could grow 4-5 times, with some protocols outperforming major cryptocurrencies. Despite regulatory challenges, the crypto sector seems poised for significant growth and reevaluation. Coutts suggested that if valued like Coinbase, the CEX market could achieve a $749 billion market cap, surpassing TradFi’s $610 billion. As adoption and innovation accelerate, the next decade could bring transformative changes to both traditional and crypto markets, potentially positioning Coinbase as a dominant force in global finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37883450,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631047,1734702087,"Tech, stocks, AI, and Bitcoin 2025 market predictions","The curtains are drawing on 2024, and investors are already looking forward to what 2025 will bring. Crypto and stock market enthusiasts had a bitter time for the most part of the year, but recent rallies have made 2024 a little bit “palatable.” Recent reports show tech stocks, fueled by large-cap companies, have dominated Wall Street . The Nasdaq 100 Index ETF (QQQ) has soared 150% over the past five years, outpacing the Russell 2000 Index ETF (IWM), which rose only 47%. Meanwhile, the banking sector showed promising signs of continued strength, bolstered by Wall Street’s optimistic projections. As the S&P 500 continues to climb, strategists are targeting a year-end increase, with some predicting a rise of over 5,000 by the end of 2025. The crypto market went on a bull run after Donald Trump won the US presidential elections in November, with Bitcoin reaching a high of over $108,000. However, the market is currently in a correction phase, and investors are wondering whether the bullish trend will end this year or continue beyond 2025. From tech stocks to the immense potential of AI’s growth, here’s how the FY2025 may play out; Tech stocks predictions: 2025 could be the breakout year In 2024, large-cap technology companies have led the charge on Wall Street, outpacing other sectors in both earnings and performance. Over the past five years, the Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) has surged approximately 155%, far surpassing the small-cap Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which has gained just 47%. Even the short-term outlook for tech stocks looks “encouraging.” Source: EWF However, analysts are now predicting that small-cap stocks will outperform their larger counterparts in 2025 for a few key reasons. Firstly, the looming threat of President-elect Donald Trump’s tariffs could disrupt global supply chains, particularly impacting China, Mexico, and France. These tariffs would make foreign products more expensive, potentially shifting production and demand toward domestic suppliers, benefiting smaller companies. Additionally, small-cap stocks, as represented by the Russell 2000, are poised for a breakout after a lengthy three-year base pattern. This technical setup suggests that the index could be ready to play catch-up, especially as large-cap stocks face inevitable profit-taking. Despite a strong market performance in late 2024, analysts warn that a pullback may be due, especially given the historical pattern of corrections in even the most bullish of markets. Moreover, regulatory changes under the new administration could have a significant impact on tech mergers and acquisitions. With Trump-appointed Andrew Ferguson set to take the helm of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the environment surrounding M&As will likely become more lenient. This shift could benefit mid and small-cap companies, potentially fueling further market growth. Crypto forecasts: Signs already in play The crypto market is expected to experience transformative growth in 2025, building on the momentum gained in 2024. The largest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin, quickly rose above $100,000 after the November US presidential elections. Investors have witnessed a 120% year-to-date growth in the asset’s price. Bitcoin price chart. Source: TradingView Nations are predicted to follow El Salvador’s footsteps in embracing Bitcoin as a native currency, further solidifying its role as “digital gold.” This shift could trigger a massive increase in Bitcoin’s value, possibly pushing prices beyond $250,000 per coin. The US President-elect Trump’s early executive order designating Bitcoin as a reserve asset will pave the way for institutional adoption. The success of Bitcoin ETFs, which saw inflows exceeding $10 billion in 2024, is also likely to drive more diverse offerings in 2025. As large investors continue to buy into Bitcoin, the market is becoming increasingly liquid, stable, and credible, setting the stage for further growth. Expect additional ETF offerings for altcoins like Solana (SOL) and other Layer 1 tokens, which will boost institutional participation. Furthering the trend, major banks like JPMorgan and Citi are likely to introduce their own stablecoins, offering faster settlements and competitive yields tied to government treasuries. With the potential to capture 30% of the $150 billion stablecoin market, these bank-issued stablecoins will bolster the expansion of the crypto ecosystem. Legislative updates from Congress will also redefine securities law, expanding access to crypto assets for a broader range of investors. These changes will help bring more clarity to blockchain-based projects, potentially unlocking new growth opportunities for the entire sector. Bank stocks: Could the S&P 500 survive inflation? After a strong two-year run, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about the outlook for bank stocks in 2025. Despite concerns about market valuations, strategists are predicting continued growth for major indices like the S&P 500, with targets for 2025 pointing to gains of over 9%. Economic conditions, including robust earnings and a resilient economy, are expected to support this upward trend. S&P 500 Index. Source: TradingView However, some experts caution that valuations have become stretched, and investors should temper expectations for another blockbuster year. While some analysts predict a slight pullback in the second half of 2025, particularly in response to slower economic growth and inflation concerns, others remain bullish. Wall Street firms like Oppenheimer Asset Management and Deutsche Bank expect the S&P 500 to finish the year near 7,000, driven by corporate earnings and a favorable macroeconomic backdrop under President-elect Trump’s administration. In particular, defensive sectors like healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples are likely to outperform the market with slower growth as investors seek safer bets amid an aging bull market. Bank stocks may face increased scrutiny and regulatory oversight, but their strong fundamentals could still provide stability and growth opportunities in the long term. AI market: The industry will grow Despite skepticism about AI stocks in the fiscal year 2024, the market for artificial intelligence is poised for significant growth in 2025. The market was valued at $235.27 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $3.58 trillion by 2034, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.3%. According to the Polaris Market Research report , by 2025, over half of enterprises are expected to be at a “mature” stage in their AI adoption, which will spur further innovation and investment in AI technologies. However, political and regulatory factors are likely to shape the AI landscape in the coming year. President-elect Trump’s stance on big tech’s influence over content moderation, along with his plan to reverse the Biden administration’s AI executive order, could affect the trajectory of AI development. With a focus on reducing government intervention, Trump’s policies may enable more rapid deployment of AI technologies, particularly in the private sector. In terms of practical applications, AI is expected to enhance customer experiences by personalizing services and products, with businesses leveraging AI-driven predictive analytics to better anticipate consumers’ needs. Generative AI, in particular, will automate responses across various customer touchpoints, though concerns about data privacy and AI’s role in personalization will require continued attention. As consumer comfort with AI grows, so too will its influence on marketing and customer relationship management. With forecasts predicting strong growth, the AI market is likely to see a broadening of use cases, particularly in workforce transformation. AI will be increasingly integrated into work environments to support human productivity rather than replace workers. This evolution, alongside advancements in transparency around data usage, will help build trust and accelerate AI adoption across industries.

37883333,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112234,1734702059,El Salvador Adjusts Bitcoin Policies to Secure $3.5 Billion IMF Deal,"El Salvador Adjusts Bitcoin Policies to Secure $3.5 Billion IMF Deal El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, has made significant adjustments to its cryptocurrency policies as part of a $3.5 billion funding agreement. This deal includes $1.4 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), marking a pivotal step in the nation’s financial strategy while maintaining Bitcoin’s legal tender status. Bitcoin Policy Changes for IMF Compliance El Salvador’s government has agreed to modify several aspects of its Bitcoin policies to meet the IMF’s conditions for funding. These changes include: State-Run Chivo Wallet: Plans to either sell or dismantle the government-managed Chivo wallet, which previously played a key role in Bitcoin transactions. Voluntary Bitcoin Acceptance: Private-sector businesses are no longer required to accept Bitcoin as payment, making participation entirely optional. Tax Payments in USD: All tax obligations must now be settled in U.S. dollars, moving away from Bitcoin as an alternative payment method for taxes. Despite these concessions, Bitcoin will remain legal tender in El Salvador, and the government will continue its strategy of acquiring and holding Bitcoin in its national reserves. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Reserves As of now, El Salvador holds 5,968 BTC, valued at approximately $596 million. The government plans to bolster its Bitcoin reserves, leveraging the cryptocurrency’s long-term growth potential. While Bitcoin-related initiatives are being restructured, education programs and the development of cryptocurrency capital markets will proceed as planned, aiming to position El Salvador as a leader in digital currency innovation. Balancing Bitcoin Adoption and Economic Stability El Salvador’s bold experiment with Bitcoin has garnered international attention but also faced criticism from global financial institutions. The IMF had previously raised concerns about the risks associated with Bitcoin adoption, including financial instability and potential misuse for illicit activities. By implementing these policy changes, El Salvador seeks to strike a balance between its ambitious Bitcoin strategy and the requirements of traditional financial systems. Key Impacts of the Policy Adjustments 1. Chivo Wallet Restructuring The Chivo wallet, designed to facilitate Bitcoin transactions, has been at the center of El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption strategy. However, technical issues and low adoption rates among citizens prompted the government to rethink its approach. Selling or dissolving the wallet will align with the IMF’s recommendations while allowing private enterprises to step in with alternative wallet solutions. 2. Voluntary Bitcoin Acceptance Allowing businesses to opt out of accepting Bitcoin could improve relations with private-sector stakeholders, many of whom had expressed concerns about mandatory adoption. This move aligns El Salvador’s policies with global norms, where cryptocurrency usage is typically voluntary. 3. Taxation in USD Requiring taxes to be paid in U.S. dollars reduces the risks of price volatility associated with Bitcoin, providing greater stability for public finances. Future of Bitcoin in El Salvador Despite these changes, El Salvador remains committed to Bitcoin as part of its economic strategy. The government’s continued acquisition of Bitcoin reflects confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential as a store of value. Additionally, initiatives to educate citizens about cryptocurrency and foster a robust capital markets ecosystem highlight the government’s broader vision for integrating digital currencies into the economy. Global Reactions to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Policies El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey has been met with mixed reactions on the global stage. Advocates praise the nation’s pioneering efforts to embrace financial innovation, while critics highlight the economic risks and challenges of implementing a national cryptocurrency strategy. The recent concessions to the IMF may alleviate some concerns among international stakeholders, potentially paving the way for further financial support and investment. FAQs About El Salvador’s Bitcoin Policy Adjustments What changes are being made to El Salvador’s Bitcoin policies? The government is ending or selling the state-run Chivo wallet, making Bitcoin acceptance voluntary for private businesses, and requiring taxes to be paid in U.S. dollars. Is Bitcoin still legal tender in El Salvador? Yes, Bitcoin remains legal tender in El Salvador despite the policy adjustments. Why is El Salvador making these changes? The changes are part of a $3.5 billion funding agreement, including $1.4 billion from the IMF, which required adjustments to Bitcoin policies for compliance. What will happen to the Chivo wallet? The government plans to either sell or shut down the Chivo wallet, allowing private solutions to fill the gap. How much Bitcoin does El Salvador currently hold? El Salvador holds 5,968 BTC, valued at approximately $596 million. Conclusion El Salvador’s revised Bitcoin policies demonstrate its commitment to balancing innovation with economic stability. By addressing global concerns and securing significant funding, the nation aims to strengthen its economy while maintaining its pioneering role in cryptocurrency adoption. As the world watches El Salvador’s bold experiment unfold, the adjustments to its Bitcoin policies may serve as a model for other countries exploring the integration of digital assets into their financial systems.

37883268,https://crypto.news/?p=14321060,1734701926,ZKP voting promises to unlock mathematically secure democracies | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The 2024 US presidential election showcased the public’s growing enthusiasm for prediction markets and citizen journalism. However, while blockchain-backed offerings promise to empower citizens like never before, the most pressing issue impacting the future of our government remains voter privacy and security. Paper systems are costly and slow, and current electronic voting systems lack privacy, transparency and accessibility—undermining trust in democracy. You might also like: US voters gave a ‘pro-crypto’ mandate—what happens now? | Opinion Enter zero-knowledge proofs : a cryptographic method that ensures privacy-preserving, succinct, and unfalsifiable proofs that offer a transformative solution for national elections. By enabling verifiable, tamper-proof votes, ZKPs can revolutionize democratic processes, ensuring voter privacy, election integrity, and transparency without reliance on trusted authorities. ZKPs have the potential to unlock mathematically secure democracies. Understanding where and how paper ballots went wrong Despite technological advancements in every function of our everyday lives, the United States voting system still largely relies on paper ballots. In fact, in August of this year, it was projected that 98% of all votes for presidential candidates in November would be cast on paper. While paper systems are often seen as secure, they inherently require trust and leave voter data vulnerable to breaches, misuse, and identity theft. Additionally, traditional systems offer little transparency or mechanisms for voters to verify their vote’s integrity, fueling public scepticism and disinformation. For example, the 2020 US elections saw widespread allegations partly because voters lacked a reliable way to verify results independently. As we’ve seen, insecure systems erode trust and perpetuate myths about electoral integrity. How traditional methods of electronic voting offer flawed systems While electronic systems were introduced to modernize elections and reduce costs, they still pose a significant risk to fair elections and come with trade-offs in security and trust. That’s because these systems rely on centralized intermediaries, making them vulnerable to tampering, coercion and privacy violations. Early attempts to address these issues, such as blockchain-based systems, introduce decentralization and self-tallying. However, these blockchain-based systems often fell short of addressing scalability and securing voter’s personal information. The lack of any true privacy inherent to current decentralized blockchain technology runs the risk of compromising voter privacy, exposing both a voter’s identity and ballot choices, not unlike paper or traditional electronic systems. What’s needed is a technological system that can ensure voter integrity and privacy and prevent manipulation while reducing the data that’s stored on-chain—something that allows for faster and more efficient vote processing without compromising security. This is where ZKP technology stands out. By resolving the trade-offs between transparency and privacy while maintaining scalability, ZKPs provide a foundation for secure, verifiable, and efficient voting. Introducing ZK proofs: The next-gen solution to voter integrity ZKPs offer the very solution needed to protect voter privacy and enable scalable voting processes. That’s because ZKPs allow a voter to prove eligibility or vote validity without revealing their identity or vote choice, ensuring both privacy and integrity in the process. To do so, ZKPs rely on mathematical principles that enable the verification of claims, such as vote validity in elections, without disclosing any personal data or sensitive details. Additionally, ZK off-chain computations can address scalability issues in blockchain-based e-voting systems. By reducing on-chain storage requirements, this system makes handling large-scale elections feasible while maintaining transparency, privacy, and universal verifiability. Here’s a more in-depth look at how ZKPs can build mathematically secure democracies and resolve issues with existing electronic voting systems: 1. Protecting voter anonymity: ZKPs allow voters to authenticate the validity of their vote or other documentation without revealing underlying personal data or documents, thus protecting their privacy. This is made possible through the three components of the ZKP’s algorithm: completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge. Completeness works like this: a statement (X) is true, and both the prover and the verifier correctly follow the protocol, the verifier must accept the proof as true. The proof cannot be falsified, ensuring reliability. Similarly, the soundness component means that if the statement (X) is false, the verifier will not be convinced by the proof, even if everyone follows the protocol correctly. 2. Enabling decentralized record-keeping: In a ZKP system, a decentralized and transparent ledger (the blockchain) records votes, establishing accountability and security. 3. Ensuring voting transparency and integrity: ZKPs enable a collusion-resistant system that empowers voters to verify that their vote was accurately recorded in the tally without revealing their vote preferences, ensuring trust and integrity in the voting process. 4. Establishing mathematical security: ZKPs provide robust guarantees, confirming that the voting protocol is secure. Real-world applications of ZKPs in voting ZKP-based voting is no longer theoretical. In October 2024, Georgia’s leading opposition party, the United National Movement, launched “United Space,” an identity app built by Rarimo, a protocol specializing in decentralized digital identities. This app utilizes blockchain and ZKPs to ensure secure and anonymous voting, aiming to combat low voter turnout by rewarding participation and protecting voter identities. Other projects like zkPassport, Anon Aandhaar, and OpenPassport demonstrate the potential for integrating ZKPs into identity verification systems, proving attributed information like nationality or age without exposing privacy information. Existing limitations of ZKP-based identification While ZKPs offer groundbreaking potential for secure voting systems, they still face challenges, particularly their reliance on passports for verification. Passport ownership is not universal—only around 50% of the US population holds a valid passport, and rates are much lower in many developing countries. Moreover, passports lack biometric validation, making them susceptible to fraud through stolen or counterfeit documents. Corrupt issuing authorities could theoretically manipulate voting outcomes by creating invalid documents that nonetheless pass verification. Another fundamental challenge lies in the persistence of cryptographic signatures associated with revoked or replaced passports. Even when a document is no longer valid, its digital signature often remains usable, introducing a risk of misuse. Finally, many ZKP-based systems rely on a single point of verification—typically a passport—rather than aggregating attestations from multiple sources, such as national ID systems, banking institutions, or mobile carriers. This reliance increases the likelihood of system failures or manipulation. A solution to these challenges exists in expanding the sources of identity verification to include attestations from diverse and trusted attestors. Incorporating biometric validation into the passport verification process could significantly reduce risks associated with stolen or borrowed documents. Additionally, the development of cryptographic standards that allow for the invalidation of outdated signatures would address vulnerabilities posed by revoked or replaced documents. ZKPs represent a paradigm shift in secure voting, addressing vulnerabilities in traditional and blockchain-based systems. By enabling mathematically secure, privacy-preserving elections, ZKPs have the potential to foster trust, transparency, and participation in democratic processes. As ZKP technology evolves, it holds the potential to unlock democracies that are not only secure but also more inclusive, equitable, and participatory.

37883226,https://finbold.com/?p=221331,1734701756,Will Bitcoin crash below $90k?,"For the first time in many weeks, trading on Friday, December 20, raised the question of whether Bitcoin ( BTC ) will continue soaring like Led Zeppelin or if it will fall like a ‘lead zeppelin.’ Specifically, despite trading above $108,000 just days earlier – on December 17 – BTC collapsed to its press time price of $92,398 – a 9.52% 24-hour drop. BTC 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold Though the needle has moved somewhat in recent weeks, $92,000 has, on several occasions, been designated as the final stop before a plunge toward $85,000, most notably by the prominent cryptocurrency analyst on X , Ali Martinez. Can Bitcoin truly crash below $90,000? Indeed, unless the momentum shifts significantly, Bitcoin is in significant danger of a deeper collapse as it has already fallen beneath the highest support zone near $95,000 and is testing $92,000. Should it plunge even lower, its next potential bounceback level would be slightly above $88,000. Furthermore, as a cryptocurrency and stock analyst on X, Seth , who pointed out that the correction is ‘normal and healthy, also opined the immense liquidation in the early hours of December 20 could provide a ‘liquidations spring’ for a renewed rally. #Bitcoin possible path. what do you think? This is the 12H chart. $BTC consolidation is normal and healthy. Been warning you about this since Nov. Not financial advice DYOR https://t.co/1luP6bYwDn pic.twitter.com/BBarkggJ0o — Seth (@seth_fin) December 20, 2024 Despite the seemingly dire situation, it is worth pointing out that the current BTC performance mirrors the coin’s reaction to other recent external calamities, and should the mirroring continue, it remains likely the cryptocurrency will rebound. The press time downtrend was, by all accounts, triggered by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish announcements about 2025, detailing it now expects inflation will run higher and that there will be fewer interest rate cuts in the coming 12 months than was previously hoped. Why Bitcoin can still rally in 2025 During 2024, Bitcoin provided a similarly violent and bearish reaction on at least three occasions when faced with external shocks. In both early August and early September , there were deep yet brief drops on the news of the weakness of the labor market and the manufacturing sector. Similarly, BTC experienced a sharp downturn during ‘Operation True Promise 2,’ better known as the Iranian October missile attack on Israel. These historical examples indicate that the current downturn will likely be ephemeral and that, in the long run, Bitcoin’s upward path remains unobstructed. Therefore, it is unlikely the recent price predictions placing the cryptocurrency at $250,000 , $350,000 , and even as high as $800,000 next year have been invalidated. Simultaneously, they do open the doors to some longer-term concerns as, despite not annulling the 2024 bull market, they did debunk the argument that Bitcoin is a safe-haven asset akin to gold , at least for the time being.

The approval extends the access of traditional institutional investors to the two largest crypto assets through spot-based investment products. Franklin Templeton, Hashdex Hybrid ETH-BTC ETFs Approved According to a Dec. 19 notice , the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Hashdex Crypto Index US ETF, which will trade on the Nasdaq stock market. The Wall Street top financial cop also greenlighted the Franklin Crypto Index ETF to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. “The proportion of bitcoin and ether to be held by each Trust will be based on free-float market capitalizations,” the notice reads. Franklin Templeton’s updated filing, submitted earlier on Wednesday, was approved on an “accelerated basis” due to compliance with existing commodity-based trust share structures. The SEC also stated that the proposals satisfied the criteria of the Exchange Act, which requires ETF providers to have sufficient rules to deter fraudulent and manipulative actions and protect investors, among other requirements. More Dual Crypto ETFs Coming? Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, observed in an X post that it would be “interesting” to see if other issuers, including Wall Street giant BlackRock, will seek to introduce similar investment products following the SEC’s recent approval. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” Geraci added. The regulatory green light comes amid a Federal Reserve-spurred crypto market rout .

Emerging Threats in the Crypto Landscape While traditional hacking methods remain prevalent, 2024 saw a surge in advanced techniques driven by emerging technologies. 1. AI-Driven Phishing Attacks Artificial intelligence has become a tool for both defenders and attackers in the cybersecurity realm. Hackers have employed AI to create highly convincing phishing campaigns that can deceive even the most cautious users. These attacks often mimic legitimate communications from exchanges, prompting users to disclose sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. 2. Quantum Computing Threats Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize industries but poses a significant risk to cryptography. Experts warn that quantum machines could break traditional encryption algorithms, leaving crypto assets vulnerable. The rise of quantum threats has sparked discussions about the need for quantum-resistant protocols to secure blockchain networks. Why Crypto Scams and Hacks Are Increasing 1. Growing Popularity of Cryptocurrency The global adoption of cryptocurrencies has attracted not just investors but also cybercriminals. As more people and businesses enter the crypto space, hackers are incentivized to exploit vulnerabilities. 2. Inadequate Security Measures Many platforms, especially CeFi platforms, still lack robust security frameworks. This includes poor private key management, insufficient multi-factor authentication (MFA), and limited incident response plans. 3. Regulatory Gaps The absence of consistent global regulations for cryptocurrencies has created loopholes that cybercriminals exploit. Clear regulatory frameworks are necessary to address these challenges. Preventive Measures for Individuals and Businesses To safeguard against crypto scams and hacks, users and organizations need to adopt proactive measures. For Individuals: Use Hardware Wallets: Store your assets in cold wallets to prevent online theft. Enable MFA: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts. Beware of Phishing: Always verify the source of emails and messages before clicking links. For Businesses: Conduct Regular Audits: Perform frequent security checks on smart contracts and systems. Implement Advanced Security Protocols: Use quantum-resistant encryption and AI-driven monitoring tools. Educate Employees: Train staff to recognize and respond to cyber threats effectively. Quantum-Safe Protocols: A Necessary Evolution As the crypto industry braces for the advent of quantum computing, integrating quantum-safe algorithms has become a top priority. These protocols are designed to withstand attacks from quantum machines, ensuring the long-term security of blockchain networks. Leading projects are already exploring quantum-resistant cryptography, paving the way for a more secure digital future. The Role of Industry Collaboration Collaboration among crypto platforms, regulators, and cybersecurity experts is essential to counter growing threats. Key initiatives include: Information Sharing: Regularly exchange intelligence about emerging threats and vulnerabilities. Standardized Protocols: Develop industry-wide standards for security practices. Global Regulation: Work towards unified regulations to close legal loopholes. FAQs on Crypto Scams and Hacks What are the most common types of crypto scams in 2024? Phishing, private key breaches, and smart contract exploits are among the most common types of scams. How can I protect my assets from phishing attacks? Use strong passwords, enable MFA, and avoid clicking on suspicious links or emails. Are decentralized platforms safer than centralized ones? Decentralized platforms eliminate single points of failure, but they are not immune to smart contract vulnerabilities. What are quantum-safe protocols? Quantum-safe protocols are encryption methods designed to resist attacks from quantum computers. What should I do if I fall victim to a crypto scam? Report the incident to the platform and local authorities immediately. Seek help from blockchain forensics firms to trace stolen assets. Will regulations help reduce crypto scams? Yes, consistent global regulations can provide a framework for accountability and enhance security standards. Conclusion The surge in crypto scams and hacks in 2024 serves as a stark reminder of the challenges facing the digital asset industry. However, with advanced security measures, quantum-safe protocols, and collaborative efforts, the industry can mitigate these risks and build a safer ecosystem for users worldwide. As we look to 2025, staying informed and proactive will be crucial in navigating the evolving crypto landscape.

37883013,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375491,1734701488,Craig Wright Receives One-Year Suspended Sentence for Defying Court Orders,"Craig Wright, who has repeatedly and falsely claimed to be Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was handed a one-year suspended sentence in the United Kingdom for five counts of contempt of court. The computer scientist was also fined £145,000, approximately $180,000 for his actions. Wright Breached Court Order During a December 19 hearing, Judge James Mellor ruled that the Australian national had breached a court order by filing lawsuits against Bitcoin developers. Despite a prior order to stop all legal actions against the programmers, Wright defied the ruling in October by initiating cases worth more than $1.2 trillion. He also repeated his discredited claim of being Nakamoto. Jonathan Hough KC, representing the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), a nonprofit group of cryptocurrency companies, highlighted this defiance, stating that Wright’s actions were intended to inflict “maximum possible distress.” Hough also told the court that the 54-year-old’s behavior had caused significant harm, describing his legal threats as a form of “terrorism” against developers and bloggers. He argued that his recent lawsuits were a “desperate publicity stunt” to keep his supporters engaged. The former Charles Sturt University researcher had even accused the judiciary of bias, suggesting he was a victim of the British aristocracy due to using the term “Lord” in prior judgments. However, Judge Mellor dismissed these allegations and found his contempt proven “beyond reasonable doubt.” The latest development follows a March ruling in which another UK judge rejected Wright’s claims of being Nakamoto. His ongoing claims of intellectual property rights related to Bitcoin were previously dismissed by the legal system, which found that he faked evidence to support his assertions. The court described his tactics as “forgeries on a grand scale” and his explanations as “technobabble.” It also noted that the real Satoshi Nakamoto, who is believed to own one million Bitcoin, is likely a billionaire. In July, the false Bitcoin creator appeared to acknowledge this outcome by posting a tweet that said he was not the creator of the OG digital asset. Details From the Court Appearance According to a report from the Guardian, Wright participated in the hearing via video link from an undisclosed location in Asia, refusing to reveal his whereabouts. He also declined to attend in person, demanding £240,000 ($300,000) to cover his expenses and lost earnings before complying with the order. The courtroom was also packed during the hearing, with one onlooker wearing a T-shirt reading: “This is just an elaborate fiction.” Judge Mellor had previously criticized the Brisbane-born software engineer’s credibility in a high court ruling in May, describing him as “an extremely slippery witness” who had repeatedly lied to the public. Meanwhile, Wright announced his intention to appeal his sentencing following the judgment.

37924032,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/we-asked-chatgpt-what-the-best-crypto-is-to-buy-this-december-for-10x,1734701455,We Asked ChatGPT What The Best Crypto Is To Buy This December For 10x?,"Amid the recent market correction after Bitcoin failed to maintain momentum following its all-time high, investors have been cautious. To navigate the uncertainty, we consulted ChatGPT for insights on the next three cryptos to watch ahead of the anticipated 2025 bull rally. Hyped to give 10x gains, the top choices are Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), and the gaming token Yeti Ouro (YETIO). As different in purpose and outlook, these tokens offer great investment prospects for the future. Dogecoin (DOGE) Recovery And Consolidation Trends Dogecoin price is at around $0.35, which is a crucial support level that is also in line with the 50-day EMA and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. If $0.35 support is to be breached, the price is projected to rise to $0.41; that is a 13.5% rise. However, bearish pressure remains intact, with RSI below 50 and the chances of the price dipping to $0.31 in case of a support breakdown. On the macro chart, Dogecoin has been oscillating between oversold and overbought zones. Having recently left the oversold zone, DOGE price is projected to reach the overbought zone at $8–$10, marking the cycle’s potential peak. Analysts foresee a future floor price between $0.8 and $1.8, presenting a buying opportunity for the next cycle. Social sentiment remains robust, and a decisive break away from consolidation may trigger long-term gains of 10X. Source X Solana (SOL) Sustained Growth Amid Resistance Levels Solana has demonstrated strong growth in 2024, with the price reaching its yearly peak of $263 in November. However, over the past 30 days, it has faced resistance, with its price declining by 10%. Currently Solana price is trading at approximately $217, Solana’s technical indicators present a mixed outlook. The 200-day EMA points to the possibility of bullish momentum if Solana holds support near $200. Key resistance levels at $228 and $250 will be crucial for determining its next upward move. The institutional interest in Solana continues to be robust owing to the high activities in decentralized finance and non-fungible token sectors. According to crypto analyst Jelle, SOL price has the potential to climb to $300 by early 2025 and go as high as $500 in the future with the increase in adoption and further development of the ecosystem. Source X Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Rising Star In Play-to-Earn Gaming Yeti Ouro is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming token that is becoming popular during its presale. In the second presale round, 3,768,670 tokens were sold, and $64,067 was collected. Tokens are currently priced at $0.017, with 3.8% of the stage completed. The first presale phase sold out, raising $1.2 million and delivering over 40% returns to early investors. The token’s potential is tied to Yeti Go, a P2E racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. Featuring AAA-quality graphics and advanced audio technology, the game aims to attract a large gaming audience. Yeti Ouro has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, with a burn mechanism to enhance scarcity. Analysts predict YETIO could trade between $0.50 and $1.00 by late 2024 and reach $3.00 in 2025, contingent on Yeti Go’s success and growing demand for P2E platforms. Yeti Ouro has recently announced a meme contest! The top prize is $2,000 for first place, $1,000 for second place, and $500 for third place.

37884526,https://invezz.com/?p=2397928,1734701451,"Crypto custodian Copper drops UK licensing plans, eyes US and global expansion","Barclays-backed cryptocurrency custody firm Copper Technologies is scaling back its efforts to secure an operating license in the United Kingdom to focus elsewhere. According to a December 20 Bloomberg report , Copper has withdrawn its application to be licensed and regulated under the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The London-based firm will focus on expanding to other global hubs despite being one of the largest crypto-based businesses in the UK. The new strategy will be spearheaded by the new CEO, Amar Kuchinad, who took over the role in October after former CEO and founder Dmitry Tokarev stepped down. Kuchinad, who previously served as a managing director at Goldman Sachs and a senior policy advisor with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, said that refining the company’s “global growth strategy” has been his “priority” since taking on the role, requiring “key decisions” to shape its “direction and approach.” Kuchinand is overseeing ClearLoop, the firm’s off-exchange settlement solution and will also work on strengthening the firm’s presence in the US, where it plans to seek regulatory custodial or money-transmitter licenses. Beyond the US, the Copper is seeking operational licenses in Switzerland, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi to drive its “institutional first” approach. Founded in 2018, Copper offers institutional investors exposure to the cryptocurrency market through its secure custody solutions, trading infrastructure, and settlement services, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. The company failed to secure permanent registration with the FCA back in 2022, which prompted it to shift to this new strategy. Despite setbacks, Copper has continued to expand its offerings over the past year, most recently adding support for the USDC stablecoin on the Sui blockchain, becoming one of the first digital asset custodians to integrate the stablecoin on the layer-1 network. Earlier this year, it enabled staking support for the Mina Protocol, prior to which it partnered with proof of stake blockchain Hedera. Enhancing transparency in the crypto sector Meanwhile, in the UK, Copper joins a flurry of other firms that have failed to register with FCA due to not meeting its stringent licensing standards. According to the regulator, 90% of crypto firms have implemented poor anti-money laundering standards, which led to only 4 out of 35 applicants being approved in 2024 and 15 withdrawing their applications. On December 16, the FCA unveiled a proposal that would introduce stricter rules for admissions and disclosures, requiring authorized firms to provide accurate and transparent information when listing crypto-assets on trading platforms. The proposal aims to enhance market integrity and reduce the risk of market manipulation, thereby creating a secure marketplace for investors as it continues to view cryptocurrencies as high-risk investments. As a part of the UK government’s bid to enhance transparency in the crypto space, the Bank of England recently mandated that businesses holding or planning to hold crypto assets in their balance sheets must report their exposure to the Prudential Regulation Authority.

37883044,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395694,1734701428,Why Is Dogecoin Crashing? Market Trends and Whale Activity Explained,"The post Why Is Dogecoin Crashing? Market Trends and Whale Activity Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s recent 11.25% drop has shaken the entire crypto market, causing significant declines across the board. Dogecoin, the original memecoin, suffered one of the steepest falls, plunging 32% over the past three days. As of today, Dogecoin is down 20.7% in the last 24 hours alone, creating opportunities for short sellers and long-term investors alike. Let’s examine what’s driving these moves and what could come next. DOGE Metrics According to data from DeFiLlama, Dogecoin’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped sharply by 32.65% in the past three days. On December 17, the TVL was $8.82 million, but it has since fallen to $5.94 million. Open interest (OI) in Dogecoin has also decreased significantly. On December 9, OI stood at $4.34 billion when DOGE was priced at $0.45. Now, with the price below $0.30, OI has halved to $2.26 billion, signaling reduced activity and confidence among traders. Source : Tradingview A Look at the Technicals Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.28, with its nearest support level at $0.27, backed by the 100-day moving average (MA). It has slipped below the 20-day and 50-day MAs, while the 200-day MA sits lower at $0.17. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.15, indicating that DOGE is in oversold territory. This could attract whales and large investors looking to buy at discounted prices. Whale Activity In Focus Coinglass data reveals that Dogecoin remains in a risky zone despite recent attempts at recovery. Whale orders and large trades dominate, with many traders holding substantial short positions. Source : Coinglass At the current price, a majority of short trades have been fulfilled. This creates the potential for an upward price spike, possibly targeting high-leverage traders. Such sudden moves are common in volatile markets, so traders should approach with caution and implement strong risk management strategies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Markets Plunging Down as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Drops Below $94,000; Has the $90,000 Targets Activated? , What Traders Should Watch Dogecoin often mirrors Bitcoin’s price movements, and this trend continues. As Bitcoin attempts to stabilize and recover, Dogecoin may follow. However, the possibility of further declines remains. New buying pressure could help push Dogecoin’s price higher, but the overall market remains uncertain. The ripple effect from Bitcoin’s decline is one of the primary reasons behind Dogecoin’s sharp drop. During volatile periods like these, leverage trading is especially risky. Traders are advised to be cautious, stick to proper risk management, or avoid leverage altogether. On the other hand, long-term investors may find this an opportunity to dollar-cost average, building their positions gradually. Dogecoin’s next moves depend heavily on Bitcoin’s performance and broader market sentiment.

37883051,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99179,1734701427,Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Largest Daily Outflows Of All Time As Major Sell-Off Rocks Crypto Market,"US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their largest-ever single-day outflow on Thursday amid a devastating crypto market bloodbath, with Bitcoin and other major digital coins shedding a chunk of their recent gains as the market continues a correction that began on Wednesday following the FOMC meeting. BTC ETFs Snap 15-Day Positive Flow Streak Roughly $671.9 million exited spot BTC exchange-traded funds on Dec. 19, ending a period of net inflows that started 15 days ago, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. Fidelity’s FBTC led the negative flows, with $208.5 million leaving the fund. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust logged $188.6 million in outflows and ARK and 21Shares ARKB recorded $108.4 million in outflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Bitwise’s BITB also posted withdrawals, with GBTC losing $87.9 million and BITB shedding $43.6 million. BlackRock’s IBIT, the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF by assets under management, recorded zero flows yesterday. WisdomTree’s BTCW was the only ETF among the dozen funds to post positive flows, attracting $2 million in investor money. BTC ETF Investment Inflows Coincide With Crypto Sell-Off The spot Bitcoin ETF outflows aligned with a massive sell-off in Bitcoin’s price following a hawkish FOMC where Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at only a few rate cuts in 2025. Powell then said at a post-FOMC press conference that the central bank wasn’t allowed to own any Bitcoin under current laws — in response to a question about President-elect Donald Trump’s strategic BTC reserve promises. According to CoinGecko , Bitcoin nosedived to a current price of $93,550, just days after rocketing to a new historic peak above $108,000. The benchmark crypto is now down 9% on the day — but other high-cap digital assets are experiencing bigger losses. Ethereum has plummeted by nearly 13% on the day at a current price of $3,217, while the Ripple-promoted XRP has almost matched its crash with a 12.4% dip, changing hands for $2.10 at press time. Meanwhile, the industry’s oldest and largest meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 22% over the last 24 hours, trading at $0.2838. And Solana’s SOL has collapsed below the psychologically important $200 line, sinking by 12.1% to a current price of $183.23.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etfs-record-largest-daily-outflows-of-all-time-as-major-sell-off-rocks-crypto-market/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37884525,https://invezz.com/?p=2397974,1734701273,Bitcoin plummets 9% amidst market jitters and Fed’s hawkish tone,"Bitcoin experienced a sharp sell-off on Friday, plummeting 9% as broader investor caution towards risk assets took hold. The cryptocurrency’s dramatic reversal highlights the sensitivity of digital assets to macroeconomic signals and market sentiment, amidst a broader atmosphere of unease across various asset classes. Bitcoin traded at approximately $92,808.07 by 6:57 a.m. ET on Friday, a significant drop from its price of over $102,000 just 24 hours prior, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency had only recently hit an all-time high above $108,000 earlier this week, before succumbing to a wave of aggressive selling. This rapid shift underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The Fed’s Impact The Federal Reserve’s recent signals regarding a reduced number of interest rate cuts next year have rattled markets, triggering a pullback in risk assets. This shift in monetary policy has also impacted equity markets and has filtered through to crypto assets. With some markets already on edge due to the Fed’s outlook, some of the steam has come out of assets that have seen big gains this year. Bitcoin, despite having more than doubled in price this year, was not immune to these effects. The price gains were supported by factors such as the launch of spot exchange-traded funds and the election of Donald Trump, whose pro-crypto policies had helped propel Bitcoin to its latest record high. Beyond Bitcoin Bitcoin’s sudden decline also dragged down other cryptocurrencies. Ether was down around 15%, and XRP plunged 17% from 24 hours prior by 7:14 a.m. ET. This broad decline highlights the interconnectedness of the crypto market and the vulnerability of digital assets to shifts in overall investor sentiment and broader market trends. Furthermore, Tesla, which was another big beneficiary of Trump’s election, continued its post-election slide with shares falling on Friday in premarket trading. Other big names like Nvidia were also lower during the session. Fed’s position on Bitcoin reserves: Powell’s remarks Bitcoin’s price also took a hit after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish tone and comments on the potential of a Bitcoin reserve. During a press conference on Wednesday, Powell stated that the US central bank has no intention of being involved in any government efforts to stockpile large amounts of Bitcoin. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin,” he said, following the Fed’s two-day policy meeting. While the Fed cut rates as expected, it also signaled a less certain monetary policy path in the coming months. Regarding the legal issues of holding Bitcoin, Powell noted, “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Powell’s remarks came in response to discussions about a potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which could be pursued once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.

Rexas Finance (RXS), SEI, and Algorand (ALGO) stand out for their strong fundamentals and innovative offers. With excellent presale updates, technical advances, and market confidence, these coins could rise above $5 while Dogecoin remains stagnant. Rexas Finance (RXS): On Track to Hit $5 Faster than Dogecoin Rexas Finance (RXS) pioneers real-world asset (RWA) tokenization in cryptocurrencies. It uses blockchain to allow fractional ownership and sale of highly priced assets like real estate, commodities, and artwork. This strategy has gained substantial traction, with investors complementing its strong ecosystem and unique approach. The ongoing Rexas Finance presale has been a huge success, with Stage 10 being 92% complete. Each RXS token is now valued at $0.15 and will rise to $0.175 in the next stage. The presale has already collected a whopping $28.5 million and sold 359 million tokens. Once all presale phases are completed, RXS will be listed on at least three of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges for $0.20 per token. Analysts predict that the listing would spark a rally, initially driving the token's price to $5 and maybe $10 by the end of 2025. The presale's success is partly due to its decision to avoid venture capital (VC) backing and go public. This decision has enabled Rexas Finance to create an active and involved community, promoting its long-term expansion. It also ensures the token's long-term stability, as the fear of large dumping is commonly seen in VC-funded projects. The project's ecosystem comprises a no-code Token Builder, AI-powered Rexas GenAI for NFT development, the QuickMint Bot for rapid token deployment, and the Rexas Treasury, which optimizes yields across several chains. These features improve accessibility and scalability, making RXS a desirable asset. Certik's recent audit underlines the project's emphasis on security. Rexas Finance is giving early investors a huge prize. The top twenty participants in the ongoing $1 million giveaway will earn $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. With over 550,000 entries, this contest boosts Rexas Finance's visibility by encouraging community interaction and rewarding early investment. Rexas Finance, a game changer with a $326 trillion RWA tokenization market, is one of the most promising discounted coins. SEI: Designed for Scalability and Speed SEI, a layer-1 blockchain, will become popular in 2024 thanks to its role in DeFi and NFTs. It excels in speed and scalability, completing transactions in under 0.5 seconds. This makes it a good Ethereum alternative, whose congestion issues irritate users. Market analysts note SEI's potential to profit from institutional-grade DeFi solutions, citing its native order-matching engine and cross-chain flexibility. These capabilities have established SEI as the go-to platform for high-frequency trading, which standard blockchains struggle to support. SEI's latest surge saw its price rise to $0.32, a 300% increase from its 2023 lows. Analysts such as Matthew Hobbs of ChainEdge believe SEI's price forecast will rise to $1.50 by mid-2025 as DeFi use increases. If SEI breaks crucial resistance at $0.50 in the coming months, it could pave the way for exponential growth, potentially exceeding $5 in a bullish scenario. Algorand: Poised for a Long-Term Breakout Algorand is not new to the limelight, especially for its solid institutional support and a history of technical innovation. Popular for its energy-efficient PoS system, Algorand is a preferred choice for uses stressing scalability and sustainability. Thanks mostly to DeFi apps like Folks Finance, its total value locked (TVL) rose by 300% in Q4 2024, culminating at $244.7 million. As of this writing, ALGO is trading at $0.4965, indicating an upward trend aided by strong network activity and the ability to stay above important moving averages. Analysts are optimistic about ALGO's long-term prospects. Steph Is Crypto, a notable analyst, projects a surge to $1.26 in the next months and $5 during the next crypto cycle. Algorand's most recent developments include tokenized assets such as NVIDIA stocks and S&P 500 trackers, which showcase its capacity to connect traditional finance with blockchain technology. Furthermore, its foray into tokenizing collectibles like Pokémon cards has created new markets for blockchain adoption. Conclusion While Dogecoin holders wait for the next surge, Rexas Finance , SEI, and Algorand are making waves in the crypto market with strong fundamentals and attractive price objectives. These ventures could go above $5 with their inventive ideas, leaving meme currencies in the dust. Rexas Finance stands out among the three due to its full ecosystem, strategic exchange listings, and concentration on real-world asset tokenization. For investors looking for long-term gain, RXS has the potential to reinvent decentralized finance and produce remarkable returns.

IMF Loan Forces Bitcoin Adjustments in El Salvador El Salvador reached a $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF, agreeing to limit Bitcoin-related activities. Companies can now voluntarily accept Bitcoin, and public sector involvement in cryptocurrency will be scaled back. The government will also reduce its role in managing the Chivo wallet, while taxes will continue to be collected in US dollars.

Despite these changes, El Salvador remains committed to Bitcoin, continuing its daily cryptocurrency purchases. Critics argue that over 90% of Salvadorans do not use Bitcoin for transactions, reflecting limited adoption. Nonetheless, the loan agreement signals a compromise, ensuring continued IMF support while maintaining a Bitcoin-centric strategy. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bearish Momentum Prevails Bitcoin is trading at $93,740, marking a steep 8% decline in 24 hours as selling pressure surges. The 24-hour trading volume reached $118.6 billion, reflecting intense market activity. Key support levels are at $90,780 and $88,730, with resistance at $97,810 and $100,760.

While market leaders like XRP and Solana (SOL) continue to dominate the spotlight, a new contender is gaining traction Lightchain AI (LCAI). With its groundbreaking blockchain-AI integration and an ambitious roadmap, LCAI is shaping up to be the next big thing. Investors are already turning their attention to the Lightchain AI Presale , a rare opportunity to get in early on a project positioned for 25x gains by early 2025. Don’t miss your chance to join this game-changing movement. XRP’s Journey to $5 Challenges Ahead XRP has made big steps in getting clear rules, which has been a main reason for helping trust from buyers and pushing its cost near $2. ͏This step shows a big point for the digital money, placing it as a trusted choice in the market. But, XRP's ongoing need for large firms and foreign payment systems might hold back its growth limit since its use stays quite small next to other new tools in blockchain area. XRP's path looks steady and hopeful for the near future but it does not reach the big change shown by things like Lightchain AI, which uses smart AI-driven blockchain answers to change how shared systems work giving wider and more flexible uses. Solana’s ATH Aspirations Solana has built a strong reputation for its high-speed transactions and low fees, making it a favorite among DeFi and NFT platforms. Its unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism has set it apart, enabling faster processing times compared to many other blockchains. This has attracted developers and users alike, bolstering its ecosystem and positioning it as a serious contender in the crypto space. However, scalability challenges, such as network outages during periods of high activity, and increasing competition from other Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Cardano, may dampen its ability to replicate its previous all-time high (ATH). The platform’s long-term potential will likely depend on how effectively it can address these issues while continuing to innovate and attract new projects. How XRP and Solana Compare to LCAI XRP Focused but LimitedWhile XRP continues to excel in cross-border payments, it faces competition from alternative financial solutions like stablecoins. Additionally, its centralized partnerships may limit its appeal in the era of decentralization-driven innovation. Solana Rapid but ChallengedSolana is still a leading blockchain for DeFi and NFTs, but its focus on speed has led to occasional network outages. Additionally, its ability to integrate emerging technologies like AI remains limited compared to the advanced AI-blockchain fusion that Lightchain AI offers. These challenges highlight the potential for Lightchain AI to surpass both XRP and Solana in terms of overall growth and innovation. As a next-generation blockchain platform, LCAI offers unprecedented capabilities that effectively address the limitations faced by other projects, making it a top contender for exponential gains in the coming years. How Lightchain AI is Changing the Game Lightchain AI’s pioneering approach to blockchain integration with artificial intelligence presents a more secure, efficient, and scalable solution for decentralized systems. By leveraging AI algorithms, LCAI provides advanced consensus mechanisms and real-time fault diagnosis capabilities that enable lightning-fast transactions while minimizing network congestion. In addition, Lightchain AI’s compatibility with smart contracts allows for the development of complex decentralized applications (DApps), opening up an expansive range of possible use cases beyond traditional payment systems. This versatility sets Lightchain AI apart from other projects in the space and positions it as a leader in innovation. Lightchain AI’s Roadmap A Clear Path to Success Lightchain AI’s ambitious roadmap ensures consistent development and adoption. 2024 Prototype development for the AIVM and PoI, focusing on use cases like predictive analytics and decentralized healthcare. Early 2025 Testnet launch with enterprise partnerships and developer incentives. Mid-2025 Mainnet rollout, introducing cross-chain integrations and enhanced scalability features. Late 2025 Expansion into tokenized AI solutions, creating new revenue streams for developers and enterprises. Each milestone strengthens Lightchain AI’s position as a market leader, making it a strong contender against XRP and Solana. What Analysts Are Saying About LCAI Crypto analysts are increasingly optimistic about Lightchain AI’s potential, highlighting its cutting-edge technology and attractive early-stage pricing as major factors driving its growth. Unlike many projects in the crowded crypto landscape, LCAI stands out with its innovative approach to leveraging AI and blockchain, appealing to investors looking for the next big opportunity. While established assets like XRP and Solana continue to provide stability and long-term value, LCAI’s projected ability to deliver 25x gains by early 2025 makes it a standout option for those focused on high-growth opportunities. For investors willing to take calculated risks, Lightchain AI could become a game-changing addition to their portfolio. The Next Big Player in Crypto While XRP and Solana have solidified their positions in the cryptocurrency market, they face challenges that may limit their growth potential. On the other hand, Lightchain AI's innovative approach to blockchain integration with artificial intelligence presents a promising solution for the limitations faced by other projects. With its ambitious roadmap and increasing recognition from analysts, LCAI has the potential to become a major player in the crypto space, providing investors with high-growth opportunities. As always, it is important for investors to thoroughly research and assess any investment before making decisions. However, with Lightchain AI's impressive technology and projected growth potential, it may be worth keeping an eye on as it continues on its journey towards revolutionizing decentralized systems. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

In a recent interview, Lummis outlined his vision for a federal Bitcoin reserve, noting its potential to serve as both a hedge against inflation and a long-term savings mechanism. Senator Lummis proposed that the US government purchase 200,000 Bitcoins per year for five years, for a total of one million Bitcoins. This reserve would be held for at least twenty years and could be worth an estimated $16 trillion. “I want our federal government to have a strategic Bitcoin reserve that can help support the US dollar as the world reserve currency and serve as a long-term savings account,” Lummis said. “This can help offset our national debt, which currently exceeds $36 trillion.” The senator suggested that the purchases could be funded with existing assets already held by the federal government. Lummis also suggested that the approximately 200,000 Bitcoins currently held by the government be disposed of through asset seizures, and that these assets be consolidated into reserves. Related News: Giant Whale Also Lose: Stop-Loss Activated on Altcoin Trade, Where He Previously Made Millions of Dollars in Profit, Sold at a Loss Despite Bitcoin’s relative volatility and 15-year history, Lummis believes it’s the right asset for the job. Describing Bitcoin as “digital gold,” Lummis noted its limited supply of 21 million coins and its historically high value. “Over the long term, Bitcoin’s growth has far outpaced the ability of the US dollar to keep pace,” Lummis said. “While the US dollar is designed to depreciate with a 2% inflation target, Bitcoin is designed to appreciate, providing a hedge against inflation and a stronger asset over time.” While acknowledging Bitcoin’s short-term volatility, Lummis argued that its long-term growth potential makes it an important asset for the country’s fiscal strategy. When asked why such a move had not been considered by the Fed before, Lummis explained that current law does not authorize the Fed to hold Bitcoin. “We need to give them that authority,” he said. Lummis also dismissed concerns about Bitcoin’s volatility, arguing that BTC’s rise over time offsets short-term fluctuations. He added that the reserve would provide the U.S. with a powerful asset to help stabilize the dollar and reduce the national debt burden. *This is not investment advice.

Lightchain AI Price Predictions for the Coming Bull Run,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, investors are on the lookout for groundbreaking projects with exceptional growth potential. Lightchain AI (LCAI) has quickly gained attention as a standout contender, seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to solve key challenges such as scalability, security, and efficiency—issues that have long plagued traditional blockchain platforms. Currently available at just $0.003 per token during its presale phase, Lightchain AI presents a highly accessible opportunity for investors aiming to leverage its unique value proposition. With its cutting-edge features and well-crafted strategic roadmap, analysts foresee exponential growth for LCAI, with the potential to outperform established cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) by 2025. For those seeking to get in early on what could become the next major success in the crypto space, Lightchain AI stands out as an exciting and compelling investment prospect. In this article, we will delve deeper into the potential of Lightchain AI and explore why it may be worth considering for your investment portfolio in 2025. Understanding Lightchain AI's Unique Proposition Lightchain AI sets itself apart by bringing together smart computer powers (AI) with block chain tech, solving problems of size, safety, and speed found in old block chain systems. At its center, Lightchain AI shows the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) way of agreement, which gives rewards to units for doing useful AI tasks like model learning, guessing, and making things better. This way encourages real help to AI growth while keeping network safety. At the heart of the system is the Sm͏art Machine (SM), a lively computing layer made to carry out AI jobs smoothly on the blockchain. Different from fixed systems, the SM grows through teamwork of a worldwide group of builders, allowing instant AI model training and shared data analysis right on the blockchain. With a thorough plan aiming for full launch by 2025, Lightchain AI hopes to change fields like health care, money, and supply chain management; it offers a fresh time of clever blockchain applications. The Potential for Exponential Growth Lightchain AI's strategic roadmap sets the stage for remarkable growth in the years ahead. Through planned partnerships, collaborations, and innovative product launches, analysts anticipate rapid global adoption and widespread utilization of its technology. By addressing real-world challenges and delivering practical solutions, Lightchain AI aims to establish itself as a leading choice for businesses integrating AI with blockchain. Furthermore, the presale phase offers an attractive opportunity for investors, with the token's low entry price providing strong potential for significant returns. As demand for Lightchain AI's solutions increases, the token value is expected to grow substantially, promising lucrative rewards for early adopters. Is Lightchain AI Worth Investing in for 2025? Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents a compelling investment opportunity for 2025, integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology to address scalability, security, and efficiency challenges. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables real-time AI model training and decentralized analytics directly on the blockchain, facilitating the development of intelligent decentralized applications (dApps). The tokenomics of LCAI are designed for sustainability and growth, with a total supply capped at 10 billion tokens. The presale allocates 40% of tokens to early supporters, 28.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity pools, 5% to marketing and partnerships, 6.5% to the treasury, and 5% to the team, ensuring equitable distribution and long-term value. A deflationary mechanism is in place, where a portion of transaction fees and staking rewards are periodically burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing token value over time. The roadmap outlines key milestones, including prototype development, testnet rollout, mainnet launch, and global adoption phases, with the mainnet launch targeted for March 2025. These strategic plans position Lightchain AI for substantial growth, making it a noteworthy consideration for investors seeking high-growth potential in the evolving crypto landscape. Price Predictions for the Coming Bull Run As the cryptocurrency market prepares for the next bull run, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is gaining attention for its potential to deliver substantial returns. With increasing interest in AI and blockchain integrations, experts predict that LCAI could see significant price growth in 2025. As more investors recognize the platform’s unique value proposition and its roadmap unfolds, LCAI's presale price of $0.003 could multiply exponentially. Given the deflationary mechanisms in place, including token burns, and the expected rise in adoption as the mainnet launch approaches, analysts forecast LCAI could experience a 10x or even 20x price increase. As industries such as finance, healthcare, and supply chains continue to embrace decentralized AI solutions, LCAI’s innovative approach positions it as a strong contender for market outperformance during the upcoming bull run. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Such a rally would erase a zero from the current value of the token. Investor gives targets for XRP Armando Pantojo, a cryptocurrency investor, has outlined his price targets for XRP . According to him, the Ripple coin price could surge to $3.87, and then a sharp rise to $8 in the coming weeks. He expects FOMO to rise sharply when the price of the Ripple coin pumps to between $10 and $12. In another tweet, the crypto investor highlighted some major factors that could push the value of the Ripple token up. One of them is the potential approval of XRP ETFs which could occur next year. Another factor he mentioned was the end of the rift between Ripple and the US SEC. At the moment, the Ripple price is consolidating between $2.27 and $2.70 on the weekly timeframe. The cryptocurrency’s price has dropped by 1.2% on this level but its technical indicators, the 14-day RSI remain bullish.

37882370,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375527,1734700146,Massive Announcement From Pi Network (PI): Details,"TL;DR Pi Network reported 18 million KYC completions and hinted at an open mainnet launch by Q1 2025, sparking mixed reactions. Users were cautioned to rely on official channels and use the authentic Pi Wallet to avoid scams. The Latest Update Pi Network – a controversial cryptocurrency project that allows people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones – remains one of the trendiest topics in the space. While it saw the light of day in 2019, its native token and open mainnet have yet to be introduced . Over the past several months, the team said the project’s progress depends on certain factors, such as community involvement and passing necessary authentication steps. Pi Network recently claimed that 18 million people have completed necessary Knoy-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications, while 8 million have already migrated to the mainnet. “Thanks to recent major speed upgrades, KYC applications and Mainnet migrations are processed faster than ever, i.e. nearly 200,000 Pioneers migrated in the last day,” the statement reads. That said, the developers claimed they could launch the Open Network as early as Q1 2025. Many community members thanked Pi Network for the announcement. Some, on the other hand, expected an earlier launch and remained rather disappointed. One X user described the latest disclosure as a joke. They assumed that the community will lose trust in the project due to the constant delays and lack of clear information regarding the upcoming developments. “There is no more “can” with the Pi community , the time for that is over , there needs to be a very clear date or countdown because everything you say is worth zero after 6 years. I’m sorry for the harsh words but an open mainnet is out of the question in Q1 2025 if the PCT says “can” instead of a fixed date,” the annoyed user stated . Pi Network Warnings The project has amassed a huge community base over the years with its application recently hitting the milestone of 100 million downloads. As such, it is no wonder that some members are often targeted by fraudsters. To protect its users from such bad actors, Pi Network’s team issued two important warnings. First, the developers cautioned “pioneers” to rely only on information provided by official channels. They also provided a dedicated safety page with all the sources and URL links the community can refer to. Pi Network also reminded people to use only their Pi Wallets in the designated Pi Browser. “Ensure you’re in the correct Pi Wallet, not any fake one, to safeguard your Pi. The authentic Pi Wallet is also visually identified by a purple color in the navigation bar of the Pi Browser with a Pi logo featuring the Core Team apps logo,” the warning reads.

37888272,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105988,1734700040,Data Confirms XRP Historic Rally Dragged Down Bitcoin Dominance,"Bitcoin dominance, a key metric reflecting its share of the total crypto market capitalization, recently experienced a notable 6% dip. Of this, XRP accounted for a significant 3% surge in its dominance. While Bitcoin dominance is now rebounding, the broader implications highlight evolving trends in crypto market liquidity. News On XRP : CryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju called public attention to this observation in a tweet . Bitcoin and XRP market dominace update Young Ju tweet XRP Independent RiseOver recent weeks, XRP has emerged as one of the few altcoins to attract fresh liquidity, contributing directly to Bitcoin’s temporary decline in dominance. Specifically, between November 3 and December 3, the price of XRP soared by approximately 500%.In parallel, its market cap expanded by more than five times, from $28.99 billion to an all-time high of $154.83 billion. This major XRP move dealt a blow to Bitcoin's dominance, which at one point hit 52%. Meanwhile, it is now around 60%. Bitcoin and XRP market dominance update The increase in XRP’s market share underscores a break from the traditional patterns where altcoins closely mirrored Bitcoin’s uptrend. Instead, XRP is carving out its own narrative, driven by heightened interest and independent adoption.This trend aligns with a previous prediction by Ki Young Ju. Two weeks ago, he forecasted that the altcoin seasons would deviate from expectations, with only select altcoins gaining traction due to their unique ecosystems or market dynamics.The State of Altcoin SeasonDespite XRP’s surge, the current market does not resemble a typical ""alt season,"" where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. According to Ki Young Ju’s recent commentary, BTC-to-altcoin rotations remain limited, and only a handful of altcoins, like XRP, are attracting meaningful liquidity. This marks a change from past cycles, suggesting that altcoins now require distinct utilities or market narratives to thrive.This observation is further emphasized by market data showing that Bitcoin currently outperforms as much as 74% of the crypto assets in the top 100. With Bitcoin trading at $93K, it boasts a year-to-date growth of 1110%.At the same time, altcoins like Celestia (TIA), Arbitrum (ARB), Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC), Optimism (OP), and DYDX are all posting staggering losses of over 50% in their YTD performance.Young Ju suggested that altcoins are not seeing the traditional Bitcoin-to-altcoin rotation because BTC has created a paper-based Layer 2 ecosystem through ETFs and corporate treasury allocations. This is limiting liquidity flows to altcoins.According to Young Ju, the two potential paths for altcoins to remain relevant are developing “paper-wrapped” versions similar to Bitcoin’s institutional products and building robust ecosystems that leverage stablecoins or Bitcoin as foundational elements.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/20/on-data-confirms-xrp-historic-rally-dragged-down-bitcoin-dominance/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=on-data-confirms-xrp-historic-rally-dragged-down-bitcoin-dominance,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, Lightchain AI (LCAI) stands out for its blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence, promising a utility-based future that could anchor its value for years to come. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale phase , analysts believe LCAI could be a high-upside investment not just in the short term, but over the next decade. Could LCAI’s innovative features and roadmap position it to remain a strong contender through 2025, 2030, and even 2035? Why Lightchain AI’s Fundamentals Matter for Long-Term Viability Unlike a lot of projects that depend a lot on buzz or one-time uses, LCAI combines AI skills into its blockchain setup. Its AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) helps builders create AI-based apps that fix real-life issues in finance, health care, delivery, and other areas. This aim at useful applications instead of passing trends makes͏ way for steady need and use Also, LCAI’s Proof of Smartness (PoS) agreement model gives rewards to network workers for doing useful AI tasks, making sure that they keep adding to AI jobs. This method encourages steady network use and real-life usefulness which can stay appealing to businesses and groups for the long time. Price Prediction for 2025 Early Breakout Projection $15 to $20 By 2025, Lightchain AI will likely have achieved several key milestones, including a mainnet launch and integration with various enterprise solutions. As industries increasingly adopt AI-driven services, LCAI’s ecosystem should mature, attracting both developers and users. Catalysts Successful testnet and mainnet deployments. Initial enterprise partnerships and cross-chain integrations. Growing community of developers building AI-powered dApps. If these factors come into play, LCAI could experience significant upward pressure, raising its price from $0.003 into the $15 to $20 range—transforming early investments into life-changing returns. Price Prediction for 2030 Sustained Utility and Market Adoption Projection $50 to $100 Looking further ahead, by 2030, the broader tech landscape may see AI integrated into countless business processes. As more enterprises discover the value of a blockchain-AI hybrid platform, LCAI’s utility could shift from a niche concept to a standardized infrastructure component. Catalysts Widespread adoption of AI-driven blockchain solutions in multiple verticals. Robust ecosystem of dApps offering AI-based financial modeling, predictive analytics, and automated governance. Continuous token burns maintaining deflationary pressure and driving scarcity. Under these circumstances, LCAI may enjoy sustained demand even through market downturns. The token’s price could climb to between $50 and $100, reflecting its ingrained role in the global AI economy. Price Prediction for 2035 Mature, Essential Infrastructure Projection $200 to $500 Fast-forwarding a decade into the future, the world’s dependence on AI and decentralized solutions may be far greater than we can currently imagine. If LCAI successfully navigates this evolving landscape—consistently updating its technology, forging strategic partnerships, and scaling its capabilities—it could become an indispensable protocol. Catalysts Global enterprises and governments leveraging LCAI’s platform for AI-driven public services and international data-sharing networks. Ongoing improvements to PoI and AIVM making LCAI a gold standard for AI integration on blockchain. High liquidity, institutional involvement, and a stable user base insulating it from short-term market fluctuations. If LCAI cements itself as a foundational pillar of the digital economy, prices ranging from $200 to $500 by 2035 might be attainable. Such growth would hinge on widespread acceptance, technological leadership, and the project’s ability to remain agile in the face of new competitors. Potential Risks and Challenges No long-term projection is complete without acknowledging potential hurdles. Over the next decade, LCAI could face competition from emerging protocols, as other projects may blend AI and blockchain in innovative ways, challenging LCAI’s market share. Regulatory shifts could also play a significant role, with global regulations on AI data usage and blockchain deployments potentially impacting LCAI’s adoption and token economics. Additionally, rapid technological advancements could render certain approaches obsolete, requiring LCAI to adapt quickly to maintain relevance. The long-term viability of LCAI will rely on proactive governance, consistent innovation, and community-driven decision-making to effectively navigate these uncertainties. Long-Term Bet on Innovation and Utility While no price prediction is a guarantee, the fundamental strengths of Lightchain AI —AI integration, a productive PoI consensus, and deflationary tokenomics—position it for significant upside. If it capitalizes on early adoption, meets roadmap milestones , and navigates potential challenges, LCAI could rise from $0.003 into double or even triple-digit prices over the next decade. For investors with a long-term horizon and faith in the growth of AI-powered blockchain solutions, LCAI offers a compelling bet on a future where intelligent decentralized systems form the backbone of the global economy. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Pepe (PEPE) Pepe (PEPE) has seen significant price changes over the past six months, rising by 67.15%. In contrast, the past week showed a drop of 24.02%, and over the past month, it decreased by 6.85%. The current price ranges between $0.00002 and $0.00002779, reflecting recent market volatility. The coin is nearing its nearest support level at $0.000018, which is about 25% below the current price. Falling below this could lead to the next support at $0.00001126, a further drop. On the upside, if demand increases, Pepe could reach the nearest resistance at $0.00003144, about 31% higher. Breaking past this could aim for the second resistance at $0.00003818, nearly 59% above the current price. Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound. The RSI is at 30.42, close to oversold, indicating the price may rise. The Stochastic indicator at 32.86 points to similar potential. The 10-day moving average is $0.00001929, below the 100-day average of $0.00002261, showing a recent downtrend. If momentum builds, the price could move above these averages. The negative MACD level could shift to positive, signaling upward momentum. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable.

Electric Elon Musk (ELECMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELECMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Electric Elon Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Electric Elon Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Electric Elon Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Electric Elon Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Electric Elon Musk by entering its contract address – GLb1x7V9aav8iRjsxgG5UXdxLdk7YkrkcnKYByr542UD – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELECMUSK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/electric-elon-musk-elecmusk-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37882303,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631005,1734699601,What if Trump and Elon make Bitcoin and Dogecoin legal tender in America?,"Imagine waking up in an America where Bitcoin and Dogecoin replace the dollar. The president tweets, “Bye-bye Federal Reserve,” while Elon Musk, holding a Dogecoin plushie, declares the dawn of a new financial era. Yes this is a fantasy, but it’s one that feels disturbingly possible with Donald Trump back in the White House and Elon pulling strings from the inside. Elon’s ideas, Trump’s actions Trump, always one to shake up the system, seems bent on making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” His administration is talking about building a Bitcoin reserve to replace gold. And Elon? Oh, he’s running a government body now called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). If you think that’s a coincidence, you haven’t been paying attention. This guy is so powerful now that Bloomberg is reporting he was the person singlehandedly behind Trump’s important decision to vote against government funding yesterday. How about that? Naturally, crypto markets exploded as soon as Trump secured his election win. Bitcoin surged to $108k on December 17, more than doubling its price from earlier this year. Dogecoin? It’s gone up 152%, now sitting pretty at around $0.30. Elon’s tweets aren’t just memes anymore, they’re policy teasers. I mean, I have his notifications on for the first time ever. Everyone’s watching this guy like a hawk right now. With DOGE as the face of a government efficiency department, speculators have poured billions into Dogecoin futures. Open interest jumped from 7 billion to 8.3 billion tokens in just weeks. But it’s not all fun and games. Crypto markets are chaos on steroids. Bitcoin prices alone have been whiplashing harder than Wall Street in 2009. A single sentence from Fed chair Jerome Powell took Bitcoin from around $106k all the way to $95k as of press time. Imagine if crypto actually becomes legal tender in America – Just imagine You know what? Imagine with us. Let’s say they do it — Bitcoin and Dogecoin officially replace the U.S. dollar. Well for sure, it’d flip the global economy on its head. But the U.S. dollar, the world’s go-to reserve currency and America’s strongest weapon, would lose its throne. Countries and corporations holding dollars would then panic-sell, destabilizing entire economies. Bitcoin and Dogecoin, meanwhile, would have to shoulder responsibilities they’re wildly unprepared for. Their prices would need to stabilize. Good luck with that when Bitcoin swings by thousands of dollars in hours. Inflation as we know it would change. Traditional economics would be almost obsolete. We know that Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, meaning it can’t be printed into oblivion like fiat. Dogecoin, on the other hand, keeps adding coins, but its rate is kind of predictable. These mechanics would rewrite inflation rates, but at what cost? The average American would struggle to keep up with volatile swings, and businesses might demand clearer frameworks for pricing goods and services. Speaking of frameworks, how do you tax people in crypto anyway? Trump hasn’t said anything about that. On-chain transactions are decentralized, meaning the government loses some (okay all) of its grip. And what about hacking? Or haven’t you heard? The North Koreans stole more crypto than ever before this year, according to recent reports. And let’s not pretend this transition would be smooth. For starters, cryptocurrencies are terrible for everyday spending. Picture buying a coffee in Dogecoin—its value swings so wildly that the price might double or half before you even take a sip. Salaries, rent, groceries—all of it would turn into a nightmare of conversions. People might still use the dollar as a shadow currency to make sense of prices, much like how unstable economies rely on the dollar unofficially. How sad is that?

The Bitcoin price , which had broken above the bullish pattern, has plunged and reached lower support. In such a scenario, the markets are largely considered to be entering the bearish range; hence, the BTC price is expected to drop back below $90,000. However, the technicals have turned bearish, which may validate the bearish scenario for the token. 3 days of BTC weakness have wiped out more than 3 weeks of altcoin gains. Moreover, the token is threatening to lose each of the lower supports in the times when it was just days away from confirming its first price discovery correction. Now over $1 billion has been evaporated from the markets, with the ETFs recording over $671.9 million outlaws in a single day as BTC price drops hard. Does this suggest Bitcoin dump could still get worse? A popular analyst, Crypto Rover, compares the current price action to that of the previous year in December 2023 and suggests it could be the best buying opportunity. The BTC price has witnessed a similar dip after the bulls triggered a strong rebound in October. The pullback drained nearly 15% then, which resulted in a rise of over 90% in the next couple of months, forming new highs close to $74,000. However, to trigger the upswing, the price further dropped by another 10% to reach the bottom. Therefore, if the BTC price mirrors the previous rally, then the price is speculated to drop by another 10% and mark the bottom between $85,000 and $88,000. Hence, the bulls are expected to enter and trigger a strong rebound, forming new highs above the speculated ATH at around $125K. However, the price has formed yet another megaphone pattern and if it rebounds from the current range, a rise above $110K could be imminent, squashing the bearish narrative.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-markets-plunging-down-as-bitcoin-btc-price-drops-below-94000-has-the-90000-targets-activated/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Ether, Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, xrp (XRP) and bnb (BNB) fell as much as 16%, while memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) fell over 27%, data shows. Crypto market capitalization is down more than 11% in the past 24 hours, one of the worst single-day drops in the year.    Some traders say a hawkish tone in this week’s FOMC meeting flipped market sentiment ahead of the new year.    “The Fed rate cut itself was already expected and priced in as markets hinged on the Fed's outlook for next year, which was less optimistic than expected and included only two rate cuts instead of the four that were previously expected,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Traders should be cautious until inflation is tamed and we see more concrete Trump policies in the coming year.”    But in the mid to long run, we believe that monetary and fiscal stimulus policies in both the US and other parts of the world will ultimately expand liquidity.

The cryptocurrency market is a mine where anyone can earn big. By investing in the right coins, even young investors can make their dreams come true in 2025. We will look at Rexas Finance (RXS), DogeCoin (DOGE), PepeCoin (PEPE), and Ripple (XRP), which have the potential to help even a 20-year-old earn millions by next year. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Cryptocurrency With Great Potential Rexas Finance uses innovative features to help small investors tap into opportunities that were once out of reach. The platform has incorporated blockchain technology into its functioning, which enables the issuing of digital tokens against physically held real estate properties, artworks, precious metals, and other forms of assets. These tokens let anyone, even with modest savings, own a piece of valuable assets and grow their wealth. Rexas Finance breaks high-value assets like real-world assets or artworks into smaller units, allowing investors to own a part of these assets. Rexas Finance is designed for simplicity. It offers tools like the Rexas Token Builder that make creating and managing tokens easy, while the QuickMint Bot lets you handle transactions from apps like Telegram. Rexas Finance's project is in its tenth stage and has raised over $28 million. RXS is set to launch at $0.20. Since its launch, RXS has increased by 400%, and analysts predict it will surge to $12 and more in 2025. RXS has completed a CertiK Audit, which reassured investors about its long-term potential. Rexas Finance is listed on websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, where traders get real-time updates on its progress. For anyone trying to earn massively and become a millionaire in 2025, Rexas Finance offers everything you need to start small and think big. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Beloved Meme Coin Dogecoin is becoming more than a joke, with its coin being taken seriously recently. With its consolidation pattern reflecting 2021’s pattern before its breakthrough, DogeCoin is likely to repeat its 2021 bullish run. Analysts project an 85% price increase in DOGE that will cause DOGE to reach $0.75 by January 2025. Also, investors are growing confident in the coin by accumulating large amounts of DOGE. DOGE recently earned 60,000 new holders in 10 days alone. The increasing confidence of investors and Elon Musk's influence is pushing the coin towards a bullish run. Another Analyst speculated that DOGE will likely drop to $0.2 and surge to $1 afterward. Any pullback to $0.2 would represent a good buying opportunity for any investor and a prospect for massive returns when it rises to $1. PepeCoin (PEPE): A Rising Meme Coin With Great Potential Pepe is another meme coin that can turn a young investor into a millionaire in 2025. A significant factor that can cause PEPE to surge is its technical pattern, cup-and-handle, and inverse head-and-shoulders formations, which position DOGE for a bullish run. PEPE is awaiting a $1 billion token burn by Binance in 2025. This will reduce the amount of PEPE in circulation by 10%, and a deflationary effect will significantly increase its price. PEPE's market-to-realized value (MVRV) shows that most investors are holding the coin rather than selling it, indicating a strong long-term sentiment. The coin's MVRV, along with the ascending triangle pattern, could trigger a breakout if the buying activity increases. The coin is affordable, and with its growing potential, younger investors have a good chance of earning massively by investing in PEPE. Ripple (XRP): Poised For A Massive Rebound XRP currently trades at $2.33, down from its recent high of $2.80. Yet investors are still buying the token in anticipation of its surge. This optimism is also fueled by investors' belief that Ripple's legal battle will end after the inauguration of the new SEC leaders. Additionally, a crypto expert predicted that XRP will rise by 1,300% to $30 in the next year. This possible rise in the price of XRP is more likely to happen once Ripple's stablecoin and ETF launch. Another analyst suggests that XRP will increase in price to $4 in 2025 even if it doesn't skyrocket to $30. Considering these factors, XRP can potentially turn any younger investor into a millionaire in 2025. Conclusion These four coins discussed have great potential, and they are all you need to become a millionaire in the next year. One token you shouldn't miss out on is RXS, a new entry that is very affordable to purchase. RXS also has the potential to yield massive returns with its remarkable innovations and future prospects in the crypto market.

One project that’s catching everyone’s eye is Lightchain AI (LCAI). Currently priced at just $0.003 in its presale phase , LCAI is already turning heads. Analysts are even predicting it could hit $50 with surprising ease. So, what makes Lightchain AI so special, and how soon could we see this incredible growth? Let’s dive into the details and explore what’s fueling this excitement! What Gives Lightchain AI the Edge? Lightchain AI is making significant strides in the blockchain and AI sectors , introducing innovations that set it apart from existing platforms. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Consensus Lightchain AI’s PoI rewards nodes for performing AI tasks like model training, ensuring network security while advancing AI development. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM powers AI-driven dApps with advanced computing on the blockchain for seamless and efficient execution. Real-World Applications Lightchain AI addresses challenges in healthcare, finance, logistics, and education, making it versatile across industries. Sustainable Design Focusing on productive AI tasks, Lightchain AI minimizes energy waste, aligning with global sustainability goals. Decentralized Governance Token holders actively shape the platform’s future through inclusive, decentralized governance. Market Potential With innovative tech and a promising presale price, Lightchain AI offers strong growth opportunities for investors. Timeline for LCAI’s Rise to $50 To understand how and when LCAI could reach the $50 mark, consider the roadmap and market catalysts expected to unfold over the coming months and years. Early Presale Phase (Now – Next 3 Months)At its current presale price of $0.003, Lightchain AI offers unprecedented upside. During this phase, early adopters accumulate tokens while the project finalizes partnerships, expands its developer community, and raises funds to support the rollout of its testnet. Testnet Launch (Next 6-9 Months)As the project launches its testnet, developers begin experimenting with the AIVM, creating a pipeline of AI-focused dApps. This stage demonstrates LCAI’s real-world utility, sparking initial public interest and driving token demand. Analysts suggest that upon a successful testnet debut, LCAI’s price could jump into the $1-$5 range. Mainnet Activation (12-15 Months from Now)The mainnet launch represents a turning point. Enterprises and institutional players gain access to LCAI’s AI-driven ecosystem. As use cases multiply and network adoption soars, token scarcity intensifies due to its deflationary model. With the mainnet live and early dApps running, many predict the token could hit $10-$20, setting the stage for its next major growth spurt. Widespread Adoption and Scaling (Within 24 Months)By the time LCAI reaches its two-year mark, it’s expected to have a robust ecosystem of dApps serving multiple industries. Its PoI mechanism, which incentivizes meaningful computation, attracts global AI developers. As mainstream media and institutional investors recognize LCAI’s transformational potential, the token’s value could surge into the $50 range. Market Catalysts That Could Accelerate LCAI’s Growth Many outside and inside things could speed up LCAI's rise to $50. The current AI surge is important, as firms around the globe more and more use AI answers, making LCAI a clear pick for ͏using these skills in a safe, spread out setting. Also, links and joint chains with other big blockchains can grow LCAI's space; this brings more users and makers to the platform. Also, big buyers and smart money folks may really support LCAI after its testnet and mainnet show good results it could be the next huge thing in market. Comparing LCAI to Established Titans Ethereum and Solana shook up the blockchain world with smart contracts and lightning-fast transactions—but LCAI is here to one-up them. How? By adding a big brain to the blockchain. With AI baked right into its framework, LCAI brings automation, predictive analytics, and data-driven decision-making to the party—things other platforms are still figuring out. Think of it as the DeFi of decision-making or the NFT of next-gen tech. With AI at its core, LCAI isn't just keeping up—it's redefining how we play the blockchain game. Road to $50 From its $0.003 presale price to a projected $50 valuation, Lightchain AI (LCAI) presents one of the most compelling growth stories in the crypto space. With revolutionary technology, a clear roadmap, and favorable market conditions, LCAI’s path to mainstream adoption seems both plausible and potentially swift. Investors ready to capitalize on the intersection of AI and blockchain should pay close attention as LCAI takes its first steps. While no investment is risk-free, the case for LCAI’s long-term success—and its potential to reach the $50 milestone—has never looked stronger.

Their price charts show combined growth of over 200%. However, a new presale sensation is also making some noise— IntelMarkets (INTL) . This phase seven presale star has soared over 610% in just a few months. Since it will combine the AI market with blockchain, many experts even predict INTL will potentially experience a 4x growth in 2025. Therefore, this altcoin could replicate the recent growth that XRP and SOL saw. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing in the Crypto Space While Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) are making waves, IntelMarkets (INTL) is another crypto coin that has captured investors' attention. This rookie has given early buyers a 610% return in just a few short months—an amazing performance for this phase seven presale star. Not only that, but more price jumps are coming since this crypto ICO event is still far from over. What makes IntelMarkets stand out from its peers is the innovation that it will bring to crypto trading. This upcoming trading platform will have AI technology integrated into every level. Therefore, users will get the benefits of this tech, like autopilot bots or self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time, up to 1000x leverage, and more. The INTL native token will be the backbone of this ecosystem. This altcoin has already soared by 610% from its starting price, now costing $0.064. Phase eight will bring another 14% jump to $0.073. Given its assured listing price of $0.11, investors could see a 71% return by buying this altcoin now. Thus, INTL could be one of the best cryptos for fast returns. Crypto Bull: The Price of Ripple (XRP) May Hit $5 Market analyst Crypto Bull made some headlines with his Ripple (XRP) statement. In a recent X post, he told his followers that the next leg up for this altcoin may see its price hit $5. Due to this Ripple price prediction, many traders are increasingly excited about it. The Ripple price has jumped over 200% in the past 30 days. During that time, CoinMarketCap shows that its value moved between nearly $0.70 and close to $2.50. Meanwhile, the Ripple market cap moved between $40B and $130B. However, this could be a disadvantage for Ripple (XRP) since, with a higher market cap, its price may need more new money to surge. IntelMarkets will not face this problem, potentially giving faster returns. Solana (SOL) Price Rises, Analyst Remains Optimistic Solana (SOL) is another altcoin showing some bullish signs. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Solana has increased by over 5% on the one-month chart. Its price fluctuated between nearly $210 and over $220 in that period. Crypto expert Jelle also made a bullish Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this crypto currency may see new ATHs before 2024 ends. In other words, Solana (SOL) could soar past $404 soon. The Solana coin is trading above its 50-day EMA of $214 and its 100-day EMA of $193. Although this altcoin may see big price gains soon, its highest upswing has been achieved as its value soared over 200% on the YTD chart. Thus, experts are looking at IntelMarkets. Will IntelMarkets (INTL) Follow the Footsteps of Ripple (XRP) & Solana (SOL)? Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) also had periods when they were under the radar and made early buyers rich. In the same way, experts think IntelMarkets (INTL) also has the potential for growth, which can be very profitable. This rookie could dominate the crypto trading space while having a smaller market cap than its peers. Therefore, INTL could surge faster than most tokens. Because of this, experts foresee a potential 4x surge for INTL in 2025, making it one of the top altcoins to keep an eye on.

Is it heading for $90k next?,"Bitcoin nosedived to $92,808 early Friday, shedding 9% in a single day. Just days ago, it was basking in its glory above $108,000, its highest price ever. Now, the scene looks different. The sell-off comes as the Federal Reserve drops a bombshell: fewer interest rate cuts are expected next year. And oh, no Bitcoin national reserve will get any support from them. That’s not the kind of news anyone wanted heading into the holiday season. Crypto isn’t falling alone. Wall Street took a hit too. The ripple effects from the Fed’s tighter stance dragged down equities. And all predictions point to things only getting worse. Bitcoin carnage: Blood on the crypto charts The Bitcoin crash is pulling the entire crypto market into a downward spiral. Ethereum? Down 15%. XRP? A brutal 17% drop in just 24 hours. Even Bitcoin-focused ETFs felt the heat. Yesterday, U.S.-listed ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin recorded $671.9 million in outflows. That’s literally their worst day since these funds came into existence. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF saw $208.5 million walk out the door, while Grayscale’s GBTC wasn’t far behind, losing $188.6 million. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, a favorite in recent weeks, recorded no inflows for the first time in a while. It’s like investors suddenly got cold feet. Meanwhile, the CME Bitcoin futures market isn’t faring much better. The annualized premium on one-month BTC futures dropped to 9.83%, its lowest level in over a month. Lower premiums mean those arbitrage trades that made traders easy money aren’t so lucrative anymore. Ether ETFs bled $60.5 million on Thursday too, breaking a streak that had been running since November 21. Ethereum , once flirting with $4,100, is now down 20% in just a few days. Markets don’t like uncertainty, and Trump’s aggressive policies are adding fuel to the fire. He’s already threatening tariffs against U.S. allies and rivals alike, making investors wonder if geopolitical tensions will make an already jittery market worse. Combine that with the Fed’s hawkish tone, and you’ve got a recipe for a volatile holiday season. Is a Santa Rally even possible at this point?

On December 19, the National Bitcoin Office confirmed that 11 BTC were added to the country’s strategic reserve, taking El Salvador’s total holdings to 5,980.77 BTC, valued at approximately $580 million, based on Bitcoin’s price of $97,000 at the time. This purchase marks a break from the country’s previously stated plan to buy “one Bitcoin per day,” which was announced by President Nayib Bukele in November 2022. However, National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert assured in an X post that the country would continue to buy Bitcoin, possibly at an accelerated pace in the future. IMF Deal Imposes Limits On December 18, El Salvador struck a landmark agreement with the IMF , securing a $1.4 billion financing deal to be disbursed over the next 40 months. However, this agreement comes with a significant caveat: the IMF has urged El Salvador to limit its Bitcoin dealings. The IMF’s mandate includes restricting government-led Bitcoin activities, limiting Bitcoin transactions and purchases, and halting the use of Bitcoin for tax payments, which will continue to be collected in US dollars. Additionally, the IMF has required that the government unwind its involvement in the Chivo Wallet , a crypto wallet launched by the Salvadoran government for Bitcoin transactions. In response to the IMF’s stipulations, a spokesperson for the National Bitcoin Office stated that despite these new conditions, Bitcoin would remain central to the country’s strategy. While the government will scale back its involvement in Bitcoin transactions, it will continue purchasing Bitcoin, with the possibility of increasing the pace of acquisitions. Bitcoin Status Remains Unchanged Despite the IMF’s pressure, El Salvador remains steadfast in its commitment to Bitcoin as legal tender. The country made history in September 2021 by becoming the first nation to adopt Bitcoin alongside the US dollar as an official currency. Herbert confirmed that Bitcoin would retain its legal tender status in the country, though the Chivo wallet would be sold or wound down. The private sector, she added, would continue to facilitate Bitcoin transactions. The deal with the IMF is still pending approval by the IMF Executive Board, marking the culmination of over four years of negotiation. The deal’s approval will likely bring an end to the tension caused by Bukele’s Bitcoin policies, which the IMF had warned could expose El Salvador to significant financial risks.

37881728,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313544,1734698743,Trader Michaël van de Poppe Says Bitcoin Could Surge Another 400% in the Ongoing Bull Run – Here’s His Timeline,"A closely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains in a bullish trend and could explode by more than 400% despite dipping below $100,000 this week. In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 754,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could ultimately hit $500,000 in the current cycle. He uses a rainbow logarithmic growth channel (LGC) curve chart, which aims to predict Bitcoin’s longer-term cycle lows and highs while filtering out shorter-term volatility. Overlays of rainbow color bands on top of the LGC suggest market sentiment at different price ranges. “Bitcoin rainbow chart shows some beautiful things. First of all, the previous top should have been way higher as it didn’t get into extreme territory. Secondly, the longer the chart lasts, the higher the tops will be. If we get a bull to 2026, a target of $500,000 isn’t bad.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Next up, the analyst suggests Bitcoin has likely hit its near-term peak already due to the hawkish outlook announced this week by the Fed. However, he says altcoins may start to rip. “When it comes to the Bitcoin price action, I think we’ve sealed the high for now. The good part: altcoins are ready to fire off when the labor market data is going to be worse, as that’s going to provide a substantial correction on the Yields. Finally, the chances of a longer cycle for crypto have significantly increased.” Lastly, he predicts that the crypto bull market is far from over. “Altcoins are dead. That’s what you hear. Let me tell you: they are not. This cycle isn’t. There’s so much more to come, but this cycle will be full of surprises. A longer cycle, with higher returns, for patient participants.” Bitcoin is trading for $97,094 at time of writing, down 3.4% in the last 24 hours.

How do you find the right one? Here’s a simple guide to help you. Know the Rules First, understand the Canadian regulations. Why? Because following the rules keeps your money safe. Look for exchanges registered with FINTRAC which indicates that means they follow anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) laws. You don’t want to get associated with the dark side! Check Security Is security important? Absolutely! Make sure the exchange has strong security measures. The top criteria include two-factor authentication (2FA), encryption, and cold storage. Look at Liquidity and Volume Why is liquidity important? It helps you buy and sell quickly without big price changes. So, choose an exchange with high trading volume for better prices and smoother trades. Compare Fees Different exchanges have different fees. Some have low trading fees but high withdrawal fees. You don’t want to lose large chunks of your profits to fees you didn’t anticipate, so check the total cost and look for exchanges with transparent fee policies. Check Available Cryptocurrencies You should also make sure the exchange supports those cryptocurrencies. Most significant exchanges offer Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other popular coins. However, some don’t offer many lesser-known altcoins, so you must check the list of supported cryptocurrencies. User Experience and Support Is the exchange easy to use? Does the exchange offer good customer support? Good user experience and quick and helpful support are crucial. So, look for an intuitive interface, useful guides, and a reputation for solving problems quickly. Payment Methods It’s essential to check the payment methods to see if your preferred withdrawal or deposit method is available. Reliable exchanges offer bank transfers, credit/debit cards, and cryptocurrency transfers, so you can choose the one that suits you best. If you’re interested in more than just trading? Some exchanges offer staking, lending, and OTC trading. These features can provide extra income, and if you are interested in them, you can also find an exchange that offers them. Reputation You should also read reviews and testimonials and look for exchanges with good reputations. Avoid those with security breaches or scandals. Comparing Fees, Security, and Services When selecting a cryptocurrency exchange, what should you focus on? Fees, security, and services are three crucial factors. Let’s dive into why each of these matters and how they can influence your decision. Analysis of Fees Across Different Platforms Fees matter because they can eat into your profits. Different exchanges have different fee structures, but some charge low trading fees and high withdrawal fees. Others might have no deposit fees but higher trading fees. Think about this: Are you a frequent trader? Then, trading fees will impact you more. Do you plan to withdraw often? Withdrawal fees will be more relevant. So, always look at the total cost, as hidden fees can surprise you. Transparent fee policies are essential, as they help you understand exactly what you’re paying. How Safe Is Your Money? Is security a big deal? Absolutely! Your investments need to be safe. Security measures vary between exchanges. What should you look for? Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a must. It adds an extra layer of protection. Encryption is another critical feature, as it ensures your data is secure. Also, consider cold storage. This means keeping most of the assets offline, away from hackers . So, look for exchanges that have never been hacked. Past security breaches can be red flags. Remember, a secure exchange protects your money from threats! Security Features and User Safeguards Different exchanges offer different services. If you are just looking to trade, a simple exchange might work. Or do you want more? Some exchanges offer extra features like staking, lending, or over-the-counter (OTC) trading. Think about customer support. Is it easy to get help when you need it? Good support can save you time and frustration. User experience matters, too, as an intuitive interface makes trading easier. Making the Right Choice Balancing these factors depends on your needs. If low fees are crucial, you might compromise on extra services. If security is your top concern, you might pay a bit more, so think about what matters most to you. Best Decentralized Crypto Exchanges in Canada Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs allow users to trade directly from their wallets, providing greater control over their assets. Here are some of the best decentralized crypto exchanges available to Canadian users, each with unique features that set them apart. 1. Uniswap- Best for Decentralized Trading Uniswap is one of the most popular DEXs globally and is widely used in Canada. What makes Uniswap unique? Its automated market maker (AMM) model. This model uses smart contracts to pool liquidity from users, allowing trades without a traditional order book. Uniswap’s simplicity and ease of use are unmatched. It also supports a wide array of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 2. SushiSwap: Best Community-Driven Platform SushiSwap , a fork of Uniswap, has carved out its niche by focusing on community governance and rewards. It offers additional incentives to its users through yield farming and staking. Every time you stake the native token, SUSHI, you can earn rewards from trading fees. Moreover, SushiSwap is not just limited to Ethereum. It has expanded to other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, providing more options for Canadian users and providing cross-chain compatibility. 3. PancakeSwap: Best DEX on BSC Although PancakeSwap is not exclusive to Canada, its unique positioning on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) makes it a valuable option. What sets PancakeSwap apart are its low transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to Ethereum-based exchanges. The crypto exchange uses an AMM model similar to Uniswap but leverages the benefits of BSC. It also offers fun features like lotteries and NFT collectibles, making it more than a trading platform. 4. Balancer: Best Flexible Liquidity Protocol Balancer offers a unique twist on the AMM model by allowing customizable liquidity pools. Users can create pools with multiple tokens and varying weights, providing flexibility not seen in other DEXs. For instance, you can have a pool with 80% ETH and 20% BTC or any other combination. This flexibility allows for innovative investment strategies and efficient portfolio management. Balancer’s innovative approach to liquidity pools sets it apart from other DEXs. 5. Curve Finance: Best for Stablecoins Curve Finance is the best decentralized crypto exchange for trading stablecoins efficiently. Its focus on stablecoins and low fees provides a specialized service that appeals to users who want stability in their trades. Its algorithm is optimized for low-slippage trades between stablecoins and other assets with similar prices. This makes it ideal for users looking to engage in liquidity mining with minimal risk. 6. 1inch: Best DEX Aggregator 1inch distinguishes itself by being a DEX aggregator rather than a traditional exchange. It works by scanning multiple DEXs to find the best prices for your trades, ensuring you get the most value. By using 1inch, Canadian traders can access a wide range of liquidity sources without manually checking each DEX. This smart routing of trades optimizes prices and reduces slippage, making it a powerful tool for serious traders and one of the best crypto exchanges in Canada. 7. Bancor: Best for Single-Sided Liquidity Bancor offers a unique feature known as single-sided liquidity provision. Here, users can provide liquidity with a single token without needing to pair it with another, reducing the risk of impermanent loss. Bancor’s protocol also includes an automated compensation system to mitigate this risk further. Bancor’s approach offers a more straightforward and safer alternative for users wary of the complexities of traditional liquidity provision. 8. Kyber Network: Best On-Chain Liquidity Protocol Kyber Network has an on-chain liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from various sources. This helps investors get instant token swaps without the need for an order book, enhancing transparency and security. Kyber’s integration with multiple DEXs and DeFi platforms makes it a versatile choice for users looking to engage in various DeFi activities beyond simple trading. Benefits of Using Decentralized Exchanges Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offer a range of benefits that appeal to cryptocurrency traders in Canada. Enhanced Security One of the primary benefits of using DEXs is enhanced security. Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs do not hold your crypto holdings. Instead, trades occur directly between users’ wallets through smart contracts. This reduces the risk of hacks and theft, as there are no centralized points of failure. Better Privacy DEXs are an attractive option for those who value their privacy and want to maintain anonymity while trading. They offer greater privacy compared to their centralized counterparts. Users do not need to undergo extensive identity verification processes, commonly known as Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. Control Over Assets With DEXs, you have complete control over your assets and are not required to deposit your funds into an exchange’s wallet. Instead, you trade directly from your wallet, retaining ownership and control. This self-custody approach aligns with the core principles of decentralization and autonomy. Wide Range of Tokens DEXs often support a more comprehensive range of tokens than centralized exchanges. This can be particularly beneficial for traders looking to diversify their portfolios or invest in emerging cryptocurrencies. By listing new and lesser-known tokens quickly, DEXs ensure that you can enjoy soon access to a broader selection of assets. Lower Fees Decentralized exchanges typically have lower fees than centralized platforms. No intermediaries take a cut from each trade, which can result in significant savings, especially for frequent traders. Additionally, DEXs generally avoid deposit and withdrawal fees. Censorship Resistance Operating on blockchain technology, DEXs offer censorship resistance. This means they are less likely to be subject to regulatory shutdowns or government interference. For Canadian users, this provides assurance that their trading activities can continue uninterrupted. Wrapping Up With the SEC tightening things up in Canada’s southern neighbor, the crypto industry in Canada is one of the most dynamic anywhere in the world. There are plenty of quality crypto exchanges where you can trade, stake, earn, invest, and otherwise diversify your portfolio. However, the ultimate choice comes down to your needs, so ensure that you research to identify what works best for you.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-exchanges-in-canada/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/32080639.jpeg

37881764,https://crypto.news/?p=14321047,1734698686,"DOGE gains wiped by bearish FED forecast, DTX Exchange defies market trends with 33% surge","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. FED rate cuts bring dark clouds over Dogecoin; meanwhile, the emerging platform DTX Exchange defies market trends with a massive presale rally. Table of Contents Dogecoin price action fades amid FED rate cuts Will DOGE hit $1 in 2025? DTX Exchange gains traction with robust security protocols DTX Exchange’s global inclusion takes over DOGE investors After posting an explosive rally, the Dogecoin price consolidated between $0.35 and $0.47, and later, DOGE regained 78% in a month. This has prompted meme coin holders to join DTX Exchange’s highly bullish ERC-20 token presale to capitalize on its potential for huge profits in 2025. With its ongoing presale getting attention, DTX Exchange is poised to lead the meme coin sector soon. Dogecoin price action fades amid FED rate cuts The Dogecoin price jumped from $0.14 in early November and reached a local high of $0.47 before surrendering gains. At $0.39, the Dogecoin price has surged 170% in less than 2 months. After the slide, investors think DOGE is losing momentum. This also comes as old coins that surged in the same period are tanking. Analysts believe the Dogecoin price will see further downside before having any chance of rising again. This has pushed DOGE holders to seek better opportunities in emerging presale tokens. The Dogecoin price is 46% below its May 2021 all-time high. Will DOGE hit $1 in 2025? The $0.33-$0.35 range has been the floor for Dogecoin since mid-2021. A break below this level could see a bigger drop, potentially back to the early 2024 highs of $0.23. However, DOGE is supported by its 50-day moving average and strong investor sentiment after the Trump rally in November. Despite short-term risks, Dogecoin’s long-term outlook is good; 2025 is going to be a big year for the meme coin. Dogecoin’s performance in past cycles gives us a clue on what to expect. In previous Bitcoin (BTC) bull runs on April 2017, December 2020, and November 2024, Dogecoin lagged behind BTC’s price discovery phase but broke out to new highs in 1-3 months. If history repeats, Dogecoin could do the same. Dogecoin’s track record of catching up to Bitcoin’s momentum is a good reason to be optimistic about its price. Dogecoin to $1 is becoming more possible as macro- and crypto-friendly policies converge. You might also like: Bluntz predicts breakout for SHIB as DTX and ETH ride bullish wave DTX Exchange gains traction with robust security protocols The DTX Exchange operates on a non-custodial basis, meaning users retain control of their private keys and funds. This eliminates the need to trust a central authority with their assets, reducing the risk of potential hacks or mismanagement. The technical architecture of the DTX protocol is designed for scalability and high performance. This enables the platform to handle a large number of transactions and users simultaneously without compromising speed or efficiency. The integration of distributed liquidity pools in the DTX protocol fosters increased liquidity, allowing traders to execute orders with minimal slippage and at competitive prices. DTX Exchange’s global inclusion takes over DOGE investors The protocol’s decentralized nature ensures that DTX Exchange is accessible to users worldwide. There are no restrictions based on geography, nationality, or financial status, promoting financial inclusion. DTX Exchange is built on the Ethereum blockchain, leveraging its robust infrastructure and smart contract capabilities to create a decentralized and secure trading platform. The technical architecture of DTX Exchange revolves around key components that enable seamless trading, security, and transparency. At the core of DTX Exchange’s technical architecture are smart contracts. These self-executing contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and govern various aspects of the platform.

The fee, equivalent to 818,293,968 satoshis, has sparked discussions ranging from network congestion to sophisticated money laundering schemes. Someone just paid $790,000 fees for their $13K amount #Bitcoin transfer pic.twitter.com/MDS0ZN1MjX — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) December 19, 2024 Initial Reactions The incident was shared on X by Vivek (@Vivek4real_), a crypto reporter at Bitcoin Magazine. One user questioned whether network congestion could explain the high fee. Another speculated that it might be a code bug, considering current transaction fees are generally $1–$2. This led some in the community to shout out their preferred tokens, with one user noting how XRP has much cheaper fees, pushing the belief that XRP is superior to Bitcoin . Various theories have been proposed to explain the exorbitant fee: User Error: It’s possible that the sender accidentally set the fee too high. Misunderstandings of Bitcoin’s fee structure or wallet misconfigurations can lead to such mistakes. However, critics argue that such errors are rare in well-designed wallets. Network Congestion: Congestion can result in higher transaction fees as users compete to have their transactions confirmed quickly. However, this explanation seems unlikely given the current low congestion levels and average fees. Replace-By-Fee (RBF): RBF allows users to replace an unconfirmed transaction with one offering a higher fee. While plausible, it doesn’t entirely explain why the transaction fee was set so disproportionately high. Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP): CPFP incentivizes miners to confirm a transaction by attaching a higher fee to a dependent transaction. Again, this doesn’t fully justify the $790,000 transaction fee. Miner’s Choice: Miners might also prioritize high-fee transactions to maximize earnings, but the fee’s magnitude still defies standard economic logic. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Money Laundering? One unique explanation is that the fee might be part of a deliberate money laundering scheme. A detailed thread outlined how criminals could exploit Bitcoin’s high-fee market: First, a transaction is sent with an unusually high fee. The transaction is prioritized due to the fee, but the miner is controlled by the sender. The mining operation then claims the fee as legitimate revenue. The mining company declares the fee as business income, effectively cleaning the funds. This theory highlights vulnerabilities in Bitcoin’s fee structure, particularly in a high-fee market. However, such anomalies would be less likely in blockchains with low, predictable fees and higher transaction throughput. Although this transaction seems to be an isolated event, investors have long criticized Bitcoin for its higher fees while XRP transactions costing millions of dollars have fees under $1 .

After reaching a high of $4,109 earlier this week, Ethereum’s price has dropped by almost 20%. This downturn is largely driven by continued selling pressure from whales, who have been dumping large amounts of ETH, and many other reasons why. El Salvador’s Accepts IMF’s Demands A key development affecting market sentiment is El Salvador’s recent agreement to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) proposal. El Salvador’s $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF requires the country to reduce its Bitcoin policies and taxes will now only be paid in U.S. dollars Ethereum Foundation & Whale Selling ETH Another factor contributing to the price drop is the Ethereum Foundation’s decision to sell large amounts of ETH.

37881437,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630999,1734697725,Debate over Ethereum gas limit: Lower fees vs. Network stability,"Ethereum’s gas limit may be raised from 30 million to 40 million to lower transaction fees by 15-33%. Supporters of the proposition argue it will boost dApp efficiency, while critics warn it could cause centralization and network strain . Ethereum is in an important debate within its community. The focus is on whether or not to raise the gas limit, the maximum amount of gas that can be used per block. The debate is about reducing transaction fees and improving the network’s efficiency. While the idea of raising the gas limit received support, it also raised concerns about its impact on network stability and decentralization. This ongoing discussion raises a key question: can Ethereum handle higher gas limits without sacrificing security and decentralization? Ethereum gas limit To understand the debate, it’s essential first to know what the gas limit means within Ethereum. Gas is a fee that users pay to execute transactions or run smart contracts on the network. Each operation on Ethereum requires computational work, and gas measures the amount of work needed. The gas limit refers to the cap on how much gas can be used in a single block of transactions. Setting the gas limit too low can lead to congestion, high transaction fees, and slower processing times. On the other hand, too high can create increased pressure on the network’s resources, such as storage, bandwidth, and computational power. Ethereum’s current gas limit is just above 30 million, but many in the community are pushing for it to be increased. Moving ahead with the proposition could reduce transaction fees, allowing for better scalability and efficiency. The push for raising the gas limit Ethereum developers and validators have been pushing to raise the gas limit for some time. In March 2020, core Ethereum developer Eric Connor and former MakerDAO executive Mariano Conti started a campaign called “ Pump The Gas, “ aiming to increase the gas limit to 40 million. They believe this change could lower transaction fees by 15% to 33%, which would benefit both developers and users. Lower fees would make it easier for developers to create more complex applications and services, encouraging more people to use decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum. One of the main supporters of this change is Emmanuel Awosika, the creative director of the 2077 Collective. He argues that the current gas limit is too low for high-demand applications. Many dApps, like games or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, struggle to operate efficiently with the current limit because the fees become too high during busy periods. Increasing the gas limit would help these applications run more smoothly and be more user-friendly. Network stability vs. risks of raising gas limits While many people support raising the gas limit, not everyone in the Ethereum community agrees with the approach. One of the main critics is Toni Wahrstätter, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. His concern is that increasing the gas limit too quickly could harm Ethereum’s security and stability. When the gas limit is raised, it requires more computational power to process and validate transactions. This could put extra pressure on Ethereum’s infrastructure, which will definitely make it harder for smaller and independent operators. Only larger operators with more resources can handle the high gas limit. This could lead to centralization, which is against Ethereum ’s core idea of decentralization. Another issue with increasing the gas limit too fast could cause problems like higher storage needs, slower speeds, and more stress on the network. The “Pump The Gas” campaign agrees with these concerns and suggests that any change to the gas limit should be made slowly and carefully to avoid creating more problems, like network congestion or performance issues. Finding the right balance The Ethereum community is still debating how to move forward with raising the gas limit, but there is no agreement on how much it should be raised. On December 19, it was reported that 10% of validators backed raising the gas limit to over 30 million. However, many people believe that the increase should be gradual, so the network can adjust to the added pressure. For example, junior Ethereum researcher Justin Drake increased his validator’s gas limit to 36 million, which is a 20% rise from the current limit. According to him , it “safely greases the wheels.” Drake thinks this change would help the network handle more transactions without causing major issues. The decision to raise Ethereum’s gas limit is part of a larger conversation about its future scalability. With Ethereum 2.0 already working to improve efficiency and security, managing gas limits is essential for handling more transactions without losing decentralization. Raising the gas limit could help developers and lower transaction fees, but it must be done carefully. Any changes should be gradual to avoid affecting the network’s stability.

Instead, its new CEO wants to shift the custodian’s focus towards securing operating licenses in the US and other countries. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto custodian firm Copper Technologies withdrew its registration from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority on Dec. 20. The firm stated it will shift its focus towards expanding their overseas operations under its newly appointed CEO, Amar Kuchinad. Kuchinad took up the mantle of CEO in October after Copper’s former CEO, Dmitry Tokarev, stepped down. After being appointed, he told Bloomberg that the company plans to enter the U.S markets if Trump ends up winning the Presidential race in November. Now that he has ushered in a more pro-crypto administration, Kuchinad said that the company will apply for regulatory custodial or money-transmitter licenses in the U.S. “Refining Copper’s global growth strategy has been my priority since joining, and this has necessitated key decisions on our direction and approach,” said Kuchinad, who is mostly based in New York. Copper not only has its sights set on America, the crypto firm is also planning to apply for licenses and regulated approval in crypto-friendly regions like Hong Kong , Switzerland and Abu Dhabi .

In an email to Seeking Alpha, eToro said it had no comments to share at this time regarding a potential IPO. In 2021, eToro attempted to list itself through a SPAC deal but that process was eventually abandoned amid stock market volatility and a plunge in crypto at the time. The deal also reportedly ran into regulatory hurdles. As the SPAC process was underway, some experts raised red flags about valuation, especially when compared to HOOD, which was (and remains) the obvious valuation comparison. At the time, Seeking Alpha author L-S Tech argued , ""If you love Robinhood’s stock and are considering [eToro], my analysis of the publicly available data suggests that eToro is desperately buying growth (probably unprofitably), that the valuation the merger was set at is far too high, and that serious questions remain about conflicts of interest with its customers."" Note: More information about the original process can be found under the original SPAC ticker of Fintech Acquisition Corp. V ( FTCV ). Since that initial attempt to go public, eToro has reportedly significantly improved its profitability. The firm reported a core profit of $107 million last year, a strong turnaround from the loss of over $40 million the prior year, according to a Globes report. The improved profitability answers some of the concerns raised in 2021 by analysts like L-S Tech and makes the company a more formidable rival for investor attention in a market that is traditionally less tolerant of unprofitable companies. The firm has also had a few regulatory issues, and in September, it agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges with the SEC. The regulator accused the company of operating an unregistered broker and unregistered clearing agency in connection with its trading platform that facilitated buying and selling certain crypto assets as securities. As part of the settlement, the firm agreed to cease trading activity in almost all crypto assets, and the only assets that U.S. customers can trade on the company’s platform will be Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether. eToro has reportedly tapped Goldman Sachs to help plan for its U.S. IPO, Bloomberg reported. In February, CEO Yoni Assia told CNBC that they were ""definitely eyeing the public markets.” The potential IPO plans come at a time when Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has been scaling the $100K mark, boosted by the expectation that President-elect Donald Trump will oversee a crypto-friendly regulatory apparatus.

BCHG's NAV premium compression is ongoing, influenced by less robust private placements compared to other Grayscale funds like GSOL, which had a more extreme premium bleed. Bitcoin Cash's network metrics, such as non-zero balance addresses and active address ratio, indicate a lack of significant usage, failing to meet its P2P cash system goal. Both Bitcoin Cash and BCHG are hold; BCHG's premium may adjust if BCH appreciates, but better returns are likely found elsewhere in the market. In late-September, I offered readers my latest take on the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust ( BCHG ) through Seeking Alpha. While I've generally kept a small speculative position in Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) off and on through the years, I've never once rated BCHG a 'buy' having now covered the fund three times in the last 12 months. Since my last article covering the fund, BCH has indeed outperformed BCHG: BCHG vs BCH since 9/25/24 (Seeking Alpha) Bitcoin Cash is up over 35% since late-September, while BCHG has lagged the underlying asset by a significant degree. In this update, we'll get into the recent compression in the NAV rate of BCHG, the share dynamics of the fund, and on-chain metrics for BCH to determine if either of these assets are a buy at this point in time. Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust I won't bury the lede, BCHG still trades at a considerable premium to the net asset value, or NAV, of the underlying BCH that is represented by each fund share. However, while the 62.7% premium to NAV is still too high in my personal view, it's a large improvement from the 112% premium that was observable the day my last article was published: BCHG Premium (CoinGlass) The chart above shows the trend in the NAV rate going back to September 2023. At that time, the fund shares actually traded at a sizable discount to NAV. But in 2024, we had the return of the premium, and to a significant degree. On April 2nd, BCHG shares traded at a 300% premium to NAV, which was the largest premium since April 2021. One could definitely argue that I've been early on my arguments against NAV rate premiums in excess of 100%, but I don't think I've been wrong. It is my belief that this NAV rate compression is far from over, and I take that view because of what we're observing in some of the other Grayscale funds. Grayscale NAV Rates (CoinGlass) BCHG now has a smaller premium to NAV than the Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ). I've covered GSOL's premium for Seeking Alpha several times and have been very bearish on the premium and on private placement lockup expiration. We've seen the implications from those lockups start to manifest for GSOL. However, the premium bleed has been much less extreme in BCHG than it has been for GSOL to this point. The latter of which eclipsed 800% earlier this year. Grayscale Trust 12/28/22 12/18/24 Change Bitcoin Cash 34,812,900 45,966,400 32.0% Litecoin ( LTCN ) 17,204,700 23,985,800 39.4% Filecoin ( FILG ) 111,400 1,920,900 1624.3% Chainlink ( GLNK ) 321,010 1,197,610 273.1% Solana 1,522,140 7,088,535 365.7% Source: Grayscale, GSOL shares from 12/28/22 are 5 for 1 split-adjusted I suspect one of the major reasons why BCHG has had a far more orderly NAV premium re-rating than GSOL is due in due to the fact that the private placements through Grayscale weren't nearly as robust for Bitcoin Cash as they were for Solana. Where a fund like GSOL has had 365% growth in shares outstanding through private placements since the end of 2022, BCHG has had just 32% growth. The table above indicates that the strongest growth in shares over the last two years has absolutely been linked to the NAV premium extremity, as GLNK and FILG have also traded at sky-high premiums. Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash notoriously spawned from the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hard-fork that resulted from the block size war preceding the 2017 bull market. The major selling point of Bitcoin Cash as a network is that proponents claim it is closer to Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin to be a peer-to-peer digital cash system rather than a digital store of value akin to something like Gold. I happen to personally agree with much of the sentiment from the BCH community regarding Bitcoin's shortcomings. However, that doesn't necessarily mean BCH is a buy. As I see it, the data would actually suggest BCH has failed to be a P2P cash system as well. BCH Total Non-Zero Addresses (IntoTheBlock) The first metric that I feel shows a general lack of interest for Bitcoin Cash is non-zero balance addresses on the network. That figure currently stands at 24.8 million. Not only is this only about a 40% increase from the 17.7 million starting point from 2017 following the fork, but it's actually a decline of 2% year over year. The lack of total addresses with balance wouldn't be totally concerning by itself if those addresses were using BCH to a significant degree. But that is not really the case, judging by active address ratio: BCH Active Address Ratio (IntoTheBlock) This takes the active address on the chain and divides it by the total addresses. The active address ratio on Bitcoin Cash has generally fallen somewhere between 0.2% and 0.4% with outliers in both directions. This is substantially worse than the active address ratio for Bitcoin, which is typically above 1% each day and was above 2% during most of 2023. However, it's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin Core supporters who opposed the fork could still have BCH from the fork with no intention of ever moving it. If we take the all-time low in Bitcoin Cash non-zero addresses (14.9 million) and assume the spread between the low and the current figure (24.8 million) is more indicative of the actual Bitcoin Cash community (lets call it 10 million), we can make an adjusted active address ratio for the sake of a more fair comparison. BCH Active Address Ratio (CoinMetrics) The 30-day active address number for Bitcoin Cash is currently about 50k. If we divide that by the 10 million adjusted Bitcoin Cash zero wallet address figure described above, we still get an active address ratio of just 0.5%. This is below Bitcoin and well below the 4.5% active address ratio observed by PoW blockchain peer Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Closing Summary From where I sit, Bitcoin Cash and the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust are both just holds. I won't call BCHG an outright sell because it's always possible BCH appreciates the premium away if BCHG shares don't rise with the price of the underlying. You can certainly talk me into direct BCH holdings as a small speculation, or to simply toy around with a fast blockchain. But I'm not going to call BCH a 'buy' based on any fundamental setup that I'm observing in the network data. To be clear, this is not to say the chain isn't interesting technologically. I think things like CashFusion are important, and I believe there are interesting developments happening on the blockchain. But beyond that, I believe traders/speculators/investors will likely see better returns elsewhere if/when the market gets a proper 'alt-season.'",NEUTRAL,BCH | SOL,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745533-bitcoin-cash-vs-bchg-nav-rate-compression-begins?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37881062.jpeg

Is the time for a market recovery approaching? Traders need to take advantage of volatility First of all, it must be acknowledged that markets are markets, and the best laid plans can be wiped out at a whim. This is why those who are the most successful in the markets are generally very long term investors. As long as you have your money on the right horses, the potential wild swings of the market are much less of a worry. That said, there are always those who want to take advantage of volatility over the short to medium term time-frame, and the current precipitous downturn in the crypto market could be ripe for this. Precipitous Bitcoin dump continues Source: TradingView First of all, there is no little matter of a huge dump taking place for Bitcoin. The price has crashed out of the ascending channel and does not appear to be slowing down yet. The measured move for the channel is on the chart at $88,000. It is starting to look like the bears could bring the price there. It just depends whether horizontal support at the current level will hold. Another concern is the gaping drop if $88,000 does not hold. With all this in mind, it’s exactly at times like these when there is money to be made. Forecasting when the $BTC price will finally turn back around becomes all-important. Of course, we could even be seeing a descent into a bear market. All possibilities are on the table. That said, this particular scenario is probably not likely just yet. Good buy levels for $ETH Source: TradingView For $ETH, it can be seen that the fake-out of the triangle has resulted in the price heading back down fast. The 0.618 Fibonacci at $2,881, and the 0.786 Fibonacci at $2,552 are both good buy levels. There is also the bottom of the triangle as a last possibility. $SOL approaches next big support Source: TradingView The $SOL price is in precipitous decline right now. It has fallen out of the bull flag after turning the major support at $202 into resistance. The price is currently stopped at a horizontal level of support, but may continue on down to the stronger horizontal support at $162. This also could coincide with an ascending trendline as seen on the chart above. A bounce has to come for Bitcoin and crypto. It is just a case of when, and how hard.

They are also demanding damages of more than $150,000, but they are also open to any other amount the court may deem appropriate.

Fans claim she has gone MIA as she has also not released a new episode of her weekly podcast, Talk Tuah, for the past two weeks. Her last Instagram post promoting the show was on December 3. Welch initially told Fortune that her memecoin was “not just a cash grab” and that she had revised her opinions on crypto in recent months after gaining more knowledge on the subject.

Then comes Hollywood’s Cardi B, Jason Derulo, and Caitlyn Jenner. Derulo accused Sahil Arora, a crypto influencer and controversial memecoin co-creator, of orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme for his own profit. Jenner piled on, also blaming Arora. In Cardi’s case, the UAE wouldn’t take any chance with its citizens being scammed. Investigations have been opened into her WAP token. Should you worry about PNUT? Well, the fight over PNUT continues, and the price does not look too good. PNUT could be the next HAWK on the list. PNUT has gained support and market recognition following its ties to Donald Trump, Make America Great Again (MAGA), and Elon Musk. The token initially gained traction after being listed on Binance , but has since seen fluctuating performance. Soon after that, Mark Longo, owner of the Peanut the Squirrel brand, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, accusing the platform of trademark infringement in relation to its PNUT-themed memecoin. After that, the price tanked. On-chain data from CoinMarketCap shows that PNUT is down over 25% in one day alone. What could go wrong? Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Longo has accused the PNUT community of exploiting his story for financial gain. In a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), Longo stated, “The $PNUT community USED MY STORY, MY SQUIRREL, AND MY LIKENESS TO MAKE MILLIONS!” Now, it looks like not many are interested in the coin anymore.

37880836,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395626,1734696672,DeBridge (DBR) Hits All-Time High Following Major Bithumb Listing,"The post DeBridge (DBR) Hits All-Time High Following Major Bithumb Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Historically, Cryptocurrencies tend to react with major crypto exchange listings. The latest on the block is decentralized finance (DeFi), which made some noise in the crypto downtrend. DeBridge (DBR) is making waves in the crypto market after a 30% price surge, fueled by its recent listing on South Korea’s Bithumb exchange. This Solana-based token, DeBridge (DBR), hit an all-time high of $0.04702 before settling at $0.0347. In the last 24 hours, DBR is ranked at 697 and has seen $72 million in trading volume, with a market cap of $40.57 million. Bithumb’s decision to list DeBridge is a big deal for the token’s visibility and adoption. The listing, announced on December 20, allows DBR to be traded in South Korean won (KRW) pairs. This move is expected to attract more investors and strengthen DeBridge’s position in the global crypto market. To ensure stability, Bithumb implemented trading controls during the initial phase, a practice common with new listings on the exchange. This means attracting more people to the blockchain industry, securing mainstream acceptance, and so on. What is DeBridge? As its name implies, deBridge acts as a cross-chain bridge and communication layer that facilitates the effective movement of data and assets across different chains. DeBridge helps solve liquidity problems in DeFi by offering low fees and plenty of liquidity. The DBR token is important for the platform, allowing users to stake and vote on decisions within the network. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Doodles NFT Price Explodes 62.5% on Token Launch Rumor: What’s the Truth? , What’s Next for DBR? While some tokens listed on Bithumb experience short-term price jumps, analysts believe DBR’s practical use in DeFi could support long-term growth. Notably, other KRW-listed tokens are facing price fluctuations, but DBR is showing signs of a further breakout with innovative technology and real-world use cases. For U.S. crypto users, DeBridge’s rise highlights the growing demand for efficient cross-chain solutions. Today, there is no single blockchain that everyone uses and that every asset is based on. Instead, there are multiple blockchains including Layer 1s and Layer 2s that are widely used by the public. In short, DeBridge is positioning itself as a key player in the global DeFi market, offering opportunities for both seasoned investors and newcomers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Source: CoinMarketCap Trading volume surged to $24.75 billion, an 8.38% increase over the last 24 hours, signaling intense market activity as traders scrambled to reposition. XRP is still trading above its 200-day simple moving average, suggesting that the broader trend remains positive despite the correction, as the token remains up 76.35% in the past month Over the past 30 days, XRP has seen 17 green days out of 30, reflecting a 57% positive trading streak. Key XRP levels to watch In the short term, traders are eyeing the $2 psychological level as a critical marker for recovery. The immediate support level lies at $1.92, and if this holds, XRP could stabilize and attempt to reclaim higher ground. On the upside, the resistance level at $2.55 will be the next challenge for the bulls. While the sudden crash has rattled investors, the overall outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Traders and analysts will closely monitor whether XRP can quickly bounce back above $2, a move that could restore confidence and set the stage for renewed upward momentum. Interestingly, a lot of chart analysts on X (formerly Twitter), such as Crypto Tony, had suggested that XRP was holding up relatively well compared to other altcoins before the price continued to cascade downward. This false sense of resilience was quickly shattered as selling pressure mounted. Renowned on-chain analyst Ali Martinez added to the discussion, noting that if XRP rebounds to $2.62, a significant 20.50 million in short positions could face liquidation. $20.50 million in short positions will be liquidated if $XRP rebounds to $2.62! pic.twitter.com/IKMCIolaiV — Ali (@ali_charts) December 20, 2024 This potential squeeze could serve as a catalyst for a swift recovery if the market sentiment flips bullish.

Controversy is not always far off from Australian computer scientist and businessman Craig Wright. The self-acclaimed Bitcoin founder was entangled in another legal action on Thursday, landing jail time this time.The British High Court has sentenced Wright to 12 months imprisonment for contempt. The December 19 ruling would see the computer scientist spend one year behind bars, including a 24-month suspension.Prison Time for Five Counts of ContemptThe beginning of Wright’s woes stemmed from his case with the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), an NGO consisting of crypto establishments. The firm sued Wright over his escalating claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonymous Bitcoin founder.Earlier this year, the Australian businessman lost the legal battle, with the court ruling that he blatantly lied in his claims. Furthermore, the judge issued a legal order constraining Wright from filing legal claims relating to Bitcoin.However, Wright disobeyed the order and pursued fresh legal action against COPA. The association disclosed in a Wednesday hearing that the self-proclaimed Bitcoin founder sued it for £900 billion.Meanwhile, the High Court tried Wright, who appeared on a video call and claimed he was too poor to afford a flight from Asia for the hearing on Thursday. The court charged him with five counts of contempt and sentenced him to a 12-month jail term.Wright’s Years-Long Bitcoin Creator Claims Turning SoarThe computer scientist has incessantly made headlines over claims that he created Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. A court earlier fueled his claims after ruling in his favor over a dispute with David Kleiman, a renowned computer forensics specialist.However, several courts have thrown out other legal proceedings on his Bitcoin claims. The most recent ruling was in March when a court inferred that Wright was not the founder of Bitcoin.Meanwhile, the search for who the pseudonymous founder is has continued.

37880852,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52605,1734696057,Utility Tokens Crash: XRP Falls Below $2.25; SHIB Falls 15%; IntelMarkets Tops Gains With $4.9M Raised,"The Federal Reserve recently announced a 25-basis-point rate cut, bringing the benchmark interest rate to 4.25-4.50%. Following the announcement on Dec. 18, all sectors of the crypto market, including utility tokens, entered a downtrend with tokens like Ripple and Shiba Inu recording significant price drops. However, an AI utility token IntelMarkets, has defied the current market trend, topping gains with $4.9 million raised from its ongoing presale. In this article, we will explore the factors contributing to IntelMarkets’ impressive performance! Ripple: XRP Price Drops Following Federal Rate Cut Announcement The native cryptocurrency of Ripple Labs, XRP, also fell victim to the broad market downtrend witnessed on December 18. The price of XRP declined below $2.25 just hours after the announcement of the Federal rate cut, its market cap dropping over 5% as well. This downturn happened just a day after XRP surpassed BNB and Solana to become the 4th largest crypto by market cap. Ripple’s surge to its current position was influenced by the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD), which boosted its price and market cap. Nevertheless, crypto whales saw the downtrend as an opportunity to purchase 30 million XRP tokens worth $78 million, sparking a recovery for XRP which is now trading at the $2.38 level. Analysts foresee Ripple back to its bullish trajectory by the weekend. Shiba Inu Investors Sell SHIB Holdings, Sparks Selling Pressure Memecoins suffered the most from the Fed Rate cut downturn. Shiba Inu experienced a significant price drop of over 15% while its trading volume dropped by 64%. This suggests that buyers are not defending the asset; instead, they are liquidating their SHIB holdings to mitigate further losses. SHIB’s momentum and sentiment has remained negative since the announcement, while it seeks immediate support at $0.00002500. Experts speculate that a breakdown below this level could move SHIB closer to the 200 EMA’s resting level at $0.00002038. Furthermore, experts have noted that Shiba Inu is not strong enough to make a recovery soon, unless there’s a significant decrease in selling pressure. Based on technical indicators, the Shiba Inu price is predicted to rise 2.69% from its current trading point to $0.00002485 before the new year. IntelMarkets (INTL) Record Gains Amid The Market Downturn While major utility tokens such XRP experience decline alongside Shiba Inu, IntelMarkets is gaining significant traction as the world’s first AI-powered smart trading platform. Powered by AI technology, IntelMarkets aims to provide fast, transparent transactions and seamless, risk-free trading for its users. IntelMarkets helped investors escape the potential losses from the current market downturn, providing them with AI trading agents which offer real-time market analysis from over 10,000+ data points, to investors, helping them stay ahead of the market. Amid the downturn, IntelMarkets’ investors made passive income from staking dividends, while enjoying holding perks such as reduced trading fees and high leverage options up to 1000x, while other investors mourned their losses. The best part is the inter-stage returns over 30% they enjoyed as IntelMarkets transitioned to stage 8 of its presale, with INTL price increasing from $0.064 to $0.073. Market analysts have observed a migration of Shiba Inu investors and others to IntelMarkets, evidenced by its rapid presale growth, which has raised over $4.9 million.

Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) has experienced significant price changes lately. In the past week, its price dropped by 26.17%. Over the past month, it fell by 34.73%. Despite these declines, WIF is up 28.14% over the last six months. Technical indicators suggest that WIF might be oversold. The Relative Strength Index is at 29.14, and the Stochastic oscillator is at 27.16. Both are below 30, which often signals an oversold condition. The current price range is between $2.38 and $3.52. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $2.29, and the 100-day SMA is $2.69. If WIF can rise above the nearest resistance level at $4, it could reach the second resistance at $5.33. This would be an increase of over 50% from current prices. On the downside, if it falls below the support level at $1.91, the next support is at $0.7749, representing a significant drop. The MACD level is negative at -0.0965, showing bearish momentum, but the oversold indicators suggest a possible rebound. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced notable price changes recently. Over the past week, its price decreased by 12.87%, settling within a range of $0.36 to $0.46. The past month saw a smaller decline of 2.80%. Despite these short-term drops, Dogecoin has surged by 189.72% over the last six months, showing significant long-term growth. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 38.21, nearing oversold territory, which might suggest a potential price rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.36, while the 100-day SMA is slightly higher at $0.39, indicating a short-term downward trend. The MACD level stands at -0.00808, reflecting recent bearish momentum. Looking ahead, Dogecoin’s nearest support level is $0.31. If the price falls below this, the next support is at $0.21. On the upside, the nearest resistance level is $0.51. Breaking through this could lead to the next resistance at $0.62. Overcoming these resistance levels could result in price increases exceeding 10% to 20%. Given its substantial six-month growth, Dogecoin may have the potential for further gains if market conditions become favorable. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced notable price movements recently. In the past week, its value dropped by 16.90%, reflecting a significant short-term decline. Over the past month, the decrease was less steep at 3.70%, suggesting some stabilization. Impressively, over the last six months, SHIB’s price has surged by 34.10%, indicating strong long-term potential. Currently trading between $0.000023966 and $0.000032006, SHIB is approaching its nearest support level at $0.000020063. If it holds above this point, it may rally towards the nearest resistance at $0.000036143. Breaking this resistance could lead to testing the second resistance level at $0.000044183, which would be an increase of around 38%. Conversely, falling below the support might push the price down to the second support level at $0.000012023. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 35.34, suggesting the coin is nearing oversold territory and might rebound. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.000024107, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.000026627, indicating potential bearish momentum. The MACD level is negative at -0.0000005695, but the Stochastic oscillator at 40.84 is in a neutral zone. Considering these factors, SHIB’s price could consolidate before making a decisive move, with close attention needed on key support and resistance levels. Conclusion Although WIF, DOGE, and SHIB are strong assets, XYZVerse (XYZ) leads as the pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting significant growth in the 2024 bull run.

42389405,54ae5706-7239-40b8-a1b7-4e393cc9f7a6,1734696000,Crypto Daybook Americas: China's Economic Woes Offer Hope as Fed Rate Talk Crashes BTC,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  Keeping an eye on the Far East has been our mantra lately, and the latest news from the Chinese bond market shows why. Just today, China's one-year government bond yield dropped below 1% for the first time since the Great Financial Crisis, adding to the year-to-date downturn. The benchmark 10-year yield slipped to 1.7%.  How does that play out for risk assets like bitcoin, which slumped overnight? Well, there are two key reasons to feel optimistic. For a start, the continued decline in yields suggests Beijing will have to roll out more aggressive stimulus measures than we saw earlier this year.  Jeroen Blokland, the founder and manager of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, put it succinctly: “This indicates that China's economic troubles are far from over, and the government will do what aging economies often do: ramp up government spending, allow for larger deficits and higher debt levels, and drive interest rates down toward zero.”  And there's more to consider. This situation in China also raises questions about Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's recent alarm over interest rates, which sent bitcoin tumbling to $95,000 from $105,000.   China, the world's factory, is facing worsening deflation having already experienced the longest stretch of falling prices since the late 1990s. That could cap PPI and CPI readings worldwide, including in the U.S., a major trading partner.  BNP Paribas noted this phenomenon earlier this year, with analysts saying that China has already contributed to lowering core inflation in the eurozone and the U.S. by about 0.1 percentage point and core goods inflation by roughly 0.5 percentage point.  What this means is that Powell's concerns about stubborn inflation may be unfounded and begs the question whether he will really stick to just two rate cuts for 2025 as he implied on Wednesday? Many experts think there might be more.   “Fed concerns on inflation are misguided. Interest rates are still too high in the U.S., and liquidity is about to increase, driving Bitcoin higher,” said Dan Tapiero, CEO and CIO of 10T Holdings, on X, alluding to China's declining bond yields.  For now, markets aren't considering this bullish angle. BTC has dropped below $95,000 and ETH has slipped to $3,200. All the 100 biggest coins are flashing red. Futures tied to the S&P 500 are down 0.5%, indicating a negative open and continuation of the post-Fed risk-off.  Sentiment may worsen if the core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, comes in hotter than expected later today. That might see markets price out another rate cut, leaving just one on the table for 2025. Stay alert!

The scatologically named AI agent token jumped over $1.1 billion in market cap early Friday even as the broader market saw a second-straight day of losses, becoming one of the few tokens in the green.  FART's rise is as much about human psychology as economics. In a market where fundamental investments are faltering, it has become a symbol of the absurd, a light-hearted rebellion against the grim financial forecasts.  Its platform allows users to potentially submit related-theme memes or jokes to earn tokens. It features a unique transactional system where each trade produces a digital flatuence sound.  People are investing not for the promise of utility or groundbreaking technology but for the joy of the moment, the shared giggle over a coin whose name alone is enough to break the tension of the day.  It isn't all about the jokes, though. The token is part of the rising AI agent crypto sector, one that claims to use AI-powered entities to perform tasks on blockchain networks autonomously under a memecoin branding.  Derivatives Positioning  The BTC one-month basis has pulled back to 10% on the CME while the three-month basis has dropped to around 12% on offshore exchanges. ETH futures display similar behavior.   Most major tokens are showing negative perpetual cumulative volume deltas for the past 24 hours, a sign of net selling pressure. DOGE has seen the most intense selling.   Front-end BTC and ETH show a strong put bias, but calls expiring on Jan. 31 and beyond continue to trade at a premium.   Block trades in options leaned slightly bearish, with large transactions involving a standalone long position in the $75K put expiring on Jan. 31.  Someone sold a large amount of ETH $3K put.

Dozens of House Republicans Defy Trump in Test of His Grip on GOP (The New York Times): President-elect Donald Trump’s influence over his party failed a test on Thursday as 38 conservative House Republicans ignored his threats and rejected a bill to extend federal spending into 2025 and suspend the debt limit until 2027.   As Bitcoin's Post-Fed Price Dip Extends, This Key Contrary Indicator Offers Fresh Hope: Godbole (CoinDesk): Bitcoin’s drop below $96,000 triggered a key contrary indicator—the 50-hour SMA crossing below the 200-hour SMA—suggesting potential for a renewed rally above $100,000, though risks of further declines remain.

37880459,https://crypto.news/?p=14321012,1734695912,El Salvador accelerates Bitcoin buying following IMF deal,"El Salvador has ramped up its Bitcoin buying a day after agreeing to an International Monetary Fund deal that required scaling back its government-led crypto activities. On Dec. 19, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender and host a Bitcoin strategic reserve added 11 BTC worth over $1 million to its holdings. With the recent purchase, the country’s total holdings now stand at over 5,980 Bitcoin, currently valued at over $577 million according to the National Bitcoin Office’s tracker. Up until now, El Salvador’s Bitcoin accumulation followed the steady pace of its “1 Bitcoin a day” program, launched by President Nayib Bukele after making the cryptocurrency legal tender in 2022. However, the latest purchase deviated from the strategy and aligns with the National Bitcoin Office’s plans to continue buying Bitcoin at an “accelerated pace,” as conf irmed by the Bitcoin office’s director, Stacy Herbert, on Dec. 19. This follows the country’s recent yet-to-be-confirmed $1.4 billion IMF deal , which mandates changes to its Bitcoin policy. The global regulator has repeatedly warned of the economic risks Bitcoin adoption could pose to the nation’s financial stability. You might also like: El Salvador to discontinue Bitcoin wallet Chivo in $1.4b IMF deal As part of the deal, El Salvador has agreed to remove mandatory requirements for businesses to accept Bitcoin, making it optional, and to restrict tax payments to US dollars. Further, the country will also wind down the Chivo crypto wallet, which was launched in 2021 as the nation’s state-backed platform to facilitate Bitcoin transactions. Nevertheless, according to Herbert, the country will continue to accept Bitcoin as legal tender and expand its efforts to solidify its position as a Bitcoin-focused economy. This includes advancing Bitcoin capital markets, fostering education programs, and supporting private-sector Bitcoin wallets to serve the growing ecosystem. Additionally, initiatives like blockchain developer training and financial literacy programs will remain central to El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy as governments worldwide grow increasingly curious about Bitcoin, spurred by incoming US President Donald Trump’s plan to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Notably, regulators in Brazil have proposed allocating 5% of the nation’s $370 billion treasury to a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Elsewhere, a deputy in the Russian parliament has urged Finance Minister Anton Siluanov to consider a similar approach. Last month, Polish minister Sławomir Mentzen also pitched the idea of Poland holding Bitcoin in a bid to make the country more crypto-friendly.

37880397,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395588,1734695796,The Rise of Remittix (RTX): A New Competitor to Near Protocol (NEAR) And Avalanche (AVAX),"The post The Rise of Remittix (RTX): A New Competitor to Near Protocol (NEAR) And Avalanche (AVAX) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The promise of another bull run is dawning upon us. And with it, the gold rush for the next hot new crypto. While AVAX and NEAR were once the hot new crypto in their initial parabolic runs to all-time highs in 2021 and 2022, respectively, they are no longer in the running for the plum in 2025. One exciting newly launched DeFi protocol is expected to make a strong case in the form of Remittix (RTX)—and the best part? This hot new crypto just launched its presale. Here’s why analysts believe Remittix will outperform NEAR and AVAX in 2025. Remittix: Laying down a marker for PayFi in 2025 The smart money is betting on hot new crypto projects to turn in big-time gains in 2025—and one of those projects is Remittix. Kicking off stage 1 of its presale amid massive intrigue from industry observers, Remittix revolutionizes cross-border payments by creating a blockchain powered payment network, enabling users to send fiat payments to any bank account using cryptocurrencies. With zero FX fees and near-instantaneous settlements, Remittix is filling the gap between traditional payment processors like Wise and Stripe and the $4 trillion crypto economy. With the global cross-border payments industry forecast to exceed a $250 trillion valuation by 2027, Remittix is well-positioned to capture a sizable chunk of the inflows expected to flow into the industry thanks to its unique PayFi infrastructure. The Remittix ecosystem will be powered by its native $RTX token, which is available in its presale at just $0.015. The presale is an ideal opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a low-cap blue chip with all the momentum and runway to go on a godlike pump in 2025. Remittix takes the cake as the hot new crypto presale that’s left on the board. NEAR and AVAX poised for a comeback? NEAR and AVAX are Layer-1 blockchain protocols that peaked at all-time highs in previous bull runs. And while both NEAR and AVAX token prices have fallen by the wayside relative to their ATH levels, both L1 platforms are making decent comebacks as the year comes to an end. NEAR Protocol is up by a decent, if rather unspectacular, 13.6% in the past month, while AVAX is up by a substantial 39% within the same time frame. The price action that both NEAR and AVAX are recording as the year ends indicates a potential comeback brewing in the works when the new year arrives. While they will never be mistaken as hot new crypto investments, their large market caps make them more appropriate for more conservative investors wishing to gain some exposure to the crypto market. However, investors looking for a pump will be better served by investing in low-cap gems like Remittix. Remittix takes plum as THE hot new crypto presale of 2025 NEAR and AVAX are solid picks but have a more limited upside for growth; at best, they might retest their previous all-time highs. That’s not bad at all. However, Remittix, with its value proposition, discounted presale prices, and strategic positioning in a lucrative market, has all the markings of a blue chip that’s ready to skyrocket once it lists on exchanges, making it the better choice for investors looking to outperform the rest of the market in 2025.

37880396,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395603,1734695792,"PENGU Token Crashes 25% After Airdrop, but Should You Exit?","The post PENGU Token Crashes 25% After Airdrop, but Should You Exit? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After launching a major airdrop earlier this week that unlocked nearly 70% of the Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) token into circulation, the altcoin has seen a sharp decline. With a fully diluted market valuation of about $2.1 billion and a 24-hour trading volume around $1.2 billion, PENGU dropped over 25% in just 24 hours, trading at about $0.024 on Friday, December 20, during the early New York session. The drop in price comes amid broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market . More than $1.3 million was liquidated from the PENGU leveraged market, with over 85% of liquidations involving long traders. As early adopters, who received PENGU tokens during the airdrop, begin to take profits, the token faces more downward pressure in the near term. What to expect ahead? We’ve laid it all out for you. PENGU Market Fundamentals Despite the recent decline, PENGU’s value is supported by the success of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, which consists of 8,888 digital assets. According to OpenSea, the floor price of these NFTs is around 16.8 ETH, or more than $50k, reflecting a 51% rise over the past 90 days. The Pudgy Penguins team has also expanded into physical products like toys and clothing, further growing their brand. The community around Pudgy Penguins, known as the Huddle community, has also grown significantly, strengthening the ecosystem and positioning the project for future growth as the crypto industry continues to adopt mainstream attention. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Early PENGU Trader Makes $87,000 with Just $6 – Here’s the Strategy , What’s Next for PENGU?

Despite facing selling pressure, PENGU has managed to hold a market cap above $1 billion, demonstrating its resilience.

Here’s why","XRP is showing signs of recovery following a sharp 18% decline in value, attributed to the broader cryptocurrency market downturn. This drop, which saw the price fall from $2.7 to $2.08, coincided with Bitcoin’s retreat from $108,000 to under $100,000 after the Federal Reserve announced a 0.25% interest rate cut. Despite the bearish sentiment, analyst EGRAG suggests that XRP is poised for a bullish reversal.

Using a 1-hour chart, the analyst noted that this zone could be the foundation for stabilization and recovery. #XRP Quick Update 1 Hour Time Frame ( UPDATE): The #BULLS has Stepped IN. Trust the Process https://t.co/xQDzxuveIx pic.twitter.com/8fljp7iDYM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 18, 2024 Currently, XRP trades below the 21-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), representing the nearest resistance level. The analyst remarked that this positioning highlights the ongoing tension between buyers and sellers. EGRAG’s analysis indicates the formation of a potential double-bottom structure—a bullish reversal pattern—following the recent price action. The first bottom was observed when XRP dropped to $2.33 on December 16 before rebounding to $2.72, a move fueled by the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD . The second bottom formed during the recent decline to $2.17. Should XRP consolidate within the current support range, it could set the stage for a recovery. However, the price must surpass the neckline resistance at $2.7 to confirm the double-bottom pattern. Technical Indicators Support a Bullish Outlook EGRAG’s analysis also highlights encouraging signs from key technical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has aligned with price trends and recently hovered near 70, a level suggesting increasing momentum. The analyst stated that a breakout above 70 could pave the way for further strength, potentially reaching 90. Additionally, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator supports the possibility of bullish momentum. Its histogram has flipped positive, signaling a potential upward trend. Meanwhile, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has also improved, indicating a strengthening trend.

At that time, XRP was trading at $2.31. Scenario A suggested a breakout above $2.5, potentially initiating upward movement. Scenario B, however, predicted a dip to $2.27 followed by consolidation within the $2.17–$2.27 range. According to the analyst, this consolidation phase would allow XRP to form a double-bottom structure, providing a foundation for subsequent bullish action. The recent market activity suggests that XRP is following Scenario B. After testing the $2.2 level and finding support, the cryptocurrency is expected to consolidate before attempting a breakout. EGRAG noted that this phase would enable key moving averages to align, creating a stronger base for sustained growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.27, marking an 8.26% decrease in the past 24 hours. For now, investors are closely monitoring a possible price interaction with the $2.39 EMA resistance and the $2.7 neckline.

Concurrently, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is closing in on the coin after the end of its first stage presale, having generated more than $1 million in funding. Yeti Ouro is signaling exciting potential with its Play-to-Earn game Yeti Go amid its second stage. Ripple’s XRP Poised For A 700% Rally As Analysts Eye New Highs Ripple’s XRP has been impressive in 2024 as analysts predict a 700% rally. XRP price has risen by 133.2% in the last 30 days and now trades at $2.47. The positive developments that are buoying the price of XRP include bullish technical indicators, rising whale transactions, and Ripple’s RLUSD enterprise-grade stablecoin. Ripple is introducing RLUSD on December 18 across platforms like Uphold, Bitso, MoonPay, and CoinMENA and has plans for further integration in the future. Experts say that RLUSD will enhance the use of XRP in cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. If XRP managed to break past $2.72, it could hit short-term goals at $5.85 and $8.76 with potential for the token to reach an all-time high of $9.78. Source X The ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and regulators and the possibility of approving spot XRP ETFs in the U.S. further bolsters the positivity. According to technical analysis, XRP is in the process of forming an ascending triangle, which is a bullish continuation pattern. If a breakout happens above this formation, XRP could easily hit $4 USDT, which would be a 48% gain from the current price. Yeti Ouro Presale Progresses Amid Investor Interest Yeti Ouro is a Play-to-Earn gaming token experiencing steady investor demand during the presale phase. At the moment, stage two is going on; 3,282,716 tokens have been sold for $55,806.165, and 3.3% of the stage has been completed. The token is priced at $0.017 in this phase, after marking a successful stage one with 100,000,000 tokens sold for $1.2 million. This is largely due to the launch of the Play-to-Earn game called Yeti Go which is being developed using Unreal Engine. The game has been developed to feature AAA-quality graphics, active gameplay, and Dolby Atmos sound. The creators of this game have worked along with the creators of other well-known games like The Witcher 3 and Call of Duty to ensure the game is as good as it can be. Yeti Ouro has launched a meme contest with a prize pool of $2000 for 1st place , $1000 for second place and $500 for third place. To participate, create engaging Yeti-themed memes, and share on X. Make sure to tag @yetiouro and use hashtag #YetiMeme. To learn more head over to the official Yeti Ouro X channel . Yeti Ouro’s total maximum supply of one billion tokens and the burn mechanism give investors confidence. YETIO is expected to trade between $0.50 and $1.00 by the end of 2024 and $3.00 by the end of 2025 based on Yeti Go’s performance. With the immersive gameplay mechanics and design, Yeti Orou aims to become a Play-to-Earn market leader and attract gamers from around the world.

37880282,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395269,1734695580,Memecoin Alert: Can Shiba Inu Holders Save SHIB From Dipping Below $0.00002? Experts List Alternate Cryptos,"The post Memecoin Alert: Can Shiba Inu Holders Save SHIB From Dipping Below $0.00002? Experts List Alternate Cryptos appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Shiba Inu (SHIB) is hovering around a critical price point of $0.00002, a key resistant level that SHIB has struggled to breach multiple times in the past. Earlier in October 2024, SHIB was predicted to reach an approximate of $0.00004020 on October 5, 2024. However, despite the prediction, the price didn’t sustain above that level for long. Now, the $0.00002 price level calls for the consideration of alternative projects like DTX Exchange, which has already given traders gains of over 440% in the past few months. SHIB Seems To Be On a Downward Spiral Amidst Other Alternate Cryptos Like DTX Exchange SHIB reached its all-time high of approximately $0.000084 in late 2021. Ever since, it hasn’t sustained impressive price points for traders. There’s been a downward trajectory, with prices falling around $0.000018. The turn of events seemed to be temporary at first, but even with the increase in whale transactions of up to 240%, there hasn’t been any sustained upward momentum. This begs the question: Will investing in alternate cryptos like Fantom (FTM) or DTX yield better returns than waiting on a price change? Based on the current market sentiment and adoption trends, investing in alternate cryptos like DTX Exchange may give more promising returns. The current listing price of DTX Exchange is $0.20, but the current price is set at $0.12, giving a chance for 80% profit in its listing alone, especially for early adopters. DTX Exchange supports a wide range of assets, including stocks, forex, and commodities. Compared to SHIB, this allows traders to explore various markets, serving as a more substantial utility and practical investment option. DTX also provides advanced trading features as up to 1,000x leverage, helping them maximize returns. The presale success of DTX also attracted institutional investors, raising over $10.3 million. With the institutional backing, there’s an increased legitimacy status of the project, opening a door for more growth potential. Based on the current growth, DTX could follow a trajectory similar to established stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DTX token holders also have governance rights within the platform. They can participate in decision making processes regarding the future of the exchange. Compared to other coins, this community-driven approach creates an environment for deeper engagement and trust in the future of the exchange. DTX Exchange Solidifies Its Technology Foundation As Traders Make More Gains DTX Exchange uses the Vulcan X blockchain technology, which has shown an impressive transaction speed of 0.4 milliseconds and an ability to process over 100,000 transactions per second. The exchange’s solid tech foundation helps traders in fast-moving markets and ensures they can make the most gains without technical difficulties. Alongside DTX’s top tech, they allow low transaction fees compared to the traditional financial markets, which makes DTX more cost-effective and, on the long run, more reliable. Since they employ a non-custodial trading model, allowing users to retain control over private keys, they still stand as one of the best Shiba Inu alternatives. Don’t Wait for SHIB’s Dip When DTX Exchange Promises Gains As SHIB faces a major challenge in maintaining its price above critical support levels, traders look for more stable opportunities like DTX Exchange . Recent projections suggest that early investors in DTX could see returns of up to 321% as it gains traction in the market. The previous gains from the past few months prove a potential for more traction after its broader launch.

Last Day is January 19!,"Worldcoin (WLD), which has been at the center of controversy since its launch, has failed to overcome the problems it has had with countries. At this point the last news came from Germany. Worldcoin, the cryptocurrency-based digital identity project co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, is under renewed scrutiny as German regulators demand compliance with European Union (EU) data protection laws. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) said in a statement that the investigation focused on whether Worldcoin's core technology, World ID, complies with GDPR standards. At this point, BayLDA ordered Worldcoin to implement a GDPR-compliant data deletion protocol by January 19 at the latest. GDPR is a comprehensive EU law designed to protect individuals' personal data and privacy, and imposes strict rules on how data is collected, processed and stored. Michael Will, BayDLA State Office Director, said: “With today's decision, we apply European fundamental rights standards in favour of data owners in a technologically challenging and legally complex case. With this decision, all users who provide their iris data to Worldcoin will have an unrestricted opportunity to exercise their right to erasure in the future.” Worldcoin has received the German regulator's decision and plans to appeal it, according to a statement from the institution. Worldcoin, which has had problems with regulators in many countries, voluntarily suspended some of its operations in EU countries during the investigations and made updates to improve compliance. However, countries like Kenya and Portugal have temporarily banned the project due to privacy concerns. Worldcoin, which has fallen by 7.7% in the last 24 hours, continues to trade at $2.22 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

Kiyosaki reveals ‘it’s not too late to buy Bitcoin’,"The recent price action in the cryptocurrency market – both the November and the early December rally and the latest downturn – caused some anxiety among investors about whether it is too late to enter a Bitcoin ( BTC ) position. Robert Kiyosaki , a prominent investor and the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ took the opportunity to alleviate these fears in a pointed X post. Specifically, in a mock conversation, Kiyosaki, in no uncertain terms, opined that it is never ‘too late’ to invest in BTC as the coin ‘is designed to make everyone rich.’ He highlighted in the tweet that this fact applies to ‘those who start late’ as much as to the early investors. Finally, the author concluded his message with a simple warning that, despite the exceptionally bullish tone of his post, investors shouldn’t ‘get greedy.’ Q: IS IT TOO LATE to start buying BITCOIN? A: NO. The beauty of Bitcoins design is it is never too late to start….regardless of how high Bitcoins price goes. Bitcoin is designed to make everyone rich…. even those who start late. Just don’t get greedy. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 19, 2024 Is following Kiyosaki’s advice a savvy move for investors? Looking at the performance of Robert Kiyosaki’s favored investors – chiefly Bitcoin, gold , and silver – his message appears to ring true. Traders who listened to his advice and invested in the cryptocurrency or the commodities would have enjoyed stellar gains in 2024. This fact holds particularly true for BTC, as essentially everyone who purchased the coin before mid-November would be significantly in the green, even once the current downtrend is accounted for. BTC 6-month price chart. Source: Finbold Zooming out, however, reveals that Kiyosaki’s advice doesn’t necessarily hold true in myriad ways. To begin with, investors who purchased Bitcoin on his recommendation near the 2021 highs and didn’t have the financial security to outlast the ‘crypto winter’ would have been devastated. Additionally, there is a general sense that the author’s advice is primarily aimed at those with exceptional financial resilience – a resilience that can justify a grand risk appetite – as he is also known for describing recessions – famously periods when most people don’t have much disposable income – as the very best buying opportunities. Indeed, this grand risk appetite is seen in his own approach as Kiyosaki indicated much of his portfolio – despite its successes in 2024 – is fueled by debt and that he is himself more than $1 billion in debt . Finally, the earnestness of the author’s advice can be called into question as, earlier in December, he called on people to sell their homes and buy Bitcoin while he himself claims to own thousands of houses . Can investing in Bitcoin this December truly make everyone rich? As for the accuracy of Kiysoaki’s most recent advice, only time will tell whether following it would lead to profit. On the one hand, the current downtrend in the cryptocurrency market does not negate the overall bull case – Wall Street legend Tom Lee estimates Bitcoin will hit $250,000 in 2025, and the author recently revised his price target for BTC to $350,000 . On the other, the deep plunge digital assets are experiencing in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s latest announcement – a plunge that is, at press time on December 20, proving stickier than for stocks or commodities – equally calls into question the stability of the cryptocurrency bull market and the wisdom of using these assets as a hedge against financial instability. It is worth pointing out that a common thread for Kiyosaki’s advice is that Bitcoin, gold, and silver can save investors from the massive and imminent crash he frequently predicts.

Trump Fires Powell (TRUMPPOW), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPOW is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Fires Powell can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fires Powell could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fires Powell launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fires Powell on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fires Powell by entering its contract address – FWmVybuoRxJ79ZDHJ3Y8efeYsHsKL4qMNwJP8rCDsfmB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPOW. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-fires-powell-trumppow-will-explode-over-15000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

This time, the risk-taking wallet holder accumulated FARTCOIN, the hottest meme created by an AI agent. The wallet of sbfonchain.sol now contains FARTCOIN, a trending crossover between memes and AI agents. The asset, created based on the ideas of an AI model, has acquired cult status in the past month, reaching a series of all-time highs. The sbfonchain.sol wallet spent 19,103 SOL, averaging into FARTCOIN in the past 24 hours. The accumulation was at an average price of $1.17, for a total of 3.25M FARTCOIN. After the purchase, the token remained inactive for a few hours. The purchase is relatively small in comparison to previous bigger whale inflows. As of December 19, one whale purchased $43.77M of FARTCOIN, just before the token’s all-time high. The sbfonchain.sol wallet is known for risky trades The wallet of sbfonchain.sol has become active for the first time since November 27, taking positions in high-profile memes. In the interim, the wallet buys and flips more obscure meme tokens. For some of the trades, the wallet bought in near the top. In September, sbfonchain.sol also traded Moodeng (MOODENG) while the asset was trending. After that, the wallet holder flipped Chillguy (CHILLGUY), later divesting all holdings. The buyer’s approach is to roll into hot tokens with large sums, then take profit or cut losses quickly within hours. Previously, the wallet had spent $1.44M on FARTCOIN, flipping the asset soon after that. The latest purchase of FARTCOIN had a similar timeline, as the wallet rolled over all funds into the meme. The purchase was made right after the token dipped from recent highs of $1.27 down to $0.94 . The wallet’s holdings are relatively minor, outside the list of top 150 addresses, but the public profile is drawing more attention to the asset and to the opportunity of buying the dip. Soon after the purchase, the wallet experienced a loss, as the holdings sank from $3.2M to $3.097M in valuation. Overall, the wallet’s performance in the past month has been somewhat underwhelming, as previous flips on DogWifHat (WIF) incurred losses. The previous losses, however, did not seem to faze the wallet owner, as the risky trades continued. The wallet is also not careful with divesting the holdings, as in the case of crashing the MANYU token by directly liquidating all reserves. The wallet was first noted for moving between meme tokens in May. It also gained attention because of its vanity name. There is so far no evidence proposed that the wallet belongs to Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the defunct FTX exchange. Whale buyer enters the market as FARTCOIN expands to new trading hubs FARTCOIN started out as an unserious asset, similar to GOAT and other AI-generated memes. As the asset grew its owner base, exchanges started to pay attention. The meme is held in more than 51K wallets. At first sight, FARTCOIN has a relatively wide distribution, although some of the wallets may be connected and control a larger portion of the supply. The token was also one of the largest holdings in the Truth Terminal wallet. Later, FARTCOIN became a community-owned token, with no known cabal or group of buyers. The wide community put FARTCOIN at the top of all Solana projects based on the number of unique addresses and wallets. The recent purchase by sbfonchain.sol came a day after FARTCOIN was listed on KuCoin. The token was added to the dy/dx futures market a week ago. OKX started trading FARTCOIN on its perpetual futures market starting at 4 AM UTC on December 20. The token will gain a futures market along with AI16Z. FARTCOIN has the advantage of turning into a cult meme, while also riding the AI agent narrative. Both categories are the consensus choices for creating FOMO among buyers, tapping into the demand for irrational memes and social media cults. While the overall meme market slowed down, FARTCOIN used the moment to extend its rally and gain more attention. Recently, the token broke above the $1B market cap barrier, surpassing GOAT and almost competing with the AI16Z token.

37880017,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395569,1734694997,Japan Eyes Crypto Tax Reform: Here’s What Will Change,"The post Japan Eyes Crypto Tax Reform: Here’s What Will Change appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Japanese crypto investors currently pay taxes as high as 55% on their profits. This heavy tax burden has raised concerns about the country’s crypto market. Recognizing the negative effects of this outdated tax system, Japan’s policymakers are now working on a solution. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is preparing a reform outline to stop the outflow of capital caused by the country’s unfriendly tax rules. Here’s what you should know about the latest development. What’s in the Proposed Crypto Tax Reform? The LDP is expected to release its crypto tax reform plan by the end of 2024, with many anticipating significant changes in 2025. The political shift in the U.S., especially with the rise of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump , seems to have influenced Japan’s decision to rethink its tax approach. The goal of the reform is to make Japan’s crypto tax system more competitive and prevent capital from leaving the country. Takuya Hirai, Japan’s Minister of Digital Affairs, has stressed the need for a solid crypto tax and regulation framework before Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2025. His comments highlight the urgency Japan feels to align with global trends and stay competitive. Why Tax is Hurting Japan’s Crypto Industry Currently, many crypto investors in Japan face taxes up to 55% on their profits, a steep rate compared to the 20% flat capital gains tax in many other countries. Critics argue that Japan’s high tax rates are pushing investors and businesses to seek opportunities elsewhere, stalling the country’s potential to become a leader in the crypto space. Reforms Under Fumio Kishida The push for crypto tax reform began during the leadership of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Under his guidance, the LDP showed strong support for creating a favorable environment for Web3 development . The Headquarters for the Promotion of a Digital Society, in partnership with the Financial Research Council, has played a crucial role in drafting the reform outline. Reports suggest that both the ruling and opposition parties agree on the need for crypto tax reform in Japan. Many lawmakers recognize that the current tax system is holding back the growth of Japan’s crypto industry, making it difficult for the country to compete globally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Considers National Bitcoin Reserve as Countries Embrace Crypto , Staying Cautious Is Key While the reform proposal has wide support, recent comments from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who campaigned as a pro-crypto candidate, suggest he prefers to take a cautious approach to tax reform.

37879961,https://crypto.news/?p=14321029,1734694931,This $0.15 SOL alternative could pump like 2021 Solana in the coming altcoin season,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as a promising altcoin contender, with 400% presale growth and a unique approach to real-world asset tokenization poised to rival Solana’s meteoric rise. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The tokenization revolution A presale success that mirrors Solana’s growth Why investors are eyeing RXS as the next big altcoin Conclusion Investors looking for the next big project are considering investing in altcoins, which can repeat history and grow like Solana’s (SOL) growth in 2021. With a current SOL price of $234.0877, it has cemented its dominance as one of the top blockchain platforms. However, an alternative option, RXS, with a cost of $0.15, is starting to gain traction, and several industry professionals believe it will grow similarly to Solana. The Rexas Finance (RXS) project surges are more likely to happen due to its unique take on real-world asset tokenization and the success achieved with the token’s presale. The price of $0.030 in September 2024 has already skyrocketed to $0.150, an increase of 400%, and is still expected to climb further. Aiming for real-life use cases, along with great tokenomics and advanced tech, Rexas Finance has the potential to perform well in the next altcoin season. Rexas Finance: The tokenization revolution Rexas Finance prioritizes tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate, commodities, and fine art, offering investors efficient and transparent access to typically hard-to-reach markets. By tokenizing assets, Rexas believes there will be more room to design investment strategies that target these usually hard-to-access markets in a better, more efficient, and transparent way. Through the Rexas Estate platform, Rexas enables users to tokenize real estate properties, which then allows these properties to be bought and sold more efficiently, thereby increasing the chances of fractional ownership. The essential distinction between Solana and Rexas Finance, on the one hand, and Rexas Finance, on the other, lies in the Solana ethos. Solana changed the face of the blockchain world by providing extraordinary speeds in transactions and scalability. On the other hand, the aim of Rexas Finance is entirely different: it is intended to bring a radical change in the everyday asset markets. Enabling RWAs to be tokenized can create innumerable growth opportunities, looking at the world’s demands for diversification into blockchain assets. This blend of the real estate markets with blockchain technology and the decentralization and transparency that comes with it are key competitive advantages of Rexas Finance. You might also like: Rexas Finance price forecast: where could RXS be in the next 12 months A presale success that mirrors Solana’s growth The presale performance of Rexas Finance has also drawn parallels to Solana ‘s early days. With a remarkable boost in price, it moved from a $0.030 price tag to $0.150 within a few months, and it has managed to raise more than $28.7 million in the presale. This sudden rise in demand has stirred expectations around the project as it moves toward its presale’s final stages. Similar to the presale of Solana in 2021, it seems Rexas Finance is poised to become the next biggest crypto project. Rexas Finance’s presale has done exceptionally well, and other than the superb price margin growth, it has also been aided by an excellent tokenomics strategy. 42.5% of the entire supply of Rexas finance has been saved for a presale, allowing new investors to buy coins off the market at a considerably low price before they are listed on major exchanges. The exchange listing price is predicted to be around $0.20, allowing early investors to receive a favorable 2x return upon the coins being released in major exchanges. Based on how Rexas Finance is currently proceeding, there is a chance that it may mimic Solana’s rapid growth during 2021. Why investors are eyeing RXS as the next big altcoin The roadmap for Rexas Finance makes the project so distinctive from other altcoins. Rexas Finance also includes cutting-edge technology such as the Rexas Token Builder, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas GenAI, besides their goal to tokenize real-world assets. These platforms give users the power to generate personalized tokens, mint NFTs, and use AI to make blockchain interactions easier and more interesting. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem expansion is directed towards appealing to a considerable market, ranging from DeFi users to real estate and NFT markets. Moreover, the project is also equipped with smart contracts that have passed a CertiK audit and thus provide further confidence in investing in Rexas Finance in hopes of significant profits during the upcoming altcoin season. There are high expectations for RXS to develop along a trajectory similar to that of Solana in 2021, as the token’s success in the presale must largely be attributed to its newfound growth. Once more investors comprehend the full breadth of the project and its potential, there could be significant demand for RXS tokens akin to what happened in Solana’s surging prices in a matter of days. Conclusion Following its unique strategy of tokenizing real-world assets and a presale that resembles Solana’s early stages, Rexas Finance is one of the leading altcoin projects to watch in the forthcoming altcoin season.

37880638,https://thecoinrise.com/bitcoins-drop-sparks-surge-in-buy-the-dip-sentiment-on-social-media/,1734694870,Bitcoin’s Drop Sparks Surge in ‘Buy the Dip’ Sentiment on Social Media,"As Bitcoin’s price dipped below the critical $100,000 threshold on December 19, social media discussions about “buying the dip” surged to their highest levels in over eight months, according to data from crypto analytics firm Santiment. The firm revealed that the social dominance score—reflecting mentions of the phrase on social platforms—peaked at 0.061. This spike in sentiment mirrors trends seen earlier this year. The last time the “ buy the dip” narrative was this dominant was on April 12, when Bitcoin’s price plummeted from $70,000 to $63,000 within days. A similar surge was observed on August 4, as the cryptocurrency slipped below $60,000, ultimately reaching $53,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $93,200, continuing its week-long struggle to maintain stability above $100,000. Each dip below this psychological level has triggered notable liquidations , with traders scrambling to capitalize on perceived bargains. Rising Interest in ‘Buy the Dip’ Sentiment While Bitcoin battles to regain ground, the sentiment to “buy the dip” has gained traction not just on social media but also in search trends. Global searches for the phrase hit their highest point since August 10, according to Google Trends data. However, interest in the broader term “crypto” has waned since the beginning of December. Over the past seven days, search interest for “crypto” scored 75, a notable decline from the peak score of 100 seen earlier this month. Market Volatility on the Horizon Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Fund, warned investors to brace for heightened volatility in the coming days. In a December 19 post, Edwards noted that market movements could swing significantly in either direction due to the heightened bearish sentiment. He suggested that such pessimism might eventually fuel a market rebound, triggering a short squeeze as traders rush to cover positions. “The odds are decent that the market becomes so bearish it flips,” Edwards remarked, leaving room for optimism amid the current uncertainty. As Bitcoin hovers below $100,000, all eyes are on whether buy the dip sentiment will translate into a reversal or if the market will continue its downward trajectory.

37879868,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375501,1734694825,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Collapse, Meme Coin Bloodbath, and More: Bits Recap Dec 20","TL;DR Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 14% in three days, influenced by the Federal Reserve’s inflation concerns. The meme coin market saw a sharp 20% drop, with assets like DOGE and SHIB facing double-digit losses and analysts predicting further losses for the former. XRP hit a multi-day low of under $2, but industry participants remain optimistic, highlighting key potential triggers for a future rally, including a Ripple ETF and regulatory resolutions. BTC Loses $13K in Three Days At the start of the business week, Bitcoin (BTC) soared to a new all-time high of over $108,000. Its market capitalization crossed the $2 trillion mark, making the cryptocurrency bigger than Saudi Aramco and other well-known corporations. However, the peak was short-lived, and the bulls took a major blow in the following days. BTC tumbled to approximately $101,000 on December 18 and under $93,000 in the last several hours. Currently, the asset is worth around $93,200 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 14% decline on a three-day scale. The market started retracing shortly after the US Federal Reserve announced its latest rate cut. It reduced the benchmark by 0.25%, but Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that the policy might be paused next year due to rising inflation concerns. He also said the central bank is not permitted to buy BTC , despite Donald Trump’s promises . While the 13-grand crash in just three days might sound quite dramatic, some factors hint that the bulls could be back in charge soon. Crypto analytics platform Santiment recently estimated that BTC’s collapse has increased discussions about buying the dip to early August levels. Back then, the asset’s price tumbled below $50,000, but a few days later, it climbed beyond $62,000. It will be interesting to see whether history will repeat itself this time. Heavy Bleeding in the Meme Coin Niche The meme coin sector has been even more affected than BTC. Its market capitalization is down a whopping 20% on a daily scale , plunging below $100 billion. All of the leading assets, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk Inu (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), and many more, have charted double-digit losses. It is quite challenging to find a meme coin positioned in the green today, with Zerebro (ZEREBRO) being among the few exceptions. Some analysts expect further losses in the sector, more specifically touching upon DOGE. Jake Wujastyk envisioned a potential drop to $0.27, while Rose Premium Signals predicted a crash to $0.22. However, the latter thinks DOGE could then rebound and resume its bull run. How’s XRP Doing? Lastly, we will focus on Ripple’s native token , which is also deep in the red today (December 20). Currently, it trades at around $2, which is the lowest mark observed in the past ten days. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Many industry participants, though, foresee good days ahead for the XRP army. One analyst recently advised investors to cash out only when seven important things happen. Those include the introduction of Ripple’s stablecoin , Donald Trump’s inauguration, a potential resolution of the Ripple v. SEC case, Gary Gensler’s departure from the regulator, the beginning of the altseason, a partnership between the company and a large banking institution, and the possible launch of an XRP ETF.

37879969,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=631017,1734694819,"Forget Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), The True Ethereum (ETH) Killer Could Be This Altcoin Priced Under $1","The race to become Ethereum’s strongest competitor continues to captivate the crypto market, but Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) might no longer be the frontrunners. Instead, an emerging contender priced under $1, Rexas Finance (RXS), is redefining what it means to challenge Ethereum. Combining advanced blockchain technology with the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), Rexas Finance offers practical solutions that other cryptocurrencies struggle to match. While Ethereum focuses on decentralized applications and smart contracts, Rexas Finance bridges blockchain and tangible assets. This positions it as a unique force in the crypto market, targeting industries traditionally slow to embrace blockchain innovation. Rexas Finance Revolutionizes Real-World Asset Tokenization Rexas Finance transforms how investors access and manage tangible assets like real estate, gold, and art through blockchain. The platform’s tokenization system enables users to purchase fractional ownership of high-value assets from anywhere with ease. This lowers traditional barriers, such as high costs and limited accessibility, making investments more inclusive. For instance, an investor in Asia can now own a fraction of a commercial property in Europe and generate passive income from rents. Similarly, a user with minimal capital can acquire tokenized shares of gold or even high-value artworks. These innovations open endless possibilities for individuals and businesses alike. The Rexas Token Builder simplifies the process further by allowing anyone to tokenize their assets, whether they’re luxury commodities or financial instruments. Through this tool, investors can create digital tokens tied to specific real-world assets, unlocking liquidity and expanding investment opportunities. To help projects secure funding, the Rexas Launchpad provides a platform to host token offerings. Startups can raise capital efficiently while offering value to their backers. Additionally, the Rexas QuickMint Bot integrates seamlessly with Telegram and Discord, enabling users to mint tokens using simple commands. This bot, compatible with Ethereum and other EVM blockchains, ensures accessibility even for newcomers. Solana and Cardano Face Growing Competition Solana and Cardano have long been Ethereum’s closest rivals, thanks to their efficient transaction speeds and lower fees. However, neither has effectively bridged blockchain with real-world utility. Solana faces frequent network outages, and Cardano’s adoption rate lags behind its roadmap. These limitations provide Rexas Finance with an opening to carve a niche. Rexas Finance not only matches their technical capabilities but surpasses them by focusing on practical applications. Its tokenization model has significant appeal to industries like real estate and commodities, which are valued in the trillions of dollars globally. While Solana and Cardano primarily target decentralized finance and applications, Rexas Finance directly links blockchain to real-world economic systems, positioning it as a more comprehensive solution. Rexas Finance Gains Investor Attention Rexas Finance’s presale is already demonstrating impressive traction, raising over $28.7 million. Stages 1-9 sold out swiftly, generating $26.3 million and pushing the token price up fivefold to $0.150 in the current Stage 10. With investors seeing a 1.33x return upon launch for Stage 10 purchases, interest continues to grow. The project’s $1M giveaway has further boosted engagement, offering 20 winners $50,000 each. Combined with listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance is gaining significant exposure, increasing its credibility and attracting a wider audience. Furthermore, the CertiK audit reinforces confidence in the platform’s security and stability. Rexas Finance is also planning to list on three of the top 10 tier-one exchanges, ensuring liquidity and greater adoption. With a limited total supply of 1 billion tokens and innovative use cases, RXS has the potential to rise to $10 by early 2025, offering a 150x return from current prices. Conclusion Rexas Finance is reshaping the crypto market by addressing gaps left by Ethereum and its competitors. With its focus on real-world asset tokenization, tools for asset management, and a successful presale, it is rapidly gaining momentum. While Solana and Cardano focus on decentralized applications, Rexas Finance bridges blockchain with tangible industries, making it a compelling option for investors. As RXS continues to scale and attract attention, its under-$1 price tag may not last long. For those seeking a future Ethereum alternative, Rexas Finance could be the answer.

In a notice released on Dec. 20, today, the company has announced the issuance of its 5th Series of Ordinary Bonds for raising approximately $31.91 million through EVO FUND. This news closely follows the company’s previously disclosed intent to issue up to ¥5 billion in ordinary bonds. The proceeds from this issuance will be allocated towards purchasing Bitcoin ( BTC ), as detailed in the company’s Nov. 28, 2024, announcement concerning the issuance of the 12th Series Stock Acquisition Rights with an Exercise Price Adjustment Provision and the accompanying Stock Acquisition Rights Purchase Agreement. *Metaplanet to issue 5.0 billion yen in Ordinary Bonds to Accelerate Bitcoin Purchases; Repayment to be made from Warrant Exercise Proceeds* pic.twitter.com/9Sr6a5kDkD — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 20, 2024 In the case of the 5th Series Bonds, there is no interest, and when the principal is redeemed, it is equivalent to 100 yen for every 100 yen of the bond amount. Each bond is valued at $1.59 million (¥250 million), and the full payment is due on Dec. 20, 2024. The bonds will mature on Jun. 16, 2025, but they may be redeemed early at the request of EVO FUND by providing written notice to Metaplanet Inc. The bonds can also be redeemed early when the proceeds from the exercise of the 12th Series Stock Acquisition Rights are multiple times integral multiples of the bond principal amount.

The company is now borrowing and selling bonds to investors like EVO FUND rather than using its own money. That means they’ll have to repay the money they borrowed later, whether or not BTC performs well. Although this allows them to invest in BTC without spending their own cash reserves, it also adds some financial obligations and risks if the value of BTC falls. It is the company’s way of investing in BTC in borrowed time, but it is bound to repay that debt in the future.

Tether’s absence in the EU market pushes traders to use fiat or lower liquidity stablecoins. New stablecoin issuers are stepping up to fill the gap left by Tether’s removal in Europe. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is changing the region’s crypto market.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana confirms an uptrend with a bull flag breakout targeting $320, while Lunex Network impresses with a 283% presale surge, redefining DeFi opportunities. Table of Contents Lunex Network records over 283% jump, more gains incoming Solana: Bull flag breakout confirms SOL uptrend Best crypto investments for December: LNEX and SOL Solana has broken out of a bull flag pattern on its one-day chart, confirming an uptrend momentum. CryptoBullet has identified the key breakout, where Solana’s price movement is now targeting the $320 and $340 regions. This breakout coincides with the support and resistance flip, signaling strong buyer control over the asset. Similarly, a new presale project has hit new milestones with each passing day. The LNEX token has already achieved major price rallies, including the recent jump to the $0.0046 region, representing an over 283% rise. The surge has been attributed to the growing demand for DeFi projects and their unique features. Lunex Network records over 283% jump, more gains incoming Lunex Network is becoming the most talked-about DeFi project. Early buyers have already experienced an over 283% return on investment, with the percentage set to rise soon. This move has been attributed to the project’s unique DeFi features. The project’s long-term goal is to create the world’s first non-custodial exchange platform to connect all isolated blockchains. Here, users can swap over 50k assets across 40+ blockchains at the lowest cost possible. This will also be achieved anonymously, as Lunex Network does not require sign-up KYC checks. Moreover, holding the LNEX tokens allows users to enjoy governance voting rights and staking rewards. The LNEX token is currently going for $0.0046, representing an over 283% rally from its starting price of just $0.0012. Lunex Network has also seen impressive growth in its presale revenue, currently at over $5.3m. A tier-1 exchange listing could propel Lunex Network’s price closer to the $1 region in 2025. Solana: Bull flag breakout confirms SOL uptrend cryptoBullet’s analysis shows a classic bull flag pattern that normally signals a continuation of the previous uptrend. Solana had initially recorded an impressive rally forming a flagpole before entering a consolidation period that led to a downward-sloping channel. Solana’s price has now broken above the flag’s upper resistance line, which usually signals a fresh upward momentum. The breakout has been supported by a crucial support/resistance flip, where SOL’s previous resistance zone is now a key support region. This support zone has helped stabilize the Solana price above $220 . If the current uptrend holds, the analyst’s long-term Solana prediction points to a possible $400 and $600. The projections align with Solana’s historical price patterns during strong surging trends, which indicates growing market confidence. This move comes despite technical indicators pointing at a slowly growing momentum. Solana must hold momentum past the $221 region and ignite a bullish sentiment while aiming for the next resistance zone within the $245 region. Best crypto investments for December: LNEX and SOL The crypto market has been buzzing again with the recent price rally in Solana and Lunex Network. While Solana is a well-established altcoin, Lunex Network is emerging as a presale star offering early investors over 283% ROI. The LNEX token is set to redefine the DeFi market, allowing investors to capitalize on its achievement early. To learn more about Lunex Network, visit the official website and its socials.

Even though it’s facing a lawsuit from J Capital Research, which claims the company overstated its Bitcoin deals, Hut 8 believes its Bitcoin strategy will help the company grow and bring good returns to its investors. Hut 8 Corp., one of North America’s largest Bitcoin mining companies, became one of the top Bitcoin holders worldwide. With its latest purchase of 990 Bitcoin for $100 million, the company now holds over 10,096 Bitcoin, valued at over $1 billion with an average cost of $24,484 per Bitcoin. Data about Hut 8 Corp’s Bitcoin holdings. Source: Hut 8’s website The firm’s management believes that its approach will strengthen its financial position, enhance scalability, and provide a competitive edge. By combining the Bitcoin reserve with cost-effective production and strategic purchases, it expects to generate superior returns for its shareholders. Hut 8 has a clear Bitcoin vision According to Hut 8’s CEO, Asher Genoot, “A key component of our treasury strategy, the strategic Bitcoin reserve supports a flywheel effect that aligns our capital and operating strategies to accelerate value creation across the business.” Sean Glennan, the company’s CFO also chimed in. “Our decision to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve is rooted in our drive to deliver superior returns to our shareholders.” He emphasized the company’s commitment to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. The company’s approach aligns with its broader capital and operational strategies. According to Genoot, expanding Hut 8’s Bitcoin holdings is not only about current profitability but also about positioning it for long-term growth. He highlights that as the company scales its mining operations and maintains its cost advantage, it can grow its Bitcoin reserves at a significant discount to market prices. This approach reflects a growing trend among institutions and corporations to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. With a limited supply and increasing institutional adoption, Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a key component in financial portfolios. Legal troubles persist Hut 8’s recent acquisitions and plans to raise $500 million for future Bitcoin purchases are signals of its confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Despite its achievements, On December 2, Hut 8 filed a motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit from its shareholders, arguing that the case was initiated by short-seller J Capital Research as part of a campaign to lower the company’s stock price for its own financial gain. The lawsuit came from a report by J Capital in January, which accused the Bitcoin mining company of exaggerating the benefits of buying United States Bitcoin Corp. and hiding problems at a Texas facility. Hut 8 said the lawsuit was just an effort by J Capital to make money by lowering the company’s stock price, hurting regular shareholders in the process.

As the altcoin market faces a downturn with Bitcoin nearing $95k, top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano , and XRP are falling below crucial support levels. Amid rising liquidations, ADA's price trend marks its fifth consecutive bearish day.The ADA trend signals significant downside risk with the price falling below $0.90. Could the volatile market drive Cardano’s price down to $0.70?Cardano Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, Cardano’s price shows a bearish channel pattern. The ongoing correction within the falling channel has broken below a key support trendline. Cardano price Chart This breakdown suggests a bearish continuation, with the price likely to extend the downtrend. Currently, Cardano’s market price is $0.839, and a bearish engulfing candle is forming on the 4-hour chart.This engulfing candle breaks the support trendline and is on the verge of closing below it, which increases the likelihood of a drop to the $0.70 psychological support level.The 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart also produced a bearish crossover. The 4-hour RSI has also entered the oversold territory, further indicating a sell signal for Cardano.ADA Price TargetsOn the daily chart, Cardano forms its fifth consecutive bearish candle. This undermines the previous accumulation phase above $0.90 and has resulted in a break below the 50-day EMA. Cardano price Chart As the downtrend continues, Cardano’s price will likely test the 100 EMA at around $0.71.

37879242,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395557,1734693496,5 Challenges of Crypto-Travel. How to Manage Them?,"The post 5 Challenges of Crypto-Travel. How to Manage Them? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Christmas is just around the corner, and it’s the perfect time to plan a special trip. Maybe you’re dreaming of a cozy cabin in the mountains or relaxing on a sunny beach. But if you’re someone who uses crypto, planning your holiday can feel much harder than it should be. Why is that? While crypto is changing many industries, like finance and technology, travel still hasn’t caught up. Crypto could make booking trips faster, cheaper, and easier, but many platforms haven’t started using it yet. This means crypto users often face extra steps, fees, and complications when trying to plan their vacations. Platforms like United Atlas are working to solve these problems. By looking at the challenges and the solutions being developed, we can see how crypto might make travel simpler and better for everyone in the future. Key Issues in Crypto-Travel 1. Transparency in Transactions Hidden fees, unclear pricing, and ownership disputes are big problems in travel systems, especially with timeshares. What are we talking about? Blockchain can help by keeping records that can’t be changed. But many platforms still don’t use this technology, so travelers often feel unsure and don’t trust the process. 2. Limited Crypto Payment Options Even though crypto is popular in finance, many travel platforms don’t accept it as a payment method. This makes travelers exchange crypto for regular money, adding extra costs and making things harder. It follows that payment options need to expand for crypto-travel to grow. 3. Complex Timeshare Management A timeshare is a shared vacation property where people purchase the right to use it for a specific period each year. For instance, a family might own one week annually at a beachfront resort. Timeshare properties often come with strict rules, making them difficult to transfer or sell. Blockchain technology could address these issues by turning timeshares into tokens, simplifying management and trading. 4. Personalization Gaps Crypto users have different needs, like business trips, family vacations, or adventures. Most platforms don’t offer options that match these needs, so many users feel disappointed. Without better personalization, crypto-travel can’t reach its full potential. 5. Overlooked Sustainability Travelers today care about eco-friendly options, but the crypto-travel world rarely promotes them. In other words, it’s a missed chance to encourage responsible travel. Innovations Addressing These Challenges Blockchain technology is transforming timeshare ownership by turning properties into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This innovation simplifies ownership transfers, removes the need for middlemen, and marks a significant improvement over traditional timeshare models. Platforms like United Atlas take this a step further by allowing users to manage their tokenized timeshares on NFT marketplaces, enabling easy buying, selling, or trading. This makes the entire process much more flexible and user-friendly. In addition to simplifying ownership, blockchain introduces smart contracts for bookings and payments. These self-executing contracts automate transactions, reducing errors and avoiding disputes. By ensuring smooth and secure processes, platforms like United Atlas provide a more reliable experience for travelers. The integration of multi-currency payment systems is also breaking down barriers. Travel platforms are increasingly accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside traditional payment methods, making transactions more convenient for a wider audience. Flexibility in payment options is essential for crypto-travel to thrive and reach more users. Eco-friendly travel is also gaining attention. Platforms now reward travelers with tokens for making sustainable choices, such as booking green-certified hotels or participating in low-impact activities. These tokens can be redeemed for discounts or exclusive perks, making eco-conscious decisions more appealing. Blockchain ensures that these rewards are distributed fairly and transparently, building trust among users and promoting responsible travel. Moving Forward While crypto-travel still faces issues like unclear pricing and limited payment options, platforms are finding new ways to solve these problems. By combining blockchain and AI, they are creating systems that focus on security, personalization, and sustainability. It follows that collaboration and innovation are the future of crypto-travel. As more platforms adopt these solutions, platforms like United Atlas are helping bring us closer to easier, safer, and greener travel.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/5-challenges-of-crypto-travel-how-to-manage-them/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37879035,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395498,1734693111,Bedrock Launches brBTC: Introducing BTCFi 2.0 — the Future of Bitcoin Staking,"The post Bedrock Launches brBTC: Introducing BTCFi 2.0 — the Future of Bitcoin Staking appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SINGAPORE, December 20th, 2024 — Bedrock , one of the leading multi-asset restaking protocols, introduces brBTC —a transformative BTC derivative asset designed to redefine Bitcoin’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi). As Bedrock’s innovative Liquid Restaking Token (LRT), brBTC maximizes Bitcoin yield by enabling holders to deposit a variety of Bitcoin derivatives and earn rewards through a curated selection of advanced restaking protocols. BTCFi 1.0: A Foundation with Room to Grow The evolution of BTCFi began with BTCFi 1.0, which laid the groundwork for Bitcoin’s integration into DeFi. This phase introduced staking protocols that allowed Bitcoin holders to generate yields, providing a glimpse of Bitcoin’s potential in decentralized finance. However, BTCFi 1.0 also revealed key challenges: liquidity was fragmented across platforms, restaking opportunities were limited, and real-world applications remained largely untapped. A Vision for BTCFi 2.0 The launch of brBTC marks the beginning of BTCFi 2.0 —a new concept aimed at addressing current key challenges in BTCFi, such as fragmented liquidity, limited restaking opportunities, and a lack of real-world use cases. BTCFi 2.0 introduces a more unified and efficient ecosystem, providing sustainable yield strategies, enhanced security through Layer-2 (L2) solutions, and integration with collaborative platforms. Zhuling Chen , Bedrock’s Core Contributor, shared his thoughts on brBTC’s launch, “brBTC will be the catalyst for driving BTCFI into its next phase, BTCFI 2.0. It will enable multi-source yield through interoperability and help to secure and unite the fragmented liquidity in the ecosystem.” Echoing this sentiment, Calvin Zhou , another Core Contributor, added, “By enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and staking capabilities, BTCFi 2.0 and brBTC not only unlock new financial opportunities but also strengthen the overall security and resilience of the decentralized ecosystem.” brBTC: A Game-Changer for Bitcoin Yield Launching initially on Ethereum and BNB Chain, with plans to expand to additional chains, brBTC empowers investors through three core features: Unified Ecosystem brBTC addresses the challenge of market fragmentation by integrating Bitcoin seamlessly across multiple DeFi platforms. By accepting a wide range of BTC derivative assets as collateral—including WBTC, FBTC, mBTC, cbBTC, BTCB, and uniBTC —brBTC creates a cohesive and dynamic ecosystem. Collateral allocations are optimized across multiple staking protocols to ensure holders benefit from the most competitive yields. Enhanced Yield Strategies brBTC offers diversified yield-generation options, extending beyond traditional staking by leveraging restaking protocols such as Babylon, Kernel, Pell, SatLayer, Mellow, and Symbiotic . Furthermore, to further strengthen brBTC’s liquidity and expand sustainable yield opportunities, Bedrock partners with Thena and MEV Capital . These collaborations ensure a solid and well-supported ecosystem, empowering users to access competitive and scalable restaking solutions. With scalability in mind, additional protocols and partnerships will be introduced over time to enhance yield strategies and unlock even greater opportunities. Real-World Applications Engineered with versatility in mind, brBTC bridges the gap between digital assets and tangible utilities. Its applications extend to collateral in financial products, enabling microtransactions, and supporting other real-world financial needs, enhancing Bitcoin’s relevance in both DeFi and traditional finance. With BTCFi 2.0, Bedrock is pioneering a new era for Bitcoin holders, offering tools to maximize yield, navigate a more cohesive ecosystem, and explore real-world applications. Driven by innovation and collaboration, brBTC is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of Bitcoin in decentralized finance. About Bedrock Bedrock leads the DeFi space with its unique offerings. As the first multi-asset restaking protocol, Bedrock supports BTC, ETH, and IOTX liquid restaking. This capability allows users to unlock impressive yields, with some exceeding three digits—all while maintaining asset exposure. Bedrock has proven its dominance by providing the highest Babylon points in Cap 1 and Cap 2. Backed by notable investors like OKX Ventures and Babylon’s co-founder, Bedrock ensures robust security and seamless cross-chain functionality.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-pepe-and-dogecoin-drop/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
42416497,dbdbf335-7144-4421-be27-8930652651b6,1734692853,Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Have Sold 1M BTC Since September: Van Straten,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading 13% below its record high of around $108,000, the most since President-elect Donald Trump won the U.S. election in early November.   Since then, the largest cryptocurrency has spent several periods at 10% below the record, a level that some investors term a correction.  The selling pressure originates with long-term holders (LTHs), which Glassnode defines as investors who have held bitcoin for at least 155 days. They tend to sell into price strength after accumulating bitcoin when prices are depressed.  LTHs were already distributing a significant amount of BTC about a week ago, previous CoinDesk research showed. Since then, they've picked up the pace and have reduced their total holdings to about 13.2 million BTC from around 14.2 million in mid-September. On Thursday, they sold almost 70,000 BTC, the fourth-biggest one-day sell-off this year, according to Glassnode data.   On the flip side, for every seller, there has to be a buyer. In this case, it's the short-term holders (STHs) who have accumulated approximately 1.3 million BTC in the same time period. The number indicates they picked up coins from the LTHs and more.   In the past few days the narrative has changed and LTHs are looking to sell more than short-term traders are looking to buy. That imbalance has contributed to the price decline of around $94,500.   There are 19.8 million tokens in circulating supply and another 2.8 million sitting on exchanges, though that balance continues to fall: about 200,000 bitcoin has left exchanges in the past few months.  These cohorts are key to monitoring bitcoin's price activity in the next few days.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/long-term-bitcoin-holders-have-sold-1-m-btc-since-september-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e204b50fbb4bf3d18a6b85c62421304797823d08-1800x1013.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37880947,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321470,1734692756,Bitcoin Market Experiencing Supply Shock: CryptoQuant,"The total amount of Bitcoin readily available for sale, also known as sell-side liquidity inventory, has reached its lowest level since October 2020, according to on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant. Data from the firm shows only 3.397 million Bitcoins are available for sale across exchanges, miners, OTC desks, and GBTC. This is a huge drop in sell-side liquidity, which has declined by 678,000 BTC in 2024 alone. The shrinking supply reduces potential selling pressure, creating a tighter market as demand continues to surge. Liquidity Crunch Bitcoin demand has remained in “expansion territory” since late September, with apparent demand growing at a monthly rate of 228,000 Bitcoin. CryptoQuant reports accumulator addresses—wallets that consistently buy Bitcoin but have never sold any—are increasing their holdings at a record-breaking pace of 495,000 Bitcoin per month. These accumulators have become a force in the market, contributing to the liquidity crunch as more Bitcoin is locked away from circulation. This rise in demand has helped push Bitcoin’s price to a record high of $108,000 this month, say analysts. Market Cap of USD-Based Stablecoins Rises to $200B While Bitcoin’s supply tightens, liquidity in the broader crypto market continues to expand. The total market capitalization of USD-based stablecoins, including Tether and USD Coin has increased to $200 billion. This represents a $35 billion increase, or 20%, since late October, reports CryptoQuant. The growth in stablecoin supply shows that fresh capital is entering the crypto market, potentially fueling further price increases for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Price Action On Friday, the crypto market faced a major shake-up with over $1 billion in leveraged positions being liquidated within 24 hours. Bitcoin dipped over 8% trading below $96,000. Bitcoin had maintained strong momentum over the past 30 days, but has slipped below the critical $100,000 psychological mark after the Federal Reserve signaled a more hawkish stance.

It has surpassed the peaks of 2000 and 2007 and is closing in on the all-time high recorded in 2021. The world’s stock markets are now worth $100 trillion, with the United States taking center stage. U.S. stocks account for more than half of global equity markets. In the past decade alone, U.S. equities have added $40 trillion to their market value. As investors pour into the market, growth stocks have dominated the playing field, while value stocks are in the gutter. Today’s global GDP is $85 trillion, with the United States contributing $30 trillion. China and Japan follow with $17 trillion and $4 trillion, respectively. The market cap-to-GDP ratio, once at 58% during the 2008 crash, has shot up to 117%. By 2022, it was already at 106%. Growth stocks skyrocket, value stocks suffer Growth stocks have skyrocketed over the past 15 years. Since 2008, these stocks have delivered a jaw-dropping 907% return. In contrast, value stocks have only managed a 363% increase in the same period. The gap is widening. Over the last two years, growth stocks surged 94%, tripling the gains of value stocks. This has left value stocks looking cheap — and I mean dirt cheap. Relative to growth, value stocks haven’t been this affordable since the Dot-Com Bubble in 2000. The ratio of value to growth stocks has halved since the 2008 crash. It’s the worst stretch for value stocks in 42 years. Wall Street is watching closely to see if growth can keep outpacing value at this rate. The Russell 2000 index tells a grim story for small-cap stocks. It hasn’t hit a new all-time high in nearly 800 straight days. That’s the longest streak in 13 years and the third-longest in history. This year, the Russell 2000 is up 11%, but that’s far below the S&P 500’s 23% gain. Small caps remain about 10% below their November 2021 peak. The gap between small-cap and large-cap stocks is wider than ever, and the struggle is very real. Policies, profits, and recovery The roots of this market explosion go back to the 2008 financial crisis, as aforementioned. Central banks slashed interest rates to near zero and launched quantitative easing programs to pump money into the economy. The Federal Reserve bought up massive amounts of government and mortgage-backed securities, pushing up asset prices across the board. Low interest rates made stocks a no-brainer compared to bonds. Corporate profits have been another big driver. Since 2008, profit margins have hit post-World War II highs. Companies slashed costs and leveraged technology to run leaner operations. Profits are now a bigger slice of GDP than ever before. The tech sector has been the MVP here, with giants like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft leading the charge. Their growth in cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital services has changed the market forever.

JasmyCoin (JASMY) JasmyCoin (JASMY) is a cryptocurrency from Tokyo-based Jasmy Corporation, an Internet of Things (IoT) provider. The IoT connects devices like computers, cars, and phones, allowing them to share data. Jasmy aims to give users full control over their personal data by combining IoT and blockchain technology. On the Jasmy platform, people can securely store and share their information, turning it into personal assets. This creates a safe space where data can be exchanged between devices and services without relying on trust. In a time when data privacy matters more than ever, JasmyCoin offers something new. By decentralizing data storage and using secure systems like IPFS, Jasmy lets users own and control their data. This sets it apart from other cryptocurrencies that focus mainly on transactions. As people look to protect their information, JasmyCoin could gain attention. The crypto market is always changing, but Jasmy’s focus on data sovereignty meets a real need. This might make it attractive to those interested in projects with practical uses. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency that began as a joke but got serious fast. Launched on Ethereum, it’s based on Matt Furie’s Pepe the Frog meme, popular since the early 2000s. Like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE aims to be a top meme-based cryptocurrency. With a no-tax policy and honesty about its lack of utility, PEPE is pure and simple—a memecoin. In late April to May 2023, its value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion. Early holders made huge gains, and a strong community formed. This sparked a “memecoin season,” with other meme coins experiencing big ups and downs. Many hope PEPE and others will reach new highs, especially with the upcoming Bitcoin halving. PEPE’s potential lies in its community and meme appeal. Its roadmap has three phases: first, getting noticed on CoinMarketCap and trending on Twitter; second, listings on centralized exchanges; third, major exchange listings and a “meme takeover.” Though it doesn’t offer new technology, its straightforward approach attracts some. Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that’s making waves with its unique approach to blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains that can get slow and congested, Kaspa uses something called the GHOSTDAG protocol. This means it doesn’t discard blocks that are created at the same time; instead, it keeps them all and orders them in a way that makes sense. As a result, Kaspa can process transactions much faster—currently one block per second, with goals to reach ten, or even a hundred, blocks per second. Its innovative design aims to reduce waiting times to nearly zero, so transactions are confirmed almost as fast as your internet connection allows. With features like quick transaction times and plans for even more improvements, Kaspa is positioning itself as a strong contender in the crypto world. Compared to other coins that struggle with scalability, Kaspa’s technology could give it an edge. The current market is always looking for cryptocurrencies that solve real problems, and Kaspa’s focus on speed and efficiency fits that trend. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, Kaspa’s unique approach might make it an interesting option to watch as the market evolves. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency that began as a playful rival to Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it access to Ethereum’s large ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB started with a massive supply of one quadrillion tokens. In a surprising move, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a significant portion to India’s Covid relief fund and burned the rest, removing them from circulation. This act not only reduced SHIB’s supply but also boosted its standing in the crypto community. SHIB’s connection to Ethereum allows it to do more than other meme coins. It powers ShibaSwap, a place where people can trade tokens without a central authority. There are also plans for a platform for NFTs (digital collectibles) and a system where holders can help make decisions. These developments show that SHIB wants to be more useful and not just a joke. In today’s market, where investors look for coins with real-world uses, SHIB stands out. Its strong technology and active community make it attractive compared to other coins. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, SHIB’s growth and plans make it one to watch. Conclusion These under-$1 cryptos—JASMY, PEPE, KAS, and SHIB—show potential for investors.

37878692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665540,1734692441,"Bitcoin Rally Loses Momentum: Could A Drop To $75,000 Signal The Final Correction?","Since Donald Trump’s election victory on November 5, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a substantial rally, reaching record highs above $108,000. However, this momentum has recently faltered, with the cryptocurrency dropping below the critical $100,000 mark, This has prompted analysts to speculate on a potential deeper correction with some experts believing Bitcoin could dip to levels around $85,000 or even $75,000 before resuming its upward trajectory. Is It A Temporary Setback Or The Calm Before A Final Surge? Analyst Morecryptoonl highlights that the current market dynamics suggest a substantial likelihood of Bitcoin moving toward $85,000. This projection stems from the observation that the recent wave of price action lacked the strength typically seen in bullish trends, failing to reach key extension levels. The “overlapping and corrective nature” of the rally highlighted by the analyst further supports the idea that a significant pullback may be imminent. Should this scenario unfold, it could represent the last major correction of the current bull market, setting the stage for a final surge in prices. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Technical analyst Rekt Capital offers a contrasting perspective, asserting that the perception of Bitcoin at $75,000 as a favorable entry point is relative to its current price of approximately $97,000. Rekt Capital further suggests that what seems like a bargain now may not have appeared as attractive when Bitcoin was previously at that level. Despite the bearish sentiment from some experts, others see the recent price correction as a significant buying opportunity. Analyst VirtualBacon argues that the market’s reaction to Bitcoin’s drop from $108,000 to $96,000 has been “exaggerated.” Is Bitcoin Preparing For New Record Highs? VirtualBacon asserts that this decline is not indicative of a market collapse but rather a healthy consolidation phase within an ongoing bull market. Historical data supports this view, as corrections of this nature often precede new highs. Key support levels, such as the weekly 21 exponential moving average (EMA) around $79,000 and the daily 200 EMA near $73,000, remain intact, suggesting that even a brief dip to these levels would not destabilize the overall bullish structure. Related Reading: 400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming? The underlying economic conditions also play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s future, according to VirtualBacon. The recent Federal Reserve (Fed) actions, including a modest rate cut and a cautious approach to monetary policy, suggest a stable economic environment. While the Fed continues its policy of quantitative tightening (QT), the expectation is that this will not persist indefinitely. The rising US debt crisis is likely to necessitate a return to quantitative easing (QE), which has historically fueled bullish trends in crypto markets. In summary, the recent dip in Bitcoin’s price is viewed by many as a temporary setback rather than the end of the bull market. As long as Bitcoin maintains its position above critical support levels, the bullish trend remains intact. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $97,720, down 3% for the 24-hour period and over 2% for the week.

As the world’s leading cryptocurrency continues to trade above this crucial level, altcoins are preparing to set record highs. BTC remains the undisputed leader of the crypto world and maintains its reputation as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC is the go-to choice for institutional investors, and spot BTC ETFs witness record inflows. Despite BTC reaching a new ATH of $107,780 yesterday, its dominance is declining, and investors are turning their attention to smaller assets, signalling the start of the altcoin season. Pauline Shangett, CMO of ChangeNOW , commented on the potential gains of the upcoming altcoin season: ""Bitcoin's continued show of force in its ability to make these massive price gains sets the example of what is truly possible within the crypto space. As the alt season approaches, investors gain renewed confidence in the market and cements the belief that projects other than BTC can potentially witness similar gains."" Let’s delve into some of the top altcoins to own as Bitcoin makes these historic gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $59.13 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $350 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Ripple (XRP) Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the fourth-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $143 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF. Husky Inu (HINU) As BTC continues to trade around the $106,800 level and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $622,000, completing its third presale round. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu’s presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

Notably, the global market cap, which stood at $3.56 trillion, has plummeted to $3.25 trillion, marking a 7.90% decrease. Total crypto market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The sudden downturn has rattled investors, signaling a wave of uncertainty that has left virtually no digital asset untouched. This steep decline has been exacerbated by the pullback in Bitcoin ( BTC ), which fell below the crucial $102,700 level and now trades at $94,805, a drop of 6.83% for the day. Bitcoin’s dominance, however, saw a slight uptick to 57.93%, reflecting its status as the anchor of the market during turbulent times. Pain extended to Ethereum ( ETH ), which tumbled 11.22% in the last 24 hours, slipping to $3,263 as the crash of the two biggest cryptocurrencies has had a cascading effect on the broader altcoin market. Indeed, every cryptocurrency in the top 100 by market cap is currently in the red, underscoring the widespread nature of the sell-off. DeFi and stablecoin volumes surge While the market cap declined, trading activity surged, with the 24-hour trading volume reaching $290.6 billion, representing a 10.90% increase. Of this, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) volumes accounted for $19.56 billion, or 6.73%of total market volume. Meanwhile, stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI saw volumes climb to $271.51 billion, making up a hefty 93.43% of the total 24-hour trading volume, indicating that many traders are seeking refuge in stablecoins amidst the market chaos. Altcoins follow the big two The downturn in Bitcoin and Ethereum has deeply impacted altcoins, which rely heavily on sentiment in the broader market. Leading tokens like Solana ( SOL ), XRP , and Cardano (ADA) all saw significant losses, with double-digit percentage drops erasing recent gains. The sell-off highlights the high correlation between major cryptocurrencies and the altcoin market, reinforcing the dominance of BTC and ETH in shaping overall market sentiment. Crypto market outlook The sharp decline has left investors wondering whether this correction is a buying opportunity or a sign of deeper troubles ahead. Analysts point to macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory concerns, and profit-taking after a recent bull run as potential drivers of the crash. However, with Bitcoin and Ethereum still trading well above their yearly lows, some believe the market could stabilize and rebound once the dust settles. The next few days will be crucial in determining whether this is a temporary setback or the start of a more prolonged downturn.

37878375,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630969,1734691529,Europe fumbles crypto playbook as Trump’s America leaves it behind,"The European Union is stumbling in its attempt to regulate the crypto market while Trump’s America accelerates ahead. With the EU’s Markets in Cryptoassets (MiCA) regulation set to take full effect by year-end, the bloc has already reshaped its own market. Just perhaps not necessarily for the better. Exchanges have started delisting Tether’s USDT (the most-used stablecoin worldwide) creating massive disruptions for traders. MiCA was supposedly designed to increase transparency and curb crimes like money laundering, and it has triggered criticism for its restrictive approach. Meanwhile, Trump’s incoming administration is sending bullish signals to crypto markets, pushing Bitcoin past $100,000 and igniting rallies in speculative tokens. The president, now a crypto lover, is assembling a team of advocates to oversee regulation. Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Commerce. Lutnick’s firm already helps custody Tether’s $85 billion in Treasury holdings, signaling a shift toward crypto-friendly policies. Paul Atkins is the pick to replace anti-crypto Gary Gensler as the chairman of the SEC. Atkins first invested in Bitcoin over a decade ago, making him one of the earliest believers. Stablecoin delistings disrupt EU markets The rules mandate that stablecoins listed on centralized exchanges must be issued by entities with e-money licenses. Without this license, exchanges have no choice but to drop USDT by the December 30 deadline. “I was quite surprised by that,” said OKX Europe CEO Erald Ghoos, whose company dumped USDT for USDC. This disruption is shaking up liquidity across European markets. USDT accounts for a vast majority of trading pairs globally, leaving traders facing higher costs and inefficiencies. MiCA’s intention to improve regulatory oversight comes with other strict conditions. Issuers must hold up to two-thirds of their reserves in independent banks and monitor all transactions for payment purposes. Circle, Tether’s competitor, secured an e-money license in July, but Tether has yet to follow suit. The company has not shared with the public whether it plans to apply, leaving its EU market presence uncertain. MiCA’s limitations and enforcement gaps Despite MiCA’s ambitions, critics say the regulation falls short of delivering its goals. Reports show USDT is the most-used stablecoin for criminal activities, including terrorism financing, particularly on the Tron blockchain. Earlier this year, UK authorities dismantled Russian networks using USDT to launder billions for oligarchs and spies. Responding to such cases, Tether partnered with Tron and TRM Labs to create a Financial Crime Unit to combat misuse. But MiCA alone won’t solve enforcement challenges. Local authorities lack the surveillance tools needed to track transactions effectively. Upgrading these capabilities will take time, leaving a gap that bad actors could exploit. Despite these challenges, crypto adoption in the EU has seen some growth. A European Central Bank report revealed that crypto ownership in the euro area has doubled to 9% since 2022. However, the ECB warned that the data might be skewed due to changes in survey methodology. The report still described adoption rates as “comparably low.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEGATIVE,USDT | USDC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/europe-fumbles-crypto-trump-america/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37878375.jpeg

Bitcoin below $95,000 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has sent the community in shock by nose diving 11.25% in the past 3 days. It lost almost $12,000 from its value and is currently trading at $94,715 and the crypto market faced a $1.10 billion liquidation. This is a great time for bears while long traders are paying hefty prices. Let’s see what is happening and why crypto market is down today. El Salvador’s $1.4 B Loan El Salvador being the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin as a legal tender, has been receiving backlash from traditional institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been warning the nation to change their Bitcoin policy. They have been urging El Salvadore to limit public sector exposure to the crypto however, the nation never listened. Now, there is a deal between the Bitcoin country and the IMF , a loan of $1.4 billion to support their economy. This still has to be approved however, there is a condition, they will have to bring amends to the Bitcoin policy. The country has accepted the proposal. Experts believe this was the major reason for the drop, however charts add more to the story. The Bitcoin Market Analysis BTC made a new all time high at $108,364 on December 17 and since then it has been falling. Coinmarketcap shows that the first crypto is down from its ATH by 12.74%. Currency BTC hovers around a daily support level but it would be very difficult to say if it is going to survive here. Source : Tradingview However the 4 hour chart says a different story. RSI has dropped below 30, suggesting we should soon see an uprising. This is the perfect moment for whales to refill their bags on discount. The most interesting thing lies in the daily chart. We are not going to talk about numbers here but just patterns. If you compare the movement of price with RSI movement, you will see it. Even though the price was moving up from $89k all the way to the new ATH, the RSI kept falling down. Source : Tradingview This diversion in their movements was giving the alert of this price drop. This should clear the doubts about why crypto market is down today. And as the price is coming down, soon it will balance with RSI and bounce back. The Damage? As Bitcoin leads the crypto market, its movements influence alts. With this crash, the crypto space lost around 9.31% of its market cap which is now at $3.21T. The trading activity is up by 13.77%because of the short traders. Source : Coinglass The figures say it all. In the last 24 hours, around 334k traders got liquidated and lost around $1.10 billion of funds. The biggest liquidation happened for the ETH/USDT pair with a value of $15.80 million. $929.16 million were lost to long trades as the market took a nosedive. What to Expect? The crypto market is full of surprises. The community is expecting Bitcoin to hold its fall and climb back. The market is waiting for big buys now. Whales tend to accumulate assets when the market dips. The current zone is the last remaining support, if the price falls more, it can go to $91,900 that has moving average 20 lying there.

Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF hit $1 billion in inflows earlier this week, which means the demand for ETFs are still strong before the year ends. Meanwhile, social media chatter about ”buying the dip” surged after Bitcoin's recent dip below $100,000. Hashdex and Franklin Templeton Get SEC Nod for Crypto Index ETFs The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF and Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF in a Dec. 19 notice. Hashdex’s ETF will be traded on the Nasdaq stock market, while Franklin Templeton’s ETF will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Both ETFs will include spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF will track Bitcoin and Ethereum included in the Nasdaq Crypto U.S. Settlement Price Index. Meanwhile, the Franklin Crypto Index ETF will follow the Institutional Digital Asset Index, which is designed to measure the performance of key digital assets like BTC and ETH. The SEC’s approval was based on the similarities between these proposals and already approved spot Bitcoin and Ether products. The ETFs are also compliant with the Exchange Act's requirements to prevent fraudulent practices and protect investors. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, suggested that this approval could inspire other firms, including BlackRock, to follow suit and introduce similar products. Geraci believes that financial advisers are likely to embrace these offerings because of their diversification potential, especially in the budding crypto ETF asset class. Franklin Templeton initially filed for its crypto index ETF in August, but the SEC delayed its decision in November. Hashdex submitted an amended ETF application in November after revising its proposal in October to address the SEC’s requirements. These two firms are not alone in their pursuit of crypto index ETFs. In November, NYSE Arca filed to list a Bitwise ETF holding Bitcoin and Ethereum, and in October, it shared plans to list a Grayscale crypto index ETF containing a broader range of digital assets. Bitcoin-Ether Funds to Kickstart 2025 ETF Boom These latest ETF approvals could open a lot of doors in the crypto industry. In fact, a whole new wave of crypto ETFs are anticipated to emerge in 2025, starting with funds tracking both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared this forecast on Dec. 17, alongside insights from fellow analyst James Seyffart. They predict that this Bitcoin and Ethereum combo fund will pave the way for ETFs tracking other cryptocurrencies, like Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR). The SEC has historically been cautious in approving crypto-related ETFs, and even recently rejected several proposals for Solana and XRP-focused funds. Seyffart believes that approval for these assets may only come under a new administration, specifically after President-elect Donald Trump’s SEC chair nominee assumes leadership. Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto businessman and former SEC commissioner, as the agency’s next chair, which could signal a potential shift towards more crypto-friendly policies. Litecoin’s potential for approval stems from its close relationship with Bitcoin as a fork, which makes it a lot more likely to be classified as a commodity. Hedera benefits from not being labeled a security by the SEC, which simplifies the regulatory path for its inclusion in an exchange-traded product as well. On the other hand, XRP and Solana faced some setbacks due to their classification as securities. Despite the likelihood of approval for Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, analysts are still uncertain about the level of investor demand these products will attract. On the brightside, many people expect that Trump’s administration will encourage a much more supportive regulatory environment for digital assets. Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF Hits $1 Billion in Inflows Some ETFs are already achieving impressive milestones before the year even comes to an end. Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF saw remarkable success in 2024 by pulling in over $1 billion in net inflows by Dec. 17. The Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust was launched as part of a spinoff in July that now manages more than $4 billion in assets. Alongside the Bitcoin Mini Trust, Grayscale introduced the Ethereum Mini Trust, separating these low-cost offerings from its older and more expensive funds, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE). The Mini Trusts also offer the most affordable management fees of just 0.15%. The introduction of low-cost ETFs intensified competition in the market, and even led to fee wars among issuers. Most of the newly launched spot crypto ETFs, including Grayscale’s, temporarily waived or discounted fees to attract investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in January after extensive review by the SEC, and have become dominant players. In fact, U.S. spot BTC ETFs surpassed $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November. Grayscale also expanded its portfolio beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum by managing a range of alternative cryptocurrency funds. In 2024, the asset manager introduced an investment fund for Aave’s governance token (AAVE) and launched trusts for Sky, Bittensor, and Sui protocol tokens. Grayscale also has plans to diversify its offerings, proven by its October filing with NYSE Arca to list the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. This index ETF will hold a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies. With President-elect Donald Trump’s administration expected to adopt a much more crypto-friendly stance, the landscape for cryptocurrency ETFs is poised for some very impressive growth. Surge in ”Buy the Dip” Chatter Only time will tell if crypto prices will play along to help boost the 2025 ETF boom, especially after the lastest market dip. However, things may look up soon as the proportion of social media discussions about ”buying the dip” in crypto surged to its highest level in over eight months, which coincided with Bitcoin's fall below the critical $100,000 price level. According to data from crypto analytics firm Santiment , Bitcoin’s dip to $95,500 on Dec. 19 prompted the social dominance score for mentions of ”buying the dip” to hit 0.061, which was its highest point since April 12. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $95,182.49 after its price fell by more than 6% over the past 24 hours. Historically, similar spikes in the social dominance score have been associated with notable price drops. In April, Bitcoin fell from $70,000 to around $63,000, and in August, it slid below $60,000, nearing $53,000 within just a day. These events also aligned with increased mentions of ”buying the dip.” This suggests that investors and traders are very closely monitoring opportunities during market downturns. Search interest for cryptocurrency is also robust, though it has tapered off slightly since December’s start. Google Trends data indicates a global search score of 75 for “crypto” over the past seven days, down from 100 earlier in the month. In contrast, searches for ”buy the dip” surged to a score of 38, the highest since August 10. Search volume for ‘buy the dip’ (Source: Google Trends ) Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Fund, warned that market participants should prepare for heightened volatility. Edwards pointed out that bearish sentiment could intensify to a point where it triggers a short squeeze, causing prices to rebound sharply.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | LTC,BTC | ETH | LTC | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6658/sec-approves-bitcoin-ether-et-fs-by-hashdex-and-franklin-templeton,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

El Salvador had agreed to modify its Bitcoin policy, limiting public sector involvement with the cryptocurrency and gradually phasing out its Chivo wallet. El Salvador To Continue BTC Payment El Salvador has said it will continue buying Bitcoin, a day after reaching a crucial financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF had insisted the country limit its exposure to the cryptocurrency. However, Stacy Herbert, El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director, has said Bitcoin will remain legal tender in the country, and it will keep buying BTC to add to its strategic reserve. El Salvador reached a $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF. As part of the agreement, the country agreed to scale back its Bitcoin policy and make crypto payments voluntary instead of mandatory. The deal also specified that tax payments would only be made in the other official tender, the US Dollar. The IMF also wants the government to phase out its Chivo wallet. The IMF stated, “The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies. Legal reforms will make acceptance of Bitcoin by the private sector voluntary.” In addition to the $1.4 billion loan, El Salvador is also expected to secure $3.5 billion in financing from other global financial institutions, including the World Bank. Responding to the IMF’s announcement, Bukele’s Bitcoin advisor Max Keiser, dismissed the criticism of its Bitcoin policy as “bureaucratic” and “meaningless.” El Salvador started purchasing Bitcoin in 2021, giving it legal tender status and becoming the first country to do so. It currently holds 5968 BTC, valued at around $632 million. Despite the country’s bullishness on the asset, an October survey revealed 92% of Salvadorans do not use the asset. Countering Negative Blowback According to Eugene Epstein, the head of trading and structured products for North America at Moneycorp, the government’s announcement about accelerating the purchase of more Bitcoin could be to counter any negative blowback from a perceived diminished status cryptocurrency's status in the country. “Given the size and likely the terms of the IMF deal, it was probably worth it for (Bukele) to do that.” El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has been hyping up the country as a Bitcoin and digital asset trading hub. It also hosted an “Adopting Bitcoin” conference, and is home to the “Bitcoin Beach,” a surfing spot where businesses accept Bitcoin payments.

List of Dog Memecoins to Skyrocket in 2025 Doge2014 The first on the list of top Dog memecoins is Doge2014 , an ERC20-based token developed on the Ethereum blockchain to honor the 10th anniversary of Dogecoin (DOGE).

Down a combined 8% for Wednesday and Thursday, the price is still falling on Friday, currently at around $95,000. How much further will this plunge go? Powell successfully talks the market down Who would have thought that a Fed rate cut of 25 basis points would have resulted in so much carnage across markets. Once Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell took the stage at the end of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and began to ‘talk the market down’, by saying that there would only likely be two interest rate adjustments in the whole of 2025, the markets started to descend. What Powell was doing was probably absolutely to be expected. With the Fed in between a rock and a hard place, any more promise of further rate cuts could have fired markets to the upside, with the very possible consequence of also igniting inflation. On top of this, most of the Fed members are even predicting rate rises, as per the Fed’s dot plot system. The fact that Federal Reserve predictions are almost never correct does not appear to have been considered by the market in this case. Spot Bitcoin ETFs see big outflow In response to the current malaise for Bitcoin, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs sold heavily on Thursday with a record 6.71K BTC outflow. This brings to an end a record straight 15 trading days of net inflows. Measured move to $89,400 Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart above shows a definitive break of the ascending channel for $BTC. These patterns do usually break to the downside, so there is no surprise here. The price has reached the deepest Fibonacci level of 0.786 at a price of $95,000. If the price continues its descent, the measured move for the channel is shown on the chart at $89,400. If this plays out, the problem would be that $BTC makes a lower low. This would likely signal an end to the current uptrend, and then a much bigger reversal down to $73,000 or lower could take place. Nosedive back to $73,000 is a possibility Source: TradingView The daily chart shows just how precipitous the next drop could be for $BTC. If the price does not stop at the measured move out of the ascending channel, the price could nosedive all the way down to $73,000. At least at this level there is plenty of market structure to hold the price from dropping further. At the bottom of the chart is the Stochastic RSI which signals momentum. As can be seen, the indicator lines are reaching the bottom. This is also the case for all the short-term indicators below the daily. Therefore, a move back to the upside should be forthcoming. However, it will remain to be seen whether the next upside move will continue the uptrend, or whether it will confirm the downtrend. Bitcoin is at a very pivotal moment.

Over the past few years, we’ve seen tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu capture the attention of investors and the media alike, proving that a little humour can go a long way in the crypto space. Now, BTFD Coin is ready to take this meme coin popularity to new heights. With its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game , enticing staking rewards, and a robust community, BTFD Coin is poised to stand out in 2025. The presale for BTFD Coin, which kicked off on November 26, 2024, is generating serious buzz. Investors are flocking to this project, eager to get in on the action. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a well-thought-out investment opportunity that combines fun and potential profit. BTFD Coin aims to up the ante in the meme coin market, and its presale performance is a testament to its promise. With impressive figures and features, this coin is creating a FOMO effect that’s hard to ignore. As we dive into the best meme coins to join for 2025, BTFD Coin is at the forefront of this movement. With over $4.2 million raised and 57 billion tokens sold to more than 6,000 holders, the excitement surrounding BTFD Coin is palpable. Analysts are predicting a bright future for this token, making it an exciting time to get involved. So, let’s explore what makes BTFD Coin—and its competitors—worth your attention this coming year. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Thing in Meme Coins BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a potential game-changer in the crypto space. Launched at a presale price of just $0.000004, it has quickly surged to a current price of $0.00013, reflecting the growing interest and confidence from investors. The presale has already reached its 12th stage, raising an impressive $4.2 million in a matter of weeks. This rapid growth is a clear indication that BTFD Coin is tapping into something special. One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its integration of a P2E gaming model. Imagine playing games and earning rewards while you’re at it. This engaging approach sets BTFD apart from many other tokens that simply rely on hype. The presale has been remarkably successful, hitting its fourth stage—almost 25% of its journey—in just 24 hours. That’s the kind of momentum that gets investors excited. Let’s paint a picture of the potential returns for BTFD Coin . Suppose you decided to invest $100,000 during Stage 5, when BTFD was priced at $0.00005 per coin. You’d end up with a whopping 2 billion BTFD coins. If the price reaches its anticipated listing price of $0.0006 by the end of the presale, your investment would balloon to an incredible $1.2 million. That’s the kind of return that makes BTFD Coin one of the best meme coins to join for 2025. Crypto All-Stars: The Collaborative Platform for Meme Coins While BTFD Coin leads the charge, Crypto All-Stars is also making waves in the meme coin arena. Currently in its final presale stage, which ends on December 20, 2024, Crypto All-Stars has raised an impressive $22.64 million. This project is all about community and collaboration, introducing the MemeVault, a platform that allows users to stake various meme coins, creating a unified ecosystem for enthusiasts. The $STARS token is at the heart of Crypto All-Stars, offering staking rewards that can reach up to 147%. This is particularly appealing for investors looking to maximise their returns while being part of a community-driven initiative.

The company chaired by former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the decision to withdraw was part of the company's strategic shift, and that U.K. registration no longer fitted the company's future business trajectory.  The London-based custodian recently announced a new strategy more focused on international opportunities.   It appointed Amar Kuchinad as its new global CEO in October. He has been tasked with leading the firm's global growth strategy, with a focus on strengthening the company's U.S. presence.  Copper isn't the only crypto company to withdraw from the registration process in the U.K.. Between January 10 2020 and December 1 2024, 69% of applications were withdrawn, according to data from the FCA.   The custody firm said it would look to capitalize on opportunities across priority markets, such as the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.  ""Withdrawing our application to register as a cryptoasset institution in the U.K. is the right decision for our business, and reflects our refocus on driving growth in priority markets,"" said Amar Kuchinad, CEO of Copper, in the release.  Copper started offering clients secure custody and trading of tokenized money market funds such as BlackRock's BUIDL, the company said in October.

37878050,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630892,1734690657,Is the $671M Bitcoin ETF outflow the start of something bigger?,"The US Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) hit their largest net outflow of $671.9 million. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge with a record $208.5 million outflow, while BlackRock’s IBIT stood steady with a $0 net flow. This outrush has marked a major shift in the market after watching 15 days of BTC inflow streak. The global digital assets market witnessed a drop of more than 6% in the last 24 hours as Bitcoin and major altcoins printed heavy red indexes. The cumulative crypto market cap stands at $3.3 trillion with a trading volume of $275 billion. However, the fear and greed index is still flashing ‘Greed’ on the radar. Bitcoin ETFs bleed As per the SosoValue data , Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) reported a withdrawal of $87.86 million, and Ark’s ARKB noted $108.4 million in outflows. GBTC’s total outflow stands at a massive $21.24 billion. Grayscale’s mini BTC fund saw $188.6 million of outflow while Bitwise’s BITB reported a withdrawal of $43.6 million. The largest spot bitcoin ETF by net assets, BlackRock ’s IBIT, reported zero flows among the rest of the funds. Meanwhile, WisdomTree’s BTCW turns out to be the only fund among all the BTC ETFs to record positive flows of $2 million. The total trading volume of 12 spot bitcoin ETFs hit $6.3 billion on Thursday. Total net assets under all funds stood at $109.66 billion which is 5.74% of Bitcoin’s market cap. The Bitcoin price dropped by around 8% in the last 24 hours dragging down its bullish run. Despite smashing all the records, BTC is down by 4.8% over the past 7 days. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $95,242, at press time. The selloff wasn’t limited to Bitcoin ETFs as Ethereum linked ETFs also broke their 18-day inflow streak. ETH linked funds reported an outflow of over $60 million on Thursday, breaking all the positive records. Grayscale’s ETHE is still the biggest Ether ETF with $4.81 billion under its belt. Ether is also dealing with the same sell-off sentiments. ETH price dropped by 15% over the last 7 days and is down by a massive 10% in the last 24 hours. Ether is trading at an average price of $3,284, at press time. What triggered the crash? The Federal Reserve’s hawkish tone at the Federal Open Market Committee has shaken the markets. The constant brewing inflation pushed the Fed to signal 2 rate cuts in 2025. It is down from the market’s expectation of 3 and has dampened investor enthusiasm. It has also sparked a selloff across risk assets. The Fed’s shift isn’t the only factor as experts suggest that year-end profit-taking could also be playing a role. For now, Bitcoin remains resilient, doubling in value this year amidst ETF inflows and market optimism. With fewer rate cuts expected for 2025, some investors are opting to reduce exposure and take profits. Momentum has cooled, but the market is far from done.

Sui (SUI) shows great promise with its recent price movement; yet, another DeFi token is fast selling out during its presale and could present much more returns. With its creative features and novel revenue-sharing approach, Lunex Network (LNEX) is positioned as a game-changer in DeFi. But in this bull cycle will Lunex Network outpace Sui (SUI)? Read on to discover why experts are projecting huge returns for Lunex Network holders. Lunex Network (LNEX) Offers Investors Massive ROI Potential A unique DeFi protocol called Lunex Network allows users to trade and swap cryptocurrencies across multiple blockchains effortlessly, hence bridging the gap between isolated blockchains. Lunex Network gives anonymity, security, and user independence a priority, unlike traditional DEXs. Lunex Network helps traders to keep total control of their assets and experience lightning-fast transactions at the lowest possible cost, removing the need for KYC checks or linking third-party wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Having access to over 50,000 cryptocurrencies spread over more than 40 blockchains, Lunex Network is redefining decentralized trading. Lunex Network is a community-owned network that shares its success directly with its users. By holding LNEX, investors gain access to a unique revenue-sharing model, receiving a percentage of the project’s profits. This innovative strategy guarantees a passive income source and a real share in Lunex Network’s growth. Lunex Network serves a wide spectrum of investors with a comprehensive portfolio tracker that also tracks bonds, shares, and ETFs, thereby combining crypto trading with conventional asset management. With over $5.3 million raised and more than 2.3 billion LNEX tokens sold, the Lunex Network presale is drawing in smart investors. Early adopters who joined at the original price of $0.0012 have already enjoyed amazing returns of over 283%; analysts anticipate an additional 500% gain by year-end while each LNEX token costs just $0.0046 right now. Sui (SUI) Skyrockets to New Highs With the Sui price jumping by more than 9% in the past week and hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $4.93 on December 16, the altcoin has been seeing amazing momentum. However, the Sui price has been consolidating between $4.97 and $4.25 over the past week. Rising by more than 25%, the Sui coin has maintained its bullish trend over the past month. The Sui (SUI) community is still rather hopeful as many investors believe the price of the altcoin will soon surpass the $4.88 resistance level. With the Momentum Oscillator and Moving Averages pointing to purchase prospects on the Sui price chart , technical indicators complement the strong positive attitude about the altcoin. These technical trends suggest that another rally will shortly replace the present consolidation phase, hence possibly driving the Sui coin higher. Particularly hopeful analysts anticipate the altcoin might reach the $5 mark before the year ends, as per a recent Sui price prediction . With experts projecting the altcoin to trade in a range between $7 and $23 next year, the Sui price prediction for 2025 is bullish. The altcoin is attracting fast attention from both individual and institutional investors with its good performance over the previous month and continuing positive signals from technical indicators on the Sui price chart . Why Lunex Network (LNEX) Could Outshine Sui (SUI) Sui (SUI) impresses investors with its recent gains and all-time highs, but Lunex Network (LNEX) is silently stealing the show with its creative features, unique revenue-sharing model, and large ROI potential. Lunex Network is about to provide even more notable profits for early investors than Sui (SUI) did for its holders. Now is the ideal moment to join since the presale tokens are selling out quickly with analysts projecting a 500% increase in the LNEX price by year-end.

Announced on December 19, the Franklin Crypto Index ETF will trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, while Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index funds will be listed on the Nasdaq stock market. Both ETFs will hold spot Bitcoin and Ether as part of their investment portfolios. The Franklin Crypto Index ETF tracks the Institutional Digital Asset Index, a benchmark representing key digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether. Hashdex’s ETF, on the other hand, follows the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. The SEC’s approval comes on the heels of updated filings from both firms, with Franklin Templeton’s application receiving the green light on an “accelerated basis” as per its December 18 amendment . The regulatory body cited similarities in structure and operational terms with other previously approved Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products (ETPs) as a factor in its decision. A New Era for Crypto Diversification The approval has sparked speculation about the broader implications for the cryptocurrency ETF market. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, stated the potential for these new products to inspire similar offerings from other major players. “Will be interesting to see if BlackRock or others attempt to piggyback on this & launch similar ETFs,” Geraci noted in a December 19 X post. “Advisers love diversification, especially in an emerging asset class like crypto.” Franklin Templeton first applied for its crypto index ETF in August, though the SEC delayed its decision until November 20. Hashdex, meanwhile, submitted its second amended application on November 25 following an initial filing in October that prompted additional scrutiny from the SEC. Growing Interest in Crypto Index ETF This year has seen a surge of interest in crypto index ETFs. In late November, NYSE Arca filed to list a Bitwise ETF holding both Bitcoin and Ether . The exchange had previously shown interest in listing a Grayscale crypto index ETF, which would include a diverse basket of spot cryptocurrencies. The SEC’s latest approvals underscore growing institutional interest in crypto-based investment products and could pave the way for additional innovations in the ETF space. With regulatory hurdles clearing, the path forward seems promising for further integration of digital assets into traditional financial markets.

37877790,https://coinpaper.com/6659/hut-8-surpasses-1-billion-in-bitcoin-holdings-with-latest-purchase,1734690600,Hut 8 Surpasses $1 Billion in Bitcoin Holdings with Latest Purchase,"Bitcoin mining giants are ramping up their investment strategies, solidifying their positions as major players in the cryptocurrency market. Hut 8 and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) have collectively acquired billions of dollars in Bitcoin in recent months, leveraging innovative financial tools to bolster their reserves. Hut 8 Bolsters Bitcoin Reserve With $100 Million Acquisition, Now Exceeds $1 Billion in Holdings Hut 8 Mining, one of North America's largest Bitcoin miners, has made headlines with its latest purchase of 990 Bitcoin (BTC), worth approximately $100 million. The move, announced on Dec. 19, is part of the company's drive to solidify Bitcoin as a core asset within its treasury strategy. This acquisition pushes Hut 8’s total BTC holdings to a staggering 10,096 Bitcoin, valued at over $1 billion, a significant milestone for the mining giant. The company revealed that it purchased the Bitcoin at an average price of $101,710 per coin, a substantial premium over current market prices. This decision aligns with Hut 8’s strategy of combining cost-efficient Bitcoin production with opportunistic market purchases to maximize returns. The company emphasized that Bitcoin serves as a reserve asset integral to its financial and operational strategy. The latest acquisition reflects Hut 8’s long-term vision of establishing a robust digital asset reserve. The company has been raising significant funds to support this effort, including a recently announced $500 million capital initiative aimed at acquiring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This initiative follows a $250 million stock repurchase and share sale program, which further strengthens the company’s financial position to scale its operations. Hut 8’s BTC holdings now stand at an average cost of $24,484 per coin, thanks to a combination of mined and purchased Bitcoin. This cost efficiency demonstrates the company’s ability to leverage its mining operations to acquire Bitcoin at a substantial discount compared to market prices. Hut 8’s move is also part of a growing trend among institutions recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic financial portfolio asset. The increasing adoption of BTC as a reserve asset is gaining momentum, particularly as the United States prepares for a pro-crypto administration under President-elect Donald Trump. Operational Expansion and Fleet Upgrades The newly acquired Bitcoin will also play a pivotal role in Hut 8’s operational expansion. The company plans to use its digital asset reserve to fund a fleet upgrade, enhancing its mining capabilities and reinforcing its position as a leader in the Bitcoin mining sector. While Hut 8 celebrates its achievements, the company is also navigating legal challenges. On Dec. 2, the company filed a motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit from shareholders. The lawsuit alleges that Hut 8 overstated the profitability of its acquisition of United States Bitcoin Corp. and concealed operational issues at a Texas facility. The allegations stemmed from a January report by J Capital Research, which Hut 8 has characterized as part of a “short and distort” campaign. Hut 8 has dismissed the allegations as baseless, asserting that they were part of an effort by J Capital Research to profit from a short position at the expense of ordinary shareholders. Marathon Digital’s $1.5 Billion Bitcoin Buying Spree Pushes Holdings to Over $4.4 Billion In other Bitcoin miner news, Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ: MARA), one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies, has cemented its position as a leading player in the crypto market with a series of aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. Over the past two months, the company has spent $1.53 billion to acquire 15,574 Bitcoin, a move financed by the issuance of two convertible notes. These strategic purchases have boosted MARA’s Bitcoin holdings by over 50% this quarter and nearly 200% since the beginning of 2023, bringing its total reserves to 44,394 BTC as of Dec. 18. To fund this substantial buying spree, MARA raised $1.925 billion through two zero-coupon senior convertible note offerings. The first, announced on Nov. 21, secured $1 billion in notes maturing in 2030, yielding $980 million in net proceeds. These notes carried a conversion price of $25.91 per share, representing a 42.5% premium over the average trading price preceding the announcement. The second offering, disclosed on Dec. 4, raised $850 million in notes maturing in 2031, with $835.1 million in net proceeds. These notes featured a conversion price of $34.58, a 40% premium over the share price on Dec. 2. MARA allocated $1.53 billion of the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin at an average price of $98,529 per coin. The acquisitions, coupled with a repurchase of $263 million in existing convertible notes due in 2026, are part of the company’s strategy to enhance its Bitcoin treasury while optimizing its financial structure. MARA’s recent acquisitions represent a significant leap in its Bitcoin holdings, which stood at 26,747 BTC at the end of the third quarter and 15,174 BTC at the close of 2023. With 44,394 BTC now under its control, the company’s Bitcoin treasury is valued at approximately $4.45 billion, based on an average price of $100,000 per BTC. The company has reaped impressive returns on its Bitcoin holdings, enjoying a yield of 22.5% quarter-to-date and 60.9% year-to-date. MARA’s treasury strategy, which integrates mining profits with opportunistic market purchases, positions the company to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential price appreciation while solidifying its role as a long-term holder of the cryptocurrency. Strategic Purchases Amid Market Activity MARA’s buying spree began immediately after the convertible notes were issued. On Nov. 22, the company announced its acquisition of 5,771 BTC at $95,554 per coin. By Nov. 27, it had added another 703 BTC, bringing its holdings to 34,794 BTC. Subsequent purchases saw its treasury reach 40,435 BTC by Dec. 10 and climb further to 44,394 BTC by mid-December. Marathon Digital is not alone in its bullish stance. In December, other prominent Bitcoin miners also made significant acquisitions. Hut 8 purchased 990 BTC, while Riot Platforms bought $510 million worth of Bitcoin following a bond issuance. CleanSpark, meanwhile, raised $500 million through a convertible note offering but indicated no plans to acquire Bitcoin with the funds. Marathon Digital’s aggressive acquisitions reflect its belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value as a reserve asset and a strategic financial instrument. The company’s CEO has previously highlighted its focus on integrating advanced financial tools with its core mining operations to maximize returns. By leveraging convertible notes and mining revenue, MARA is building a treasury model that not only supports operational expansion but also positions the company as a significant institutional holder of Bitcoin . The decision to issue zero-coupon notes with generous conversion premiums suggests the company is confident in its stock’s future performance. It also highlights the growing trend of Bitcoin miners leveraging financial instruments to strengthen their balance sheets and fund strategic initiatives. MARA’s actions align with a broader institutional trend of increasing Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset. As Bitcoin’s role in global financial markets expands, companies are recognizing its potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. With institutional interest continuing to grow, Marathon Digital’s strategic moves may serve as a blueprint for other companies looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s rising prominence.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6659/hut-8-surpasses-1-billion-in-bitcoin-holdings-with-latest-purchase,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The Federal Reserve has projected only two rate cuts for 2025, down from the initially forecasted four. Following the announcement, BTC registered a substantial drop, falling below $100,000 to a low of $95,875 before marginally recovering. Powell’s comments led to a bloodbath in the crypto markets, with all major cryptocurrencies in the red. BTC is currently down over 4% and trading at $97,829, with the bears firmly in control. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is down over 8% and has slipped below $3,500, with sellers now eying the $3,000 level. Solana (SOL) tanked almost 8% as well and has surrendered nearly all of its post-election gains. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), Uniswap (UNI), and Litecoin (LTC) also registered substantial losses. Bitcoin (BTC) Plummets Following Fed’s Rate Cut Announcement Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a rate cut, as its price tanked below $100,000. The drop comes after BTC set a new all-time high as markets turned bearish following the FOMC meeting. The interest rate cut of 25 basis points was along expected lines. However, Powell’s comments signaled a slower pace for future reductions. Powell stated that rate cuts in 2025 will be smaller due to previous inflationary pressures, with the Fed Chair’s remarks sparking a cautious mood across markets, and cryptocurrencies registered a drop almost instantly. The Fed’s announcement also led to crypto derivatives positions worth $700M liquidated, with Bitcoin long positions accounting for a significant chunk. Altcoins fared considerably worse, with Ethereum (ETH) dipping below $3,500. Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), Chainlink (LINK), and several other prominent altcoins also registered substantial drops. The crypto market cap has declined over 4% and is currently at $3.36 trillion. The drop comes after a period during which crypto prices surged, with Donald Trump emerging victorious in the US elections. Markets rose in hopes of a pro-crypto administration and clear regulatory guidelines. Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, stated, “The crypto market has already been on pins and needles around the possibility of a correction following the record run in the price of bitcoin through $100,000. We got that catalyst from the world of traditional markets. The fallout from Wednesday’s Fed decision was simply too much to ignore.” However, some, like Azeem Khan, co-founder of Morph felt the pullback was healthy considering the market's growth. “When you zoom out and consider the year-over-year growth, a pullback like this feels healthy. It’s also worth noting that, historically, year-end selloffs in securities can occur as investors offset losses against gains to lower their tax liabilities. While it’s hard to say how much of this is driving the current trend, it could be a contributing factor.” Losses From Crypto Hacks Jump To $2.2 Billion Losses from major crypto hacks surged 21% to $2.2 billion in 2024, exceeding $1 billion for the fourth year in a row. Smaller hacks also increased from 282 in 2023 to 303 in 2024. According to Chainalysis, markets are bound to see hacks as crypto adoption surges. “As the digital asset market booms, it is typical to see illicit use of crypto grow in tandem. Countering the proliferation of these crimes, especially fraud will undoubtedly be a key challenge to the industry in the new year.” Some of the most notable hacks include the loss of over $305 million from Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin and over $230 million from WazirX. El Salvador Strikes Deal With IMF El Salvador has scaled back its Bitcoin and crypto dream to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $1.4 billion loan deal. According to the IMF, risks from El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin (BTC) had reduced significantly after the country allowed businesses to decide whether they wished to accept Bitcoin or not. El Salvador is the first country to adopt BTC as legal tender. “The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies. Legal reforms will make the acceptance of Bitcoin by the private sector voluntary. For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined.” The IMF has been extremely critical of El Salvador’s decision to give BTC legal tender status and warned it could become a hurdle if the country needed financial assistance. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp decline following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s hawkish comments on rate cuts. The Fed’s stance rattled investors, leading to a selloff across asset classes. As a result, BTC plummeted below $100,000, falling to a low of 95,630 before recovering to its current levels. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has continued to drop for the third straight day thanks to growing macroeconomic pressure. The market selloff intensified after the Fed forecasted just two rate cuts in 2025, against previous expectations of four. The uncertainty surrounding the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is also negatively impacting the asset price. President-elect Donald Trump had repeatedly raised the prospect of a Bitcoin reserve similar to the country’s strategic oil reserves. However, such an initiative will likely face regulatory hurdles. BTC recovered from a substantial decline at the beginning of last week, rising over 4% on Wednesday to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $100,900. However, buyers could not sustain momentum and the price dropped almost 1% on Thursday to settle at $99,923. BTC recovered on Friday to reclaim the $100,000 level and settle at $101,394 before registering a marginal decline on Saturday. However, bullish sentiment returned on Sunday as BTC rose almost 3% to go above $104,000 and settle at $104,181. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC reached an intraday high of $107,464. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to $105,746, ultimately registering an increase of 1.50%. Tuesday saw BTC register a new all-time high, reaching $108,268 before marginally declining and settling at $106,142. Sentiment changed drastically on Wednesday as the markets turned bearish. As a result, BTC plummeted almost 6% and fell to $100,189, barely holding on to $100,000. BTC continued to decline on Thursday after buyers failed to mount a recovery, falling by 2.48% to go below the 20-day SMA and $100,000 to settle at $97,703, but not before hitting an intraday low of $95,630. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has slipped below the $3,500 level as it continues to decline, thanks to short-term holders' panic selling. However, long-term holders have remained inactive, and declining exchange reserves could indicate the decline is temporary. Nonetheless, the drop is substantial and ETH could plummet to the psychological $3,000 mark and surrender a significant chunk of its post-election gains. ETH made a strong recovery on Wednesday after plummeting to a low of $3,521 a day prior, rising almost 6% to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $3,834. Buyers attempted a move past $4,000 on Thursday as ETH reached an intraday high of $3,988. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $3,882, ultimately registering an increase of 1.26%. Buyers retained control on Friday, and ETH registered a marginal increase to go above $3,900 and settle at $3,907. However, it fell back on Saturday, dropping almost 1% to $3,869. Source: TradingView Buyers returned to the market on Sunday as ETH registered an increase of 2.25% to go above $3,900 and settle at $3,956. ETH faced considerable volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand, and ETH registered a marginal increase to settle at $3,985, still unable to go above the $4,000 mark. Sentiment changed on Tuesday as ETH dropped over 2% to $3,892. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH went below the 20-day SMA after a drop of almost 7% and settled at $3,625. Buyers attempted a recovery on Thursday as ETH rose to an intraday high of $3,763. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, ETH plummeted almost 6%, going below the $3,500 level and settling at $3,416. The current session sees ETH marginally down as sellers continue to lower the price. If bulls fail to step in and stop the decline, ETH could drop to $3,000. On the other hand, if ETH can rebound from its current level, it could reclaim the $3,500 level. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has almost surrendered all its post-election gains as it continues to drop. The altcoin slipped below $200 on Thursday as bearish sentiment around the asset increased considerably. SOL has been unable to go above the 20-day SMA, which acted as a dynamic resistance level. It reached an intraday high of $234 on Thursday as buyers hoped to build on Wednesday’s momentum. However, it could not go above this level and fell back to $227, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Friday as SOL dropped almost 1% to $224. Bearish sentiment intensified on Saturday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $215 before settling at $219 after a drop of 2.22%. Source: TradingView The price recovered on Sunday as SOL rebounded from the 50-day SMA, rising almost 2% to settle at $224. However, buyers could not build momentum, and SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping by 3.55% and settling at $216. Tuesday saw an uptick in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand, pushing SOL up over 3% to $223. However, bearish sentiment returned on Wednesday as SOL dropped over 7% to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $206. SOL fell below $200 on Thursday as it fell 6.15% to $193. The current session sees SOL firmly in the red, with the price down almost 2% and trading at $190. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) has turned bearish after reaching a peak of $748 on December 6, with its price plummeting substantially at the beginning of the previous week. By Friday, TAO dropped to an intraday low of $562 as bearish sentiment intensified considerably. The weekend saw the price drop lower as TAO registered a decline of almost 3% and settled at $561.It recovered on Sunday to register an increase of 2.24% and end the weekend at $573. However, this is where market sentiment around the asset went downhill. TAO started the current week on a bearish note, dropping almost 6% to slip below the 50-day SMA and the key $550 level to $518. Source: TradingView The price continued to drop on Tuesday and Wednesday as TAO fell by 4.17% and 3.59%, slipping below $500 and settling at $499. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as TAO dropped over 10% to go below $450 and settle at $447. Buyers attempted a recovery during the current session as TAO reached an intraday high of $469. However, sellers have retaken control, and TAO is currently down almost 3% and trading around the $433 mark. If sellers retain control, TAO could drop to $400, where it could find support. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Analysis Internet Computer (ICP) recovered after dropping to an intraday low of $10.85 last Tuesday. By Thursday, it had gone above the 20-day SMA and reached an intraday high of $14.18 before settling at $13.68. However, it entered the weekend on a bearish note, dropping by 1.17% on Friday and almost 5% on Saturday to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $12.87. The price recovered on Sunday as ICP rose 2.33% to $13.17, just short of going above the 20-day SMA. Source: TradingView ICP turned bearish on Monday after buyers failed to stay above the 20-day SMA, dropping almost 4% and settling at $12.68. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ICP dropped nearly 5% to $12.07. Bearish sentiment registered a substantial uptick from here on, as ICP fell almost 8% on Wednesday to settle at $11.11. Thursday saw the price drop below the 50-day SMA as ICP settled at $10.15 after falling nearly 9%. Buyers attempted to move above the 50-day SMA during the current session as ICP reached an intraday high of $10.77. However, they lost momentum at this level, allowing sellers to lower the price. ICP is currently down almost 3% and trading at $9.88, losing the crucial $10 level. Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis Filecoin (FIL) has also lost momentum this week as markets turned bearish after Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below $100,000. FIL slipped below the 20-day SMA last week when it fell to a low of $5.68. Since then, it has struggled to build momentum, reclaim key levels, and failed to go above the 20-day SMA.

The current session sees FIL down just over 5% as sellers look to drive it towards the 200-day SMA.

By the beginning of last week, ATOM plummeted below the 20-day SMA and fell to a low of $7.25 before recovering to go above $9 by Friday. Despite a strong recovery, ATOM could not go above the 20-day SMA and fell back in the red at the beginning of the current week, falling by 2.52% and settling at $8.87.

He also expressed his disappointment with Biden’s administration. By the look of things, his problems will not end with Kamala and Biden. Why? Given Elon Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration, Sam Altman has all the reasons to be worried. Could Trump’s presidency pose a threat to ChatGPT and Open AI? Sam Altman appeared on the Honestly with Bari Weiss podcast on Thursday. In answering the question about his feud with Elon Musk, he explained, “I think it’s because he wants the most powerful AI in the world to be controlled by him.” Musk was a co-founder of OpenAI but cut ties with the company in 2018. Ever since he started fighting Altman and OpenAI. He has also made it known that he does not trust Sam Altman to head the most powerful AI in the world Elon Musk says he doesn’t trust OpenAI or Sam Altman and he doesn’t want the most powerful AI in the world controlled by someone who is not trustworthy pic.twitter.com/M2C35mMzeb — Tsarathustra (@tsarnick) October 7, 2024 In addition, Musk founded the xAI model Grok which has been a competitor to OpenAI. He pushed artificial intelligence programs, notably ChatGPT, into the political spotlight, claiming that AI models have grown “too woke” and “politically correct.” Clearly, Musk no longer supports OpenAI or Sam Altman. Musk and Sam Altman’s ongoing feud Musk was recently elected as an exec at the US government’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. This explains Altman’s concern about OpenAI under the new administration. In the interview, Altman expressed his anxiety when he said, “I remember what it was like when there were moments since then where it felt like he kinda wanted to reconcile and find a way to work together.” Musk was one of the first people to back OpenAI in 2015 and is widely regarded as one of its co-founders. Initially, Musk’s reason for investing in OpenAI was to create AI that benefits humanity while being open and accessible. It was established as a non-profit to ensure that it remained true to its objective. However, in the interview, Altman said that Musk has never believed in OpenAI. He made a statement, “I remember what it was like when he said OpenAI has a 0% chance of success and you guys are idiots, and I’m pulling funding, and I’m going to do my own thing,” According to reports, Musk resigned from OpenAI’s board due to concerns about potential conflicts with Tesla’s own expanding AI endeavors, particularly in driverless vehicles. His departure from the organization signaled the start of a strained relationship with OpenAI, which deteriorated as the company transitioned to a “capped-profit” model in 2019. Musk thought that this approach contradicted the initial objective and suggested that OpenAI was becoming more commercially motivated. To that end, Musk has been in court with lawsuits against the company. He accused Altman of making OpenAI a profit-making company when it started as a non-profit. In the interview, Altman explained, “I’ve seen Elon’s attacks to many other people, many friends of mine, everyone gets their period of time in his spotlight. But this all seems like standard behavior from him.” Biden’s administration versus Trump’s administration – Sam Altman’s take There have been allegations that Biden’s administration was attempting to control and regulate AI. This allegedly caused only a few large companies that would work with the government and be protected from competition. However, Altman answered, “I don’t think it’s true, I don’t know what he’s referencing I think regulation that reduces competition for AI is a very bad thing,” He added, “I don’t even think like the Biden administration is competent is enough to… I mean, we were in a room with them, and other companies and the administration.” Also, the co-founder of OpenAI stated that he believed Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo was more conscious of AI’s emergence and the areas that required prioritization than the Biden administration as a whole. Still, Altman expressed that he expects the next administration to do a better job. In a statement, he stated, “The things that I think should have been the administration’s priorities and I hope will be the next administration’s priorities are building out massive AI infrastructure in the U.S., having a supply chain in the U.S., things like that.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | DOGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-the-trump-govt-end-of-sam-altman-musk/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37877533.jpeg

The analyst pseudonymously known as Sherpa tells his 234,700 followers on the social media platform X that the memecoin Popcat ( POPCAT ) is at a “do-or-die” level. Based on Sherpa’s POPCAT chart, it appears that the Solana-based memecoin has formed a head and shoulders pattern on the daily time frame and could plunge if the support level fails to hold. A head and shoulders pattern is typically considered a bearish pattern in technical analysis. Source: Sherpa/X POPCAT is trading at $0.802 at time of writing, up by 21,147% since the January 5th low of $0.00379. Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to Sherpa, there are several reasons to remain bullish on Bitcoin and other crypto assets, even after a recent correction that saw the flagship digital asset briefly dip below the $100,000 price. “Bitcoin dominance has yet to come down. Ethereum has yet to fully send. January is an incredibly bullish time for crypto. [US President-elect] Trump is pro-crypto, owns some, and has his own decentralized finance (DeFi) project. ….and you’re selling??” Bitcoin is trading at $100,624 at time of writing. Bitcoin dominance, the ratio of the market cap of Bitcoin relative to the rest of the crypto market, is currently at 54.7% down by several percentage points from the 2024 high of 58.99% recorded mid-last month.

Morocco’s Plan to Regulate Crypto Looking at the crypto usage in Morocco despite its ban since 2017, the Morocco government is close to finalizing its first set of rules for cryptocurrencies. Supporting the innovation, Abdellatif Jouahri, governor of Morocco’s central bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM), announced that the framework is nearly ready and is crypto-friendly. The goal is to regulate crypto assets without stopping the innovation they bring. This framework has been developed with help from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Jouahri explained, “We want to regulate crypto without slowing its potential. This plan ensures smooth adoption and reduces uncertainty.” The drive gained momentum after Bitcoin touched the historic high of $100,000 though it is hovering below the critical level of $96K the market is optimistic of its recovery. The proposed laws will first go through public discussions before heading to Morocco’s parliament and cabinet for approval. If passed, Morocco will become one of the first developing countries to establish clear crypto regulations . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance.US to Resume USD Services in Early 2025 Anticipating Favorable Regulations , Why Now? Crypto adoption in Morocco has been growing fast. In 2023, the country ranked 20th globally for crypto usage, according to Chainalysis, and 13th for Bitcoin adoption in another survey. However, the lack of clear rules has created confusion and risks for users. By introducing these laws, Morocco hopes to manage the challenges of digital finance while creating a welcoming space for innovation and investment. This move could position Morocco as a leader in crypto regulation among developing nations, setting an example for others to follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37877282,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375504,1734689619,‘Normal’ Correction or Bull Market End for Bitcoin and Crypto?,"The landscape in the cryptocurrency space can change drastically in days. Recall that bitcoin tapped a new all-time high of over $108,000 on Tuesday, but its price has slumped to $94,500 since then. This came after a few remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who warned that the central bank could not purchase BTC despite Trump’s promises and that there might not be any more key interest rate reductions in 2025. With bitcoin reacting the way it did to those comments, this has led to speculations among the crypto community about whether this is just another ‘normal’ correction during a bull market cycle or whether the asset’s post-Trump-victory honeymoon is over. Bull Market’s End Side Even before Donald Trump’s decisive victory, BTC’s price had already started to appreciate after the US Federal Reserve pivoted from its previous monetary strategy and started lowering the interest rates. In fact, the first cut was the deepest, as they say, when the central bank reduced the rates by 50 basis points. Riskier assets such as bitcoin reacted with immediate price increases. However, the Fed’s policy seems to have a bigger impact on the asset’s price movements than many anticipated. After all, the expected 25 basis point reduction from Wednesday didn’t lead to another price increase. Just the opposite, the central bank’s warning about another potential reversal in its strategy resulted in a bloodbath for BTC and the entire crypto market. Consequently, those who argue that the bull market might have ended received some validation. In case the Fed indeed stops cutting the rates, BTC’s bull market might come to a screeching halt. Powell’s actions have already changed US investors’ behavior toward the cryptocurrency, as the spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their worst day in terms of net outflows since their inception nearly a year ago. Some analysts believe the $94,000 support zone is crucial for bitcoin, which is close to being tested now. If lost, the asset could plummet to $90,000 and even $80,000. Just a Correction Side Captain Faibrik also outlined the $94,000 support line as crucial during this correction. They told their 100,000 followers on X that such a price drop to that line would be a “healthy reset” and it could propel the asset in the opposite direction and continue its months-long rally. $BTC #Bitcoin Correction is almost Done..!! https://t.co/GXWt21b5o6 pic.twitter.com/4d9QPO3kuk — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) December 20, 2024 Crypto_Rover was also on the ‘just a correction’ side, claiming that this is the ‘final bear trap’ and investors should not be shaken out. If you survived the #Bitcoin bear market… Don’t let this final bear trap shake you out this bull market. Don’t give up now. The next 3 months can truly change your life. — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) December 20, 2024 In any case, it seems as if the $94,000 support will indeed be vital for BTC’s upcoming price movements. It was tested on a couple of occasions last week and bitcoin is close to doing it again. Recall that the cryptocurrency bounced off after the second such test on December 10 and marked a new all-time high just a week later.

37877269,https://finbold.com/?p=221135,1734689537,$12 billion wiped from Solana (SOL) in a day,"Solana ( SOL ) has been something of an early marvel of the 2024 cryptocurrency bull market , as it was one of the first tokens to make substantial moves already late last year. Though it entered a protracted period of stagnation in March, it followed many other assets into the post-election rally, even recording highs above $257 in late November – no small feat for a cryptocurrency that stood at about $20 just over one year ago. Still, despite the undeniable successes in the last 14 months, SOL proved unable to resist the great downturn that started on December 18, 2024, and it is, in the last 7 days, 19.43% in the red with its press time price of $182.19. SOL 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold Furthermore, Solana’s market capitalization plunged about $16 billion since the evening of December 18 – the time the downturn began in earnest – and $12.5 billion from where SOL stood just 24 hours earlier to the December 19 valuation of $87.4 billion. Why Solana is crashing The majority of SOL’s downturn cannot, however, be attributed to the token itself as it emerged as a reaction to the Federal Reserve’s rather hawkish outlook for 2025, made public on the evening of December 18. Specifically, despite lowering interest rates by the expected 25 basis points (BPS), the Fed raised its inflation forecast for next year from 2.1% to 2.5% and revealed fewer cuts are in the cards in the coming 12 months than was anticipated. The reaction to such statements was not confined to Solana – or to the cryptocurrency market as a whole – and numerous assets reacted violently. For example, the U.S. stock market erased $1.5 trillion before the closing bell on Wednesday, and even gold – traditionally regarded as a safe-haven asset – plunged more than 1% in the immediate aftermath. As it turned out, however, the effects of the news were particularly sticky for digital assets – something of an unexpected development given cryptocurrencies were the first to show signs of recovery. Looking at Solana’s valuation in the last seven days, the trend becomes quite clear. After the initial plunge from a $103 billion market cap to $69.6 billion, SOL recovered to $101 billion, only to again fall toward $90 billion. This motion was, by press time, repeated once more as the token’s valuation rose $95 billion in the night between December 19 and December 20, only to fall once more to its press time level of $87.4 billion. SOL market cap 7-day chart. Source: CoinMarketCap What¡s next for Solana? Looking ahead, it is somewhat unclear when and if the Solana rally will reignite. The next move might, in fact, be decided within hours as the token is trading just cents away from its nearest support zone , and should there be a continued decline, it would likely test the subsequent levels close to $175 and $165. Should SOL bounce off of the nearest zone, it would have a relatively clear upward path until reaching about $208 – the nearest significant resistance point. Furthermore, despite the current trends being mostly bearish, Solana’s relative strength index ( RSI ) has fallen to 40.89, which, while neutral on its own, is rather close to ‘oversold’ territory and, therefore, close to a likely bullish pivot. Such a situation might be particularly pointed once a long-term analysis – reported by Finbold on December 11 – demonstrates SOL has been forming a multi-year ‘cup and handle’ pattern that could, eventually, send it rocketing toward $4,000.

37877103,https://crypto.news/?p=14320988,1734689254,Here’s why MOVE rallied 26% as the crypto market tanked,"MOVE, the native token of the Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Movement, experienced a significant price rally outpacing the broader crypto market, which remained on a downward trajectory. Movement ( MOVE ) recorded the highest gains among the top 100 largest crypto assets on Dec. 20, reaching an intraday high of $0.877 and closing with a market capitalization of nearly $2 billion. The altcoin’s price rally coincided with a 63% rise in daily trading volume, which exceeded $1.6 billion, indicating growing interest among traders. Additionally, CoinGlass data reveals that open interest in its futures market surged to an all-time high of $103.93 million, nearly double the $56.03 million recorded the previous day, signaling a jump in demand among traders. Why is MOVE rising? The major driver of the altcoin’s gains appears to be tied to its partnership with leading digital asset custody and security company BitGo, which will bring WBTC (a tokenized version of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain) onto Movement’s mainnet. By incorporating WBTC, Movement aims to enhance its DeFi offerings, providing users with more options for asset utilization, liquidity provision, and participation in decentralized financial services. Movement’s price surge can also be attributed to the launch of its mainnet last week. As an Ethereum layer-2 network powered by MoveVM, Movement issued its native token, MOVE, last week. A portion of these tokens was distributed to early adopters and community members. Further, MOVE has gained significant traction by securing listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit. You might also like: Can your crypto portfolio beat the market? Whales are buying these altcoins Movement kickstarted the token’s launch with an $830 million airdrop. Projects that combine a large user base, substantial airdrops, and strong exchange support often experience initial price spikes before stabilizing. The altcoin’s rally came as the broader crypto market slumped 9.1% over the past day, standing at $3.39 trillion when writing, fuelled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) drop below the $100k level , which led to a cascading effect across the broader altcoin market with leading assets like Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ) and BNB ( BNB ) all posting losses over the past day. MOVE could rally to $1 again Experts suggest that MOVE could continue to rally in the coming weeks, with the price likely returning to $1 and potentially surpassing it. According to a crypto trading signal community on X, Rose Premium Signals, MOVE could continue its rally, potentially reaching $1.3, which represents an increase of approximately 60% from its current price levels. Meanwhile, analyst Globe Of Crypto observed that MOVE recently broke out of a bullish pennant pattern in the 4-hour time frame. Such a breakout typically signals a continuation of an asset’s price rally. Based on this, the analyst predicts that MOVE could rise by another 40-50%, potentially surpassing $1 in the next week.

37877169,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52673,1734689202,How XRP Holders Can Generate Passive Income From RLUSD,"The integration between XRP Ledger (XRPL) and OpenEden has introduced a significant opportunity for XRP holders to earn passive income while remaining within the XRP ecosystem. This collaboration revolves around OpenEden’s tokenized T-bills (TBILL tokens), which allow investors to access low-risk, yield-generating assets backed by U.S. Treasury Bills. By utilizing Ripple USD (RLUSD) and other stablecoins, the partnership highlights a pivotal advancement in digital asset investment strategies. XRPL’s Institutional-Grade Features The XRPL’s robust infrastructure is equipped to support institutional-grade financial applications, making it an ideal platform for tokenization efforts such as OpenEden’s TBILL tokens. With features like Automated Market Maker (AMM), Decentralized Identifier (DID), Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT) capability, a Lending Protocol, and native Oracle support, XRPL creates a strong foundation for Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization. The platform’s ability to integrate with stablecoins, including RLUSD, further strengthens its appeal to institutional and retail investors. As highlighted by OpenEden Co-Founder Jeremy Ng, the introduction of tokenized T-bills to XRPL marks a transformative moment. This development not only enhances the accessibility of yield-generating assets but also positions XRPL as a key player in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. How the Integration Works OpenEden’s platform offers a streamlined approach for XRP holders to participate in earning passive income through tokenized T-bills. The process involves four simple steps: Acquiring Stablecoins: Investors can convert XRP into Ripple USD or another supported stablecoin directly on the XRPL. Minting TBILL Tokens: Using OpenEden’s platform, stablecoins such as RLUSD are deposited to mint TBILL tokens. These tokens are backed by U.S. Treasury Bills, ensuring low-risk exposure. Earning Passive Income: Holders of TBILL tokens earn regular interest from the yield generated by T-bills. Yields are paid in RLUSD, providing a consistent and reliable income stream. Flexible Options: Investors can choose to reinvest their earnings, redeem their TBILL tokens for stablecoins, or trade them for XRP or other digital assets on the XRPL. This seamless process allows investors to access high-grade financial instruments while taking full advantage of the transparency, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness offered by blockchain technology. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Expanding the XRP Ecosystem OpenEden’s TBILL tokens have already attracted a diverse range of institutional clients, including foundations, corporate treasuries, and buy-side funds. The partnership’s $75 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) underscores the growing market confidence in this innovative approach. By integrating stablecoins and tokenized RWAs into the XRPL, this initiative expands the utility of the XRP ecosystem beyond traditional remittance use cases. As the XRPL-OpenEden partnership continues to evolve, it showcases the potential for blockchain-based ecosystems to revolutionize traditional finance by offering secure, scalable, and profitable investment options to a global audience.

This is the first phase of Cryptopia’s distribution plan since it went bankrupt in 2020. According to the NZ Herald , the New Zealand -based crypto exchange’s liquidators declared that more than 10,000 account holders of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) received crypto funds worth more than NZ$400 million ($225 million) in the past 48 hours. Grant Thornton, the public accountancy firm in charge of liquidating Cryptopia’s assets to customers, said that liquidators have been working towards identifying users to proceed with return payments since the launch of Cryptopia’s claim portal four years ago, following Justice David Gendall’s 2020 verdict. The firm revealed that 10,000 accounts is just the tip of the iceberg, as the exchange has an estimated total of 960,000 users entitled to compensation after the crypto exchange’s untimely demise. “This complex process also involved rebuilding the hacked cryptocurrency exchange and reconciling millions of transactions from nearly 960,000 users,” said Grant Thornton.

For now, Grant Thornton stated that it will continue to remind account holders to register on the portal and take the necessary steps to meet the requirements for future distributions. “The liquidators will give account holders notice of the soft cut-off date in the coming days. Further distributions for newly verified users are planned for the new year,” the firm added. Cryptopia went bankrupt in 2019, after the exchange suffered a hack that cost the exchange a loss of around $16 million in crypto assts. In May 2019, liquidators estimated that the exchange owed creditors an estimated total of $4.2 million.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

37877166,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52590,1734688854,Solana Could Hit $350 Target; DTX Exchange and Ripple (XRP) Emerge as Institutional Favorites for 2025,"You have both old, well-known mainstays and new, exciting, relatively unknown projects in the crypto market; and expert traders and investors often have to navigate both sets so as to maximize their opportunities for making profits. And in this line, different crypto projects continue seeking a surge in value with analysts monitoring all relevant market dynamics. Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and the emerging DTX Exchange are capturing significant attention for different reasons amidst the current up and down crypto wave. Each project has unique qualities and potential, but let us see why DTX Exchange is positioned to stand out as a revolutionary force in the trading space. Solana’s (SOL) Current Position in the Journey for $350 Solana, one of the most popular blockchain projects for speed, is a strong name, with its processing ability that exceeds 65,000 transactions in one second. Hence, Solana is a favorite for decentralized applications and NFT products. It has been suggested among experts that SOL may touch a price target of $350 sooner than later, say by the year 2025. But to do that, the token would need to experience a drastic turn around on its current downward trend. After a rally in November 2024 that took it to an all-time high, the price of SOL has steadily dropped by 13% over the past month and is now around $210, testing a critical support level. A popular consensus is that Solana needs to find a way around its constant liquidity shortages and revamp institutional support to get back on the $350 track. Source: CoinMarketCap And while investors will always stick with a reputable asset like SOL, DTX Exchange is attracting many institutions with its features that support diverse and large-scale investments. Resilient Ripple (XRP) as a Top Contender in the Crypto Landscape Ripple has always shown that it will not fade away in the cryptocurrency market. Following the legal win against SEC, Ripple is well back as a reliable payment solutions provider. Analysts constantly rave about XRP’s growth potential after a 111% bull run from a month ago. Currently trading around $2.38, XRP is projected to reach $3 by early 2025. But the fact that it dropped in price by over 6% since yesterday also signals that XRP is not immune to market volatility and will definitely experience slumps even though the overall trajectory is positive. Source: CoinMarketCap Innovative features like RippleNet and increasing institutional adoption are primary drivers behind this optimism. However, DTX Exchange stands as a top alternative option catching the eye of investors. DTX Exchange Positioning Itself as the Future of Trading DTX Exchange is slowly coming up as a game-changer in the trading industry. With a mix of traditional and blockchain-based trading, DTX Exchange provides something different from others like Solana and Ripple. It is the first platform where you can trade stocks, cryptocurrencies, forex and others. In addition, DTX’s technology infrastructure is cutting-edge, including the Phoenix Wallet, a secure and efficient tool for managing various assets. Additionally, the exchange plans to introduce a platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), further expanding its utility. The platform’s commitment to quality and security is evident in its successful audit by SolidProof and its preview listing on CoinMarketCap. It is also a plus that early participants benefit from profit shares and voting rights. These positive investment features make DTX Exchange an interesting prospect to institutions and large-scale, who have a high volume of investment across different asset classes. As such, DTX is reflecting strong investor confidence. Its ongoing presale (in its sixth stage at $0.12) has raised over $10 million, and the community has grown to over 160,000 engaged members. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, DTX Exchange offers unparalleled opportunities with its robust features and community-driven growth.

Its growing appeal is driven by advanced technological integration, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, presenting it as a forward-looking project with high growth potential and immense community support. Here, we will spotlight said AI altcoin and explain why XRP and LINK holders demand it! IntelMarkets Sees Increased Demand From Investors: Here’s Why! Investors in established coins like XRP and LINK are showing interest in IntelMarkets (INTL) . Per recent data, more than $4.9 million has been invested in the AI altcoin amid its ongoing public presale, reflecting significant interest in INTL. INTL is a driving force in the IntelMarkets ecosystem, facilitating activities like trading, governance participation, and accessing incentives. Holders can also access tools like AI-powered robots for increased profitability. IntelMarkets is a perpetual contracts exchange where traders can engage in speculative asset trading. The platform stands out from other perpetual contract exchanges in that traders can hold a position longer or indefinitely, which is impossible on traditional exchanges. The firm operates on a dual-chain wheel spun by Ethereum and Solana. It integrated Ethereum so users can access smart contracts, liquidity pools, and decentralized applications. Meanwhile, Solana’s integration is geared towards achieving scalability and cost-friendly solutions. Given the vast role INTL plays in the IntelMarkets ecosystem, it is considered an essential part of this blockchain project. Its value proposition has brought it before XRP and LINK investors as a good crypto to buy. Analyst Foresees Ripple’s XRP Surpassing $4: Here’s Why! In his latest analysis, the wide-followed technical analyst Ali Martinez has painted a b3ullish future for XRP. Taking to X on December 17, 2024, Ali revealed a bullish pennant pattern formed by XRP’s sideways movement. This pattern is often a prelude to an explosive upward move for an asset. Ali stated that if Ripple’s XRP pushes past $2.60, it will get the ball rolling on its subsequent ascent to $4 and above. He substantiated this projection with the Fibonacci tool, highlighting price points where the Ripple coin would experience notable shifts. After the $2.60 level is beat, Ali’s Fibonacci levels at 2.414 ($3.63), 2.618 ($3.83), and 3.0 ($4.25) are potential milestones to watch out for. Despite this projection, Ripple investors have expanded to the AI altcoin INTL to boost their potential return. Nevertheless, Ripple’s XRP currently trades at $2.56, up 14.28% this week. Chainlink’s Chart Hints at an Inbound Explosive Move Chainlink is making rounds lately as LINK hints at a potential big move. The chart shows that Chainlink’s LINK broke out of a protracted downward trend in November 2024 and has continued climbing as buyers step in. However, the Chainlink coin price faces resistance between $28 and $30. These levels halted LINK’s upside rally, leading investors to take profits and buy into other AI altcoins like INTL. Meanwhile, more red candlesticks appear on the LINK price chart, suggesting that the bears are beginning to test the bulls’ grit. Failure to hold them off will see LINK drop as low as $24. The following support after $24 would be $21 and $19, which would be alarming for those who bought at the top. LINK trades at $28.11, with a 30.19% weekly gain. The INTL AI Altcoin Sees Investment From XRP And LINK Investors XRP and LINK investors have added INTL to their crypto investment list to diversify into, considering it is a good crypto to invest in for massive gains. INTL sells for $0.073 in Stage 8 of its public presale, with early investors already drenched in over 700% gains. When the INTL AI altcoin hits $0.110, its listing price, Stage 1 investors will have made 1,100% gains, while Stage 8 investors will receive a 50% profit. Buying the AI altcoin now is crucial to benefiting the most from its growth prospects. Hurry up! Click the links below to begin!

37876854,https://crypto.news/?p=14320960,1734688750,BONK goes live on Robinhood as meme coins continue to struggle,"Prominent cryptocurrency and stock trading platform Robinhood continued to expand its meme coin offering with the listing of Bonk. According to a Dec. 20 announcement , the Solana-based meme coin will now be accessible to over 24 million Robinhood users. BONK became the fifth meme coin to be listed on the Menlo Park unicorn, which initially started offering crypto trading in February 2018. Robinhood listings typically lead to short-term price surges for newly added tokens, as seen with Dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Pepe ( PEPE ). WIF, the second meme coin listed in November, jumped 8.2% within an hour of the announcement, mirroring Pepe’s earlier price action . However, BONK ‘s price failed to capitalize on the listing, though it managed to recover some losses from the past 24 hours amid a broader market downturn. The meme coin exhibited notable volatility, dropping to an intra-day low of $0.00002671 before rallying to $0.00003094 following the listing announcement. It later settled around $0.00002905 at the time of writing, down over 4.5% on the day. You might also like: Cardano price may crash soon, legendary trader warns Frustration rippled through the Bonk community as the timing of the listing clashed with the broader market’s turbulent backdrop, dampening the excitement many had hoped for. The meme coin market tumbled 9.96% in the past 24 hours, bringing its total market cap to $94.77 billion at press time. The decline is even more pronounced when compared to the monthly high of $137.06 billion reached on Dec. 9. Smaller tokens like Peanut the Squirrel and Brett have borne the brunt of the sell-off, as Bitcoin’s dip below $100,000 rattled retail investors and sent shockwaves through the speculative meme coin space. Upon writing, one Bitcoin was selling for $97,856. BONK experienced a similar sell-off, as data from Nansen showed an uptick in net flows over the past 7 days, which means more tokens were being deposited than withdrawn, typically seen as a sign that traders might be positioning to cash out. However, that metric has flipped negative over the past 24 hours, suggesting the Robinhood listing has reignited interest among investors. BONK token exchange flows | source: Nansen BONK’s price could gain momentum from its upcoming “BURNmas” event , which plans to burn 810.57 billion tokens initially, with the ultimate goal of burning 1 trillion tokens based on ecosystem activity.

37877164,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52674,1734688701,"XRP’s 7x Jump in the Next 2 Months Will Grow $1000 into $7000, But One Rival Coin Could Turn It Into $38000 with a 38x Rally","With gains of 200% in one month and 350% over two months, XRP’s current leap to $2.40 illustrates its potential for a 7x rally, transforming $1,000 into $7,000. However, a rival coin, Rexas Finance (RXS), guarantees even more profits. With a ground-breaking 38x gain expected, RXS may turn the same investment into $38,000, redefining crypto prospects. XRP’s Impressive Growth Trajectory Rising use in cross-border payments, good legal results, and growing investor confidence all explain XRP’s notable expansion. Analysts predict a 7x increase in the token’s price over the next two months. XRP’s ability to maintain a strong pan assertiveness in the crypto market has driven hope about its near-term future. Should this become a $1,000 XRP investment now, it might expand to $7,000, highlighting its attraction as a profitable prospect for anyone wishing to profit from its momentum. Several essential factors justify the expected 7x surge in XRP’s price. XRP’s strategic emphasis on transforming cross-border transactions has helped it become a major player in the payments sector as institutions increasingly use its technology. Its use has improved, and market confidence has been raised by its alliances with big financial institutions. XRP is a top competitor in the altcoin market because its potential for exponential expansion is intact, even if the larger crypto industry is also gaining strength. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rival Coin Poised to Outperform XRP Gains Unquestionably, XRP has great development potential, but a competitor coin called Rexas Finance (RXS) is starting to revolutionize the crypto scene. By linking real-world assets (RWA) and blockchain technology, Rexas Finance presents an unmatched investment possibility that might surpass XRP’s gains. Although XRP is predicted to show a 7x gain, Rexas Finance’s potential for a startling 38x rally could turn a $1,000 investment into $38,000, much above XRP’s returns. Rexas Finance (RXS) transforms the blockchain scene by tokenizing actual assets, allowing users to buy, sell, or fractionalize assets effortlessly. RXS is building an ecosystem whereby almost any physical or intangible asset, from real estate and art to intellectual property and goods, may be expressed on the blockchain. This transforming strategy democratizes access to profitable investment prospects and removes obstacles to worldwide asset ownership. Users of Rexas Finance can tokenize assets from anywhere in the globe at any moment, opening countless opportunities. The presale success of Rexas Finance emphasizes its enormous possibilities. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the presale, in its 10th stage, has generated an impressive $28.77 million after selling out its 9th stage ahead of time. This quick acceptance highlights investors’ increasing faith in Rexas Finance’s ambition and value. Unlike many other ventures, Rexas Finance, stressing its dedication to community-driven development, chose against venture capital financing. This choice is now popular for investors looking for long-term value, strengthening its credibility and attractiveness even more. Rexas Finance (RXS) Future Outlook Several elements influence the price momentum of Rexas Finance. Its CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko listing have created a lot of hype and drawn more project funding. Furthermore, RWA tokenization is becoming increasingly sought after, so Rexas Finance is positioned to profit from this trend. Analysts anticipate a 38x rally in its price and a surge to $5.7. Rexas Finance is one of the most successful altcoins, able to provide unmatched returns for early adopters, and this explosive increase would make it among them. Although XRP and Rexas Finance provide interesting prospects, their investing potentials differ. XRP is a dependable alternative for investors looking for consistent development because of its well-known market presence and emphasis on cross-border payments. However, Rexas Finance’s revolutionary approach to RWA tokenization makes it a high-growth option with the potential to exceed XRP. With its 7x gain, a $1,000 investment in XRP is expected to expand to $7,000; similarly, the amount invested in Rexas Finance may generate $38,000, a 38x increase. In conclusion, XRP’s expected 7x surge makes it a desirable investment choice since it can make a $1,000 difference in two months. Nevertheless, with its creative approach to RWA tokenization, Rexas Finance provides a significantly higher upside. Rexas Finance is a winner for investors looking for exponential development since it projects a 38x rise from the same $1,000 investment into $38,000. Rexas Finance will likely alter the crypto market and provide unparalleled returns as it continues to acquire popularity and extend its ecosystem.

This marks a big step forward in resolving the aftermath of one of the crypto world’s most notable hacks. Hacked Victims Finally Receive $225 Million In a recent press release Grant Thornton, the liquidating firm overseeing Cryptopia’s case, confirmed that over 10,000 verified account holders have received payouts totaling more than $225 million in crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin. These distributions were made possible after years of hard-working efforts to identify users and verify millions of transactions from nearly a million accounts. Cryptopia’s claims portal, launched in 2020 , was a crucial tool in this process. Liquidators worked to ensure the payouts were aligned with a court decision from March 2020, which clarified how assets should be returned to users. More Funds to Be Distributed This initial distribution is just the beginning. Grant Thornton plans additional payouts for verified users, with the potential for “top-up” distributions for those who haven’t yet received their full holdings. These top-ups will likely use unclaimed assets from users who fail to register on the claims portal before the final cut-off dates. The liquidators have urged all remaining account holders to complete their registration on the portal to qualify for future distributions. New rounds of payouts are expected in the coming year, giving hope to more users waiting to recover their funds. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks in 2024: Centralized Exchanges Become Top Targets , The Cryptopia Hack Cryptopia , once New Zealand’s largest crypto exchange with 1.4 million users, was at its peak in 2018.

Perhaps, the recent payouts give hope to thousands of affected users, showing that even in difficult cases, solutions can be found. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana’s massive 10,000% surge since 2020 set records. Now, analysts highlight a DeFi altcoin with the potential to match that growth in 2025. Table of Contents Solana set for 5th bullish wave Remittix: The PayFi powerhouse set to dominate the $250t cross-border payment market Final words Solana (SOL) is one of the most trending cryptocurrencies in the market today. Over the years, its price has increased by more than 10,000%. Sadly, only a few people were lucky to have entered at the beginning. Now, as the market continues to heat up for 2025, one DeFi coin is emerging with a similar trajectory. The new entrant called Remittix (RTX) is tapping into a trillion-dollar sector to give its holders more gains than SOL has for those who missed one of the best cryptocurrency investment opportunities in history. Solana set for 5th bullish wave The Solana coin is among the best-performing coins in the market today. Its price increase in the last three years has been exponential. Solana’s price had previously fallen to $12 after the FTX exchange collapsed in 2022. Surprisingly, the Solana token produced an overwhelming price performance last year, crossing $150. Today, the altcoin is part of the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the market according to market cap. CoinMarketCap data shows the value of the Solana crypto has spiked by 2.2% on the weekly chart. It is currently trading just below the $200 mark as it seeks to reach new highs in the coming months. A top analyst called Titan of Crypto predicts the value of Solana could pump to $400. According to him, SOL has retested the neckline of a cup and handle pattern and is now ready for an upward move. Another expert called King Charts noted the cryptocurrency is ready for the fifth bullish wave. This wave could push the altcoin past its current all-time high to $350. At the moment, the technical indicators of Solana are bullish. The relative strength index is below 50 which is the oversold region. The token has hit bottom and could be ready for the next leg up. The Hull Moving Average (9) is even showing a buy signal which supports the uptrend.

Businesses can integrate and start accepting cryptocurrencies as payment with no hassle and convert them to fiat to over 30 currencies worldwide. For over 50 crypto pairs, businesses have complete freedom to cash out in any way they wish, thus accessing a borderless economy.

Every payment is transparent, and secure, and cannot be altered as it is based on blockchain technology. Remittix is disrupting the global borders and enabling people, companies, and crypto owners to transfer money at their own discretion and as fast as possible. Remittix is gaining momentum in its presale stage and the RTX coin is currently trading at $0.015 with huge potential for growth. Analysts have tagged the PayFi protocol as the best cryptocurrency to buy after for those who missed Solana. They forecast its price could increase by up to 100x by the end of this bull market with some already dubbing it the ‘XRP Killer’. Final words Investors who missed out on Solana have nothing to worry about. Market experts believe that there are bigger opportunities out there.

37876607,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630947,1734687812,Is Xi Jinping letting its territories outside mainland China invest in what he can’t? Gambling and Bitcoin in play,"On Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping emphasized the need for Macau to prioritize economic diversification as its “first” objective during a three-day visit to the Chinese gambling hub. The trip marked the 25th anniversary of Macau’s handover from Portugal, as the city aims to expand its role within China’s mainland economic framework. According to a Financial Times report , Xi made these remarks at the swearing-in ceremony of Macau’s new chief executive, Sam Hou Fai, who is the city’s fourth leader since the 1999 handover. Sam, Macau’s first leader born in mainland China who arguably has weaker ties to the business sector than his predecessors, is seen as aligned with Beijing’s push for diversification beyond the gambling industry, which currently accounts for 80% of the city’s tax revenue. Xi Jinping urges Macau to diversify its economy “ First, Macau should focus on promoting appropriate economic diversification, ” Xi urged, encouraging increased policy support and investment in emerging industries. He also stressed the importance of aligning Macau’s development with national strategies, including integration with the Greater Bay Area, a regional economic zone comprising Hong Kong , Macau, and Guangdong province. Anthony Lawrance, founder of consultancy Intelligence Macau, believes Xi’s visit will be influential in the city’s growth. “ It will be the first time that he heaps praise on Macau for a job well done. His previous trips were to admonish and cajole ,” he remarked. Macau’s gambling industry, the cornerstone of its economy, has thrived since the liberalization of its gaming monopoly in 2002, attracting investments from global casino giants like Las Vegas Sands, MGM, and Wynn. However, the city’s reliance on visitors from mainland China made it vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, when stringent travel restrictions led to economic stagnation . Recent data suggests the city is pacing itself into recovery. In the first 11 months of 2024, Macau’s gross gaming revenue increased by 26.8% year-on-year to MOP 208.58 billion (US$25.8 billion), representing 77.4% of its pre-Covid level in 2019. Visitation also surged, with 29.05 million visitors in the first 10 months of 2024, marking a 28.1% increase compared to the previous year and nearing 87% over pre-pandemic levels. Hong Kong’s economic diversification rivals Mainland China In contrast to Macau, neighboring Hong Kong has successfully diversified its economy for years now. The city recently approved four cryptocurrency exchanges as part of efforts to establish itself as a global hub for digital asset trading. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission granted licenses to Accumulus GBA Technology, DFX Labs Company, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology, bringing the total number of licensed platforms in the city to seven. Previously approved platforms include HashKey, OSL, and HKVAX. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, has traditionally operated under the “one country, two systems” framework, a policy introduced by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. This arrangement allowed Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy in managing its own affairs, distinguishing it from mainland China . When Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997, Beijing pledged to preserve the region’s unique characteristics. As part of this agreement, China promised to uphold Hong Kong’s capitalist system and grant the city freedoms not available in mainland Chinese cities for fifty years. The freedom allowed Hong Kong to create a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, which took effect in April 2023, to issue licenses for all virtual asset service providers. Mainland China has been reluctant to follow the trend. While cryptocurrency trading is banned in mainland China, Hong Kong residents are allowed to purchase digital assets, which is why the city’s projected revenue from online gambling could surpass $600 million in 2024, as revealed by Statista.

The lawsuit claims that the token’s promoters targeted the U.S. market and failed to register it as a security, violating regulatory requirements. Rather than focusing solely on the sudden collapse, the lawsuit highlights concerns about the token’s distribution and its allegedly misleading structure. The plaintiffs allege that the company behind Hawk Tuah, overHere Ltd, suggested token holders would have shareholder-like rights. However, they claim the distribution was unequal and did not deliver on these promises. By focusing on securities law violations, the lawsuit aims to hold the company accountable through a strong legal argument. Meme coins continue to face scrutiny for their reliance on hype and celebrity endorsements, which often fuel fraudulent schemes. While rug pulls have decreased in 2024, the volatile nature of these tokens still presents risks for investors. High-profile figures, including celebrities and influencers , can amplify the appeal of questionable assets, further exposing the market to potential scams. In some cases, even hacked celebrity accounts have been used to promote fraudulent meme coins. Hailey Welch’s association with Hawk Tuah has drawn attention, though she remains uninvolved in the lawsuit. Her credibility within the community, however, may suffer regardless of the legal outcome. The Hawk Tuah case serves as another cautionary tale for investors, highlighting the ongoing risks in the meme coin market despite increased awareness and declining rug pull incidents.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/hawk-tuah-investors-sue-over-token-fraud,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37876206.jpeg

Investors ended a 15-day streak of inflows by withdrawing a net $671.9 million from the 11 ETFs, the largest single-day tally since their inception on Jan. 11, according to data from Coinglass and Farside Investors.  Fidelity's FBTC and Grayscale's GBTC led the outflows, losing $208.5 million and $188.6 million, respectively. Other funds registered outflows, too, and BlackRock's IBIT scored its first zero in several weeks.  Bitcoin extended its post-Fed losses Thursday, falling to $96,000, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,268 seen early this week.   The bearish sentiment was mirrored in the derivatives market, where the annualized premium in the CME's regulated one-month bitcoin futures fell to 9.83%, the lowest in over a month, according to data source Amberdata.  A decline in the premium means cash-and-carry arbitrage bets involving a long position in the ETF and a short position in the CME futures yield less than they did earlier. As such, the ETFs may continue to see weak demand in the short-term.  Ether ETFs also registered a net outflow, $60.5 million. That's the first since Nov. 21. Ether has dropped 20% since levels above $4,100 before Wednesday's Fed decision.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-record-withdrawals-as-cme-futures-premium-signals-weaker-demand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3579d393b0951f3776e04a3385cd9f043a19a03-2468x976.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37876047,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395430,1734687062,Fly-to-Earn Innovation Soars with $11.5M Spexi Funding Round,"The post Fly-to-Earn Innovation Soars with $11.5M Spexi Funding Round appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Fly-to-Earn (F2E) is an exciting new trend in the cryptocurrency world that is quickly gaining attention. Imagine earning rewards just by participating in flight-related activities—whether through gaming, virtual simulations, or real-world travel. As the concepts of real-world asset tokenization (RWA) and the rapidly growing GameFi sector attract more investors, the F2E model is becoming an intriguing opportunity. With its potential to reshape how we think about both crypto and rewards, F2E is set to take off in ways many never expected. The RWA market is currently valued at around $19 billion, while the GameFi sector is worth about $22.7 billion. As blockchain technology and Web3 protocols continue to gain mainstream adoption, the F2E model is expected to grow significantly in the years ahead. F2E and Virtual Reality The F2E concept has primarily been linked to virtual reality, especially in gaming and simulation industries. For example, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 lets players earn in-game currency and other virtual rewards by completing flights and missions. This gamified experience is a big attraction for aviation and gaming enthusiasts alike. Blockchain and Earning Through Flight Games Some blockchain and cryptocurrency companies are now adopting similar models to turn virtual flying into an opportunity to earn crypto. BlockAirGame, for instance, is creating an F2E model where users can win crypto assets like Polygon (POL) by playing flight-related games. This combines the excitement of gaming with blockchain rewards. In the real world, several startups are also exploring the F2E concept. One example is Satoshi Airlines, which launched the Fly-to-Earn app. This app blends air travel with blockchain technology, allowing users to earn rewards for their participation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Doodles NFT Soars 62.5% Amid Token Speculation and McDonald’s Partnership , Spexi’s Investment and Growth Earlier this month, Spexi, a network focused on ultra-high-resolution drone imagery, raised $11.5 million in a Series A funding round led by BlockChange Ventures.

37877162,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52627,1734687018,"PEPE and Litecoin Set for Growth in 2025, but Rollblock Stands Out with Its Massive Presale","PEPE and LTC have seen impressive growth in 2024, catching the attention of investors worldwide. Both coins are expected to climb even higher in 2025, with forecasts showing promising numbers. But while these tokens grab short-term interest, Rollblock’s potential stands out for bigger reasons. Its ongoing potential has already turned heads, raising more than $7 million and gaining momentum in the market. Unlike other projects, Rollblock combines utility and growth potential, giving investors a real opportunity to earn long-term rewards while enjoying the excitement of iGaming. Rollblock is confidently the next big winner Rollblock is changing online gambling with its innovative GambleFi platform. It combines blockchain technology and online casinos, giving players security, speed, and fun all in one place. Rollblock offers a major advantage: token holders get a share of weekly casino profits. The platform stands out with features that players love. It is licensed, so KYC is required to ensure users stay secure while enjoying fast crypto deposits and payouts. Rollblock offers many casino games, live sports betting, and a simple, user-friendly experience. RBLK, Rollblock’s token, adds even more value. Holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards and enjoy a buyback-and-burn system. This reduces the token supply, making $RBLK more valuable over time. Compared to PEPE and LTC , Rollblock’s focus on real-world use and passive income makes it a standout choice. For investors looking for innovation and consistent rewards, Rollblock might just be the next big winner. PEPE Coin – meme power and growth potential PEPE Coin saw an incredible 1,800% surge in 2024, turning heads across the crypto space. Forecasts for its future growth remain optimistic. Changelly expects its price to rise to $0.0000263 by December 2024, while Longforecast predicts a 16% increase by February 2025. Some scenarios even see PEPE reaching as high as $0.0036 next year. This meme-based coin appeals to younger investors because of its viral nature and community hype. However, tokens like PEPE Coin often lack practical use cases. Unlike utility-driven platforms like Rollblock, PEPE relies heavily on its popularity rather than offering real value or increasing its market cap through innovation. Litecoin (LTC) – stability and long-term growth LTC has shown strong performance in 2024, rising by 36.81% to trade at $119.20. Predictions for 2025 remain positive. CryptoNews expects LTC to climb to $213.16 by the end of the year. CoinGape forecasts an average of $204.04, with a peak at $227.56. Meanwhile, Cryptopolitan sees steady growth, projecting a minimum LTC price of $186.72. As a peer-to-peer payment coin, LTC offers stability and wide adoption for transactions. However, Rollblock sets itself apart with greater growth potential. Its thriving ecosystem, combined with rewards and increasing market cap , gives investors opportunities for consistent growth and valuable returns. Conclusion The growth potential for cryptocurrencies in 2025 looks promising, with coins like LTC and PEPE continuing to show steady progress. While cryptos like these remain a viable choice, Rollblock stands out as a stronger opportunity for investors. Its innovative approach, revenue-sharing model, and focus on rewards make it an attractive option. For those seeking long-term gains and diverse rewards, Rollblock offers far more than traditional tokens. Currently in presale at a low price of $0.0415, don’t miss out!

37875974,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665184,1734687006,"XRP, Solana Among Altcoins Witnessing TD Buy Signal, Analyst Reveals","An analyst has pointed out how XRP and Solana are among the altcoins that have just observed a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential buy signal on their 4-hour prices. Four Altcoins Are Seeing A Buy Signal On The TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the TD Sequential signal that four different altcoins have seen on their 4-hour charts. The “TD Sequential” is an indicator from technical analysis (TA) used to locate probable turnaround points in a given asset’s price. Related Reading: Secret Bitcoin Driver: Exchanges Receiving $40 Million USDT Fuel Per Day The indicator involves two phases: the setup and countdown. During the first of these the setup, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. The nine candles don’t have to be consecutive. Once the counter hits nine, the setup is said to be complete, and the price could be assumed to have reached a reversal location. If the candles leading up to the setup’s completion were green, the TD Sequential would imply a top for the asset. Similarly, if they were red, the indicator would suggest a change of direction to the upside. The second phase, the countdown, begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase of the indicator works in the same manner, save for the fact that candles are meant to be counted up to thirteen instead this time. After the thirteen candles of the same polarity, another potential top or bottom could be considered to have been reached by the asset. Now, here are the charts shared by Martinez that show the completion of the TD Sequential phase of the first type for four altcoins: XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Maker (MKR), and Worldcoin (WLD). As is visible in the above graph, the four-hour prices of XRP, Solana, Maker, and Worldcoin have all completed a TD Sequential setup with nine red candles. This naturally means the indicator gives a buy signal for these altcoins. The pattern has taken shape as assets across the cryptocurrency sector have crashed following the US Federal Reserve taking a cautious approach towards further interest rate cuts.

37875947,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395427,1734686927,Bitcoin ETF Outflow Surges to Record $672M as Price Drops Below $97K,"The post Bitcoin ETF Outflow Surges to Record $672M as Price Drops Below $97K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market in the last 24 hours has seen 361,972 traders getting liquidated, losing over $1.17 billion. This comes after Bitcoin’s price dropped 7%, hitting a low of $95,500 after achieving a historic high of $108,268, it lost about 12% of its value in just three days. US Bitcoin ETFs saw record withdrawals, with investors pulling out $672 million in a single day. This marks the largest outflow ever recorded, surpassing the previous record of $564 million set in May. The immediate catalyst was Bitcoin taking a nosedive at the critical level of $97K showing an extreme fear moment in the crypto market. The crypto market is in a panic situation as Trump’s policies might meet political resistance, market analysts like Arthur Hayes also predicted a severe market crash after Trump’s inauguration in January. Withdrawal Alert The majority of the outflows came from, Fidelity’s FBTC led with $208.6 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s BTC Mini Trust at $188.6 million and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB with $108.4 million. Grayscale’s GBTC saw $87.9 million leave, while Bitwise’s BITB saw $43.6 million exit. Furthermore, spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $60.5 million in outflows, ending an 18-day inflow streak. What Happened? The massive outflows are the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve’s negative stance on its recent rate cut. While the market was waiting for the Fed to complete its 100 basis, the Fed’s 0.25% drop in interest rate caused investors to panic. To make it worse, it hinted at fewer cuts in 2025, signaling a delay in regulations. Bitcoin’s price, along with other assets, saw sharp declines as traders reacted to these economic signals, leading to over $1 billion in leveraged liquidations. Short-Term Haul? However, the investor reaction is mixed. Since the indicators show a short-term haul, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is still showing a “greed” level of 74, suggesting that many investors are holding on to their positions, and anticipating a recovery. Many analysts are claiming this is an overreaction to the Fed’s comment and this will be a short-term fluctuation that happens after every Fed meeting. What’s Next for Bitcoin and ETFs? Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s price fluctuation is likely to continue, as global economic tensions are rising and regulatory issues are expected to delay. However, some ETFs, like WisdomTree’s Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), managed to attract new investments, indicating that not all investors are backing away. In short, the road ahead for Bitcoin will not be easy and it might see more outflows if the Fed maintains its stance over rate cuts in 2025. In such a scenario experts suggest holding on to your assets as the market will recover soon as new ETFs may flood the market sooner or later.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-etf-outflow-surges-to-record-672m-as-price-drops-below-97k/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Lightchain AI, the Polygon alternative, aims for a $20 target, promising a 6,666x return as it redefines blockchain with AI solutions. Table of Contents Why Lightchain AI is dubbed the Polygon alternative Can LCAI really reach $20? Why users should be paying attention to AI-blockchain crossovers Lightchain AI presale: A lucrative investment opportunity As the cryptocurrency market anticipates its next big movers, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a Polygon (MATIC) alternative with massive growth potential. Priced at just $0.003 during its presale , Lightchain AI is gaining attention for its smart use of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Expert traders predict that LCAI could reach $20 within the next 10 to 12 months, offering a staggering 6,666x return for early investors. Let’s dive into why Lightchain AI is being hailed as the next big thing in blockchain and how it stacks up against established players like Polygon. Why Lightchain AI is dubbed the Polygon alternative Lightchain AI is considered a Polygon alternative due to its smart approach to scalability and efficiency in blockchain technology. By integrating artificial intelligence through its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) and employing a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, Lightchain AI enhances transaction throughput and reduces costs, similar to Polygon’s Layer 2 solutions. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world applications across various industries, such as healthcare and finance, positions it as a versatile platform for decentralized applications, much like Polygon’s ecosystem. Can LCAI really reach $20? According to expert traders, Lightchain AI’s price trajectory is backed by a combination of low initial entry, strong technology, and a growing market for AI applications. Key factors contributing to the $20 prediction include. Rapid adoption With its new technology and developer-friendly tools, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction among enterprises and developers. Market demand for AI The global AI market is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030, providing a significant growth opportunity for platforms like Lightchain AI. Deflationary tokenomics LCAI’s deflationary model ensures that as adoption grows, the token’s value will appreciate due to its built-in scarcity mechanisms. Upcoming mainnet launch The scheduled March 2025 mainnet launch will unlock the full potential of Lightchain AI’s ecosystem, attracting more investors and developers. With these factors in play, the $20 target is not only ambitious but achievable within the next 10 to 12 months. But many experts believe that LCAI’s growth potential extends far beyond the $20 mark.

37876150,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-market-sees-1-billion-liquidation-amid-sudden-downturn/,1734686529,Crypto Market Sees $1 Billion Liquidation Amid Sudden Downturn,"The crypto market faced a significant shake-up as over $1 billion was liquidated in the past 24 hours, catching traders off guard. According to CoinGlass data, $856.7 million of these liquidations came from long positions, driven by the strong bullish momentum observed over the last month. Bitcoin slipped by 5% and is now trading at $96,350, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This downturn follows a pattern seen earlier this month, with Bitcoin’s dips below psychological levels triggering large-scale liquidations. On Dec. 5, a sharp 5.47% drop below $93,000 erased $300 million within minutes. A similar scenario unfolded on Dec. 10, when a crypto market pullback wiped out $1.7 billion in leveraged positions, marking the largest long liquidation of this cycle so far. Short-Term Volatility or a Bigger Trend? Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal attributed the sell-off to market unpreparedness for negative news amidst a month of bullish sentiment. “The market wasn’t braced for bad news, leading to indiscriminate selling. However, this seems like short-term angst rather than a prolonged downturn,” he stated . Other analysts echo this optimism. Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts hinted at a potential buying opportunity on the horizon. Similarly, Caleb Franzen, another prominent crypto analyst, contextualized the volatility as a natural occurrence during bull runs. Franzen pointed out that during the last bull cycle, Bitcoin experienced nine pullbacks over 16 months, all of which eventually gave way to higher highs. Fred Krueger, a Bitcoin maximalist, cautioned against using leverage in trading Bitcoin, highlighting it as a key factor in recent liquidations. Meanwhile, Hundal believes the crypto market’s next moves will hinge on expectations for the incoming Trump administration , which could bring significant changes to U.S. crypto policy. Crypto Santa Rally Still Possible? Despite the market turbulence, analysts remain hopeful for a “Santa rally” leading into the holiday season. Hundal stated that market participants should brace for volatility as the January 2025 inauguration of President Donald Trump approaches, with speculation around his plans for a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve fueling market dynamics . For now, the crypto market sits at a crossroads, balancing between short-term uncertainties and long-term bullish prospects.

37875728,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375494,1734686482,Why is the Ripple (XRP) Price Down Today?,"TL;DR XRP experienced a sharp decline, briefly falling below $2.20 following a broader crypto market correction. Despite the dip many analysts foresee the asset rebounding to targets as high as $5, with some projecting even greater peaks if a FOMO-driven rally occurs. XRP Follows the Market Decline Despite the enhanced volatility, the first half of December has been quite successful for Ripple’s XRP . At the start of the month, its price surpassed a multi-year high of $2.80, while at the beginning of this week, it consolidated above $2.50. However, things took a sudden turn on December 18, with XRP plunging below $2.30. S everal hours ago, the valuation dipped under $2.20. Currently, XRP is around $2.23 after a slight rebound, which represents a 6% decline on a daily scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most obvious factor that has impacted the price of the token is the severe correction of the entire cryptocurrency sector. The global crypto market capitalization is down almost 9% in the last 24 hours, currently set at around $3.42 trillion (CoinGecko’s data). Bitcoin (BTC), which hit a new all-time high of over $108,000 on December 17, is now worth less than $96,000. Ethereum (ETH) tumbled below $3,300, while Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and many more are down by double digits. The market started bleeding heavily shortly after the Federal Reserve announced its latest interest rate cut. It reduced the benchmark by 0.25%, but Jerome Powell hinted that next year, the policy might be halted due to an increase in the inflation rate. In addition to that , the spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed their biggest outflows in a single day. As CryptoPotato reported , over $670 million were withdrawn from the financial vehicles in total on a 24-hour scale, with Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s BTC leading the pack – $ 208.5 and $188.6 million, respectively. XRP’s Next Potential Targets Despite the substantial plunge, numerous analysts remain optimistic that XPR’s bull run is far from over. The popular X user Crypto Bitlord believes the latest correction has represented a local bottom, after which XRP could surge to as high as $5. Other market observers who recently chipped in are Dark Defender and Armando Pantoja. The former set $5.85 and $8.76 as short-term targets, while the latter assumed XRP could be headed toward $2.78 and then $3.87. Pantoja went even further, predicting a mass FOMO effect if the price reach $10-$12, and “that’s when it will get crazy.” The post Why is the Ripple (XRP) Price Down Today? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | XRP,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-the-ripple-xrp-price-down-today-5/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37875728.jpeg

37875503,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630936,1734685864,"The year closes with 16% more crypto VC deals, investment value still 20% lower","VC funding for crypto startups continued its recovery throughout the year. The past 12 months end with 16% more deals, though at a lower overall value. Funding for crypto projects expanded in 2024 in terms of the total number of deals. With growing technological stacks, more projects emerged as potentially successful narratives. Competition also picked up, as the market refilled with liquidity. The profile of investments also shifted in the past year, to reflect the new set of narratives in the bull market. Based on Messari’s report, L1 and infrastructure closed the biggest deals. DePin spending rose by 300% as projects offered new infrastructure and physical AI data centers or shared resources. AI was the other significant growth area, doubling the inflow of VC investments. While crypto prices and projects have recovered some of their metrics, VC funding is still pressured by the 2022-2023 slowdown. The biggest worry is the ability of funds to achieve a favorable price after launching their token. Teams have been more careful about their vesting and incentives, to avoid the fate of former VC-backed tokens that erased most of their value after the launch. Final quarter boosted overall deals for the year The final months of 2024 added to the overall success, with a 22.6% monthly growth, based on Messari’s accounting of crypto deals. Crypto funding ended Q3 with around $2.4B in deals, with some strong months carried by large-scale rounds. From October onward, more deals were announced, compensating for the slowdown in the summer months. The last quarter of 2024 is preparing to wrap up with similar results, though with a notably higher number of deals. VC deals tracked the bull market, recovering after the slow September growth. VC funding has returned to the levels of 2022, before the prolonged bear market, with expectations of sufficient liquidity and an upward trend in 2025. One of the big drivers in 2024 were private deals and funding rounds, often financed with bonds instead of crypto treasuries. Funds were more selective in their spending, as some VC projects faced challenges in successfully trading their tokens. The overall trend of growing VC funding also put Animoca Brands as the leader in supporting most projects. Animoca Brands also worked as a curator, singling out promising projects with rounds of $3M-$10M. Beyond the small high-profile rounds, projects received $7.07B in undisclosed rounds. Those rounds exceeded both the number and value of seed rounds, as funds became more careful of their selection with early-stage startups. In 2024, the bulk of funding came from large-scale undisclosed rounds, surpassing the number of seed rounds. | Source: Cryptorank Most of the funding flowed into US-based projects. Crypto startups had several major sources of funding, ranging from older crypto investors and former ICO projects to outsider buyers. VC funding growth in the last months of 2024 also coincided with a revival of ICO deals. As in the past, some of the projects combined a public sale with VC backing. ICO deals accelerated in the past quarter of 2024, achieving a total of 555 deals on Ethereum and 250 sales on Solana . As a comparison, Ethereum saw only 260 ICO deals in 2023 during the bear market stagnation, and Solana had a negligible number of sales. AI deals move to the forefront The pace of AI deals in the crypto space tracks the expansion of AI spending for all other startups. In the year to date, AI investments for mainstream startups expanded to $87B, up from $56B in 2023, and with an outlook of additional growth in the next year. In the crypto space, the share of AI deals rose to 26.8% of all fundraising. AI projects are constantly cropping up, and some older crypto startups are adding AI to their name. Overall, the funding tracks the newest use cases for AI, ranging from real infrastructure and decentralized computing to meme tokens and content production. The AI category is especially driven by VC funding, but not reflected in ICO rounds. Most ICO sales target an older set of narratives, including DeFi, GameFi, blockchain infrastructure and services. AI projects raise capital either through funds, or choose to launch a meme token to tap the wider public interest.

Investors Filed a Lawsuit Against Memecoin That Crashed 95 Percent!,"A new one has been added to the cases in the cryptocurrency market. Investors have filed a lawsuit against several entities involved in the launch of the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) memecoin. Investors noted that the HAWK token exhibits all the characteristics of an unregistered security according to established legal precedents. At this point, the defendants named in the lawsuit include Tuah The Moon Foundation, OverHere Ltd, Clinton So, and Alex Larson Schultz and Haley Welch, who allegedly introduced the memecoin. Social media phenomenon Haley Welch, known as the “Hawk Tuah” girl, was also reportedly sued for allegedly promoting and selling the memecoin HAWK, which suffered a 95% collapse hours after its launch on December 4. Haliey Welch has denied allegations that she or her team traded information related to the HAWK token. The plaintiffs' lawyers wrote: “Pre-launch marketing for HAWK portrayed the token as more than a speculative asset and portrayed the token as a cultural asset with significant growth potential. Haley Welch's promotion of the HAWK token and her reputation as a trusted public figure inspired her followers and potential investors to invest in the project.” HAWK initially reached a market cap of $4.9 billion before its steep decline. However, it immediately dropped by more than 90%. According to the data, HAWK was launched on December 4th with a market cap of approximately $16.6 million. HAWK’s price surged after the launch, reaching a market cap of $491 million within three hours. However, it quickly fell to around $41.7 million. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AI predicts Rollblock to outshine XRP and Shiba Inu with an 880% surge by 2025, driven by its viral GameFi protocol. Table of Contents Rollblock goes viral with GameFi protocol before 2025 gains XRP price action hints at massive gains in early 2025 Shiba Inu shows strength despite broader market crash Rollblock poised to deliver 880% returns to early investors Many market experts have started using AI to predict future trends in the crypto market. Since 2025 is just around the corner, AI has predicted Rollblock’s viral GameFi project to outshine both XRP and Shiba Inu in terms of its potential for gains. Rollblock goes viral with GameFi protocol before 2025 gains Rollblock has already gained significant whale interest during stage 9 of its presale but it is also capturing the attention of AI. Since AI models analyze the latest market trends in an objective way, analysts believe AI is correctly predicting an 880% price surge for Rollblock by the end of its presale. These extremely bullish predictions are all thanks to Rollblock’s unique strategy to bring decentralized and centralized gaming together on a single platform. By integrating the latest blockchain technology, Rollblock is giving traders a unique opportunity to make massive gains while playing the most secure online games. On Rollblock’s GameFi model, investors get exclusive access to 7,000+ AI-powered games that can be played at any time. Since Rollblock’s smart contract is already audited by SolidProof and every transaction is recorded on Ethereum’s immutable blockchain, traders can rest assured that their funds are stored in a secure place. Aside from the gaming front, Rollblock also offers long-term utility through its native RBLK altcoin. As traders become long-term liquidity providers in Rollblock’s GameFi ecosystem, they can earn a weekly passive income in the form of staking rewards with up to 30% APYs. If these direct gains weren’t enough, then Rollblock investors can also benefit from the token’s deflationary tokenomics which ensure that RBLK’s price always trends upward.

Analysts believe XRP is poised for more growth in early 2025 since its monthly, weekly, and daily timeframes show strong support for a bullish breakthrough. For now, they expect XRP’s price to test a long-term target of $27. XRP is currently trading for $2.45 after an intraday decrease of 6.98%. Despite the bearish price crash, XRP investors are still optimistic about a potential rally before the end of Q4’s bull run. Since XRP’s MACD indicator is on the verge of forming a bullish crossover with the signal line, analysts believe XRP could test the R3 resistance at $4.40 soon. Shiba Inu shows strength despite broader market crash Shiba Inu has recorded a 1.13% increase over the past 30 days which reflects the token’s resilience amid broader market fluctuations. Since Shiba Inu is preparing for an expansion of SHIB socials and SHIB DeFi platforms, analysts expect Shiba Inu’s ecosystem to offer more utility to users in early 2025. In addition, Shiba Inu has also announced a dedicated SHIB Marketplace to enable decentralized commerce which is likely to increase demand for Shiba Inu’s peer-to-peer transactions. Shiba Inu is currently trading for $0.00002543 after an intraday decrease of 5.10%. Since Shiba Inu’s RSI has reached the oversold level on the one-hour timeframe, Shiba Inu is likely to experience a trend reversal soon. If these bullish predictions stand true, Shiba Inu’s price could record a rally toward $0.00005297 in January 2025. Rollblock poised to deliver 880% returns to early investors Despite XRP and Shiba Inu’s potential for growth, the biggest contender for gains is still Rollblock’s viral GameFi protocol. As Rollblock emerges as one of the top DeFi altcoins in Q4’s bull market, both market experts and AI expect Rollblock to continue its upward trend by delivering 880% ROI to early investors soon.

37875409,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52670,1734685119,"Ripple CEO Discusses XRP Future, Discloses Something Surprising About USDC Supply","In a recent interview with eToro, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse provided significant insights into Ripple’s historical and ongoing use of stablecoins and its plans involving the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Ripple’s History with Stablecoins Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple has utilized stablecoins, particularly USD-backed ones, for years to optimize its payment solutions. He stated that Ripple had been responsible for minting 20% of the total supply of USDC, the popular stablecoin issued by Circle. This underscores Ripple’s early recognition of stablecoins as a valuable tool in cross-border payments, particularly in situations where they provide greater efficiency than other digital assets or traditional currency pairs. He added that Ripple has leveraged various stablecoins, including USDC and Tether (USDT), depending on specific corridors, customer needs, and operational efficiency. This history demonstrates Ripple’s flexibility in adopting technologies that enhance its payment solutions and address diverse institutional requirements. BREAKING: RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE IN THE NEW ETORO INTERVIEW: „RIPPLE HAS FOR YEARS USED US-DOLLAR STABLECOINS – AT ONE POINT WE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MINTING 20% OF ALL USDC!“ ‚RLUSD‘ BENEFITS FROM STABLECOIN REGULATIONS & WILL COMPLEMENT #XRP – THIS WILL BE HUGE! pic.twitter.com/6RiiZqNUgP — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 19, 2024 Ripple’s Stablecoin Launch and Market Growth Garlinghouse highlighted Ripple’s decision to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD, on the XRP Ledger. This move aligns with the company’s strategy to expand its offerings for institutional clients and maintain its competitive edge. According to Garlinghouse, the global stablecoin market, valued at around $120 billion when Ripple decided to enter, has grown to nearly $200 billion and is projected to reach several trillion dollars in the coming years. The launch of RLUSD is anticipated to benefit from emerging regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. By focusing on compliance and leveraging Ripple’s trusted reputation among financial institutions, RLUSD is positioned to complement XRP, creating a more comprehensive ecosystem on the XRPL. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of XRP and the XRP Ledger Garlinghouse emphasized that the XRP Ledger remains central to Ripple’s mission. He described the XRPL as one of the most efficient, trusted, and utility-driven blockchains in the market. The integration of RLUSD aims to enhance the ledger’s appeal to institutions, providing a stable and efficient mechanism for transactions. Garlinghouse also addressed the broader potential for stablecoins denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, such as the euro and yen. While the US dollar remains dominant, he suggested that diversification in stablecoin offerings could follow market demand. As the stablecoin market grows, Ripple’s dual focus on XRP and RLUSD positions the company to play a significant role in the next phase of digital financial infrastructure. This strategic alignment underscores Ripple’s commitment to innovation and its vision for a more efficient global payments ecosystem.

37875089,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=112362,1734685095,Get Ready to Catch The $HEADER On The Presale Event – Why We Say So?,"If you are looking for ways to invest in the next booming memecoin, have a look at the HEADER token. It is a chicken-themed memecoin that picked up momentum with user-generated memes. Though it was new to the market, it gained popularity with the help of its humor-driven community and whispers about its partnerships. The presale for the HEADER token is about to commence on December 20th, for which you can participate through the official website. This could be a one-time opportunity for traders and investors to make investments and secure the future. Reasons Why HEADER Will Take The Lead The HEADER is created as a satirical memecoin inspired by the political talks between Trump and Musk at Mar-a-Lago. Yet, the coin became viral with the user-generated memes and speculations that sparked discussions. Here are the four main reasons that could elevate the value of this token by 1000x times. 1. Powered by Solana A key factor propelling HEADER to the forefront is its strong foundation on the Solana blockchain. Solana is well known for its high-speed, low-cost infrastructure, making HEADER an efficient and scalable memecoin. Unlike traditional memecoins that often suffer from network congestion and high gas fees, HEADER leverages Solana’s robust architecture to offer lightning-fast transactions at a minimal cost. Furthermore, Solana’s growing ecosystem helps HEADER integrate with DeFi protocols,and other projects built on Solana. 2. Holds Strong Fundamentals HEADER isn’t just another memecoin capitalizing on the market hype, it is backed by strong fundamentals that set it apart from the competition. The distribution of tokenomics and the work the team behind the coin put forth has clearly indicated that HEADER is in for the long haul. HEADER’s tokenomics adds mechanisms like a capped supply (total supply of 1 Trillion $Header) to control inflation, thereby driving scarcity and increasing the value over time. 3. A Humor-Driven Community One of the main strengths of HEADER is its humor-driven community, which is propelling the memecoin toward success. The coin was designed with fun and entertainment in mind, attracting a group of enthusiasts who share memes, creative content, and jokes. This lighthearted approach not only makes HEADER appealing to newcomers but also fosters a sense of belonging among its members. The community encourages participation in various events, thereby creating a positive environment and keeping the community engaged. 4. Rewards and Surprises For Early Birds Like many crypto projects, HEADER positions itself as a community-first project, with early supporters reaping the benefits. The team has planned a variety of rewards and surprises for early adopters. They can receive exclusive token airdrops as gratitude for their dedication, giving them a head start in accumulating HEADER tokens. Early adopters can get priority access to new features, events, announcements, and more, making them an integral part of the project’s growth and success. These initiatives showcase HEADER’s commitment to loyal supporters who help foster a strong and engaging community. Conclusion Memecoins like HEADER position themselves to ride and capitalize on the major bull run. With Solana-based infrastructure, humor-driven community, and innovative rewards system, HEADER ensures both speed and engagement. As the market continues to soar, driven by positive developments, HEADER is set to emerge as one of the top performers in this altseason. The presale of HEADER will be inaugurated on December 20th. Acquiring HEADER during the initial stages would help investors enjoy the profits while the token skyrockets.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | SOL | TRADING | ZRX | AIRDROP,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/get-ready-to-catch-the-header-on-the-presale-event-why-we-say-so/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

Bitcoin Slumps as Meme Coins Thrive appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has been hit by a surprising development: El Salvador has struck a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), agreeing to adjust its Bitcoin policy. Naturally, this has sent shockwaves, triggering immense bearish momentum. While major cryptos plummeted, meme coins are thriving in the chaos. Why? Let’s uncover. Bitcoin Dips, Altcoins Follow Bitcoin (BTC) saw a significant decline of 3.32%, trading at $97,697. In the past 24 hours, its price ranged between $95,537 and $102,747. Its market cap is now $2.05 trillion, and trading volume has slightly decreased to $39.57 billion. A major factor behind the drop is a massive $682.04 million outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs, with big names like Fidelity and Grayscale reporting large withdrawals. Source : Tradingview Ethereum (ETH) dropped 6.52% to $3,420. Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs saw $58.13 million in outflows, although Fidelity and a few other firms reported small inflows. However, the overall sentiment is negative. Total spot ETH ETF outflows reached $70.45 million, adding to the selling pressure on Ethereum. Source : sosovalue Solana (SOL) wasn’t spared either, falling 6.09% to $196.56. Although Solana’s trading volume increased slightly, it wasn’t enough to offset the losses. Analysts believe the bearish trend could continue, especially for major altcoins, given the current market conditions. Meme Coins Defy the Trend Amid the market chaos, meme coins are thriving. Solana’s Fartcoin, for example, has surged by an incredible 608%, reaching a market cap of $1.18 billion since December 5. This shows that even in tough times, some investors are still willing to chase risky, high-reward opportunities. XRP has had a rollercoaster journey. After plunging 13% following the RLUSD stablecoin launch, it managed a modest recovery of 1.51%. While this bounce is small, it suggests that XRP investors are starting to regain some confidence. Market Outlook: Bearish Now, but It Gets Better The market looks uncertain, to say the least. Bitcoin and Ethereum could see more sell-offs as traders cash in on any opportunity amid the current volatility. But there’s some hope—the SEC’s approval of new ETFs might boost crypto’s integration into mainstream finance, giving the market some long-term stability. For now, the Fear and Greed Index stands at 62, meaning investors are cautious but not yet in panic mode. If you’re watching the market, expect more volatility in the short term. The market waits in suspense, but as always, the true test will come soon.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-crash-alert-bitcoin-slips-below-96k-altcoins-tumble/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37875191,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630923,1734684754,Crypto talk about ‘buying the dip’ hits 8-month high – How low do analysts expect Bitcoin to fall?,"The insatiability of crypto investors is one to reckon with. Recently, Bitcoin hit a historic price past $100K following Donald Trump’s win in the POTUS race. Shortly after, the Fed and Jerome Powell ushered in a crypto bloodbath. To that end, chatter about ‘buying the dip’ has sprung back into the industry. What are investors in for as the year closes? According to Santiment, the ratio of mentions on social media of ‘buying the dip’ ramped up as Bitcoin dropped below the six-figure price level. Source: X The social dominance score, reflecting the mentions of ‘buying the dip’ on social media, reached 0.061 on December 19. This coincides with Bitcoin’s stagnation below the $100,000 mark for approximately 12 hours at the time of this report. It was the highest social dominance score since April 12, when Bitcoin’s price fell below $70,000 to just around $67,000, then fell to around $63,000 the next day. The ‘buy the dip’ sentiment was almost retested on August 4, when BTC dropped below $60,000 and slid toward $53,000 within the next 24 hours. According to CoinGecko’s on-chain data, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently valued at $97,503.91, up 0.6% from an hour ago and down 3.6% in the last 24 hours. The value of Bitcoin today is 2.4% lower than it was seven days ago. The current ‘buy the dip’ chatter showcases investors’ belief that BTC will tank further down as the historic negative weekend sentiments kick in. Bitcoin, altcoins, memecoins market bloodbath Crypto is in an interesting state. Data shows that search interest for the term ‘crypto’ continues to be significant, although it has dropped. Recent data from Google Trends shows that global searches for ‘crypto’ have reached a score of 75 in the past week, marking a decline of 25 points from a peak score of 100 recorded at the start of December. Most of those interested in crypto are from St. Helena. Saint Helena is a British Overseas Territory off the coast of Africa in the South Atlantic Ocean. It consists of Saint Helena, Ascension Island, and the island group of Tristan da Cunha. It’s interesting right? That crypto has made a home in one of the smallest parts of the world. Nigeria follows in second place, while the Netherlands takes the third place. Source: Google Trends The interest far outweighs what has been happening in the crypto market. Today’s cryptocurrency market is experiencing a downturn, with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping beneath the $96,000 mark. BTC and ETH ETFs are experiencing outflows following an extended period of positive performance. Leading altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) experienced a downturn, with declines ranging from 3% to 5%. In a surprising twist amid the market’s downturn, Movement (MOVE) and Zerebro (ZEREBRO) have established themselves as standout performers, with MOVE surging 30% and Zerebro (ZEREBRO) skyrocketing by 56% over the past 24 hours. The global crypto market experienced a decline of around 2%, settling at $3.34 trillion, even as trading volume saw a rise of 3.42%, reaching $280 billion. The fear and greed index holds steady at 62, indicating that the market sentiment leans towards greed. Is FOMO nearing its end? The crypto dip followed after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. That may sound like a good thing on the surface, but as part of the cuts, the Fed also said it expects inflation and unemployment to rise more than expected in 2025. The recent surge in crypto began following the election, fueled by growing speculation that President-elect Donald Trump would initiate a bull run in the crypto market. While that possibility exists, the observed gains did not correspond with any significant shifts in the industry. The fear of missing out, commonly referred to as FOMO , has propelled valuations upward, and it appears that this trend may be reaching its end. There was also speculation that Bitcoin, in particular, would be acquired by the US government as a reserve currency or used as such by other governments. Fed Chair Jerome Powell was clear that the Federal Reserve is not allowed to buy Bitcoin, which may have caused some disappointment. This appears to be a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ moment in investing, in which investors are disappointed when results or news come out, even if it is as obvious as the Fed not purchasing Bitcoin.

What followed was a fake announcement that seemed almost too convincing to be true: a partnership between DOGE and the stablecoin project USUAL aimed at transforming government spending through digital currencies. But as the details unfolded, it quickly became clear that the whole thing was a scam. Keep reading for the full story. Fake Partnership That Fooled Many The now-deleted post from Ramaswamy’s account announced the supposed alliance between DOGE and USUAL, with claims that blockchain technology would make government spending more efficient. The scammers used phrases like “promoting fiscal responsibility” and “achieving economic stability” to make the announcement sound legitimate. However, fund manager James Fishback quickly stepped in , exposing the hack. He confirmed that Ramaswamy’s account had been hacked and called the announcement a “complete scam.” The fraudulent post also tried to link the fake partnership to former President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, claiming it would streamline federal spending. These claims were completely false, a tactic used to mislead crypto investors. Targeting Big Names in Crypto This incident is just one example of a growing trend in the crypto world, where hackers use well-known names to spread fake news. Recently, there was another scam involving a meme coin and the so-called “Hawk Tuah girl,” further showing the increasing use of scams to trick the public. Elon Musk’s Real DOGE Plans Even though the DOGE-USUAL partnership was fake, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is working on real goals. Recently, the department found that 80% of the $100 billion spent on federal IT systems goes toward outdated technology. Musk believes cutting wasteful spending could help reduce inflation. He continues to push for smarter government spending and economic stability through efficient policies. USUAL Stablecoin’s Booming Success Although the DOGE-USUAL partnership was fake, USUAL itself is having real success. Launched just four months ago, the stablecoin has already reached a $1 billion market cap, making it the seventh-largest stablecoin in the market. Its success is driven by strong reserves, starting with Hashnote, a tokenized money market fund. USUAL also plans to add Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin, backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund.

This development provides institutional investors with simplified access to the two largest cryptocurrencies through spot-based investment options. The Franklin Templeton Crypto Index ETF and Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF both received regulatory clearance. Franklin Templeton’s filing was approved faster than expected , thanks to its alignment with commodity-based trust standards. Rule changes by Nasdaq and Cboe BZX also contributed to enabling these funds’ listings. Initially, the Hashdex ETF will focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum but could eventually include other assets, like XRP . This approval follows earlier delays, as the SEC postponed decisions on Hashdex’s June filing twice. Analysts believe upcoming leadership changes in Washington accelerated the approvals. The launch of these ETFs is anticipated for January 2024, with portfolios weighted by market capitalization—roughly 80% Bitcoin and 20% Ethereum. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that this milestone is significant for both Franklin Templeton and Hashdex. Crypto markets remain highly volatile. Bitcoin’s price recently dropped over 8%, plunging from $105,000 to below $96,000, leading to more than $1 billion in crypto liquidations within 24 hours. Despite this, the approval of these ETFs signals growing mainstream adoption and regulatory acceptance of digital assets. Industry experts predict Litecoin ETFs could be the next to gain approval. As a Bitcoin fork, Litecoin aligns with U.S. regulatory standards, making it a potential candidate for classification as a commodity. However, demand from institutional investors may be limited. Meanwhile, ETFs for Solana and XRP may face further delays due to ongoing uncertainties. The SEC’s attitude toward crypto appears to be shifting. Recent changes in leadership, including the non-renewal of Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw , signal a potential softening of the agency’s historically strict approach. Crenshaw, a supporter of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto stance, will leave her position in January. With Paul Atkins taking on a leadership role, the SEC might adopt a more favorable view of crypto ETFs in the future. These developments highlight a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency in traditional finance, despite market fluctuations and lingering regulatory challenges.

37875565,https://invezz.com/?p=2397367,1734684521,SEC approves first crypto ETFs combining Bitcoin and Ethereum,"The crypto market has reached a significant milestone as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves two groundbreaking exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF offer a unique proposition, blending spot Bitcoin and Ethereum investments into one streamlined package. This innovative structure aims to make cryptocurrency investments safer and more accessible to a wider audience, marking a crucial step in the evolution of digital asset trading. Why Bitcoin-Ethereum ETFs matter The introduction of these ETFs stands out in an already crowded market of crypto-focused financial products. Unlike traditional crypto ETFs that target a single asset, these funds combine Bitcoin and Ethereum, with allocations determined by their market values. This diversified structure is designed to mitigate risks inherent in concentrating investments in just one cryptocurrency. These ETFs simplify the process for individual investors hesitant to purchase Bitcoin or Ethereum outright due to technical complexities or security concerns. They offer exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies without requiring users to manage wallets or directly store digital assets. The move is particularly timely, given the volatile nature of the crypto market. By leveraging both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the ETFs provide investors with a balanced portfolio, ensuring they benefit from the unique advantages of each currency. For example, Bitcoin’s position as a digital store of value complements Ethereum’s extensive utility in decentralised applications and smart contracts. A new era of crypto regulation? The SEC’s approval signals the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within regulatory frameworks. A pivotal factor in the greenlighting of these ETFs was the demonstrated stability between the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum and their futures markets. This alignment reduces the risk of market manipulation—a significant concern for regulators and investors alike. The funds also incorporate stringent safeguards to ensure transparency and security. They are subject to oversight agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which closely monitors trading activities. These measures aim to uphold investor protection, demonstrating the SEC’s commitment to maintaining high standards in this nascent market. The approval represents a shift in regulatory attitudes toward cryptocurrencies, reflecting a broader recognition of their potential as mainstream financial instruments. This could pave the way for future innovations, with more diverse and sophisticated crypto ETFs on the horizon. How does this affect the crypto market? The launch of these ETFs is expected to attract a wider range of investors, including those new to digital assets. By offering a simplified entry point, the funds lower barriers to participation and could boost overall market liquidity. Moreover, the success of these ETFs may encourage other providers to explore similar products, potentially incorporating additional cryptocurrencies or novel investment strategies. This development could foster a more inclusive and diversified market, catering to both retail and institutional investors. Looking ahead, the approval of the Bitcoin-Ethereum ETFs may also influence global regulatory bodies. As the US takes a progressive stance on crypto investments, other markets might follow suit, creating a more unified and accessible global crypto ecosystem.

In the conversation on Dec. 20, Cathie Wood pointed towards Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) fixed supply of 21 million cap as the key denominator which will drive the asset’s value. She brought to light the scarcity of BTC as more than 19.5 million BTCs have already been mined, which she says have increased the institutional investor’s hunger for the asset. “Bitcoin is really the first of a new asset class, and it will be the largest opportunity of them all,” Wood stated. As a result of this increasing institutional adoption and supply-demand dynamic, she argues that the likelihood of BTC reaching $1 million is now considerably higher. Referencing Ark Investment’s Big Ideas 2023 research report , Wood highlighted the asset’s inherent scarcity as a key driver of its growing demand.

Also, she noted that BTC’s annual supply growth rate has recently fallen to 0.9%, lower than gold’s long-term average supply growth rate of 1%, meaning that BTC is more scarce than gold. Wood said that while gold could lead to increasing supply in a rising price environment, BTC cannot due to its decentralized mechanism. “Like gold , Bitcoin is secured by its scarcity, but unlike gold it’s backed by the largest computing system in the world, making it the most secure network in the world,” she explained. It is this mathematical scarcity along with its decentralized and rules-based design that differentiates BTC as a radically new era financial asset, Wood claimed. Wood largely credits the sudden boom in digital asset adoption to the COVID-19 pandemic, which she says has “turbocharged” a period of financial self-education by younger investors whose personal standards for accreditation traditionally fall short. This change has been also documented in statistics ; where 63% of people invested in cryptocurrency in 2021 during the pandemic, with the bulk of adopters being millennials and Gen Z.

The altcoin space continued to bleed, with most assets recording significant losses over the past day. Meanwhile, reports of Aptos Labs CEO quitting amplified APT’s price volatility. The native token plummeted from a daily peak of $12.66 to the $11.02 low – a 12.96% slide. Aptos CEO quits Aptos Labs CEO and co-founder Mo Shaikh confirmed his decision to step down today.

The outgoing CEO emphasized that their goal was to build a scalable and resilient foundation for creating future-oriented financial products. The duo drove Aptos to remarkable success by ensuring close ties with early builders, including Merkle Trade, Aave, MyCo, Econia, Kyd Labs, and Thala Labs. Furthermore, the project inked strategic collaborations with giants like Franklin Templeton, Google, BCG, NBCU, MasterCard, BlackRock, and Microsoft. Such developments have made Aptos a household name in ensuring scaling and innovation possibilities in the converging web2 and web3. Further, Shaikh acknowledged their investors, including DragonFly, ParaFi, Coinbase, and PayPal, for the firm’s success. However, Mo Shaikh has stepped down from his CEO role and emphasized his confidence that Ching will drive Aptos Lab’s next growth phase. Shaikh will remain the company’s strategic advisor, prioritizing Aptos’ blockchain advancements and mission. He stated, I will always remain a champion of Aptos and its mission. As such, I will stay on as a strategic advisor to Aptos Labs and look forward to continuing to help Aptos maintain its role as the world’s leading blockchain. APT price performance While Mo Shaikh announced crucial advancements, APT price actions tell a different tale. The altcoin has experienced notable volatility amid the latest broad market fluctuations. APT failed to capitalize on the latest bullish wave that took most tokens to ATHs. Developments such as significant token unlocks triggered continued declines as the market responded to the unpredictable economic signals. Meanwhile, Shaikh’s latest announcement saw the altcoin plummeting. APT declined from the daily high of $12.66 to $11.02. That translated to a 12.96% plunge on the 24-hour chart. APT hovers around $11.02 at press time, reflecting substantial volatility and bearishness. Source – Coinmarketcap Enthusiasts will likely watch how Aptos Labs will progress under Avery Ching. The firm’s dedication to improving products and securing institutional partnerships could be crucial in absorbing prevailing volatility in the crypto space.

The decision has sparked a legal battle, with World filing an appeal against the ruling. BayLDA claims World’s data collection practices, including iris scans, lacked a sufficient legal basis and violated GDPR. The regulator has demanded the company establish a deletion procedure compliant with privacy laws and ensure explicit user consent for future data collection. World has argued that the ruling is based on outdated systems and technologies no longer in use, stating that its current operations comply with GDPR requirements. The investigation began in early 2023 and only recently concluded, with BayLDA publishing its findings. World maintains that its updated practices address regulatory concerns and continues to challenge the order. The company’s response highlights the tension between evolving technologies and strict European privacy laws. This dispute could significantly impact World’s ability to operate in the European Union, a region known for its stringent data protection standards. Critics argue that this legal challenge strikes at the core of the company's identity verification model, potentially hampering its development in the region. World, a digital identity platform, collects biometric data like iris scans to create a global identity system. While the company rebranded in October, it has faced ongoing scrutiny from regulators and struggled with market volatility. Its native token, WLD, saw a brief surge after the U.S. elections but quickly lost momentum. The token's uncertain future mirrors the company’s current challenges in navigating regulatory landscapes. Germany has taken a tougher stance on cryptocurrency and digital assets in recent months. In July, the government sold its entire Bitcoin holdings and initiated a crackdown on crypto exchanges. This increased regulatory pressure could further complicate World’s position in the market. Despite the legal setbacks, World has shown no signs of backing down. The appeal process is expected to delay the enforcement of BayLDA’s order, allowing the company to continue its operations for now. However, the long-term outcome of this dispute remains unclear. Whether World’s efforts to address privacy concerns will satisfy regulators is a question that only time will answer. The case underlines the growing scrutiny of biometric data collection and highlights the challenges faced by tech companies in balancing innovation with compliance. The outcome of this legal battle could have far-reaching implications for digital identity platforms and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.",NEGATIVE,WLD,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | WLD,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/german-regulators-order-worldcoin-to-delete-user-data,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37874563.jpeg

The sentence, issued by a London court, is suspended for two years. Wright was found guilty of violating a court order by continuing to assert his identity as Nakamoto in legal claims. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) sued Wright, accusing him of ignoring a prior ruling that barred him from pursuing lawsuits related to his claims of being Bitcoin’s creator. In March, Judge Mellor had dismissed Wright’s claims, stating he was not Nakamoto and forbidding him from pursuing related cases in the UK or elsewhere. Despite this, Wright launched a $1.1 trillion legal claim over Bitcoin’s intellectual property in October, prompting COPA to act. Craig Wright’s claims have faced significant legal challenges throughout 2024. UK courts have repeatedly dismissed his evidence, labeling his cases as groundless. Wright attended his sentencing virtually from an undisclosed location in Asia and announced plans to appeal the verdict. However, he declined to disclose his current whereabouts. The controversy surrounding Nakamoto’s identity continues to capture global attention, especially as Bitcoin’s popularity has soared during its historic rally this year. HBO’s ""Money Electric"" documentary recently reignited debates, speculating that Canadian cryptographer Peter Todd might be Nakamoto. Todd has denied the allegations and reportedly gone into hiding after receiving threats and unwanted scrutiny. In October, the mystery deepened further when Stephen Mollah claimed to be Nakamoto during a press conference in London. However, Mollah’s declaration ended in chaos , as he failed to provide credible evidence, and technical issues undermined his claims. These incidents underscore the persistent intrigue and speculation surrounding Nakamoto’s identity. Wright’s sentencing highlights the legal and personal consequences of unproven claims about being Nakamoto. Popular entrepreneur Christen Ager-Hanssen commented on X (formerly Twitter), stating that Wright’s sentence demonstrates that truth matters and that justice can prevail. Ager-Hanssen also called for further investigation into Calvin Ayre’s alleged role in supporting Wright’s claims, as well as a CPS probe into possible perjury charges against Wright and his associate. The mystery of Bitcoin’s creator remains unresolved, with many individuals attempting to claim the identity over the years. These attempts often lead to public and legal troubles, as seen in Wright’s case. While the truth about Nakamoto continues to elude the world, Wright’s story serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of making unverified assertions in the public and legal arenas.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/craig-wright-gets-suspended-jail-term-over-false-bitcoin-claims,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37874393.jpeg

Welch, who gained fame through her podcast “Talk Tuah,” last communicated with her audience by stating she was “going to sleep,” shortly before the value of her memecoin plummeted by a staggering 95%. Investors Sue Hailey Welch Over Alleged Memecoin Fraud The fallout from the rapid decline in the Hawk Tuah token has been swift, with disappointed investors taking legal action against Welch and several associated entities. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of affected investors, accuses Welch, the Tuah The Moon Foundation, OverHere Ltd., its executive Clinton So, and coin promoter Alex Larson Schultz of orchestrating a fraudulent “rug pull.” Related Reading: Interest Rate Cut Impact: Bitcoin Price Reaction Unraveled With Future Projections According to court documents obtained by Newsweek, the complaint alleges that the “unlawful promotion and sale” of the Hawk Tuah memecoin resulted in significant financial losses, particularly impacting those new to cryptocurrency investing. The lawsuit emphasizes that many investors were attracted to the Hawk Tuah project due to Welch’s public endorsement and her influential role in its development roadmap. It states, “The rapid decline in the token’s value caused substantial damages to investors who relied on Welch’s participation and the project’s stated roadmap.” Initially, the Hawk Tuah token captured attention as part of a wave of community-driven memecoins, buoyed by Welch’s “aggressive promotion” across social media platforms and her podcast. However, allegations of mismanagement and deceptive practices soon surfaced after the token’s value collapsed almost overnight, erasing millions of dollars in investor funds. Insider Trading Allegations Bitcoinist reported two weeks ago that on-chain investigator Coffeezilla accused Hailey Welch and the Hawk Tuah team of scamming investors following the token’s launch. On November 26, Welch had announced her partnership with the Web3 platform OverHere to launch the Hawk Tuah memecoin, claiming it would “set to redefine the crypto space.” Upon its launch on December 4, the token’s market capitalization skyrocketed to $500 million, only to plummet 88% within minutes as major holders rapidly sold off their assets. As the token’s value collapsed, investors and market analysts raised alarms about potential insider trading and a coordinated rug pull orchestrated by the project’s creators. Many of the affected investors were Welch’s fans, many of whom were new to the crypto landscape. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts In the wake of the backlash, Welch revealed the token’s “Hawkanomics,” which indicated that only 2% of the total supply was allocated for public distribution, while 17% was designated for a “strategic allocation” that was fully unlocked at launch and allegedly funneled to insider wallets. During an X Space discussion, Coffeezilla confronted the Hawk Tuah team about over $1 million in fees generated from the token and questioned their handling of the situation. He suggested that the sell-off was not merely the result of market snipers but rather linked to insider trading related to the creators’ accounts. Despite the team’s denials, Coffeezilla criticized the launch as one of the worst he has reviewed, labeling the tokenomics as “horrible” and calling for accountability regarding the presale funds, which amounted to approximately $16.69 million.

37875405,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52625,1734683429,"Meme Coin Madness! Whales Snap Up 210 Million DOGE, Shiba Inu Burns 99% of Its Tokens. New Crypto Rollblock May Hit $8 Million by New Year!","Whales have been accumulating DOGE at its recent dip, while the SHIB community just proposed a crazy target to burn 99% of the token supply. These bullish factors could soon spark a renewed meme coin mania that could greatly benefit the Rollblock (RBLK) presale , a new GambleFi protocol on Ethereum. Let’s discover why analysts tout staggering returns for RBLK going into 2025. Rollblock’s (RBLK) presale surpasses $7.3 million The Rollblock presale has raised over $7.3 million by stage 9 , and there are clear catalysts to drive the assets past the $8 million finish line by year-end. This GambleFi protocol disrupts the $540 billion gambling industry with blockchain-powered fair gaming technology, AI-driven betting strategies, and copy-betting player initiatives. Further, users enjoy high payouts, transparent analytics of betting history, and swift deposits & withdrawals with 20+ crypto coins. What’s more, the Rollblock gambling ecosystem rewards players and investors with a profit-sharing model and token buyback program. A portion of the revenue generated on the Rollblock crypto casino is set aside for token repurchases. 60% of the tokens are burned, reducing the RBLK circulating token supply, and making RBLK a deflationary crypto asset. The remaining 40% are distributed to LNEX holders through the platform’s staking program, with investors earning passive income to the tune of 30% APY! Whale accumulation could spark the next DOGE rally After a massive rally to $0.48 in the past weeks, DOGE took a breather, retreating to trade at the $0.37 region. However, the DOGE meme coin frenzy is just about to reignite again as whales capitalize on the pullback to double up. Data from Santiment shows Dogecoin whales have accumulated the meme coin lately, scooping a staggering 210 million DOGE during the downturn. Such institutional-level interest is often a sign that big crypto players are anticipating a major move. The large cash influx could drive DOGE upwards to break barriers in the $0.48 region and head up to revisit its 2021 highs in the $0.7 zone. Is a 99% SHIB burn realistic? SHIB has a whopping circulating supply of 589 trillion, but the SHIB community is determined to embark on an ambitious goal to burn 99% of this supply. That would leave the network with about 5.4 trillion SHIB , pushing its price over 10,800% up to $0.000742 at the current market cap. Sadly, there’s still no clear way how the SHIB community would achieve a 99% token burn, and it could take centuries to incinerate such an enormous amount at the current burn rate. SHIB is currently trading at around $0.000027, a slight pullback from its recent upswing of $0.000033. Should you load RBLK at $0.0415? RBLK is expected to deliver mammoth returns once it launches in the open market. Tokens are currently selling for $0.0415 presale price, and it’s just a matter of days before the price jumps to $0.047. Rollblock is topping up new RBLK purchases with a 20% bonus, so race up and grab your share! Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

37877310,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321456,1734683404,Metaplanet Raises 9.5 Billion Yen for Accelerated Bitcoin Purchases Through Bond Issuance,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet Inc. has raised 9.5 billion yen ($60.6 million) through two tranches of bond issuance aimed at accelerating its Bitcoin purchases. The Tokyo-listed company announced it issued a 5 billion yen ($31.9 million) bond on Friday, following a 4.5 billion yen ($28.7 million) bond issuance earlier in the week. Both bonds are zero-interest and set to mature on June 16, 2025. New Funds to Allow Metaplanet Accelerate Bitcoin Plans According to Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, the funds will allow the company to expedite its planned 2025 Bitcoin acquisitions into the current fiscal year. The move is part of Metaplanet’s broader strategy to adopt Bitcoin as a key treasury reserve asset, a shift it first announced in May. As of December 18, the firm held approximately 1,142.287 BTC, valued at about $110.3 million at current market prices. Despite the ambitious move, Metaplanet’s stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 4.24% to close at 3,610 yen on Friday. *Metaplanet to issue 5.0 billion yen in Ordinary Bonds to Accelerate Bitcoin Purchases; Repayment to be made from Warrant Exercise Proceeds* pic.twitter.com/9Sr6a5kDkD — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 20, 2024 However, its stock price has seen a meteoric 2,023% increase year-to-date. Shares also began trading on the U.S. OTCQX market this week, closing down 9.96% on their first day, according to Google Finance. Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy mirrors moves by major firms like MicroStrategy, which remains the largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin with 439,000 BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries. Metaplanet Anticipates First Operating Profit in Seven Years Asreported, Metaplanet is poised to achieve its first consolidated operating profit in seven years, just months after incorporating Bitcoin into its balance sheet . The Tokyo-based firm announced earlier this week that it expects to generate 890 million Japanese yen ($5.8 million) in revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, a significant increase from the 261 million yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The company’s operating profit is projected to reach 270 million yen, a sharp turnaround from the 468 million yen loss it suffered last year. A substantial portion of Metaplanet’s revenue comes from its Bitcoin-related activities, particularly its strategy of selling Bitcoin put options. This approach generated 520 million yen in income, making it a key driver of the company’s improved financial outlook. Put options allow investors to sell an asset at a pre-agreed strike price, and Metaplanet earns a premium for each contract sold, regardless of whether the option is exercised. If exercised, the company can acquire Bitcoin at the agreed price, aligning with its broader strategy of accumulating the cryptocurrency. The firm’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset began in April, part of a shift aimed at hedging against currency depreciation. Beyond its Bitcoin-related activities, Metaplanet’s hotel business has also played a role in its improved financial performance. Through its subsidiary, Wen Tokyo Co., the company operates the Royal Oak Hotel in Tokyo’s Gotanda district. The combined success of its hotel operations and Bitcoin strategy has put the company on track to achieve profitability for the first time since 2017.

The ""maximum pain price"" is a key metric in these scenarios. It represents the level at which the most options expire worthless, often aligning with market movements. For Bitcoin, this level is $101,000 , while Ethereum’s is $3,700 . Current prices for both are below these thresholds, but the maximum pain theory suggests they may move closer to these levels as contracts expire. Market sentiment appears optimistic, as shown by put-to-call ratios. Bitcoin’s ratio is 0.87, and Ethereum’s is 0.48, both below 1. This indicates that more traders expect prices to rise. However, the large volume of expiring options could still lead to significant market fluctuations in the short term. Options expirations often bring increased volatility, as traders and institutions reposition themselves. Analysts point out that while these events can create temporary disruptions, markets tend to stabilize shortly afterward. There’s speculation that Bitcoin could recover and approach significant milestones, supported by these dynamics. This expiration comes after recent market pullbacks for both assets, but traders remain hopeful for potential recovery. With a large portion of options likely to expire worthless, there’s a chance the market could stabilize over the weekend. As traders navigate today’s expirations, the crypto market’s future direction may be influenced by how these adjustments unfold. While price swings are likely, the long-term outlook for both assets remains a focus for investors.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-and-ethereum-face-2-6b-options-expiry,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37874245.jpeg
37874228,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630913,1734683229,Ethereum price drop forces whales to sell ETH in millions to repay debts,"Ethereum (ETH) has experienced sharp declines in recent days, forcing some of the cryptocurrency’s largest holders to liquidate significant amounts of their holdings. According to market tracker LookonChain, the price of Ethereum has fallen by 18.35% from its Monday high of $4,109, forming a bearish engulfing pattern on the daily chart. According to recent updates, ETH has lost more than 7% today alone, and this has prompted whale holders to let go of a huge chunk of their holdings to repay debts. At press time, the second largest crypto by market cap is trading at $3,390, with its 24 hour trading volume going up by 14%, signaling a heightened market activity. Whales offload, buy millions in Ethereum holdings LookonChain reported that a whale deposited 22,746 ETH, valued at $77.7 million, to Binance in the early hours of Friday to withdraw stablecoins and repay debts on decentralized finance platforms Spark and Aave. In total, this whale has moved 31,968 ETH, worth approximately $108.3 million at current valuations, to Binance over the past two days. The recent price drop forced whales to sell $ETH to repay debts. A whale deposited 22,746 $ETH ($77.7M) to #Binance in the past 5 hours and withdrew stablecoins from #Binance to repay debts on #Spark and #Aave .

This individual subsequently withdrew $137.8 million worth of stablecoins from the exchange, likely for debt repayment. Within seven days leading up to December 18, Ethereum whales holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH collectively reduced their holdings from 13.47 million ETH to 13.41 million ETH. This sell-off represents 60,000 ETH offloaded, valued at more than $200 million. Source: IntoTheBlock According to CoinGlass data, Ethereum liquidations have surpassed $190 million in the last 24 hours, with long and short trading positions standing at $165 million and $25 million, respectively. The coin’s Open Interest (OI) percentage has declined by 7.4%, following the current crypto market trend, which is trading in the red. Despite this widespread selling activity, not all whales are taking bearish positions. World Liberty Finance , an entity reportedly associated with President-elect Donald Trump’s financial ventures, spent 2.5 million USDT to acquire 722 ETH on Thursday. After the $ETH price drop, #Trump 's World Liberty( @worldlibertyfi ) spent 2.5M $USDT to buy 722 $ETH again 2 hours ago. https://t.co/AmeIF2plRb pic.twitter.com/UwI88MfoUK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 20, 2024 Additionally, another prominent whale linked to Longling Capital has strategically purchased 6,000 ETH during the dip. Known for its precise market timing, this whale has reportedly accumulated profits of $83 million by capitalizing on Ethereum’s price fluctuations. Ethereum faces resistance at $4,000 Ethereum’s recent struggles highlight the challenges it faces in breaking past the $4,000 mark. The level has acted as a strong weekly resistance throughout 2024, with the cryptocurrency facing its third rejection at this price point this year alone. Source: TradingView Historically, the $4,000 resistance has been tested five times since 2021, but a sustained bullish breakout above this level remains elusive. Market data from CoinGlass shows that Ethereum futures open interest reached a record $28.70 billion on December 17, but has now dropped to $25 billion. While futures traders predominantly held long positions throughout November, sentiment has shifted with the recent price downturn. For the first time since November 6, the aggregated premium of futures positions has turned bearish, indicating a rise in short positions relative to long positions. This shift has added downward pressure on ETH prices, pulling them below the $4,000 threshold once again.

37875403,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52666,1734682752,"Trader Spent $27,100 Worth of XRP to Acquire 100 RLUSD","A trader experienced a substantial loss of $27,000 after exchanging 10,000 XRP tokens for 100 RLUSD, Ripple’s recently launched stablecoin . The incident, which occurred on Dec. 17, highlights the risks of acting impulsively in response to market hype. Ripple officially introduced RLUSD on Dec. 17, following regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The announcement sparked significant excitement across the Ripple community, potentially contributing to hasty trading decisions. Breakdown of the Loss Data from XRPL explorer Bithomp reveals that the ill-fated trade occurred at 13:00 UTC on Dec. 17. The trader placed an order to exchange 10,000 XRP for 100 RLUSD. At the time of the transaction, XRP was priced at $2.71, making the total value of the 10,000 XRP tokens approximately $27,100. Despite the high value of XRP during this rally, the trader received only 100 RLUSD, equivalent to $100, in return. Given RLUSD’s design as a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, its value does not fluctuate, leaving the trader with no chance of recovering the lost $27,000. Misconceptions About RLUSD The situation underscores widespread misconceptions surrounding RLUSD. Ripple CTO David Schwartz had previously warned that the stablecoin should not be seen as an investment vehicle. “Its value will always remain at $1,” Schwartz explained. These warnings followed speculation triggered by Xaman (formerly Xumm), a non-custodial XRPL wallet. Xaman had displayed a rate of $1,200 for 1 RLUSD, leading some users to believe XRP might experience a corresponding surge. Schwartz clarified that this rate reflected a specific order placed on the platform and did not represent RLUSD’s true value. The trader’s decision to exchange 10,000 XRP likely stemmed from similar misunderstandings. It appears the order was placed to purchase 1 RLUSD for 100 XRP—or approximately $271. The misstep demonstrates the potential financial consequences of failing to fully understand a token’s purpose or value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Stablecoin’s Intended Use Ripple introduced RLUSD to improve liquidity within its ecosystem, not as an investment opportunity. The stablecoin, like Tether (USDT) and other similar assets, is pegged to the US dollar and designed to maintain the $1 value. XRPL validator Vet and other community members have echoed these points, emphasizing RLUSD’s utility rather than its profit potential. Schwartz similarly noted that the stablecoin would not impact market prices but would instead enhance liquidity for cross-border payments and other transactions. Lessons from the Incident The $27,000 loss serves as a cautionary tale for investors about the importance of conducting thorough research and approaching new assets with caution. The hype surrounding RLUSD’s launch led to a costly misunderstanding for one trader, emphasizing the need for clarity and education in the evolving crypto space.

BUT – we are much closer to the top and the rally will not continue for as long as many analysts seem to believe.” Bitcoin is trading at $101,784 at time of writing. According to the economist, Bitcoin could plunge by around 84% from the current level after reaching the cycle peak. “Well – my target after blow-off top is approximately $16,000. Will be interesting.” Turning to the wider crypto asset market, Zeberg says that altcoins are on the cusp of a massive rally amid a declining level of Bitcoin dominance – the ratio of the market cap of Bitcoin relative to the market cap of all other crypto assets. Zeberg says , “Crypto is THIS close to taking off in a major way! The most explosive phase of the altcoin season is about to set in. It will create extreme euphoria and “experts” will be all over each other with bullish forecasts. BUT – this is the last blow-off phase which will last weeks.

IntelMarkets (INTL), Chainlink (LINK), Ondo (ONDO), and Solana (SOL) are gaining momentum and are predicted to perform strongly, making them some of the best bullish crypto choices for the upcoming year. Analysts are particularly optimistic about the potential of IntelMarkets due to its ongoing presale and strong tokenomics. Read on as we explore why these projects are among the best bullish crypto choices to watch as we move into the new year. IntelMarkets: The Best Bullish Crypto with AI, DeFi, and Blockchain Innovation Analysts are noting a surge of interest from both investors and traders in the new AI-driven platform, IntelMarkets (INTL) , which is quickly gaining traction for its unique fusion of DeFi, AI, and blockchain technology. This has positioned INTL as one of the best bullish crypto assets to consider in the market. A major factor behind its growing appeal is IntelMarkets’ innovative features, including perpetual futures trading contracts, dual-chain functionality, and an AI-powered self-learning bot. These capabilities provide users with the flexibility to choose their preferred blockchain network while enhancing trading efficiency. IntelMarkets operates on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, ensuring fast, economical transactions that allow users to unlock a broad spectrum of market opportunities, capitalizing on both traditional and innovative assets. Moreover, IntelMarkets offers a variety of asset pairs featuring well-established cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as emerging altcoins and specialized tokens.

Traders also gain from IntelMarkets’ powerful tools, including an AI-driven self-learning bot that automates repetitive tasks, expert strategy replication, AI-powered analytics, and access to over 1,000 technical analysis tools, further improving their trading experience. The Future of DeFi: Chainlink and VaultCraft’s Groundbreaking Partnership Chainlink continues to lead blockchain innovation with VaultCraft’s integration of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) across Arbitrum, Ethereum, and Optimism. This move strengthens Chainlink’s position as the gold standard for secure cross-chain connectivity, backed by level-5 security and the Risk Management Network, ensuring unparalleled safety for users. The collaboration boosts adoption, integrates VaultCraft into the Chainlink community, and positions Chainlink as a leader in capital market blockchain solutions. With CCIP driving demand for LINK, Chainlink emerges as the best bullish crypto to watch in 2025, offering innovative utility and growth potential for investors. In just three days, LINK saw a price increase of 3%, climbing from $28.48 to $29.41. Analysts remain optimistic about its altcoin potential, with LINK possibly reaching $35 by January 2025. Ondo’s Strategic Move: USDY Vault Boosts CeDeFi Adoption Ondo Finance recently announced the integration of USDY, its market-leading US Treasury-backed yieldcoin, onto BounceBit’s CeDeFi V2 platform, driving broader adoption of tokenized RWAs. BounceBit’s seamless vault interface now features a dedicated USDY vault, offering optimized yields through a simple, one-click process. This partnership boosts Ondo’s ecosystem by expanding USDY’s reach to global users, bridging traditional and decentralized finance. It enhances ONDO token utility and demand, making it a standout in the CeDeFi space. For investors seeking innovative opportunities, Ondo’s growth trajectory positions it as one of the best bullish crypto projects to watch in 2025. In the last six days, ONDO recorded a 37% increase, with prices rising from $1.498 to $2.059 between December 10 and December 16, 2024. Analysts suggest a continued upward trend, with ONDO potentially reaching $3 by January 2025. Solana Soars: $6 Billion in Trading Volume Marks a Major Milestone At the beginning of December 2024, Solana’s network experienced a remarkable surge in liquidity and trader activity, according to DeFiLlama. Daily trading volumes for SOL skyrocketed from $2.91 billion to an impressive $6 billion, marking the highest levels since November 2024. This uptick in activity reflects growing confidence among bullish investors, signaling strong potential for a sustained rally. With its recent momentum, Solana continues to position itself as one of the best bullish crypto projects to consider in the rapidly evolving market. In just six days, SOL experienced a price surge of 6%, with the token price moving from $204 to $218. Analysts are predicting further increases, with SOL potentially hitting $250 by January 2025. Why INTL, LINK, ONDO, and SOL are the Best Bullish Crypto Picks for 2025 The cryptocurrency market is filled with opportunities, and altcoins like INTL, LINK, ONDO, and SOL are among the best bullish crypto picks to consider for 2025. Analysts are asking investors to keep an eye on INTL as it possesses the highest potential to boost their portfolios in the coming year. INTL is now in Stage 8 of its public presale, with a token price of $0.073. As the presale advances, the DeFi coin is expected to launch at $0.110, presenting investors with the opportunity for a 50% return on investment. Having already raised over $4.1 million, analysts predict that this AI coin could generate a 100x return post-launch.

The announcement , which came on Dec. 19, was the culmination of an in-depth probe into whether the project was in compliance with EU data protection laws. For failing to meet the set privacy standards, the regulator has particularly homed in on World’s iris-based digital identity verification system. Data Deletion and Compliance Deadlines BayLDA ordered World to create a GDPR-compliant data deletion process within a month to give all users the full right to request data erasure. It also includes records gathered in the early phase of operation of Worldcoin due to a lack of legitimate legal basis for acquiring such data. Improving Privacy Rights for Users Michael Will, president of BayLDA, said the ruling ensures EU fundamental privacy rights are upheld in a legally and technologically highly complex case. “Users who entrusted Worldcoin with their iris data will now be completely free to avail themselves of their right to erasure,” Will observed. The ruling bolsters the ambitions of the GDPR, which sets the course for individual data sovereignty. Anonymization Clarification Sought by Worldcoin In response, World Foundation filed an appeal to shed light from the judiciary on whether its PETs meet EU standards for truly anonymizing data. World argues that there is no consistent definition of anonymization-a critical privacy protection tool within AI-driven innovation-under the GDPR. Data anonymization is key to being able to validate that someone is human without compromising privacy”, said Damien Kieran, chief legal officer at World. He added that ambiguous definitions weaken the EU’s regime to protect privacy effectively. Ongoing Compliance Challenges Despite halting operations in several EU countries to improve GDPR adherence, BayLDA found multiple compliance gaps. The authority called for stricter protocols, including explicit user consent for certain data-processing steps. It also reserved the option to investigate potential administrative violations further. Commitment to Privacy and Innovation The World Foundation reiterated commitments to regulatory collaboration, promising that it would address privacy concerns while continuing to drive innovation. It said that “clear GDPR standards are necessary to move technology forward in the privacy-first world”. World appeals a ruling to shape regulatory frameworks in a manner that protects human rights while supporting AI-driven advancements in verified digital identity.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | WLD,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/german-watchdog-orders-worldcoin-delete/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png
37873206,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375474,1734681258,Bitcoin Could Skyrocket by 25% in Days if History Repeats But There’s a Catch: Data,"Bitcoin’s massive rise from under $70,000 to over $108,000 within a month and a half after Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the US presidential elections left some investors outside the circle. However, the ever-volatile nature of BTC always leads to substantial corrections that provide opportunities for those who missed the initial train to get on board. In the past couple of days, bitcoin’s price tumbled by double-digits, which, according to Santiment, has made the crowd seek to buy the dip. Moreover, history shows that it could send BTC flying again. Is BTC About to Bounce? As the analytics platform noted, the last time these discussions exploded in a similar manner was in early August when the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled below $50,000. Just a few days later, though, the asset had climbed by over 25% to beyond $62,000. If history is to repeat itself now, even though BTC’s market cap is a lot higher, bitcoin could recover from its big retracement and head toward a new all-time high again of over $120,000. With Bitcoin falling as low as $95.5K today, the ratio of crypto discussions that are about buying crypto’s dip has reached its highest level in over 8 months. The last time we saw the crowd nearly this enthusiastic about dip buying was the major crash on August 4th. Since… pic.twitter.com/39NlpnGMCs — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 20, 2024 Not So Fast Although the ‘buy-the-dip’ history shows that BTC’s correction could be over, this narrative is not supported by other on-chain and technical metrics, such as one particular demand zone. IntoTheBlock posted even before bitcoin lost the $100,000 mark decisively yesterday that such an area had formulated at around $97,500, given the large number of investors purchasing at such prices more than 1.4 million BTC. These accumulations turned that level into an ‘important’ support zone, which has now been broken to the downside. Once such vital support lines are breached and investors who had entered recently see their positions in the red, at least on paper, many tend to dispose of their holdings, which leads to more intense selling pressure for the underlying asset. Will Bitcoin retrace below $100k? Interestingly, a significant demand zone has formed just under $100k. Over 1.45 million BTC was accumulated at an average price 97.5k, making this an important potential support zone. pic.twitter.com/vDcHEl8OKV — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 19, 2024 The post Bitcoin Could Skyrocket by 25% in Days if History Repeats But There’s a Catch: Data appeared first on CryptoPotato .",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-could-skyrocket-by-25-in-days-if-history-repeats-but-theres-a-catch-data/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37873206.jpeg

In an interview with Scott Melker, he said that here’s even talk about exempting the U.S.-based cryptocurrencies from capital gains tax. This move could create a major shift in how crypto is treated in the U.S. market. Despite XRP’s massive market cap, Yusko isn’t a fan. He believes XRP and Cardano lack real development. Unlike Circle’s stablecoin, which is backed by actual dollars, Yusko sees these coins as missing true innovation, even though they have high market value. Pro-Crypto Leadership: A Shift in Power Yusko also touched on Trump’s visit to Nashville, where he spoke directly to voters. He mentioned Trump’s promises, including firing SEC head Gary Gensler, and how Trump is under pressure to make moves, such as freeing Ross Ulbricht and creating a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Yusko believes the current U.S. leadership is largely supportive of crypto. Key figures like Scott Bessent and the new SEC head are crypto-friendly, which could lead to positive changes in the industry. It’s a shift that could help propel the crypto market forward. The Technologist Revolution: Billionaires Taking Control Yusko said that it’s not just Trump – the real story is the rise of “technologist billionaires.” These innovators are pushing for changes that benefit both the tech industry and the nation. It’s not about political parties anymore; it’s about the tech leaders who want to shape the future. With all these shifts in power, Yusko believes we’re entering a new phase for crypto, one driven by smart, tech-savvy leaders.

37873774,https://invezz.com/?p=2397068,1734680982,Why iDEGEN’s $7.3M presale might outshine Dogecoin and Turbo by 2025,"In just 23 days, iDEGEN , the latest entrant to the cryptocurrency market, amassed $7,299,582 during its presale. Built on Solana, a blockchain known for its speed and efficiency, iDEGEN employs an adaptive auction system that dynamically adjusts token prices based on demand. This innovation, coupled with a bold community-driven AI approach, has placed iDEGEN in a league of its own, challenging established meme coins like Dogecoin and Turbo. Unlike traditional meme coins, iDEGEN integrates artificial intelligence in an unprecedented manner. An autonomous AI agent, trained entirely by Crypto Twitter users, continuously learns and evolves. Its unique personality reflects the unfiltered ethos of its community, broadcasting real-time insights into memes, trading theories, and crypto trends. This dynamic interplay has ignited interest among traders seeking both novelty and functionality in their investments. iDEGEN vs Dogecoin and Turbo Dogecoin, a household name in the meme coin universe, has struggled to sustain its momentum. After touching a high of $0.48 in December 2024, Dogecoin’s value has slid to $0.31, reflecting a 12% weekly drop. Investor confidence in Dogecoin appears shaken, as the token has failed to recover amid bearish market trends. Turbo, another AI-themed meme coin, initially captured attention with its novel creation via ChatGPT. The coin surged into the top 10 meme coins by market cap, but its recent decline underscores its volatility. Priced at $0.0081 and with a market capitalization of $526.09 million, Turbo shows potential but lacks the groundbreaking adaptability that Idegen offers. Its hybrid narrative of AI and memes feels diluted compared to iDEGEN’s robust integration of real-time learning mechanisms and adaptive pricing models. In contrast, iDEGEN’s success is underpinned by its innovative auction system and scarcity mechanics. Tokens unsold during the presale phase will be burned, creating an artificial scarcity that could drive up prices. This approach appeals to investors seeking assets with deflationary potential, positioning iDEGEN as a forward-looking alternative to Dogecoin and Turbo. iDEGEN’s performance Since its presale, iDEGEN’s token price has surged from an initial $0.00011 to $0.216, a testament to its strong market demand. With $7.3 million already raised and unsold tokens set to be burned, the project’s scarcity model aligns with investor expectations of long-term value creation. As it prepares for its public launch on 1 January 2025, iDEGEN’s trajectory points towards sustained growth, driven by community-centric AI and adaptive pricing. For investors, the choice between iDEGEN’s, Dogecoin, and Turbo boils down to innovation, risk management, and long-term potential. While Dogecoin relies on its established brand and Turbo banks on its ChatGPT origins, iDEGEN offers a compelling blend of advanced technology and community-driven evolution. Its unique approach positions it as not just another meme coin but a dynamic player in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

The Fed’s hawkish FOMC has triggered the massive crypto sell-off. “Over bullish positioning” by investors is another reason for the crash. The crypto market had a massive crash, with Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $100,000 even after several attempts to keep the price above $103,000 in the past few days.

Users can no longer buy or sell inscription assets on the exchange, but they can still view their inscription assets and move them to other wallets. The exchange has halted support for Ordinals since April this year.

37872719,https://crypto.news/?p=14320931,1734680103,Bitcoin ETFs record $680m outflows as BTC dips below $96k,"Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States recorded $680 million in outflows on Dec. 19 as Bitcoin fell below $96k amid the Federal Reserve maintaining a cautious outlook on future interest rate cuts. According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs logged outflows of $680 million on Thursday, breaking a 15-day streak of inflows that had brought over $6.7 billion into the funds. Fidelity’s FBTC led the decline with $208.55 million exiting the fund, followed by Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, which recorded outflows of $188.6 million and $108.35 million, respectively. Other notable outflows included: Grayscale’s GBTC: $87.86 million Bitwise BITB: $43.61 million Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO: $25.97 million VanEck’s HODL: $10.91 million Valkyrie’s BRRR: $8.19 million Amidst the sell-off, WisdomTree’s BTCW stood as an outlier, attracting a modest $2.05 million in inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT and two other BTC ETFs reported no changes in flows for the day. Despite the outflows, trading activity in Bitcoin ETFs surged, with total trading volume reaching $6.31 billion, a notable increase from the previous day’s $5.86 billion. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) fall below $96,000—down 4.4% at $96,751 at the time of reporting—was largely attributed to the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. While the Fed implemented a widely anticipated 0.25% rate cut, bringing this year’s cumulative cuts to 1%, officials signaled a cautious approach moving forward. Only two additional rate cuts are planned for 2025, with inflation projected to meet the 2% target by 2026 or 2027. This hawkish tone dampened investor sentiment, leading to a 4.5% drop in the broader cryptocurrency market, which stood at $3.51 trillion.

Grayscale’s ETHE accounted for the majority, with $58.13 million exiting the fund. Bitwise’s ETHW, Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust, and Invesco’s QETH also saw outflows of $6.78 million, $3.18 million, and $2.36 million, respectively. In contrast, Fidelity’s FETH and VanEck’s ETHV managed to attract inflows of $5.05 million and $4.94 million, partially offsetting the broader trend. Despite the daily outflows, cumulative net inflows for Ethereum ETFs remained positive at $2.4 billion. Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price reflected the bearish sentiment, dropping 8.1% over the past day to $3,378 per coin.

37872650,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395389,1734679979,Tornado Cash Co-Founder Fights Back: Will Roman Storm’s Charges Be Dropped?,"The post Tornado Cash Co-Founder Fights Back: Will Roman Storm’s Charges Be Dropped? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Roman Storm, the co-founder of Tornado Cash, is pushing to have criminal charges against him dropped, following a major win in court. The Fifth Circuit Appeals Court recently ruled that the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were unlawful . This ruling could be a game-changer for Storm’s case, which involves serious charges, including money laundering. Moreover, the case went all in favor of Tornado Cash the sanctions helped the native token Torn jump 700% last month. The Court Ruled Out Sanction Clause In its ruling , the appeals court made a bold statement by declaring that Treasury’s sanctions on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts were unlawful. As per the ruling, Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed or stopped by anyone, not even the creators. The court also clarified that these contracts are not “property” under U.S. law, so they can’t be blocked or sanctioned by the government. With this key factor, Storm demanded that the court should also drop the severe charges of money laundering, especially the charges that he conspired to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which forced U.S. sanctions. Storm’s Argument: No Control, No Crime In the quest to fight back, Storm is using this ruling to argue that the charges against him are flawed. He insists that Tornado Cash isn’t a financial institution and that it became immutable back in May 2020—long before the alleged money-laundering accusations. Interestingly, he says there was no way he could have conspired to launder money using a protocol that couldn’t be controlled by anyone, including him. So in simple terms, there is no concrete evidence to prove that he did the money laundering using the platform. The case has drawn massive outrage and initially, the lawsuit was filed by the Tornado Cash users, backed by Coinbase , against the U.S. Treasury and its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Although the users initially lost the court case, the ruling was overturned in November 2023, giving Tornado Cash supporters a big win. The case is also a reflection of how the decentralized platforms are treated by US law agencies. The developer’s attempt to challenge the agencies will surely bring some immutable change for future cases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk as House Speaker?

Semenov is still on the run. The third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in the Netherlands in 2022. Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2022 for approving unverified transactions and allowing cybercriminals to steal over $7 billion since 2019. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Even analysts predict an 880% return before the market debut, and RBLK has done 315% already. A key factor behind Rollblock’s growing appeal is its commitment to fairness and security. Rollblock leverages blockchain technology to provide provably fair odds to ensure every transaction is encrypted and secure from manipulation. In addition, Rollblock offers long-term benefits for investors through a revenue-sharing model and staking. This has made Rollblock a compelling opportunity for the whole crypto market . What’s even better? The presale price is an enticingly low $0.0415. Cardano Bitcoin bridge fuel whale accumulation despite SEC lawsuit FUD Rollblock’s rise to the limelight has proven how much FOMO the crypto market is experiencing right now. Another crypto that is getting a great share is the Ouroborus-based PoS network, Cardano . Despite a recent 16% pullback from its 24-month high of $1.25, Cardano is experiencing more intense demand due to its recent ecosystem development. The recent Cardano -Bitcoin bridge announced by Emurgo and BTCOS has incited FOMO . The pivotal step will open Cardano ‘s DeFi to Bitcoin’s $2 trillion ecosystem. Whales have gone on a buying spree despite lingering SEC-related FUD. However, the fundamentals are still perfect. TVL and ecosystem activities have risen to a new ATH. Is BNB the best bet in the next crypto market rally? The crown jewel of the Binance ecosystem is not left out, either. Ethereum is drawing a step closer to the $4k mark again, and BNB ‘s movement is hinting at the reality of a new altcoin season. Earlier this month, BNB posted a powerful surge to a new high. Despite the recent dip, BNB still stands as an outperformer against major alts. Analysts point to the Binance ecosystem’s strength as the driving force. TVL has soared to $5.8B, and daily activities user stats are inching closer to a new high. Beyond this, BNB ‘s resilience makes it a crypto market leader and an excellent bet amid the FOMO . Conclusion Every dip is an opportunity for savvy investors. The bull run FOMO has kept them on their feet, and most of them aren’t holding back after Cardano and BNB ‘s recent pullbacks. Amidst the market recovery, Rollblock continues to steal the crypto market spotlight. With its $7.5 million raised and GambleFi innovation, Rollblock offers a unique blend of gaming ingenuity and investor incentives driving unprecedented demand.

37872581,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665003,1734679845,Solana Holds Monthly Support As Network Activity Grows – Time For A Breakout?,"Solana faced heightened volatility yesterday, dropping 7% following the Federal Reserve’s announcement of a 25 basis point rate cut and fewer projected cuts for 2024. Despite the sell-off, Solana’s price action remains resilient as it managed to hold above a critical support level, reinforcing confidence in its ability to weather macroeconomic shifts. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? While the market reacted to the Fed’s cautious tone, Solana’s on-chain metrics tell a more optimistic story. The number of daily transactions on the Solana network has surged, nearing 67 million, reflecting growing adoption and sustained network activity. This robust transaction volume highlights Solana’s position as a leading blockchain platform, with developers and users continuing to rely on its scalability and efficiency. Analysts suggest that holding above its key support level could position SOL for a strong rebound, particularly if broader market conditions stabilize. The increased on-chain activity adds to this bullish outlook, signaling that long-term fundamentals remain intact. Solana Holding Key Demand Solana demonstrates resilience in the face of market turbulence, holding above key demand levels around $210 following yesterday’s sell-off triggered by the Federal Reserve’s policy announcements. This critical support level reinforces bullish sentiment for the asset, with many analysts eyeing a breakout on the horizon. Top analyst Jelle recently provided a compelling technical analysis on X, noting that Solana successfully took out the lows, maintained its position above monthly and weekly support levels, and continued to trade within its falling wedge pattern. According to Jelle, this setup suggests a breakout is imminent, with Solana targeting new all-time highs soon. Supporting this optimistic outlook, on-chain metrics paint a promising picture for Solana’s network activity. Ali Martinez shared data showing the Solana network nearing 67 million daily transactions, underscoring strong adoption and user engagement. This heightened network activity highlights Solana’s utility and strengthens the foundation for sustained price growth. Related Reading: XRP Consolidation Could End Once It Clears $2.60 – Top Analyst Expects $4 Soon If Solana holds above the $210 level in the coming days, it could trigger a significant rally as bullish momentum builds. Traders and investors are closely watching the asset’s price action for signs of a decisive move, with the combination of strong technical and on-chain indicators pointing toward a potential surge to new highs. Price Action: Liquidity Resting Above Solana is trading at $210, a key level it has held for several days despite broader market volatility. This price point demonstrates solid demand, but holding this level alone won’t ignite the next rally. A decisive push above $240 is critical for Solana to regain bullish momentum. This move would signal renewed strength and pave the way for higher price targets. A crucial intermediate step lies at the $225 mark. If Solana can reclaim this level with conviction, it would likely confirm a bullish trend and set the stage for further upward momentum. This could attract additional buying interest as traders and investors interpret the move as a signal of strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? Failing to break above these resistance levels, however, may keep Solana range-bound and limit its ability to capitalize on the recent support it has established. As market conditions continue to evolve, Solana’s ability to push past these key thresholds will determine whether it transitions into a stronger upward trajectory or remains stuck in consolidation.

37872718,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630903,1734679843,L2BEAT announces framework changes: L2s will face tougher rules in 2025,"According to L2BEAT, big changes are coming to how we think about layer 2 (L2) projects, the group of projects that use Ethereum’s blockchain to handle more activity. Right now, the category has over 120 L2 projects and holds more than $50 billion in total value locked (TVL). For years, L2s were mainly judged on how close they were to becoming fully decentralized. However, as L2s have grown, the security risks have become more apparent. Many projects lack proof systems and rely on centralized setups and this means that user funds are vulnerable. To address these issues, L2BEAT is rolling out a new framework to separate truly secure L2s from weaker alternatives. According to L2BEAT, these updates are expected to improve user security and transparency. L2BEAT is proposing three big changes According to L2BEAT, three big changes are coming to the ecosystem. The first will be the “Others” category. Projects without proper proof systems or sufficient data availability (DA) guarantees will now be classified under the new “Others” category . This group includes chains like Polygon PoS and certain OP Stack rollups that fail to meet the updated standards. Previously, these projects were considered L2s, but their setups often rely on centralized control or weak DA committees. Chains will also have to set up mandatory proof systems. A secure rollup is nothing without the right proof system, as that will allow permissionless exits and protect user funds even if permissioned actors become unavailable. L2BEAT now requires all rollups (a specific type of L2) to have these proof systems. Without one, they simply won’t be considered a proper rollup anymore. There are projects like StarkNet that already use proof systems to verify every state transition on Ethereum. Alt-DA L2s (like validiums and optimiums) must also meet stricter requirements for data availability guarantees. This includes having decentralized DA committees or proper DA attestation bridges. Many existing projects depend on small, centralized committees or external networks without proper guarantees, creating potential risks for users. L2BEAT said that projects have six months to make the necessary improvements to meet these new standards. So, by the middle of 2025, it expects them to have added proof systems and improved data security or face reclassification. There’s also an offer on grounds where L2BEAT will work with these teams to help them through the process. Community support is key Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, is fully on board with these stricter rules for L2 projects. Starting in 2025, he’ll only publicly support projects that meet the higher security standards (classified as Stage 1 or higher). This is a clear message to developers that security and decentralization need to be top priorities. “The era of rollups being glorified multisigs is coming to an end. The era of cryptographic trust is upon us,” said Buterin. The Ethereum community itself also plays a huge role in all of this. It starts making the space safer for everyone when it begins to only actively support projects that meet the new standards and raises questions about those that don’t. According to L2BEAT, it is not slowing down either. Instead, it will double its efforts to monitor and review proof systems in 2025. This means that it won’t just be looking to see if a project has a proof system but also checking how good and reliable those systems are. Initiatives like the ZK Catalog will help it do this more thoroughly. All of this ties into Ethereum’s bigger vision of a world of decentralized and secure L2s. It all starts by holding projects accountable and raising the bar for security so people can truly trust the technology they use Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | OP,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/l2beat-framework-l2s-tougher-rules-2025/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37872718.jpeg

The recently launched altcoin has attracted the attention of more crypto traders following the listing on major crypto exchanges led by Binance . According to the latest market data, the Usual token had a volume-to-market cap ratio of about 222 percent, after hitting a fully diluted valuation of about $6.3 billion. The highly liquid altcoin has attracted more than $1.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), through its USDO Stablecoin. Why Usual Protocols Matter a Ton The Usual protocol debuted as a secure and decentralized fiat stablecoin issuer, which redistributes ownership and governance through the USUAL token. The Usual protocol aggregates the growing RWA industry from leading entities led by BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, and Hashnote among others.

From a technical analysis standpoint, USUAL price has been forming a rising wedge, as the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers in overbought territory of above 90 percent. Amid heightened greed for the USUAL token, a potential correction could push the altcoin toward the support level of around 65 cents. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37873783,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321438,1734679744,Hashdex and Franklin Templeton Secure SEC Approval for Bitcoin-Ether ETFs,"The SEC on Thursday finally approved the first spot ETFs that combine Bitcoin and Ethereum , after months of extended reviews. On Dec. 19, the agency approved Hashdex’s Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF , allowing it to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. At the same time, it authorized Franklin Templeton’s Franklin Crypto Index ETF for listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Both indexes will hold spot Bitcoin and spot Ether directly. The Franklin Crypto Index ETF will track the Institutional Digital Asset Index, designed to reflect the performance of digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ether. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will follow Bitcoin and Ether as part of the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. Market-Cap Weighted Bitcoin-Ether ETFs Set for January Debut Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted a January launch for both funds. He said that these ETFs are market-cap weighted, with around 80% allocated to Bitcoin and 20% to Ethereum. The spot bitcoin/ether combo ETFs have been approved by SEC (as predicted). Launch likely in January. They’re mkt cap weight so 80/20 btc/eth approx. Notable that Hashdex & Frankie are first. Good for them. https://t.co/o2ri3XpqZi — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 20, 2024 The approvals came from amended filings where the Trusts’ structure and terms mirrored previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ether ETPs under earlier SEC orders. The SEC also determined that the spot Bitcoin market closely aligns with the CME Bitcoin futures market, while the spot Ether market shows a similar correlation with the CME Ether futures market. Based on this correlation and its analysis, the SEC concluded that the surveillance-sharing agreements between the Exchanges and the CME could effectively detect and prevent fraudulent or manipulative activities tied to these proposals. Additionally, the SEC confirmed that the proposals met the Exchange Act’s standards, including rules to prevent fraud and manipulation, safeguard investors and support public interest. Hashdex Eyes Broader Market Appeal With Multi-Asset ETF Hashdex earlier announced that its multi-asset ETF will initially focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum, with plans to potentially add Solana and Cardano in the future. By diversifying the ETF’s holdings across several major digital assets, the firm aims to minimize the volatility often associated with single-asset ETFs. This diversified strategy could attract a broader audience, appealing to both risk-averse investors and those seeking broader exposure to the digital asset market. ETFs have become increasingly popular because they offer a simple and regulated way to invest in a variety of assets. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, said it would be interesting to see if BlackRock or other firms might adopt a similar approach and introduce comparable ETFs. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” he said.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-pepe-and-dogecoin-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

X account, hacked to promote a stablecoin","Vivek Ramaswamy’s X account, the co-leader of the US government’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), was reportedly hacked. The breach led to the dissemination of false information about a purported partnership between D.O.G.E. and stablecoin project USUAL, resulting in a temporary surge in the price of the token. Through his official account on X (formerly Twitter), Ramaswamy allegedly announced a strategic collaboration between D.O.G.E and USUAL, an issuer of fiat-backed real world asset (RWA) stablecoins. According to the fraudulent post , the partnership aimed to leverage crypto initiatives to support the Donald Trump administration’s goal of reducing the federal fiscal deficit. It further claimed that the collaboration would enhance governmental transaction efficiency and promote fiscal responsibility. Fake announcement taken down, USUAL experiences price surge The announcement quickly drew attention and caused the price of $USUAL to spike by 31.08% to $1.61. Its market capitalization also surged by 38.73% to $720.2 million, although its 24-hour trading volume fell by 7.76% to $1.6 billion, per CoinMarketCap data . USUAL price spike – Source: CoinMarketCap However, the information was soon debunked as false, with Ramaswamy’s team confirming that his account had been hacked. The post was subsequently removed, and the team initiated swift action to regain control. Source: X James Fishback, founder of Invest Azoria, publicly clarified the situation, labeling the partnership claims as a scam. “I just spoke with Vivek. He has been hacked. He is locked out of his account. This is a scam,” Fishback wrote on X. Vivek’s influence on the government, which involves co-leading D.O.G.E. with billionaire Elon Musk, is likely the reason why hackers targeted his account. He is currently one of the “most watched” personalities, and he is at the center of Trump’s administration critics and supporters. December mauled with fake Social media crypto promotions Social media account hacks promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes have become increasingly prevalent. These incidents often exploit public trust to orchestrate pump-and-dump schemes. Earlier this week, Anthropic ’s X account was similarly compromised, with hackers using the platform to promote a fake token called ‘CLAUDE.’ The fraudulent post about CLAUDE claimed the token would incentivize AI and crypto projects and included a wallet address for “investors.” The tweet remained live for approximately 30 minutes before being removed. On-chain data revealed that the attackers collected around $100,000 from speculative investors. Further analysis showed the hackers purchased 10% of the CLAUDE token’s supply across multiple wallets and quickly dumped their holdings for profit. The scammers had also falsely claimed the token’s focus was on AI agents, capitalizing on the growing interest in AI-related projects. The Anthropic (Claude) Twitter is likely hacked. Don't interact with any links, don't buy the token. — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 Celebrity Accounts Targeted for Scams This month, several high-profile figures have also been targeted. Canadian rapper Drake’s X account was compromised on December 15, with attackers promoting a meme coin called Anita. The token, purportedly tied to Drake’s upcoming Anita Max Wynn tour, generated $4.9 million in trading volume within hours, driven by his 39 million followers. Source: X The post claimed the token was developed in collaboration with Stake, a betting platform Drake is known to endorse. The surge in trading volume saw over 7,000 buy orders before blockchain analysts, including Zachxbt, identified the token as a scam. Other celebrities have experienced similar breaches. Cardi B and Doja Cat’s accounts were hacked in December 2024, while TikTok star Halley Welch, known for her viral “Hawk Tuah” video, is facing lawsuits after promoting the HAWK token. The token soared to a market cap of over $400 million before collapsing, leaving investors and Welch’s followers with significant losses. Welch has yet to respond to the rug pull allegations.

On Dec. 18, the SEC greenlighted the crypto index ETF proposal from Franklin Templeton, allowing it to trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The following day, the commission approved Hashdex’s crypto index ETF, which is set to trade on the Nasdaq stock market. Franklin Templeton’s proposal was granted “accelerated approval” after its updated filing met the necessary requirements and was deemed “substantially similar” to previously approved spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products. Crypto index ETFs track the performance of multiple cryptocurrencies, offering investors diversified exposure to the digital asset market through a single investment vehicle. It replicates the performance of an underlying index by holding the same assets in similar proportions. Hashdex’s Crypto Index ETF will track the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, while Franklin Templeton’s product mimics the performance of the Institutional Digital Asset Index, both of which primarily focus on spot Bitcoin and Ether. Franklin Templeton submitted its filing for the Franklin Crypto Index ETF in August, while Hashdex initially filed its S-1 in June and later submitted an amended application on Nov. 25. You might also like: Franklin Templeton crypto index ETF delayed by SEC The SEC had previously requested more time to evaluate both proposals, citing the need for a thorough assessment. Hashdex and Franklin Templeton addressed these concerns by submitting revised filings, which the commission, in its Dec. 19 notice , stated were consistent with regulatory requirements designed to prevent fraud and manipulation, protect investors, and ensure the integrity of the market. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the funds are “likely” to go live in January, with Bitcoin making up about 80% and Ether 20% of the holdings. With the first crypto index funds approved, experts like ETF Store President Nate Geraci believe more issuers will follow suit, anticipating “meaningful demand” for such products as advisors seek diversification. Last month, Bitwise filed a proposal with the SEC to launch a spot Bitcoin and Ether ETP on the NYSE Arca. The fund aims to provide investors with balanced exposure to the two largest crypto assets in an accessible format, according to a Nov. 26 statement from the asset manager. These developments coincide with upcoming leadership changes at the SEC , as Chair Gary Gensler has announced his resignation, effective January 20, 2025, the day President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office.

37871333,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395373,1734677210,Crypto Hacks in 2024: Centralized Exchanges Are Now the Top Targets for Cybercriminals,"The post Crypto Hacks in 2024: Centralized Exchanges Are Now the Top Targets for Cybercriminals appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The 2024 Chainalysis Crypto Crime Report underscores a troubling reality: The crypto loss growth was significantly marginal with the total amount lost to crypto hacks reaching $2.2 billion, 21% higher than in 2023. 303 cases of crypto theft were noticed in 2024 while there were fewer of 282 cases in 2023. This is the fifth consecutive year where the crypto theft figure has exceeded $1 billion, which simply highlights the dangers of embracing crypto assets as they become mainstream. The Reason Why North Korea Dominates the Cybercrime World More specifically, North Korean hackers contributed to $ 1.34 billion of the total simulated funds that were stolen within forty-seven attacks, more than double the $660.5 million stolen in 2023. These exploits which constituted 61% of all the thefts show that Pyongyang has developed sophisticated cyber techniques to finance state activities such as weapon development. However, from July 2024 North Korea’s activity reduced by 53.7 %, probably due to geopolitical factors such as the Putin Kim Jong Un Summit Meet. A Shift in Hacker Targets and Gradual Change in Their Ways One could also notice the change of targets in 2024. The decentralized finance platforms majorly led earlier years, while this year, the centralized services rose to the trends in Q2 and Q3. Some of them were the $305 million DMM Bitcoin exchange attack in Japan and India’s WazirX which was attacked for $234.9 million . The lack of proper management of private keys, which made up 43.8% of stolen funds, was a commonly used tactic by hackers. Money laundering also became more sophisticated when more hackers started using bridges and mixing services to cover their tracks. For instance, while extorting DMM Bitcoin, cybercriminals used mixers and multiple intermediate accounts before the money reached inconspicuous markets. Strengthening Crypto Security To progress, the current crypto industry has to enhance security approaches, increase private key security, and engage with both the government and private players. Amid evolving rules and oversight, protection of customer’s assets and sound operation of the digital marketplace will continue to be critical to maintaining confidence in Crypto world. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The latest investment means that the country holds a total of 5,980 Bitcoins. The purchase comes only a few days after the country acquired a $1.4 billion development loan from the IMF. To secure the IMF deal, the country agreed to slow down on some of its crypto policies, especially the one targeting its digital wallet, Chivo. El Salvador agreed to retire or sell its digital wallet. El Salvador has been making huge gains in the reserve’s value. The Nayib Bukele portfolio tracker , which has been monitoring Bitcoin purchases, reports unrealized gains of over $125 million. This is almost 91.54% growth in reserve value. According to the tracker, the reserve is making high profits on purchases made during bear markets, when prices were as low as $19,000. El Salvador walks the talk as they continue to buy Bitcoins Although people thought the IMF agreement would slow down the country’s quest for BTC, it won’t. El Salvador had clarified that it would keep buying and holding Bitcoin. El Salvador’s national Bitcoin office director, Stacy Herbert, wrote on X that Bitcoin would remain legal tender in the Central American country and that the government would keep adding to its strategic reserves. Earlier, Eugene Epstein, the head of trading and structured products for North America at Moneycorp in New Jersey, felt El Salvador’s announcement was a PR gimmick. He said the announcement might have been a way to counter negative throwback, but now that they are buying, it means that cryptocurrency has become their way. Did the IMF intend to control the El Salvador BTC model? There was much speculation when El Salvador agreed to amend its crypto policies. Some even felt that the IMF was arm-twisting Salvador for the development loan they requested. Yet, the latest development is a testament that El Salvador’s journey to accumulate Bitcoin is in progress. Most people are worried about the risks associated with BTC and feel it’s a huge gamble for governments to adopt crypto as a legal tender. However, crypto enthusiasts have been encouraging the adoption , insisting that the reward outweighs risks by far.

It seems Powell’s comments made during the latest FOMC meeting have scared US investors as they pulled over $670 million from the spot Bitcoin ETFs within just a day. Red Record After slashing the key interest rates by another 25 basis points, Fed Chair Powell warned that 2025 might not see as many reductions due to the alarming numbers on the inflation front. To make things worse for BTC and the altcoins, he added that the central bank is not allowed to buy and store bitcoin for itself, which contrasts with one of Donald Trump’s many pro-crypto promises . The effects were immediate as the primary cryptocurrency’s price tumbled from over $105,000 to $98,000 immediately on Wednesday evening. After jumping to almost $103,000 on Thursday, the bears resumed control of the market and pushed it south to a multi-day low of under $96,000, leaving over a billion in liquidations. This came during the US trading hours. Data from FarSide indicates that US investors indeed got scared for their allocations into riskier assets like BTC and started to pull funds out of the Bitcoin ETFs. In fact, December 19 turned out to be the worst day in terms of daily outflows in the ETFs’ nearly year-long history. $671.9 million was withdrawn from the financial vehicles in total, with Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s BTC leading the pack – $208.5 and $188.6 million, respectively. Even BlackRock’s IBIT, which continues to shatter records , couldn’t attract any fresh funding but at least didn’t see any major withdrawals, ending the day at $0.0. Ethereum ETFs in Red, Too The spot Ethereum ETFs were on a roll for nearly a month, as they didn’t see a single net outflow day since November 21. However, the landscape around them changed as well, with investors pulling $60.5 million. Although the amount is more than 10 times lower than that of the Bitcoin ETFs, ETH’s price wasn’t spared. The asset is down by over 9% in the past day and struggles at $3,350 after its latest rejection at $4,000.

Recently, the nation’s Bitcoin Office announced a $1 million addition to its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This bold strategy seems to be paying off, as El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio has surged by 133%, now valued at an impressive $632 million. What drives this relentless commitment to Bitcoin despite international pressure? $1 Million Bitcoin Purchase El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office shared on social media that $1 million worth of Bitcoin was added to the country’s reserves. Reports confirm that a government-linked wallet purchased 11 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $1.07 million, further boosting the nation’s holdings. This acquisition aligns with President Nayib Bukele’s ongoing plan to purchase 1 Bitcoin daily. pic.twitter.com/w9FrMmCkwi — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) December 16, 2024 This consistent effort highlights El Salvador’s strong belief in Bitcoin as a key part of its financial strategy. Bitcoin Portfolio Hits $632 Million President Bukele proudly announced that El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have reached $632 million, marking a 133% increase from their original value. Starting with 5,966 Bitcoins worth $270 million, the portfolio has grown significantly as Bitcoin’s price rose above $106,000 per coin. By steadily increasing its Bitcoin reserves, El Salvador is strengthening its presence in the global cryptocurrency market and banking on greater returns in the future. Understanding IMF’s Concerns El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy has drawn both support and criticism. Recently, with Bitcoin’s price falling below $100,000, the IMF reiterated its warnings, urging the country to limit its cryptocurrency investments. However, El Salvador has remained firm in its approach. Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, responded to the IMF’s concerns on X (formerly Twitter), emphasizing that Bitcoin will remain legal tender in the country. She also confirmed the government’s commitment to adding more Bitcoin to its reserves.

37870869,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665261,1734676225,"As Bitcoin Reclaims $100,000, Warning Signs Emerge from Long-Term Investors","Before yesterday’s plunge, Bitcoin recent rally was able to propel the asset to a new all-time high of $108,000, marking another significant milestone in its upward trajectory. However, according to latest analysis, this notable price surge is accompanied by signs of potential market volatility, as long-term holders begin to exhibit selling activity. Attention has been turned to the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric, a critical tool for assessing the behavior of long-term Bitcoin holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks ATH Pushing Back Into Price Discovery – BTC To $130K? What Do Long-Term Holders Currently Signal? The Binary CDD metric tracks the activity of long-term holders by measuring the number of “coin days” destroyed relative to the total supply. When this metric spikes, it often indicates increased selling pressure from long-term investors. According to a CryptoQuant analyst, ShayanBTC, the Binary CDD metric has recently recorded a sharp increase, coinciding with Bitcoin’s new price high. Historically, such spikes in this metric have been precursors to market corrections, suggesting that these holders are taking advantage of current price levels to reduce their exposure. Shayan added that the long-term holders actions often serve as a barometer for broader market sentiment. The recent surge in the Binary CDD metric suggests that these holders might view the peak above $108,000 as a strategic exit point. If this selling pressure intensifies, it could lead to heightened market volatility and potentially trigger a price correction. Bitcoin Market Outlook Bitcoin has recorded a rollercoaster move in the past day. Particularly, following the FOMC news outcome yesterday along with the speech from Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve of the United States, Bitcoin saw a significant plunge in its price dropping to as low as the $98,000 level. However, the latest price action has been quite interesting as BTC is showing a rebound. In the early hours of Thursday, Bitcoin saw a recovery in price after reclaiming the $100,000 to trade as high as above $105,000. Currently, Bitcoin has seen a retrace back to a price of $100,718, at the time of writing, marking a 3.5% decrease in the past day and roughly 6.6% reduction away from its all-time high (ATH). Meanwhile, adding to Shayan’s narrative, another CryptoQuant analyst, Onatt, highlighted additional market indicators that hint at potential turbulence. The Coinbase Premium Index, which tracks the price difference between Coinbase and other exchanges, is currently in negative territory, indicating increased selling pressure.

37871931,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52616,1734676209,How to Avoid Chainlink And Toncoin Volatility: Back This Crypto Presale Before Its Price Jumps!,"Chainlink and Toncoin have embarked on an amazing crypto bull run for the last couple of months. But these days, LINK and TON have succumbed to volatility. At the same time, Rollblock , a soaring crypto presale , is hitting new heights and is set to skyrocket any time soon. Hopping into this presale now might well be the best decision any crypto investor could make today. Why Rollblock keeps attracting crypto investors It is rare to see a crypto project rise from nothing and grow into a behemoth right before your eyes. This happened for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and even BNB. They have grown from just a few cents to thousands of dollars per token. Imagine witnessing these meteoric rises and not partaking in them – the regret of many crypto investors out there! The smarter ones want to avoid a repeat situation, and that’s exactly why they’re diving into the Rollblock presale . But what is Rollblock, and what does it offer? Rollblock is a state-of-the-art online crypto casino. However, unlike most online casinos, it is powered by blockchain, which means its records are immutable and fully visible. This greatly reduces room for manipulation, making it a 100% trustworthy platform for online gamers. Even now, Rollblock is home to thousands of active users, and the number will only go higher with time. Since its RBLK token is directly linked to the platform’s growth, experts predict the price will explode as the project hits the mainstream. The good news is that Rollblock is still in presale , and is available for just $0.0415. The token won’t stay at that price level forever, and so many investors are entering the presale sooner than later. Toncoin succumbs to volatility Toncoin is the native token on The Open Network ( TON ), a framework that is specially designed for the launch of dApps for Telegram. Owing to its big user base, TON rode the 2024 crypto bull run and peaked in April and June. But since that time, TON has gradually depreciated as it succumbed to market forces and uncertainties about its future. TON had a mini rally in late November and appreciated in a remarkable manner but several price corrections saw it tumble down again. TON is trading around the $5 price level, but who knows how far it could fall? Will Chainlink weather the storm? Chainlink differs from other projects in that it is an extremely important oracle for the smooth operation of smart contracts. But this importance is yet to be translated into LINK’s price. Like other tokens, LINK appreciated remarkably well in early November, but Chainlink’s price performance since then has fluctuated wildly, albeit in small leaps. A more steep drop in the last week suggests Chainlink might go through a major drop, which has got LINK holders looking for greener pastures. Join Rollblock. Avoid Chainlink and Toncoin volatility Rollblock has appreciated by over 315% since its debut and is billed to rise by a lot more before the presale ends. It’s a revolutionary movement surging through the GambleFi space, which is worth over $540 billion and growing. Taking a chunk of this market share would send RBLK to the moon, and jumping on its presale now is the smartest choice for maximizing potential profits. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

37870858,https://coinpaper.com/6656/investors-sue-hawk-meme-coin-team-after-massive-losses,1734676163,Investors Sue HAWK Meme Coin Team After Massive Losses,"The plaintiffs allege that they collectively lost about $151,000 after the meme coin’s value tanked post launch. Meanwhile, Craig Wright received a suspended sentence in the UK for contempt of court after defying orders to stop lawsuits based on false claims of being Bitcoin's creator. In Germany, regulators ordered Worldcoin to revise its biometric data practices to comply with GDPR, and in Nigeria, the SEC introduced new stricter rules for crypto marketing. HAWK Meme Coin Faces Legal Trouble The team behind the HAWK meme coin that is associated with Haliey Welch, also known as ”Hawk Tuah Girl,” is facing legal action from investors who allege violations of securities laws. According to court documents that were filed in a District Court of New York on Thursday, the lawsuit claims that HAWK operated as an unregistered security that attracted first-time cryptocurrency investors who subsequently suffered major financial losses after the token's dramatic decline in value. The complaint was brought forward by twelve plaintiffs who collectively reported losses amounting to $151,000. They are seeking a jury trial and believe that HAWK displayed all the hallmarks of an unregistered security. Haliey Welch Central to their argument is the claim that the token's success was intrinsically linked to a ”common enterprise,” driven by the pooling of funds and the efforts of Welch and her team. The plaintiffs argue that the marketing surrounding HAWK created a ”reasonable expectation of profits” and that the token's performance relied heavily on the efforts of Welch and the Tuah Foundation. The lawsuit also alleges that the HAWK token was not registered as a security despite clear indications of its status under existing legal standards. Furthermore, it claims that a wallet controlled by the Tuah Foundation amassed $3 million from transaction fees associated with the token. Haliey Welch rose to viral fame in June of 2024 with her street interview response featuring the phrase ”hawk tuah.” The HAWK token launched on the Solana blockchain through the web3 launchpad platform OverHere on Dec. 4, 2024. The token initially saw a meteoric rise and reached a market cap of approximately $400 million before plummeting by 90%. Craig Wright Sentenced for Contempt in UK Court In other crypto-related legal news, Craig Wright, the Australian national who falsely claimed to be Bitcoin's creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has been handed a one-year suspended sentence in the United Kingdom for contempt of court. The sentence was delivered by Judge James Mellor on Dec. 19, and includes 12 months in jail suspended for two years, alongside a £145,000 fine, equivalent to approximately $180,000. The ruling stems from a case that was started by the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA), which accused Wright of violating a court order issued in July. The order stopped him from filing any further lawsuits against companies based on his unfounded claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright faced five counts of contempt of court for still continuing to pursue legal actions against Bitcoin developers. The UK court ruled in March that Wright was not the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, which is a finding Wright later acknowledged on his website in July. COPA attorney Jonathan Hough pointed out that Wright filed lawsuits against more than 100 companies, asking for damages totaling approximately £900 billion. Hough dismissed these lawsuits as “desperate publicity stunts” that are aimed at maintaining Wright's following. Despite appealing the March ruling, Wright's challenge was denied by the UK Court of Appeal due to the fact that his filing contained ”multiple falsehoods.” Wright’s legal battles also prompted counteractions. In July, a UK high court froze his assets to facilitate the recovery of $1.9 million in legal costs owed to podcaster Peter McCormack after a defamation lawsuit. While the Dec. 19 ruling imposes a suspended sentence, it is still unclear if UK authorities will issue an arrest warrant against Wright. Despite claims from various individuals, including Wright, the true identity of the creator of the 2008 Bitcoin white paper is still very much a mystery. German Regulator Takes Action Against Worldcoin The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) took corrective action against the digital identity project World, formerly known as Worldcoin, over its handling of biometric data. On Dec. 19, the BayLDA finished its investigation into the project’s compliance with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ordered World to implement a GDPR-compliant data deletion procedure within one month of the ruling’s effective date. World was launched in July of 2023, and uses iris biometrics for digital identity verification. It has faced some serious scrutiny since its inception. The BayLDA’s investigation started in 2023, and raised concerns over biometric data collection practices. Due to these proceedings, World voluntarily paused its activities in some EU countries. Despite World’s attempts to actually improve its GDPR compliance, the BayLDA identified even more adjustments required. These include the deletion of certain data records collected without a sufficient legal basis during the project’s early stages in 2023 and ensuring explicit user consent for future data processing steps. The BayLDA also shared that issues like the protection of minors and the potential for administrative offenses will be addressed in separate proceedings. In response to the ruling, the World Foundation appealed , and are asking for some judicial clarity on whether its Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) meet the EU’s definition of anonymization. World’s legal team argues that GDPR lacks a consistent definition of anonymization, which is critical when it comes to protecting personal data in the era of artificial intelligence. Despite its appeal, the World Foundation is still committed to working with regulators to establish clear guidelines that balance both privacy protection and technological innovation. Nigerian SEC Tightens Rules on Crypto Marketing Things might become a little tougher legally for crypto projects in other countries as well. The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently introduced updated rules for the cryptocurrency sector, specifically focusing on marketing practices by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and social media influencers. According to the revised Digital Asset Rules, VASPs must receive prior approval from the SEC before engaging third-party service providers for promotional activities. These service providers are also required to stick to the SEC's marketing regulations. The updated rules apply to any VASP offering services to Nigerian residents, and will take effect on June 30 of 2025. The SEC’s revisions especially target the growing influence of social media personalities, or “Finfluencers,” in promoting crypto products. Influencers have to secure a “no-objection authorization” from the SEC before publishing any advertisements for digital assets. Additionally, they are required to confirm whether the companies they promote are actually licensed by the SEC and disclose any compensation they received for their promotional activities. Non-compliance with these rules could result in penalties, including a fine of at least 10 million naira, which is approximately $6,400, or imprisonment of up to three years. The SEC also announced plans to actively monitor crypto-related advertisements to ensure compliance. These measures are part of the SEC’s attempts to address the increasing popularity of financial influencers and unauthorized promotion of investment products. Currently, only two exchanges are regulated in Nigeria: Quidax Technologies and Busha Digital, both of which received provisional licenses to operate as registered crypto exchanges. The SEC's director-general, Emomotimi Agama, stated that the agency will take decisive action against entities offering crypto services to Nigerians without the proper authorization.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | WLD,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6656/investors-sue-hawk-meme-coin-team-after-massive-losses,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

BTC dropped 4.2% in the past 24 hours, with Solana’s SOL, ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA falling as much as 9%. Dogecoin slid the most with an 11% drop, extending weekly losses to over 21%.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index of the largest tokens by market cap, fell 5.5%. That spread over to futures markets, with over $890 million in long and short liquidations in the past 24 hours.  Reaction to a hawkish FOMC triggered a sharp selloff across all risk assets on Wednesday and Thursday. Nasdaq plummeted 3.5%, S&P 500 dropped 2.9% and BTC declined more than 6% since the meeting, where Fed chair Jerome Powell hinted at only a few rate cuts in 2025.  Powell then said at a post-FOMC press conference that the central bank wasn’t allowed to own bitcoin under current regulations — in response to a question about President-elect Donald Trump’s strategic reserve promises.  Traders at Singapore-based QCP Capital attributed the market crash to overly bullish sentiment in the past month.  “While it is easy to blame the selloff on the Fed’s hawkish cut, we believe the root cause of the morning’s crash to be market’s overly bullish positioning,” QCP said in a Telegram broadcast.   “Since the election, risk assets have enjoyed an impressive one-sided run, leaving the market extremely vulnerable to any shocks. While the Fed's 25bps cut was expected, the source of panic can be attributed to the dot plot, which was revised lower. Due to persistent inflation, the Fed now projects two rate cuts for 2025 compared to the market’s consensus of 3 rate cuts,” QCP added.  A drop in bitcoin comes amid an otherwise bullish period for the asset.  December tends to be historically bullish for bitcoin in a move colloquially termed the ""Santa Claus Rally."" Data from the past eight years shows that bitcoin ended December in the green six times since 2015, running at least 8% to as much as 46% (in the outlier year of 2020).  Seasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. While it may look random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, to the generally bullish November and December, a sign of increased demand ahead of holiday season.",NEGATIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/dogecoin-s-11-drop-leads-losses-in-crypto-majors-as-bitcoin-sours-festive-mood,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ab87957226b3cddded1ac72d666b87587652b7a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It located support above $2 and recovered briefly but remains weak on the day following a 30% loss in 7 days. Many meme coins have posted a serious loss in the past month as the crypto market took a downturn. The bears are currently taking charge. However, WIF’s structure still looks bullish on the daily timeframe, but the trend seems to have shifted to the downside following yesterday’s break below an ascending trendline that stood as support since August. It tested $2.15 earlier today and took a little break due to a bounce. The price is now trading at around $2.27, While the asset is yet to establish support, it may revisit November’s low before resuming bullish. Holding the current daily low (as support) could result in a fresh buy. So far, WIF has declined by more than 50% since it lost grip above $4.8 in early November. Other major meme coin like Bonk Inu is down by over 40% – making it the biggest loser in the past 30 days of trading. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If the price recovers higher, WIF could retest the $2.54 level that broke as support yesterday. Above it lies the minor $3.2 resistance, followed by the monthly $4 resistance level. A climb above these levels could bring a full recovery to $4.86 before breaking higher. If the price breaks lower, the November $1.9 low would be the next support to watch. Other support levels to keep in mind are $1.6 and $1.3.

It appeared bearish daily and now sits above September’s high. The past month has been tough for Floki as it failed to advance bullishly above the $0.0003 level. An attempt to break above this key level earlier this month proved abortive and the crypto formed a double-top pattern. This bearish pattern led to a serious breakdown this week and the price plunged below the key $0.0002 level yesterday. Volatility increased today and it slipped to a low of $0.000177 for the first in three months. Rejecting this low, the price bounced back and now trades at $0.000188. A further bounce could bring a fast retest at the broken key level before deciding on where next to head. For now, the bears are gaining control. However, it is important to note that the latest breakdown is considered a retracement of last month’s impulsive movement. We can expect the bulls to step back in action if the current daily low holds as support. Otherwise, Floki may enter the $0.00015 range before bouncing back. Looking back, it has seen over $25% losses in the past month of trading. Floki’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview A drop below the holding $0.000177 support level could slide the price to a low of $0.0001483 this week. The lower price level to watch for support is $0.000125 – where it initiated a surge in volatility last month. The $0.00021 level is considered the closest resistance for a test. If Floki climbs above it, the $0.000283 resistance is the next level to watch for a break up to the $0.00035 resistance – printed in June.

However, it remains bullish but is still finding a key level to initiate a fresh buy. The price is currently under retracement. The late November drops continued to bring a notable setback for Sol’s bulls on a daily scale, though the $200 level has suppressed selling since the market witnessed a sudden meltdown over the past week. Following a short recovery, the $240 level posed a threat to the bulls and the price fell, though the volatility currently looks insignificant due to low supply. A big loss should be expected if the supply level increases. Looking at the choppy price actions over the past week, Sol appeared to be gathering liquidity for another major sell-off capable of retracing the price lower to the $190 and $180 area, where the buyers are patiently waiting to initiate an entry in the next few days. While the ongoing retracement phase provides a discount for a long-term reaccumulation, we can expect a huge rebound once the price tests the white ascending trendline, acting as diagonal support since September. A breakdown of this line could result in an end of the bullish move. But from a technical perspective, more growth is expected in the future. SOL’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As Sol advances retracement near a weekly support level of $210, the price must break below $200 before testing $194 and $183.4, where the trendline lies. From there, we can expect a bounce back. But if the price recovers from the current trading level, the immediate resistance level to watch on the way up is $247, followed by $264.4. A break up there could rocket the price to $280 and $300 in no time. Key Resistance Levels: $247, $264.4, $280 Key Support Levels: $210, $194, $183.4 Spot Price: $217 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

37873781,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321406,1734674509,Bankrupt New Zealand Crypto Exchange Cryptopia Returns Millions to Users Following Liquidation,"The beleaguered New Zealand-based crypto exchange Cryptopia has started returning millions in crypto to account holders, years after its collapse. Cryptopia filed for liquidation after millions of dollars of tokens were stolen from the platform in a 2019 cyber-attack. Around $15.5 million was stolen from the platform at the time. However, while the liquidations were on, the platform was hacked again in 2021. This time, a former employee stole $170,000 in crypto from a wallet tied to Cryptopia. The exchange has repaid 10,000 verified account holders with NZ$400 million ($224.9 million) in cryptocurrency. Per the liquidator’s public advisory , account holders of Bitcoin and Dogecoin have received their first cryptocurrency distributions. “Within the last 48 hours, over NZ$400 million in cryptocurrency has been returned on-chain,” Cryptopia liquidator Grant Thornton noted. Since the hack, liquidators have been working to identify verified users to repay their cryptos, following Justice Gendall’s decision in March 2020. This marks the first distribution plan for Cryptopia users and liquidators will continue to repay, following the approval. “This complex process also involved rebuilding the hacked cryptocurrency exchange and reconciling millions of transactions from nearly 960,000 users,” Grant Thornton added. Cryptopia to Add Top-Up Distribution to Account Holders The exchange’s liquidators have also planned for an additional top-up distribution to users, however, the plan is not yet confirmed. The additional distribution would allow account holders to receive up to 100% of their holdings using “unclaimed holdings” from account holders who did not register for claims after the cut-off dates. Users will apparently receive a soft cut-off date in the coming days from the liquidator to register in the claims portal. Only those who register before the deadline will be eligible to receive the refunds, the liquidator noted. Further, Grant Thornton has planned for consequent rounds of fund distributions for newly verified users, next year.

GalaChain is the first hyperledger fabric chain to release this update and this strategic migration represents a critical step towards creating a more secure and decentralized blockchain environment. The transition is currently underway in the test environment, with plans to implement the changes on the mainnet in the near future. When completed, GalaChain will distinguish itself as one of the pioneering public Hyperledger Fabric blockchains to successfully implement this sophisticated consensus mechanism. Migrating From Raft to BFT Consensus At the heart of this upgrade is a drastic improvement in network resilience. Raft, a Crash Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, falls short in scenarios involving malicious activity. It operates under the assumption that network nodes will behave predictably and without malicious intent. It can effectively manage non-malicious failures like system crashes or temporary downtime. However, this approach leaves significant vulnerabilities in a landscape increasingly threatened by sophisticated cyber attacks. For instance, a compromised leader node or a network partition could disrupt operations and lead to incorrect decisions. This highlights the need for a more superior and secured upgrade. The BFT Advantage Over Raft By contrast, BFT algorithm introduces a more sophisticated approach to network consensus. It is designed for hostile environments where some nodes may behave maliciously. BFT algorithms can withstand and neutralize potential malicious activities by requiring consensus from a substantial majority. Even if up to one-third of nodes act maliciously, it demands consensus from two-thirds of honest network nodes before finalizing any transaction. This means that even if some nodes attempt to send false messages or manipulate the consensus process, the network remains stable and secure. This critical feature significantly reduces the risk of single point of failure, fortifying the network against targeted attacks and improving fault tolerance. Building Trust and Reliability The implications of this upgrade extend beyond mere technical optimization. For users and developers in the Gala Games ecosystem, the BFT migration promises enhanced trust, improved transaction reliability, and a more robust blockchain infrastructure that can effectively resist potential security threats. As blockchain transitions with features that reduce risks and improves security, Gala Games’ proactive approach to network security demonstrates a commitment to the future of the ecosystem by creating trustworthy digital platforms.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TRADING | GALA,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galachain-pioneers-bft-on-hyperledger-paving-the-way-for-next-level-decentralization/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

According to a Bloomberg report, Gov. Eli Remolona said on Friday that the Philippine Central Bank was closely watching the peso drop and intervening in currency markets. Indonesia promised to defend the rupiah (IDR) to stabilize markets, while Brazil said it spent $14 billion last week to strengthen the real (BRL). Developing economies are facing mounting pressure. India’s rupee and Brazil’s real reached all-time lows, and South Korea’s won tumbled to a 15-year low. A weakening currency can worsen inflation and raise the cost of servicing debt for those nations that depend on foreign borrowing. Currency strategist Christopher Wong said fighting a strong dollar trend is tough, and “intervention in such an environment can only slow the pace of currency depreciation. Despite that, central banks may still have to use a mix of verbal and actual intervention tools”. Emerging-market FX has faced a sharp quarterly decline Source: Bloomberg Since late September, the MSCI Emerging Markets Currency Index has dropped 3.3%, its sharpest quarterly decline in two years. It has compounded the challenges with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stance matching a more cautious approach. This will lead to fewer interest-rate cuts next year and increased concerns about inflation. With a strong dollar, emerging market central banks are willing to take bold action to save their currencies from falling too far and stave off even wider economic damage. On Friday, South Korea said it will increase the limit banks can hold in forward contracts by 50% of its foreign currency reserves. The move is an effort to attract more money to enter the country to balance the currency market supply and demand. At the same time, China’s central bank intervened to prop up the yuan, setting its daily reference rate much higher than the market had been projecting.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

On Wednesday, the Fed cut the benchmark borrowing cost as expected but penciled in only two rate cuts for 2025, down from four projected in September. The central bank stressed that it's not interested in participating in a potential government plan to build a strategic BTC reserve.  Since then, BTC has dropped over 8%, hitting lows near $96,000 at one point. As of writing, the cryptocurrency changed hands near $97,500, down nearly 10% from the record high of $108,266 reached early this week, CoinDesk data show.  The losses have caused the 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) to dip below the 200-hour SMA, confirming a bearish crossover. The pattern suggests that the ongoing pullback could evolve into a deeper one, although it has failed to live up to its reputation during the recent bull run.  Bitcoin has experienced a few pullbacks during its post-U.S. election rally from $70,000 to over $100,000, and each of these dips has ended with a bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-hour SMAs.  The latest crossover, therefore, offers hope to bulls expecting a renewed move into six figures above $100,000.  A potential bounce could face resistance near $106,000, a level identified by the descending trendline, representing the recent price drop. A violation there would open doors for record highs.  It's important to remember that patterns don't always play out as expected, and the contrary indicator discussed above may fail, potentially leading to a deeper drop.

37869120,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665523,1734672636,From Wrapped Bitcoin To Justin Sun: Trump’s Crypto Platform Executes Major $10 Million Swap,"In a notable development for Donald Trump’s crypto initiative, World Liberty Financial (WL), has reportedly exchanged approximately $10 million worth of wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for tokens associated with project adviser Justin Sun, founder of the TRON blockchain. World Liberty Financial Links With Justin Sun In Major Token Swap According to blockchain data analytics firm Nansen, a digital wallet linked to President-elect’s World Liberty Financial swapped its entire holding of 103 cbBTC tokens for WBTC on a Wednesday operation. Wrapped Bitcoin serves as a bridge for Bitcoin (BTC) holders to engage in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, enabling broader participation in the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Predicts Major Altcoin Season As Market Cap Eyes Record Levels Although World Liberty has been marketed as a decentralized finance lending platform, it has yet to become operational as it is still in early stages of development and presales of its WLF token. Sun, a cryptocurrency entrepreneur known for his high-profile investments and attention-grabbing antics—including purchasing a banana duct-taped to a wall for $6.2 million—invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial in November, becoming an adviser to the project. His involvement appears to have pushed World Liberty past a financial threshold that could allow Trump to profit from the enterprise, potentially securing at least $15 million for the Trump family based on terms outlined in World Liberty’s “gold paper.” Trump’s Crypto Initiative Struggles The recent token swap follows World Liberty’s earlier cryptocurrency acquisitions, including significant investments in Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK). Additionally, Nansen’s data indicates that the project’s wallets received around $250,000 in ONDO, a token from Ondo Finance, which specializes in tokenization. The backdrop of these transactions is marked by controversy, particularly following a backlash triggered by a strategic partnership between Sun’s BiT Global and crypto custody firm BitGo, the operator of Wrapped Bitcoin. This partnership prompted US-based crypto exchange Coinbase to seek a delisting of WBTC from its exchange due to concerns over Sun’s potential influence and control. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Earlier this month, BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase in response to the delisting, but a federal judge in California ruled in favor of Coinbase, denying BiT Global’s request for a temporary restraining order. Despite the promotional efforts by Trump and his sons, World Liberty Financial has faced challenges in the market, with sales reportedly falling 93% short of projections. This lack of traction raises questions about the project’s viability and its ability to fulfill its ambitious promises of transforming the financial landscape. At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has fallen to the $3.3 trillion mark, after hitting an all-time high of $3.73 trillion on Tuesday, which also pushed the price of Bitcoin to a new record above $108,000.

Experts Double Down on Rollblock","There is a great crypto rally going on, with Bitcoin peeking above $108k before retracting again, but the $110k Bitcoin is inevitable. This highly positive Bitcoin price is great for all cryptos, with the Stellar price living up to its name with a stellar 80% increase on a 30-day candle. Sui is not doing too badly either, and it calls for a deeper look. However, the star of this crypto rally seems to be Rollblock , a new online gambling platform that is raking in presale investment dollars . Rollblock (RBLK): Gambling investment now available to retail investors Globally, online gambling is huge, worth over $500 billion annually. But it’s not been an investment available to the moguls and millionaires of Monaco and Macau. Engaging with the profits made in gambling was not available to Joe Everyman – until now! Rollblock is a new Ethereum-based online casino currently holding a presale to enlarge its liquidity pool. The kicker: it is an income-bearing asset. Every week, Rollblock pays out a dividend to all its token holders. Everyone who has RBLK token gets a share of the takings. The best news is that this is not something in the future, ‘when we get there’. Rollblock ’s online casino dApp is alive and running, sporting thousands of games, both digital and live, across all genres. There’s something for everyone in Rollblock , and it’s no surprise the presale has recently exceeded $7.3 million . Stellar (XLM): Stellar price rides coattails of XRP on crypto rally Depending on how one looks at it, Stellar i s either a complementary product to XRP or a competitor. XRP is racing up the charts, the feel-good story of the year, but the Stellar price is not too far behind. A cynical look will say that Stellar is riding XRP’s coattails, as both tokens facilitate cross-border payments, and Stellar shares much of its coding with XRP. A kinder reading states that Stellar is gaining thanks to its intrinsic value proposition. But no matter how one slices it, the truth is plain to see: the Stellar price is up 350% on a 90-day candle and has overtaken Polkadot to occupy the #16 spot on the market cap rankings. Sui (SUI): Breakthrough blockchain to break out? Sui is still relatively new, only listed in May 2023, but it has made some fantastic climbs since August of this year. Sui went up four dollars from $0.60 to $4.60 in a mere three and a half months, delivering a 666% increase. Is Sui done, or is it just getting started? There’s more than enough room for Sui on the blockchain market. With Ethereum’s gas fees becoming a major challenge and Solana’s reliability problems constantly hobbling it, Sui is perfectly positioned to make a play for the dApp development platform of choice. There may be a ton of growth left in Sui . Conclusion The crypto rally has delivered a “ Stellar” price , and Sui is reaching for the stars. Crypto is changing the way the world works, and we’re in the early days. There has never been a better time to invest. Stellar, Sui, and Rollblock will all make great additions to a well-balanced crypto portfolio.

37869089,https://coinpaper.com/6657/chainalysis-reveals-north-korea-s-record-crypto-heists-in-2024,1734672600,Chainalysis Reveals North Korea's Record Crypto Heists in 2024,"Blockchain security is taking center stage as new developments highlight both challenges and advancements in the sector. A recent Chainalysis report revealed a dramatic rise in crypto thefts tied to North Korean hackers, who doubled their stolen assets in 2024 to over $1.3 billion. In parallel, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm, signaling a proactive shift toward preventing such exploits. North Korean Hackers Double Crypto Theft in 2024, Chainalysis Reports In a chilling revelation, analytics firm Chainalysis has disclosed that hackers tied to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) have doubled their crypto theft in 2024 compared to the previous year. The report, released on Dec. 19, outlines how North Korean cybercriminals stole over $1.3 billion worth of digital assets across 47 incidents in 2024, accounting for a staggering 61% of all crypto thefts reported globally. The findings indicate a significant escalation in the scale and frequency of DPRK-linked cyberattacks. This marks a stark contrast to 2023, during which hackers tied to the isolated nation stole approximately $660 million in cryptocurrency. Chainalysis highlighted a worrying trend: not only are DPRK's crypto attacks becoming more frequent, but the hackers are also successfully pulling off larger exploits. The report noted that in 2024, attacks involving sums between $50 million and $100 million—and even those exceeding $100 million—occurred more often than in the prior year. This pattern diverges sharply from the two preceding years, when most of the DPRK’s exploits yielded profits below $50 million. “It appears that the DPRK’s crypto attacks are becoming more frequent,” Chainalysis reported. “Notably, attacks between $50 and $100 million, and those above $100 million occurred far more frequently in 2024 than they did in 2023, suggesting that the DPRK is getting better and faster at massive exploits.” Despite North Korea’s increasing activity, the overall global crypto theft landscape showed mixed signals. Chainalysis reported that hackers globally had stolen approximately $2.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency in 2024, marking a 21% increase compared to 2023. However, this figure is still far below the record-setting $3.7 billion in crypto stolen in 2022. The first quarter of 2024 saw decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms as the primary target for hackers. However, the second and third quarters revealed a shift, with centralized services bearing the brunt of cyberattacks. Some of the most notable incidents in 2024 include: WazirX Hack (July): Hackers compromised one of the India-based exchange’s Safe multisig wallets on Ethereum, resulting in losses of $235 million—the largest single hack of the year. BingX Hack (September): Cybercriminals targeted this crypto exchange and made away with roughly $44 million worth of tokens. North Korea’s Political Ties and Reduced Activity in H2 2024 The Chainalysis report also touched on an intriguing observation: a marked decline in DPRK-linked hacking activity in the second half of 2024. According to the analytics firm, the drop in stolen funds after July 1 was “conspicuous,” coinciding with deepening political and military ties between North Korea and Russia. However, Chainalysis cautioned against drawing direct links to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to Pyongyang earlier in the year. “The decline in funds stolen by the DPRK after July 1, 2024 is clear and the timing is conspicuous,” the report stated. “But it is nevertheless important to note that this decline is not necessarily associated with Putin’s visit to Pyongyang.” Chainalysis also noted that the year-end holidays could potentially see a resurgence of attacks, as hackers often exploit the season’s operational vulnerabilities. North Korean hackers have become notorious for orchestrating some of the most significant breaches in the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. Their activities have not only led to massive financial losses but also drawn heightened scrutiny from US authorities. The latter frequently impose sanctions on entities linked to DPRK’s money laundering efforts, which often involve laundering stolen crypto through complex networks of mixers and intermediaries. In recent years, these cyber exploits have served as a vital financial lifeline for North Korea, funding its nuclear weapons program and bypassing stringent international sanctions. The uptick in large-scale attacks in 2024 shines the spotlight on the evolving threat posed by DPRK hackers, even as the global crypto ecosystem attempts to bolster its defenses. While North Korea’s hackers had a “very active year,” Chainalysis reported that global hacking activity in the third and fourth quarters of 2024 declined compared to the same period in 2023. This trend offers a glimmer of hope, suggesting that improved security measures and international cooperation may be starting to curb some forms of cybercrime. Nevertheless, the ongoing evolution of North Korea’s cyber capabilities is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities inherent in the digital asset space. As hackers grow more adept at breaching even the most secure platforms, the industry faces an urgent need for continuous innovation in cybersecurity. The alarming scale of North Korea’s crypto exploits in 2024 serves as a wake-up call for the cryptocurrency industry, governments, and cybersecurity firms. With 2022 still holding the dubious distinction of being the worst year for crypto hacks, the path forward must involve collaboration across all stakeholders to minimize risks and protect the burgeoning digital economy. The report’s findings also raise questions about the geopolitical dimensions of crypto crime, particularly as nation-states leverage cybercrime as a strategic tool. As 2025 approaches, the global crypto community will undoubtedly keep a close eye on the DPRK’s next moves—and the broader implications for digital asset security. Chainalysis Acquires Web3 Security Firm Hexagate to Strengthen Blockchain Security In a related development, Chainalysis has announced its acquisition of Hexagate, a Web3 security firm specializing in threat detection and mitigation. The acquisition, revealed on Dec. 19, marks a significant step forward for Chainalysis as it pivots from its traditional focus on investigations into proactive prevention within the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem. Founded in 2022 and headquartered in Israel, Hexagate has quickly gained recognition for its advanced Web3 security solutions. The company’s offerings include real-time threat detection and tools to safeguard digital assets, which have reportedly prevented over $1 billion in potential losses for its clients. These clients include prominent names such as Coinbase and Consensys. Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin announced the acquisition on X, signaling a bold new chapter for the company. Levin stated: “We have spent 10 years following the money. Now it’s time to prevent the money from being stolen. Welcome to the era of secure smart contracts with proper monitoring and real-time threat detection. Announcing our acquisition of Hexagate.” In a blog post accompanying the announcement, Levin emphasized Chainalysis’s evolving mission to transition from being a leader in blockchain investigations to a trailblazer in preventative security measures. He noted that expanding into Web3 security is a natural progression for the company as it seeks to protect the burgeoning blockchain ecosystem from increasingly sophisticated threats. While the announcement shows the strategic importance of Hexagate to Chainalysis’s future endeavors, many details remain undisclosed. The purchase price for Hexagate has not been revealed, and it remains unclear whether the acquisition will lead to significant changes in Hexagate’s leadership or operational structure. Chainalysis’s Shift to Prevention The acquisition of Hexagate signals a broader strategic shift for Chainalysis. Since its founding, the company has been renowned for its blockchain analytics capabilities, assisting law enforcement and regulatory agencies in tracing illicit crypto transactions. Now, it aims to tackle issues at the root by preventing theft and fraud before they occur. Levin’s leadership appears to be a driving force behind this pivot. Having taken over as CEO in October 2024 following the departure of Michael Gronager, Levin has been vocal about the company’s aspirations to expand its services and respond to the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain technology. Hexagate’s expertise in protecting smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is expected to complement Chainalysis’s existing suite of blockchain analytics tools. By integrating Hexagate’s real-time monitoring and threat detection capabilities, Chainalysis aims to offer a more comprehensive solution to its clients, bridging the gap between investigation and prevention. Levin’s vision for Chainalysis’s future extends beyond technological advancements. The CEO has also speculated about potential regulatory changes under the incoming US administration. He suggested that greater clarity surrounding digital assets, including the repeal of rules like the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), could pave the way for a more secure and transparent blockchain industry.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6657/chainalysis-reveals-north-korea-s-record-crypto-heists-in-2024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

(@Metaplanet_JP) December 20, 2024 Globally, companies accumulating Bitcoin as a financial hedge have seen notable success. MicroStrategy, for instance, doubled its stock price in just five years through aggressive Bitcoin purchases, showing the potential of such an approach. Building Asia’s Largest Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet started its Bitcoin buying spree in April 2024 and has already added 1,150 BTC , worth $122.67 million, to its reserves. The company views Bitcoin as a valuable asset because of its limited supply and independence from government control. This bond issuance is part of its larger goal to become Asia’s top Bitcoin holder, mirroring MicroStrategy’s strategy of using Bitcoin as a key financial tool. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Japan Considers National Bitcoin Reserve as Countries Embrace Crypto , Market Cheers the Move The plan has been welcomed by investors, with Metaplanet’s stock climbing 51% in just five days.

37870222,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52662,1734671727,Expert States Why XRP Holders Will Become Richest People You Know,"A prominent cryptocurrency analyst, Steph, has expressed confidence in XRP’s potential to surpass its previous all-time high. He suggests that this anticipated surge could make XRP holders some of the wealthiest investors in the market. In recent months, XRP has gained significant attention due to its impressive price movements. Notably, the cryptocurrency rose from $0.51 at the start of November to $2.90 by December 3, representing a staggering 464% increase within a single month. While XRP faced a pullback after this peak, consolidating between $2 and $2.60 for two weeks, Steph maintains that an even larger rally may be on the horizon. Bollinger Bands Indicate Potential Breakout Steph’s analysis emphasizes the importance of key technical indicators, including the Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart. These bands, which measure market volatility, are currently widening—a signal often associated with significant price movements. He noted that in November, a similar expansion of the Bollinger Bands preceded a 132% surge in XRP’s price. Additionally, past instances of this pattern have led to rallies of 53% and 120%. Based on the current expansion, Steph believes that XRP is primed for another breakout, which could further validate its bullish trajectory. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE THE RICHEST PEOPLE YOU KNOW – HERE’S WHY! pic.twitter.com/k0tc6tCAq0 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 17, 2024 Bull Flag Breakout Fuels Optimism Another bullish indicator highlighted by Steph is XRP’s breakout from a bull flag pattern on the daily chart. Such breakouts are typically seen as a continuation of upward price trends after a consolidation phase. The breakout has been confirmed by multiple daily closes above a critical long-term resistance level. As of now, XRP has maintained a position above the crucial support level of $2.33, as it currently trades at $2.35. Steph cautioned that failing to hold above this level could challenge the bullish narrative. However, if XRP sustains its position, the market outlook remains favorable. The analyst also identified $2.60 as a significant resistance level. A daily close above this threshold would further solidify the bullish case for XRP. He has set a short-to-medium-term target of $4.90 to $5 , supported by the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) ribbons on the daily chart. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Declining Bitcoin Dominance Boosts Altcoin Market Steph also addressed the role of Bitcoin dominance, a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to other cryptocurrencies. He observed that Bitcoin dominance has been declining after breaking below a rising wedge pattern, currently testing the breakdown level near 57%. This trend is considered favorable for altcoins like XRP. Should Bitcoin dominance continue to decline, potentially reaching the 47–50% range, it could signal the start of an altcoin season. Historically, this range has acted as strong support during July 2021 and October 2021. Such conditions could create an environment conducive to XRP achieving its $5 price target. Steph advised investors to monitor Bitcoin dominance as it approaches the 47–50% zone. A reversal from this level could mark a turning point in the market, prompting investors to consider taking profits. Nevertheless, he emphasized that XRP and other altcoins currently exhibit strong potential for growth. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin shot up strongly after Donald Trump’s election victory, leading to a price above $100,000. According to the report by Financial Times, the data from Hedge Fund Research shows that hedge funds that used crypto strategies shared a gain of 46% in November, bringing total yearly gains for the niche to 76%. Compared to the rest of the hedge fund industry, these returns were very strong in what would otherwise be a 10% average win. Crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital was among the big winners The rally accelerated since Trump’s election win in November and boosted the value of the largest digital asset, Bitcoin. Brevan Howard and Galaxy Digital were among the big winners. The surge also pushed up the value of smaller digital tokens. This year, bitcoin has surged 130% to around $100,000, driving the total market value for major cryptocurrencies to rise by $1.8 trillion to $3.5 trillion. But this week, the market declined slightly as the Federal Reserve signaled it would boost interest rates less than anticipated next year, which pummels high-risk assets. In contrast to the Biden administration, which has been more cautious about digital currencies, investors hope the Trump administration’s appointments of high-level government roles will be more crypto-friendly.

According to data from CoinGlass , the bulk of these liquidations, roughly $856.66 million, were from long positions, signaling that bullish traders were caught off guard by the sudden price dip. Bitcoin, which had maintained strong momentum over the past 30 days, slipped below the critical $100,000 psychological mark after the Federal Reserve signaled a more hawkish stance. Bitcoin Drops to Local Low of $93,000 On December 5, Bitcoin’s price plummeted 5.47% below $93,000, wiping out $300 million in leveraged positions within minutes. A larger liquidation event occurred on December 10, when over $1.7 billion in crypto positions were wiped out in just 24 hours. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at around $97,000, down by more than 4% over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. Crypto veteran and Bitcoin maximalist Fred Krueger weighed in on the situation, posting on X that “the only way to screw up trading Bitcoin is through leverage,” highlighting the risks associated with high-leverage bets in a volatile market. Bitcoin is the best trade you will probably ever see. There is exactly one way to screw it up. Leverage. — Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) December 19, 2024 Despite the turmoil, some analysts remain optimistic. Crypto market analyst Caleb Franzen framed the recent dip as standard behavior during a bull market. He pointed out that during the previous bull run, Bitcoin experienced nine notable pullbacks, each of which was followed by a new all-time high. These are all of the Bitcoin pullbacks (not incl. the COVID crash) from the last bull cycle, all of which were followed by higher highs. Down -18.9%, -15.9%, -21.2%, -16.8%, -31.1%, -25.6%, -18.3%, -58.6%, -30.1%, -25.1%. All within the span of 16 months. Buckle up buttercup. pic.twitter.com/1QFdOIj1ks — Caleb Franzen (@CalebFranzen) December 19, 2024 Meanwhile, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts suggested that the downturn could present a buying opportunity, while other analysts are still holding out hope for a potential “Santa rally” — a seasonal surge in asset prices typically seen at year-end. Investor sentiment may also be influenced by speculation surrounding the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States on January 20, 2025. Market watchers are closely monitoring how Trump’s administration might handle crypto regulation, especially with discussions of a potential U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve. Fed Signals Hawkish Stance On December 18, the Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point, the third consecutive reduction. While the news is good for risk assets like Bitcoin, the central bank came with a cautionary tone about additional cuts in coming years, which adversely impacted the crypto market . In delivering the 25 basis point cut, the Fed indicated that it probably would only lower twice more in 2025. “Cryptocurrencies are still too volatile to serve as an effective hedge against traditional currencies in developed economies,” Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at swiss-based fintech platform YouHodler, said following the latest rate cut announcement. “However, they are increasingly viewed as a long-term hedge against inflation. In this context, faster rate cuts by the Fed would inject more liquidity into the financial system, potentially boosting cryptocurrency prices and global interest in the market including Europe.” The post Over $1B Liquidated as Crypto Market Continues to Dip Following Fed’s Hawkish Signal appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/over-1b-liquidated-as-crypto-market-dips-following-feds-hawkish-signal/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37873780.jpeg

37868137,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630828,1734670231,Blockstream’s Adam Back defends BlackRock ad that questioned Bitcoin’s 21M cap,"Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back has come to the defense of BlackRock after the company’s recent Bitcoin ad triggered an outrage across the crypto community. It featured a small but explosive disclaimer: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” For Bitcoiners, the Bitcoin ad was a shot at the heart of what the asset stands for. Back, though, has downplayed the controversy. He explained that the disclaimer was a legal protection inserted by BlackRock’s lawyers, not a statement of intent. “Obviously, their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and don’t have control,” Back said. But for a community allergic to corporate meddling, his words did little to extinguish the fire. Bitcoiners can’t trust BlackRock There have already been concerns of forceful centralization by what is largely believed to be the most powerful company on the planet. X users speculated that BlackRock might be preparing to influence the Bitcoin protocol. One even called the ad “very spooky.” The ad’s timing only added to the suspicion. BlackRock manages over 524,000 Bitcoin worth $53 billion through its exchange-traded fund (ETF), making it the largest institutional player in the market. For Bitcoin’s true believers, such concentrated influence is unnerving. Critics outside the Bitcoin bubble joined in. Longtime Bitcoin antagonist Peter Schiff wasted no time tearing into the ad, calling it packed with falsehoods and labeling Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin as disingenuous. And though his words may not carry weight with Bitcoiners, they amplified the outrage surrounding the ad. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is the bedrock of its value proposition. It’s what sets it apart from inflation-prone fiat currencies. The cap is hard-coded into Bitcoin’s design, making it impossible to change without consensus. Even so, the mere suggestion of altering it has always been a taboo topic. Old battles with new players The ad is dragging people back to the Blocksize War, that hostile beef in the Bitcoin community from 2015 to 2017. The whole argument was about whether Bitcoin’s block size should be increased to make transactions faster and cheaper. On one side were the “big blockers,” who pushed for larger block sizes to scale Bitcoin as a payment system. On the other were the “small blockers,” who argued that increasing the block size would centralize the network by making it harder for individuals to run nodes. The conflict reached a boiling point with the New York Agreement in 2017 proposal, which wanted to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) while also doubling the block size. Some folks saw it as an attempt by corporations to hijack Bitcoin, and a grassroots movement known as the User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) forced SegWit activation without miner approval. The fallout though led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork that adopted larger block sizes. Its effects are still felt to this day.

37867927,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630852,1734670000,"While BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL) Consolidate, Here’s Why Analysts Say This DeFi Coin Will Provide The Most Returns This Cycle","While Solana (SOL) and BNB (BNB) battle consolidation, smart investors are finding a hidden gem in the crypto market. Offering ROIs much above its rivals, the revolutionary decentralized exchange Lunex Network (LNEX) is generating great investment interest thanks to its unmatched security, privacy, and cross-chain capabilities. Could this under-the-radar token outperform top crypto coins like BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL) as analysts estimate exponential increases for LNEX in this bull cycle? Read on to find out why experts think Lunex Network might be the most rewarding investment choice this cycle. Lunex Network (LNEX) Offers Secure and Anonymous Trading Providing a rare mix of security, anonymity, and cross-chain efficiency, Lunex Network distinguishes itself in the competitive decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Lunex Network guarantees top-tier security by means of a comprehensive audit by SOLIDProof , therefore ensuring that its smart contracts are free from major flaws. Maintaining some of the lowest transaction fees in the industry, Lunex Network lets users immediately trade over 50,000 coins across more than 40 blockchains. Lunex Network also gives Web3 developers access to 65+ RPC nodes, therefore providing a flexible toolkit for growth inside the ecosystem. Lunex Network provides a safe, anonymous platform that safeguards user data while enabling flawless crypto transactions for privacy-conscious traders wishing to evade invasive KYC processes. For investors, Lunex Network offers a promising prospect given that LNEX is priced at just $0.0046 in the presale. Meanwhile, those who bought LNEX at $0.0012 have already achieved a 283% ROI and analysts project an additional 300% surge before the presale ends. BNB (BNB) Displays Strong Bullish Momentum Over the past week, the BNB price has barely increased by 2% . The BNB price is currently ranging between $738 and $696. Driven by BNB’s (BNB) outstanding performance over the previous month, the community is overwhelmingly optimistic. The altcoin soared by more than 15% during this period, according to the BNB price chart, and on December 4 it reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $793. Although BNB (BNB) has already dropped by 10% from this height, experts see this as a reasonable pullback with hopes for a rally to reach $800 before the year ends. Strong technical indicators like the MACD, Awesome Oscillator, and Moving Averages—all of which point to ongoing purchasing pressure on the BNB price chart—help to support the positive outlook for the altcoin. Additionally, analysts are forecasting BNB (BNB) to reach the much-expected $1,000 milestone in this cycle. Solana (SOL) Bulls Set Eyes on a $300 Breakout Since it declined over 5% in the past week and more than 10% over the past month, the Solana price has lately shown negative days. The Solana price has been fluctuating between $235 and $210 among these falls. Holders are worried about this bearish behavior, but some hope was rebuilt following the bullish rejection on the Solana price chart at the $205 support level. Meanwhile, several analysts expect a retest of Solana’s all-time high (ATH) before the year ends. Strong technical signals support the argument for a possible comeback. The MACD and Moving Averages both provide a purchasing signal on the Solana price chart, suggesting that the altcoin may soon rally once more. The prospect of a breakout to the $300 level before the year ends excites investors especially as Solana (SOL) starts to show indications of rebuilding bullish momentum. One of the bullish patterns observed is how Solana (SOL) has seen multiple rejections around the $220 to $204 support zone. Lunex Network Set To Outshine BNB and Solana While Solana (SOL) eyes a $300 breakthrough and BNB (BNB) aims for new highs, Lunex Network (LNEX) is quietly transforming decentralized trading—and early investors are benefiting. Lunex Network is redefining the DeFi space with its unsurpassed security, anonymity, and cross-chain adaptability. Unlike BNB (BNB) and Solana (SOL), LNEX promises early exponential gains as analysts estimate a startling 1,800% increase in the next few months when the token launches on several Tier-1 exchanges.

The loan agreement states that the government is reducing Bitcoin-related risks and keeping private sector adoption voluntary. It also showed that the government’s Bitcoin risks will significantly decrease, aligning with IMF policies. However, on Thursday, Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office, announced on X that the country would keep buying Bitcoin for its strategic reserve. She added that the office would continue shaping Bitcoin policies, creating roadmaps, attracting investors and launching educational programs. EL SALVADOR SECURES $3.5 FUNDING DEAL Bitcoin remains legal tender El Salvador will continue buying bitcoin (at possibly an accelerated pace) for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bitcoin capital markets will continue to be built; for example, the recent tokenized issuance… — Stacy Herbert (@stacyherbert) December 19, 2024 El Salvador to Maintain Daily Bitcoin Purchases Further, Herbert confirmed that the government is still buying one Bitcoin daily, following its ongoing program of daily purchases. President Nayib Bukele has previously said the government will continue this practice until Bitcoin “becomes unaffordable with fiat currencies.” El Salvador currently holds 5,969 Bitcoin worth $579m. El Salvador Plans Chivo Wallet Phase-Out Amid $1.4B IMF Agreement On Wednesday, the country finalized a $1.4b loan agreement with the IMF, requiring President Bukele’s administration to scale back its Bitcoin policies. The deal specifies that tax payments will only be made in the US dollar, the country’s other official currency. The agreement, still awaiting approval from the IMF Executive Board, marks a significant shift in El Salvador’s ambitious Bitcoin strategy. The government also plans to reduce its role in the Chivo wallet, introduced as the official digital wallet for Bitcoin transactions. The wallet has seen limited adoption, with one survey showing that 92% of Salvadorans have not used Bitcoin despite its legal tender status. Herbert announced plans to either sell or phase out the Chivo wallet. However, she confirmed that private sector Bitcoin wallets will continue to operate in El Salvador.

37867350,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395285,1734669000,FOMO Alert: This New Viral Altcoin Gains Momentum As Whales Exit Meme Coins Like Dogecoin and Dogwifhat,"The post FOMO Alert: This New Viral Altcoin Gains Momentum As Whales Exit Meme Coins Like Dogecoin and Dogwifhat appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent reports indicate that whales have been exiting meme coins like Dogecoin and Dogwifhat in droves. Meme coins are having a subpar performance and their upside has likely reached a peak after strong November gains. Both Dogecoin and Dogwifhat are down on a weekly and daily basis at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the Rollblock (RBLK) presale continues to gather momentum, with $7.3 million raised so far. The pioneering GambleFi protocol aspires to disrupt a $450 billion industry with a decentralized solution to return profits to players and investors instead of centralized insiders. Whales Fear Missing Out On Rollblock One reason large investors are moving away from meme tokens to presales like Rollblock is the market use case. Rollblock has a clear market proposition tackling centralized gambling, which retains all of the profits. It offers over 7,000 gaming opportunities for players and recently added a lucrative sports betting feature. All of this is supported by Rollblock’s revenue share model. Every week, Rollblock will use 30% of revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens on the market. 60% of the purchased tokens are burned to promote price appreciation. The remaining 40% are used in the form of staking rewards. Token holders can earn up to 30% APY via staking alone. The redistribution of earnings is a huge incentive to players, who will also benefit from instant crypto deposits. Rollblock is 100% licensed and verified and uses blockchain technology to make transactions irrefutable. The presale offers a limited-time 20% token bonus and the coin already retails at a discount. Currently priced at $0.0415, the RBLK token will appreciate to $0.047 in the next round. In total, analysts predict a 720% increase from the start to the end of the presale, with early investors already seeing huge returns. Dogecoin Disappoints Token Holders News about Elon Musk’s appointment as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initially helped to increase the price of Dogecoin. Selling for $0.10 in early November, Dogecoin shot to $0.42 in mid-December, a 4x increase. But it is unlikely to rise much further and is down 3% over the past week. Such a large November rally will be hard to sustain without a retracement, and Dogecoin currently trades at $0.39, about 60% of its ATH. Moving forward, DOGE’s upside potential remains limited compared to other coins. Nonetheless, there are some positive indicators. Meme coins are known to lag a little when it comes to Bitcoin-led rallies. Moreover, 5.8 million Dogecoin have been recently reactivated, which could have a positive price impact. Dogwifhat Drops 14% In 7 Days Down 14% last week and 8% in 24 hours, Dogwifhat is faring even more poorly than Dogecoin. Dogwifhat does not have Elon Musk’s support or the first-mover effect of Dogecoin. This Dogwifhat price decline occurred despite positive news for the ecosystem, including WIF/USDT trading on the Binance US exchange on December 11th. In other bearish news for Dowwifhat, a whale offloaded $3.4 million worth of tokens to Coinbase last week. Acquired nearly a year before, the whale recorded an impressive 9x profit, purchasing the tokens for only $390,000. With the current retracement in the altcoin market, it seems to have been a timely move. Rollblock Going Viral As Top Altcoin Alternative With volatility in the crypto markets, whales are choosing to migrate to presales that offer both early bird pricing and better price potential. Analysts predict Rollblock to 100x or more after the presale completes in early 2025 and neither Dogwifhat nor Dogecoin can offer comparable returns.

37867224,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375351,1734668795,El Salvador’s $1.4 Billion IMF Deal Harms its Bitcoin Adoption,"After agreeing to curtail its ambitious Bitcoin initiatives, El Salvador has reached a $1.4 billion loan arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The agreement, which needs the approval of the IMF Executive Board, aims to support El Salvador’s reform agenda, boost fiscal and external sustainability, and create conditions for stronger, inclusive growth. IMF Loan Agreement with El Salvador According to the official press release , the program is expected to catalyze additional financial support from the World Bank and regional development banks, bringing the total financing package to over $3.5 billion during the program period. As part of El Salvador’s $1.4 billion deal with the IMF, the government has agreed to scale back its ambitious Bitcoin policies to address financial stability concerns. Legal reforms will make Bitcoin usage optional for private businesses, removing the mandate that had been in place since the cryptocurrency was adopted as legal tender in 2021. Meanwhile, for the public sector, Bitcoin-related activities will be strictly limited, with the government no longer accepting BTC for tax payments. Additionally, the state-run Chivo wallet, which facilitated Bitcoin transactions for citizens, will see its government involvement gradually phased out. These measures are intended to mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and safeguard financial integrity, as per IMF’s statement. The program also includes improved transparency, regulation, and oversight of digital assets to protect consumers and investors while maintaining financial stability. By taking a step back from its cryptocurrency experiment, the Salvadoran government aims to rebuild confidence in its broader fiscal policies and align with IMF recommendations, a move expected to attract further international financial support and stabilize the economy. “IMF staff thank the Salvadorean authorities for the excellent collaboration and candid dialogue over the past months in the development of their economic reform program aimed at continuing to improve the prosperity of El Salvador and all of its people.” Criticisms President Nayib Bukele has staunchly advocated for Bitcoin as a key part of his administration’s economic strategy, investing heavily in the cryptocurrency to promote financial autonomy. Despite Bitcoin’s recent surge above $100,000, yielding a whopping 123.67% return on the government’s $269.7 million investment, the IMF’s conditions have compelled El Salvador to alter its BTC strategy. Critics argued that Bukele has now surrendered to the demands of global financial powers. As one financial analyst noted , Bukele’s decision to take a $3.5 billion loan from the IMF has led to accusations of selling out, calling it an ironic shift for someone who once criticized fiat currency.

37867271,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745483-dogecoin-the-gains-have-been-made?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1734668760,Dogecoin: The Gains Have Been Made (Rating Downgrade),"Summary Dogecoin surged over 240% in a few weeks, but recent metrics suggest the gains may have peaked. Network fees for DOGE spiked 330% year-over-year in November but have declined for nearly five weeks, indicating reduced usage. Daily active addresses hit over 1 million in mid-November but have since returned to normal levels, showing a drop in activity. Despite declines in fees and active addresses, DOGE's price remains near recent highs, suggesting a disconnect between usage and price. In the two months since I last covered Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) for Seeking Alpha, crypto's oldest 'memecoin' has enjoyed quite the rocket ship ride. Data by YCharts After ripping higher by over 240% in a matter of just a few weeks, I suspect the gains have been had in DOGE. In this update, we'll revisit some of the metrics and indicators I shared in my previous article, look at the technical setup for DOGE, and assess the broader 'memecoin' segment of the market. Revisiting Network Metrics When I wrote This Dog Wants To Run in late-October, there were several very specific on-chain metrics that I felt offered a favorable short-term setup to DOGE bulls. There is no question that we've seen network fees take off for DOGE in the last two months: Dogecoin (Token Terminal) Fees surpassed $552k in November. Which was about a 330% year-over-year gain over November 2023. To be clear, while this is a significant surge for Dogecoin, it's far less than what larger chains like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) typically do for monthly fees. More importantly, following the initial spike in fees in November, the trend in daily fees has been down for close to five weeks. This is indicative of declining usage. Recall what my leading indicator was for the expected rally in DOGE back in October: What I find interesting about this chart is over the last 5 years we've generally seen starts and peaks in active addresses lead price. In early 2021 active address growth lead coin price between March and May. It happened again between November 2023 and March 2024. The same appears to be happening again with Dogecoin active addresses grinding higher by about 20% starting at the beginning of September. To say that daily active addresses exploded following that article would be an understatement: Dogecoin (CoinMetrics) In mid-November, there was a five-day period when the chain had over 1 million DAAs each day. That has never happened on Dogecoin before. The problem is, activity has since fallen right back to normal levels, and yet price remains elevated. The big difference between this active address spike and the one that preceded it in the Spring is DAAs didn't lead price, price led usage. My general view is that it's more indicative of fundamental weakness than strength. But to recap, we now have declines in fees, declines in active addresses, and prices still holding closer to recent highs despite the drops in chain usage. I suspect the price will follow everything else lower. Technicals In October, I shared my technical thoughts on the DOGE price and shared what, I felt, was a clear breakout in a downward diagonal resistance trend line. I see a different signal in the chart now: DOGE (TrendSpider) This is a very different setup following what has been a magnificent rally since the end of October. But traders/investors should not overlook some of the warning signs on this chart. First, DOGE has now re-entered what is essentially a massive air-pocket between 20 cents and 36 cents. There was very little actual price discovery on the way up, and I suspect the same will be true on the way down. But that's admittedly just a guess. The bigger issues are the massive bearish divergences between November 13th and December 9th. The 200-day moving average - currently sitting at 17 cents, shows substantial downside risk if the coin were simply to revisit previous levels. Finally, DOGE isn't even technically oversold yet at a 14-day RSI of 32. This could grind much lower before any 'dead cat' bounce. DOGE/BTC Weekly (TrendSpider) It wasn't just the DOGE/USD chart where we had breakouts back in October. The DOGE/BTC chart also looked quite bullish for Dogecoin when I wrote my last DOGE piece. That too looks exhausted after the sizable move higher. In October, I felt 253 sats per DOGE was a fitting price target. DOGE smashed through that level and went all the way to 492 sats before falling back below 400. At minimum, I believe the market will take DOGE back to 250 sats though I certainly wouldn't rule out another 'overshoot' of that target to the downside since we had one to the upside. Memes and DOGE For me, one of the biggest reasons why DOGE has very limited upside from here (if any) is because there is now too much competition for liquidity in the memecoin segment. With the proliferation of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market, eight of the top hundred cryptocurrencies by market cap are memecoins - and five of those eight memecoins are dog-related. Memecoins (CoinMarketCap) Memecoins actually account for $91.5 billion of the $3.3 trillion total cryptocurrency market cap. Memecoins have been so popular, in part, due to platforms like pump.fun, that Artemis tracks memecoins as an industry segment in its benchmark index: YTD Crypto Benchmark Index (Artemis) At one point in December, the memecoin segment was up almost 400% year to date. Now at just 200% year to date, memecoins have given back almost half their 2024 gains in just a couple of weeks, and yet they're still leading the industry as a category in terms of year to date gains. There is a significant amount of 'extrinsic value' that is potentially going to get unwound in this market, and DOGE will not be immune from that. Closing Thoughts As has occasionally been the case through the existence of the coin, DOGE was a terrific trade back in October. However, the setup is very different now. The fundamental story has deteriorated, with fees and active addresses in clear decline since the November pops. The technical story looks rough in my estimation, judging by the bearish divergences on the DOGE/USD daily chart and the potential weakness against BTC that can be expected on the DOGE/BTC weekly chart. But the bottom line in my view is the harder they come, the harder they fall. Memecoins have owned the year as a segment, judging by percentage appreciation. I suspect 2025 is going to be very different than 2024. If you made bank on this DOGE run, I'd take the win.",NEGATIVE,BTC | DOGE | ETH,BTC | DOGE | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745483-dogecoin-the-gains-have-been-made?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37867271.jpeg

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-pepe-and-dogecoin-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In her technical analysis, she emphasized that the asset remains in an early Wave 3 phase within a bullish structure, despite the relatively quiet price action observed over recent sessions. By closely analyzing the 4-hour chart, CasiTrades has outlined key support levels, potential confirmation signals, and critical price targets for XRP’s next move. XRP Update! I believe #XRP is still in early W3. I know price action has been quiet, but the bullish structure remains valid! Support Levels to Watch On the 4-hour RSI, there’s still a bit of room to reach the support trendline. Testing our key support levels at $2.53… pic.twitter.com/UyRaINyhdU — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) December 18, 2024 Support Levels and RSI Observations According to the analysis, XRP is currently hovering near crucial support levels. Specifically, CasiTrades identifies $2.53 and $2.48 as critical areas to watch. These levels serve as essential zones for XRP’s bullish continuation, and a failure to hold them could disrupt the broader bullish outlook. Traders and investors are advised to monitor these supports closely as a test of these levels could occur in the short term. CasiTrades further highlights the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) in her analysis. The RSI indicates room for further downward movement toward the support trendline, which aligns with the price action testing these critical support zones. This confluence between RSI behavior and price support underscores the importance of these levels in maintaining the bullish structure. Confirmation of Wave 3 Continuation CasiTrades notes that XRP is still in the corrective phase until it can confirm the continuation of Wave 3 by breaking above the previous local high of $2.90. Achieving this breakout is critical as it would validate the next leg of the bullish structure and serve as a strong indicator that XRP is moving toward larger price targets. It is important to note that corrective phases are a normal part of price action, particularly in the context of Elliott Wave Theory. As long as the key support levels are intact, the bullish outlook remains valid. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Wave 3 Targets CasiTrades highlights a series of significant Fibonacci-based Wave 3 price targets for XRP, contingent upon a successful break above $2.90. The first key target is $3.23, based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, marking an important milestone in the asset’s progression. Higher targets include $3.81 at the 2.618 extension, $4.40 at the 3.618 extension, and $4.98 at the 4.618 extension. These levels provide traders and analysts with a clear roadmap for XRP’s upward trajectory and reflect the broader potential for Wave 3 completion. The Broader Perspective While short-term movements appear somewhat volatile, CasiTrades encourages traders to maintain a larger time-frame perspective. By zooming out to the 4-hour chart, she notes that the broader structure remains bullish. Short-term price movements, while sometimes “messy,” are part of XRP’s natural progression within the Elliott Wave framework. This analysis aligns with the principle that smaller-degree subwaves can often be less reliable, particularly in certain market conditions. By focusing on the larger degree waves, traders can avoid overreacting to minor fluctuations and maintain confidence in the overall bullish trend.

37873778,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321384,1734668475,Tornado Cash Co-Founder Seeks Dismissal of Criminal Charges After Court Rules Sanctions Unlawful,"Roman Storm, co-founder of the crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash, is urging a U.S. federal judge to dismiss all criminal charges against him. The appeal comes after a ruling by the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, which found that sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash’s smart contracts by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) were unlawful. In a motion filed on December 18 in a Manhattan district court, Storm argued that the appeals court decision exposes fatal flaws in the legal basis for the charges against him. Legal Charges are Legally Flawed His legal team asserted that the ruling “makes clear that all three counts of the indictment are fatally and legally flawed.” Central to Storm’s argument is the charge of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a key component of U.S. sanctions enforcement. The appeals court concluded that Tornado Cash’s smart contracts are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered or controlled by any person or entity. The court noted that these contracts are not “property” under the IEEPA, and therefore, cannot be subject to sanctions. The “creators [of Tornado Cash] would be powerless to stop [the smart contracts],” the Fifth Circuit stated, adding, “Mr. Storm could no more choose to stop them than he could choose to stop the sun from rising.” Storm contends that this ruling should also result in the dismissal of charges related to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He argued that Tornado Cash is not a financial institution and emphasized that the protocol became immutable in May 2020 — four months before the alleged conspiracy began. As a result, he claims there was no possible “agreement” to launder money using the platform. The Fifth Circuit’s ruling was the result of a legal battle launched in September 2022 by six Tornado Cash users, backed by Coinbase, against the U.S. Treasury and OFAC.

DOJ Files Charges Against Tornado Cash Devs The U.S. Department of Justice charged Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov in August 2023, accusing them of helping launder over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, including funds linked to North Korean hacker group Lazarus. Semenov, a Russian national, remains a fugitive. Tornado Cash’s third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in the Netherlands in August 2022 and is currently in pre-trial detention. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash , citing its role in enabling anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. The agency acted after Tornado Cash facilitated the laundering of over $7b in virtual currency since 2019. The sanctions targeted Tornado Cash for failing to implement strong controls against misuse by cybercriminals. Despite its public focus on privacy, the platform was repeatedly used to launder cybercrime proceeds.

37867111,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630830,1734668332,BlackRock’s new BTC Ad sparks outrage among holders due to supply disclaimer,"BlackRock, the most dominant asset manager globally, released an advert promoting Bitcoin. However, the advert has since received a backlash from crypto holders due to a disclaimer that questions cryptocurrency’s fixed supply. The video is displayed on BlackRock’s website under the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF page. The three-minute clip walks viewers through the evolution of money and the key principles of Bitcoin. One of the critical foundations of Bitcoin is its supply, which is fixed at 21 million Bitcoins. While the video, like any advert, explains the advantages of Bitcoin’s fixed supply, there is a part with a disclaimer cautioning viewers about future changes in the supply cap. “There is no guarantee Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” The disclaimer is the bone of contention, with Bitcoin maximalists who feel the 21 million Bitcoin supply is a sacred tenet that makes the crypto’s status as “hard money” taking offense. BlackRock leverages controversy to attract publicity The controversial caption runs for about five seconds and fades away, leaving the narrator elaborating on the importance of fixed supply without touching on the disclaimer. Most observers would have skipped the disclaimer, but Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, sharing it on his X account on Tuesday was the game changer. Although the disclaimer appears like a footnote in the video, most crypto enthusiasts are raising concerns. One key player in the crypto space, Anatoly Yakovenko, registered his displeasure: This is the problem with tradFi. They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them. BlackRock and Saylor need to commit that their full nodes will always guarantee a 21m supply, and they will only call the fork that their full nodes follow Bitcoin. ~ Anatoly Yakovenko BlackRock is not making the controversial disclaimer for the time. In June 2023, while filling for the ETF , it had a footnote indicating that “a hard fork could change the source code to the Bitcoin network, including the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap.” The consistent undertone about altering the total supply of Bitcoin is not a comfortable discussion with Bitcoin lovers. Could BlackRock influence changes in Bitcoin supply? There is a say in the marketing and public relations space that publicity is negative or positive publicity. BlackRock’s controversial disclaimer is proving the saying. Bitcoin lovers and most crypto analysts are caught in the middle of this Bitcoin supply debate. Some argue that BlackRock might use its authority as one of the top Bitcoin holders globally to influence changes to the Bitcoin network. However, it isn’t easy to wish away the concerns about undoing the supply cap. Any alteration in the supply might affect Bitcoin’s financial incentive to maintain its status quo as the best crypto. It’s difficult to understand why BlackRock has constantly made it an issue.

37866948,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630091,1734668075,Gaming Meets Finance: Play-To-Earn and Beyond,"Gaming and Finance – the convergence of these two topics might seem weird at first, but with the rise of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, people are really seeing a seismic shift in how you can interact with either of the two industries. Traditional gaming has mainly been about being entertained, but due to the introduction of technologies like the blockchain, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible Tokens (NFTs), gaming today can be so much more. Not only can technologies like these provide gamers with more immersive experiences, but they also create opportunities that can bring more economic empowerment into the equation, especially for regions that have limited access to traditional job markets. The Evolution of Play-to-Earn Gaming Play-to-Earn gaming mostly has its roots in blockchain technologies, which introduced the concept of so-called true digital ownership. Games like CryptoKitties pioneered this concept back in 2017, allowing players to trade and own unique virtual assets. Real momentum came with the game Axie Infinity in 2020: It combined elements of Pokémon-style gameplay with blockchain mechanics, which enabled players to earn cryptocurrency by participating in battles, breeding creatures called Axies and selling them to other players. For the first time, gaming became more than just a way to pass time – it became a livelihood for thousands, especially in developing countries like the Philippines or Venezuela, where earning potential eclipses local wages. Axie Infinity players earned Smooth Love Potion tokens that they could convert into real-world currency, creating an ecosystem where time spent gaming directly translated into monetary value. How Play-to-Earn Works Play-to-earn games utilize the blockchain and NFT technology, which allows decentralized ownership of different in-game assets. Generally, it works like this: In-game assets as NFTs: Items like weapons, characters, skins or even virtual land are represented as NFTs. These tokens are unique, scarce and can be traded on blockchain marketplaces. Earning mechanisms: Players earn cryptocurrency through completing tasks, winning battles and achieving milestones in the game. For example, Axie Infinity players earn SLP tokens, but Decentraland players earn MANA by monetizing their virtual real estate. Real-world value: Players can sell their earned tokens and NFTs on crypto exchanges or marketplaces, which they then can convert into other crypto assets or regular currency. The economic model this uses hinges on player participation and demand. The more players join, the higher the value of those in-game assets rises, creating a positive feedback loop, to a point. There are debates about how sustainable and scalable this is. Beyond Play-to-Earn: The Rise of GameFi The term “GameFi” (a neologism of gaming and finance) encapsulates a broader phenomenon that extends beyond the simple pay-to-earn mechanics we discussed previously. GameFi projects integrate complex financial concepts like staking, yield farming and even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within gaming ecosystems. For example: Yield Guild Games (YGG) : A decentralized guild where players pool resources that then get invested in P2E games to share profits. Illuvium : A blockchain-based RPG in which players can earn rewards by battling and exploring, but also stake tokens for even higher additional yields. Another dimension of GameFi that highlights the interplay of gaming and finance is the rise of crypto casinos. Platforms like Cryptopoker’s crypto casino leverage blockchain technology to provide transparent and provably fair gambling experiences. Players can stake cryptocurrencies on various games, ranging from virtual slot machines to poker and roulette, and earn rewards in the form of crypto tokens. While distinct from traditional play-to-earn mechanics, crypto casinos embody the same principles of digital ownership and decentralized economies. Their rapid growth underscores the expanding scope of blockchain’s influence in gaming, offering both opportunities for financial gains and cautionary tales about the risks of high-stakes gaming. Challenges Facing Play-to-Earn Games P2E gaming has been revolutionary, however, it also faces significant challenges in determining its long-term viability. Economic sustainability is a big problem – many pay-to-earn games rely on a constant influx of new players to sustain their economies, which can be resemblant of Ponzi schemes if poorly managed. Rewards for existing players are often funded by investments of newcomers – once growth is stagnating, the value of on-game tokens and other assets can depreciate and even downright plummet, which leaves late starters at a big disadvantage. Equally, even though P2E games have created opportunities in many low-income regions, the cost of entry is prohibitively high for many. Axie Infinity required players to purchase three Axies initially, which during peak market conditions could cost hundreds of dollars. This barrier has led to the rise of scholarship programs, which allowed asset owners to lend NFTs to players in exchange for a share of their earnings. Blending gaming and finance has also not gone unnoticed by regulatory bodies worldwide – there have been questions around which classification P2E tokens should receive, and thus, what taxation of earnings should be used. Equally, compliance with anti-money laundering laws could hinder the growth of the entire industry. Lastly, especially early P2E games have been prioritizing economic incentives over actual gameplay quality, which lead to a lot of criticism. P2E games had quite a lot of bad rep because they lacked the depth and polish more traditional games have. Balancing financial incentives with actually engaging, and immersive experiences needs to be a must to ensure the longevity of these games. Opportunities and Innovations in GameFi Despite challenges, the fusion of gaming and finance continues to inspire innovation. Several emerging trends are poised to shape the next phase of the industry: Interoperability of Assets : The blockchain allows for cross-platform compatibility, enabling players to use NFTs across multiple games or virtual worlds. For instance, a sword earned in one games could be used as a collectible or weapon in another. Metaverse Integration : The concept of the metaverse – a shared, persistent virtual universe – is deeply intertwined with many ideas of GameFi. Projects like Decentraland and The Sandbox create entire metaverse ecosystems in which players can socialize, build and monetize virtual experiences. AI-Driven Game Economies : AI tools are used to model and manage in-game economies, which ensures fairer distribution of resources and prevents the hyperinflation of tokens. Hybrid Models : Developers are experimenting with hybrid models that blend more traditional pay-to-play and free-to-play systems with P2E elements. This approach could attract casual gamers while still offering opportunities for financial rewards. Decentralized Governance : DAOs are empowering players to have a bigger say in the development and governance of their gaming ecosystems. This democratic approach fosters much bigger community engagement, ensuring that game economies evolve more in line with actual player interests. The Socioeconomic Impact of Play-to-Earn Gaming Play-to-earn gaming has profound implications for socioeconomic empowerment. By providing access to global financial systems, P2E games have enabled people in developing nations to earn a living wage in new ways. Especially during times of economic hardships, like in Venezuela, a country grappling with hyperinflation, P2E gaming offers a great alternative to the unstable local currencies. And in the Philippines, P2E games have also often times been used to ensure bills and other things like tuition can be paid. Being able to democratize opportunities like this really highlights the potential of gaming as a real tool for financial inclusion. The Future of Gaming and Finance As the gaming and finance sectors continue to intertwine, the boundaries between virtual and real economies are becoming increasingly blurry. The future of GameFi will likely involve a fusion of different technologies: Web3 Infrastructure : The decentralized internet will serve as the backbone for GameFi ecosystems, enabling secure transactions and greater user control. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) : Immersive technologies will enhance the appeal of metaverse projects, making virtual economies more engaging and lifelike. Tokenized E-Sports and Streaming : Gamers and streamers could tokenize their brands, allowing fans to invest directly in their success. In this future, gaming will not just be a source of entertainment – it will become a cornerstone of the global digital economy.",POSITIVE,MANA,AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | MANA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/gaming-meets-finance-play-to-earn-and-beyond/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37866948.jpeg

37866676,https://coinpedia.org/?p=395345,1734667665,XRP Price Prediction For December 20,"The post XRP Price Prediction For December 20 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s XRP has drifted to the red zone and is currently down by more than 2 percent. XRP has been trading within a range of approximately $2.20 to $2.70 over the past few days, showing limited movement on the larger time frames. The altcoin has recently experienced a slight pullback , which has led to the invalidation of a previous bullish breakout pattern. While the price has not changed significantly, it remains within a potential bull market structure. The strong resistance level is around $2.90 to $3, where selling pressure has consistently been observed. On the lower end, there is support near $2, which has been tested multiple times and serves as the lower boundary of XRP’s current trading range. If the price breaks below $2, it may hint further downside. Understanding The Support and Resistance Levels The breakout had been confirmed at around $2.35, but the price closed below this level, invalidating the pattern and suggesting that further upside momentum is unlikely in the near term. The immediate support level in the short term is around $2.30 to $2.31, which is currently holding, but if it breaks, the next support lies around $2.23, with further downside possible towards the $2 level. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit To End Soon? SEC Prepares For ‘Potential’ Shutdown , It will also most likely drop to $1.90. After reaching $1.90, the key question is whether XRP can hold that level. If it breaks $1.90, the market will enter a bear phase, and the bullish trend will be over. However, that hasn’t happened yet, so it’s too early to make any conclusions. However, if XRP holds $2.30, it could rise to $2.60. If it breaks above $2.60, we can consider $3 as the next target. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37866438,https://nulltx.com/?p=135979,1734667251,"Vitalik Buterin: XRP is Better than Bitcoin, Ripple Rival Eyes 12,050% Hike by Q1 2025","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stirred the crypto community with his surprising comment claiming Ripple’s XRP is better than Bitcoin. This statement shocked many, given the stark price differences between XRP ($2.51) and BTC ($104,085). How could XRP be better than BTC? According to Vitalik, XRP’s technological advantages, such as faster transaction speeds and lower fees, make it better than BTC. He claims these features make XRP better suited for real-world applications than BTC. Amid this heated discussion on Vitalik Buterin’s comments, a Ripple rival, RCO Finance (RCOF), is making waves with its innovative features and real-world utility. Analysts project this cutting-edge project could surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025, making it a top pick for investors seeking high-growth opportunities. Why Vitalik Buterin Says XRP Is Better Than Bitcoin Vitalik Buterin’s avid endorsement of Ripple’s native token, XRP, highlights its undervalued utility, making it a more innovative altcoin than Bitcoin. Here are some of the advantages XRP has over BTC. Ripple’s XRP offers faster transaction speed at lower fees. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) model is secure, it is notoriously slow and expensive. However, Ripple’s XRP offers near-instant transactions at low fees, making it more efficient, especially for everyday use. This utility has led to XRP’s integration into global financial networks, especially for cross-border payments. According to Vitalik Buterin, this has made it a key player in traditional institutions’ growing adoption of blockchain technology. This extends its value past speculative trading, offering more tangible value in the financial sector. Bitcoin’s energy-intensive PoW mining process is a cause of concern because of its environmental impact. This greatly limits its scalability, causing investors and developers alike to look for more energy-efficient options like XRP, which aligns with Vitalik Buterin’s outlook that the former is better than BTC. RCO Finance: The Ripple Rival Ready for a 12,050% Surge Similar to XRP, RCO Finance’s unique value proposition makes it a better investment. Backed by its innovative AI technology and real-world utility, RCOF is steadily making a name for itself and showing why it’s poised to surge by 12,050% by Q1 2025. At its core, RCO Finance leverages advanced AI tools to empower users with data-driven insights and personalized investment strategies.

RCOF’s blockchain infrastructure is designed to be compatible with multiple chains, enhancing flexibility and accessibility.

37866399,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665302,1734667228,Hut 8 Bitcoin Holdings Now Over $1 Billion With Latest Buy,"Major North American Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8 has further expanded its BTC holdings with a $100 million acquisition. This latest purchase has pushed the company’s total reserves to over 10,096 BTC, valued at more than $1 billion at current market prices. Hut 8 Bitcoin Reserves Top $1 Billion The Miami-headquartered cryptocurrency mining firm continues to increase its Bitcoin reserves, undeterred by BTC’s recent price surges. In its latest announcement, Hut 8 revealed the purchase of approximately 990 BTC for $100 million, at an average price of $101,710 per Bitcoin. Related Reading: Metaplanet To Expand Bitcoin Holdings With $11.3 Million Bond Sale This acquisition has propelled Hut 8’s total BTC holdings to over $1 billion, with the coins acquired at an average cost of $24,485 per Bitcoin. The move reflects the company’s strategy of combining low-cost BTC production with what it views as strategic market buys to maximize returns and strengthen its reserve assets. Notably, Hut 8’s recent purchase positions it among the top 10 largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. MicroStrategy remains the leader on this list, holding more than 250,000 BTC on its balance sheet. Commenting, Asher Genoot, CEO, Hut 8, said: We believe deeply in our operating business and that building a strategic Bitcoin reserve will fortify our financial position as we pursue large-scale growth initiatives across power and digital infrastructure. Additionally, as we scale operations and extend our cost advantage in Bitcoin production, we anticipate that the flywheel effect will enable us to grow our holdings organically at a significant discount to market prices, strengthening the yield of our reserve strategy. Echoing these sentiments, Hut 8 CFO, Sean Glennan explained that making BTC a reserve asset was a key component of the company’s strategy to deliver “superior returns” to shareholders through strategic treasury management. He added that the company is open to deploying its BTC reserve to support business objectives, such as upgrading its mining fleet. Earlier this month, Hut 8 unveiled a massive $750 million initiative aimed at general corporate objectives, debt repayment, and bolstering its Bitcoin reserve. On a year-to-date basis, Hut 8’s stock has surged by over 102%, trading at $27.11 at the time of writing. 4 Mining Firms Among Top 10 Corporate BTC Holders While companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block, and Coinbase are well-known among the top corporate Bitcoin holders, four Bitcoin mining firms also feature on this prestigious list, namely, Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8, Riot Blockchain, and CleanSpark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Adoption Grows As Rumble Unveils $20 Million BTC Treasury Strategy Last year, Riot Blockchain reported a significant increase in its BTC holdings. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin mining firm holds a total of 8,490 BTC. Similarly, earlier this month, Marathon Digital Holdings purchased another 703 BTC to increase its total reserves to 34,794 BTC. This move aligns with Marathon CEO’s previous statement that institutions are “waiting to buy up” Bitcoin. In October, CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford predicted that BTC may peak around $200,000 in the next 18 months. At press time, BTC trades at $100,543, down 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

37866541,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52654,1734667193,Here’s Why RLUSD is Ripple’s Trojan Horse for DeFi and Banking,"In a recent tweet, Adam Cochran, Managing Partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, has spotlighted Ripple’s newly launched stablecoin , RLUSD, as a potential game-changer in the crypto and financial ecosystems. Cochran, a longstanding critic of Ripple, has reevaluated his stance, calling RLUSD Ripple’s most significant move in years. His analysis, shared through a video accompanying his tweet, outlines the unique RLUSD potential to revolutionize DeFi, Forex markets, and institutional banking. Why $RLUSD is @Ripple 's Trojan Horse for DeFi and Banking: I've been hard on XRP over the years, and almost missed why their new stablecoin would be useful, but after a deeper dive, I changed my mind and think it's probably their strongest move in years. pic.twitter.com/KW6TKqtcoD — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) December 17, 2024 RLUSD: Not Just Another Stablecoin Unlike conventional stablecoins such as USDC or USDT, RLUSD is fully regulated, bank-backed, and custodied by U.S. financial institutions. It adheres to strict compliance measures, including oversight from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple has also secured critical regulatory approvals, such as the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license, and aims to ensure RLUSD’s compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. This level of compliance distinguishes RLUSD from many existing stablecoins, aligning it with institutional needs and making it a robust tool for enterprises, banks, and financial entities. Additionally, RLUSD will be issued on Ripple’s native blockchain and Ethereum, bridging traditional financial institutions with decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Unlocking the Ripple Ecosystem Ripple has faced challenges in expanding the utility of its XRP Ledger (XRPL). While it introduced features such as Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and token issuance formats, adoption has been limited. RLUSD addresses a key gap: the inability to price assets in U.S. dollars within Ripple’s ecosystem. With RLUSD, institutional participants can now price Real-World Assets (RWAs), Forex trades, and other financial instruments directly in USD, enhancing the appeal of Ripple’s native AMM functionalities. Moreover, RLUSD opens pathways for Ripple to incentivize XRP liquidity through USD-XRP trading pairs. By bringing liquidity on-chain, Ripple can capture yield opportunities currently benefiting centralized exchanges. This strategic shift could bolster XRP’s ecosystem by redistributing value to the network and its participants. A Trojan Horse for Institutional Markets Cochran emphasizes that RLUSD’s greatest potential lies in its appeal to institutional markets, particularly Forex settlement and debt issuance. The Forex market handles trillions of dollars in daily transactions, often through outdated and fragmented banking systems. Ripple’s ability to offer a compliant, yield-bearing, USD-backed stablecoin could streamline these processes and position Ripple as a leading alternative settlement network. RLUSD’s integration with programmability upgrades—such as Hooks and a forthcoming Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain—further solidifies its utility. These enhancements will enable DeFi applications, creating opportunities for more sophisticated financial products on Ripple’s blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Stablecoin Market Opportunity Cochran also highlights the growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). With over $140 billion in circulation, stablecoins generate substantial yields for their issuers. RLUSD’s entry into this market, particularly in the EU where Tether lacks regulatory approval, could position Ripple as a major player. If Ripple captures a significant share of this market, it stands to generate billions in annual yield revenue, which could be reinvested into its ecosystem. A Path Forward for Ripple RLUSD represents a pivotal step in Ripple’s long-term vision of bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. By addressing regulatory concerns, enhancing ecosystem programmability, and tapping into institutional markets, Ripple strategically positions itself to capture value across multiple financial sectors. Cochran concludes that while Ripple’s early ambitions of competing with SWIFT remain challenging, RLUSD’s potential to unlock trillions in value from Forex settlement, debt instruments, and RWAs could make previously speculative price predictions for XRP more realistic.

37873777,https://cryptonews.com/?p=321368,1734665512,"Bitcoin Price Drops Below $100K: El Salvador’s $1.4B IMF Deal and 6,000 BTC Reserves","Bitcoin price slips below $100,000 as El Salvador has struck a $1.4 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), forcing adjustments to its Bitcoin policy while maintaining its commitment to the cryptocurrency. Despite restrictions outlined in the agreement, the country remains steadfast in its Bitcoin strategy, holding nearly 6,000 bitcoins valued at approximately $596 million. Adjustments to Bitcoin Policies The IMF agreement requires El Salvador to limit public sector involvement in Bitcoin. Taxes will now be payable only in US dollars, and the government’s role in the Chivo e-wallet, previously central to Bitcoin adoption, will be scaled back. Additionally, Bitcoin usage by private businesses will remain voluntary. These changes aim to address international concerns over fiscal management and market volatility. However, the El Salvadoran government has reiterated its commitment to purchasing more Bitcoin for strategic reserves, signaling continued confidence in its long-term value. El Salvador just bought 11 Bitcoin The country just received a $1.4 billion dollar loan from the IMF and today they bought $1M in Bitcoin. LETS FUCKING GO. @nayibbukele pic.twitter.com/WddEAXs6hw — The ₿itcoin Therapist (@TheBTCTherapist) December 20, 2024 El Salvador’s Strategic Bitcoin Initiatives Despite the IMF restrictions, El Salvador continues to expand Bitcoin-related initiatives: Educational Programs: The government has introduced “Little HODLer Workbooks” for elementary students and continues developer training through the CUBO+ program, with over 20 graduates expected in January 2025. Capital Market Development: El Salvador recently issued tokenized US Treasuries on Liquid through NexBridgeSV, further integrating Bitcoin into its financial system. High School Programs: Initiatives like Mi Primer Bitcoin and Node Nation are being integrated into high school curricula to foster crypto literacy among younger generations. Broader Implications for Bitcoin Price El Salvador’s policies showcase the balancing act between adhering to IMF conditions and preserving its Bitcoin vision. The government’s commitment to increasing reserves contrasts with the IMF’s caution about the risks posed by Bitcoin’s volatility. El Salvador has received a $3.5 billion financing package from the IMF. The agreement? Ditch Bitcoin. Reverse having Bitcoin as legal tender and delete their Chivo Bitcoin wallet. The maxis always say “fiat is trash”, but look how quick Bukele got bought out by the globalist… pic.twitter.com/qGGlrOc351 — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 18, 2024 These tensions come at a time when Bitcoin’s global price has dropped from over $108,000 to $105,000 due to broader economic factors, including Federal Reserve rate adjustments. Key Takeaways: IMF Conditions: El Salvador will limit public sector Bitcoin involvement but maintain voluntary use for private businesses. Bitcoin Reserves: Nearly 6,000 bitcoins, worth $596 million, remain in El Salvador’s strategic reserve. Educational Investments: Programs like CUBO+ and Mi Primer Bitcoin aim to build crypto literacy. While the IMF deal imposes new restrictions, El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin positions it as a unique case study in national cryptocurrency adoption. The evolving policy landscape will likely influence Bitcoin’s role on the global stage. Bitcoin Price Technical Outlook – Dec 20, 2024 Bitcoin has slipped below critical support levels, currently trading near $96,220. The failure to hold the $99,549 pivot point reflects bearish sentiment, driven by a breakdown from an ascending trendline. Immediate resistance lies at $99,549, followed by $102,704 and $105,714. On the downside, $94,340 serves as the next support, with additional levels at $92,712 and $90,874. The RSI at 20 indicates oversold conditions, suggesting a potential relief bounce. However, the 50 EMA, now at $102,704, continues to slope downward, reinforcing a bearish bias. Bulls must reclaim the $99,549 level to regain momentum, while a sustained break below $94,340 could accelerate selling pressure. Key Insights: Immediate Resistance: $99,549; Immediate Support: $94,340. RSI at 20.62 signals oversold conditions, but bearish momentum prevails. Breakdown below $99,549 confirms a short-term bearish trend. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s outlook remains bearish, with sellers firmly in control. Monitoring the RSI and $94,340 support level will be key to anticipating potential rebounds. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 $BEST Wallet Raises $4.98M: Last Chance to Invest Best Wallet continues to revolutionize Web3, now supporting thousands of cryptocurrencies across 50+ major blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.

37865529,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665519,1734665449,XRP Price Readies For Record-Breaking Peaks As Bollinger Bands Signal 490% Upswing,"As the cryptocurrency market faces a significant price correction—led by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which have retraced 2.2% and 4.6% respectively—the XRP price shows early signs of a potential explosive surge. Currently trading at $2.21, the XRP price has recorded a nearly 5% gain in the past 24 hours, finding strong support just below its current price. This positions the token favorably for continued upward momentum, particularly since it began an upward trend on November 5, bolstered by President-elect Donald Trump’s re-election. $10.82 Target For The XRP Price Following Historical Patterns Interestingly, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the XRP price, especially considering a key technical indicator: the Bollinger Bands. This volatility indicator, which consists of a moving average and upper and lower bands, is currently tightening on the 12-hour chart. Related Reading: Ethereum To Outpace Solana In 2025, Bitwise CIO Asserts Analyst Steph has noted that the last time the Bollinger Bands exhibited such a pattern, the XRP price experienced a staggering 490% price explosion. If history repeats itself, this could propel XRP to a new all-time high of $10.82, significantly surpassing its previous record of $3.40 set in January 2018, according to the analyst. Adding to the bullish sentiment, another analyst known as Javon on X (formerly Twitter) has pointed out that XRP’s last full bull cycle saw an increase of over 600%. The analyst suggests that if the XRP price performs similarly, it could rise dramatically, potentially exceeding 6,800% to reach approximately $168. This projection hinges on the price moving above the 2.414 Fibonacci Extension level, which was valued at $3,06 during the previous cycle. However, some analysts are adopting a more conservative outlook. Key Levels At $2.42 And $2.92 In Focus DarkDefender has noted a clear break on the daily chart, predicting that the XRP price could retest the $2.42 level before breaking through $2.92. Should it surpass this threshold, targets of $3.43 and $5.85 could be in sight. DarkDefender had recently targeted $2.72, which the XRP price had successfully bounced back from, reaffirming the validity of his analysis. Related Reading: 400 Billion Shiba Inu Moved: Is A SHIB Price Crash Coming? Despite differing views on the potential extent of the surge, consensus among analysts is that the XRP price is likely to reach a new all-time high in the coming months. This optimism is further strengthened by the possibility of regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. The President-elect has promised a new regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States, which could pave the way for resolving the prolonged legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which previously stifled the XRP price, leading to a lengthy period of consolidation.

This has been a long-form debate among football fans as the promotion of betting, as heavy as it is in football, has been perceived as a negative. This is obviously based on the negative connotations of betting as a whole and with football and the Premier League being the biggest sport in the world, having a constant betting reminder on kits in front of young fans, people of religion and people who have a negative relationship with betting, isn’t the best sign and isn’t as marketable as the Premier League wants to be. As we move forward, the betting sponsorships will be (slightly) removed from the game we love. We say slightly because the kits themselves cannot have betting sponsorships on the front, but, the betting sponsors on the sleeves and with the kits themselves will still be allowed. So overall, the change is fairly small. In the wake of these sponsorships being banned, we turn to the question: instead of Premier League betting sites or betting sites as a whole being the sponsorships, who will take over as the most used sponsor for these Premier League clubs? Cryptocurrency I think when we look at the similarities between crypto and betting, there is a huge overlap between the two. Crypto is a long-term financial investment whereas betting is a short-term and more risky version of the same thing. The reason why betting sponsors are so common is because the sports betting industry is so lucrative for the companies and the teams they sponsor. Crypto is daily similar, the money in crypto is huge and cryptocurrencies will be looking at premier league clubs as a form of marketing to get their name out there. If more people are investing in crypto, there is more money to be made and that is the goal behind every sponsorship. As well as this, there are already links between crypto and football, with certain crypto sites looking to the football industry and its fans with football-themed coins, as well as teams like Manchester City, having delved into the crypto sponsorship market already. Technology Sponsors We understand that this point is incredibly vague, but the technology is one of the biggest powerhouses in the entire world. Not only is the industry growing and changing every single day, but it also is financially the biggest industry in the world. Because technology is forever changing and billions of dollars are being invested each year, the finances are perfect for Premier League clubs. Being a sponsor on one of the biggest teams in the world’s shirts is enough marketing and exposure for years to come and with these sponsorships usually being locked deals for years and years, these companies will be licking their lips. Car Sponsors We have already seen car sponsorships throughout the years in the Premier League, if you have a good memory, you will remember Manchester United’s Chevrolet sponsorship all those years ago and this is a good sign for the car companies as they know clubs will be interested in their sponsorship offers. The car industry is, again, financially huge and compared to the crypto industry, the car industry is a lot safer and less risky to push into fans’ faces.

These aren’t your typical crypto investments. They combine spot Bitcoin and Ethereum into one package, making it easier—and maybe even safer—for people to invest in the two biggest digital currencies at once. SEC has *approved* both the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF & Franklin Crypto Index ETF… Will initially hold both btc & eth. pic.twitter.com/5GUhhhXL7y — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 19, 2024 Bitcoin Meets Ethereum in a Balanced Package There are so many crypto ETFs running already, so what is so special about these two? Instead of focusing on just Bitcoin or Ethereum, they mix both. The allocation depends on the market value of each, so investors get a well-balanced exposure. Why does this matter? It’s simple: putting everything into just one cryptocurrency can feel risky. By holding both, these ETFs spread out the risk and let you benefit from the strengths of each. For anyone who finds the idea of buying Bitcoin or Ethereum directly too overwhelming, these ETFs could be the answer. They simplify the process, making crypto investments more accessible to regular people. A Big Step for Crypto Investing The SEC’s decision to approve these ETFs shows that regulators are starting to take the crypto market seriously. This is a major milestone not just for the crypto space but for SEC as well. So why did these ETFs get approved? A key reason is the strong connection between Bitcoin and Ethereum futures and their spot prices. This link helps keep things stable and reduces the chances of manipulation, which is a big win for investors. These ETFs also follow strict guidelines to protect investors. They’re tied to agreements with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to monitor trading activity and keep everything above board. The SEC isn’t just handing out approvals—they’ve made sure these ETFs meet high standards for security and transparency. What’s Next ? This approval could open the door for even more creative investment options in the future. By combining Bitcoin and Ethereum, these ETFs simplify the process of getting into crypto. They remove the hassle of managing multiple wallets or worrying about buying and storing digital assets directly. And this could just be the start. Other cryptocurrencies might join similar ETFs down the road. For now, though, these Bitcoin-Ethereum combos are a big step forward.

37865220,https://nulltx.com/?p=135990,1734664774,"As BlockDAG Releases Its Whitepaper V3, Whales Drive $5M Daily Inflows Amid Bitcoin ETF and XRP Buzz","The crypto market continues to move toward innovations, with key developments driving momentum. Last week, Bitcoin spot ETF inflows skyrocketed to $2.17 billion in just five days, highlighting growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, XRP’s market holds potential bullish moves as its price hovers near critical levels, attracting attention. Among these trends, the spotlight rests firmly on one standout project: BlockDAG (BDAG) . This Layer-1 blockchain contender has become a favorite among enthusiasts and developers, thanks to its groundbreaking Whitepaper V3 . The paper introduces key innovations addressing scalability and security issues. With daily inflows exceeding $5 million and presale figures crossing $169 million, BlockDAG has set the bar high. Its GHOSTDAG protocol is a game-changer, offering unmatched transaction speed and security. This solidifies its position as a must-watch crypto for those focused on long-term potential. Bitcoin Spot ETF Inflows Soar to $2.17 Billion According to data shared by @WuBlockchain, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $2.17 billion over five consecutive trading days. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was the leading contributor, with $1.51 billion in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which brought in $598 million. These ETFs now account for 5.71% of Bitcoin’s total market cap, signaling their growing importance. However, there are mixed signals. Grayscale’s GBTC witnessed $221 million in outflows, reflecting a shift in preferences. Experts also warn that Bitcoin spot ETFs could amplify market volatility, creating challenges for smaller players. Despite these concerns, institutional interest remains strong, underscoring Bitcoin’s prominence in the crypto ecosystem. XRP’s Road to $2.70: Hope with Hurdles XRP continues to consolidate near $0.50, with bulls targeting a breakout to $2.70. The optimism stems from growing legal clarity and increased institutional attention. XRP’s unique utility in cross-border transactions keeps it on traders’ watchlists as a promising opportunity. That said, resistance at $0.55 has slowed momentum, and analysts caution against possible dips if this barrier isn’t broken. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties, while improving, still hover over XRP’s broader adoption prospects. Despite these hurdles, the market remains optimistic, positioning XRP as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. BlockDAG Presale Rockets to $169M Milestone! BlockDAG’s Whitepaper V3 is reshaping the Layer-1 blockchain space with features designed to solve industry-wide challenges. Its GHOSTDAG protocol enables simultaneous block creation, ensuring faster transactions and greater scalability while mitigating risks like double-spending and 51% attacks. The whitepaper’s vision includes EVM compatibility, which simplifies deploying Ethereum-based dApps on BlockDAG’s network. Future updates, such as cross-chain bridging, are also in the pipeline, unlocking interoperability that could drive significant ecosystem growth. This innovation has captivated developers, traders, and miners alike. The presale momentum is proof of its rising popularity. BlockDAG’s daily inflows exceed $5 million, and total sales have surpassed $169 million. More than 17.3 billion coins have already been sold, with prices surging from $0.001 in batch 1 to $0.0234 in the current batch 26. Early supporters have seen an impressive 2240% surge. Meanwhile, over $5.9 million in miner sales have been recorded, with nearly 15,000 miners sold. As more batches sell out quickly, the presale is moving closer to its $600 million goal. With ongoing market interest and developer adoption, BlockDAG is positioned for exponential growth. For those exploring promising blockchain solutions, this could be a pivotal moment to engage with one of the most talked-about projects in crypto. Closing Thoughts: BlockDAG Leads the Way While Bitcoin spot ETFs captured $2.17 billion in inflows and XRP traders eye a potential rise to $2.70, BlockDAG continues to dominate headlines. Its Whitepaper V3 has solidified its position as a leader in addressing blockchain’s pressing issues. With daily inflows surpassing $5 million and a record-breaking $169 million presale, BlockDAG is creating ripples across the industry. As its presale approaches new milestones, BlockDAG remains a top contender for those seeking transformative blockchain projects.

37865878,https://thecoinrise.com/from-neiros-legacy-to-btfd-coins-future-dont-miss-out-again/,1734664550,From Neiro’s Legacy to BTFD Coin’s Future: Don’t Miss Out Again,"The crypto market never sleeps, and neither do the opportunities to make life-changing gains—if you’re quick enough to catch them. Today, let’s dive into two meme coins that could leave you with serious FOMO if you don’t act fast: Neiro, the heartfelt underdog carrying Doge’s legacy, and BTFD Coin , the meme coin disrupting presales with a bang. Neiro might already be flying high, but if you missed its meteoric rise, don’t fret—BTFD Coin’s presale is still open and packing more potential than your favourite meme thread. Neiro: The Little Sister You Didn’t Know You Needed Neiro’s story reads like a Hollywood script: abandoned, rescued, and now a star in her own right. Once a stray dog in a shelter, Neiro was adopted by the same woman who owned Kabosu—the Shiba Inu behind the legendary Doge meme. Her journey from obscurity to fame mirrors the rise of her namesake meme coin, which burst onto the scene with a purpose: to combine internet culture with real-world impact. When Neiro launched on Ethereum during the New Moon on August 4th, 2024, the crypto community took notice. Even Vitalik Buterin himself gave the project his nod of approval, marking only the second time he has publicly supported a meme coin (the first being SHIB). His $500,000 donation to an animal welfare fund not only solidified Neiro’s credibility but also showcased its commitment to making a difference. With the original developer long gone, the community stepped up to take the reins, making Neiro a 100% community-owned project. This transparency and collective spirit have turned it into a meme coin with a heart, backed by donations to shelters and other charitable initiatives. But here’s the kicker: if you missed out on Neiro’s launch, you’ve likely missed its biggest gains. Early adopters are already reaping rewards, and unless you’re comfortable buying in at higher prices, the train may have left the station. BTFD Coin: Don’t Miss This One Too If Neiro has you feeling that sinking “missed ICO” feeling, don’t despair. There’s another meme coin making waves right now: BTFD Coin (short for “Buy the Dip”). It’s bold, it’s brash, and it’s built for those who love turning market chaos into opportunities. Currently in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is proving that it’s not just a cheeky name—it’s a serious contender in the meme coin world. Here’s the latest scoop: Current Price: $0.00013 Funds Raised: Over $4.2 million, including $1M in under 10 days and $2.5M within 14 days of its presale launch. Community Strength: Over 6,000 holders have already joined the Bulls Squad. Coins Sold: More than 57 billion BTFD Coins have been snapped up by eager investors. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. The project combines 90% APY staking rewards, an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , and a dedicated community of Bulls driving its momentum. And unlike some meme coins, BTFD Coin is built with longevity in mind, featuring locked liquidity and a vested token distribution to ensure stability. Investment Example: Don’t Let This One Slip By Let’s break down the numbers to see what’s on the table if you act now. At the current presale price of $0.00013, a $900 investment would secure you 6,923,077 BTFD Coins. Now imagine this: if the coin reaches its predicted post-launch value of $0.0006—a realistic target given the buzz surrounding it—your $900 investment could grow to a whopping $4,153.85. That’s a potential 360% return on your money. The presale is moving fast, so the clock is ticking. Don’t let this be another missed opportunity. Lessons from Neiro: Don’t Wait for the Moon to Strike Twice If there’s one thing Neiro’s rise has taught us, it’s that timing is everything in crypto. Those who got in early are now sitting pretty, while the rest of us are left wondering, What if? Neiro’s story isn’t just inspiring—it’s a reminder of what the meme coin space is all about: community, culture, and a little bit of chaos. And while it’s still a strong contender, the best time to invest in Neiro was yesterday. The second-best time? Well, maybe not today if you’re looking for explosive growth. This is where BTFD Coin steps in. With its presale still underway, it offers something Neiro can’t anymore: a chance to get in early and ride the wave from the ground floor. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let FOMO Win Again The crypto world is full of “what ifs” and “if onlys.” If you missed Neiro’s launch and its early gains, it’s easy to feel like you’ve missed your shot. But here’s the thing: the next big opportunity is always just around the corner. BTFD Coin’s presale is that opportunity. With its unique combination of staking rewards, a P2E game, and a strong community, it’s positioned to be the next big wave in the meme coin world. But presales don’t last forever, and neither do low prices. Don’t let BTFD Coin be another Neiro—a coin you regret not jumping on while you had the chance. Act now, join the Bulls Squad, and ride this wave to the moon.

The Brazilian media outlet Livecoins reported that the survey was conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) and made public on December 17. Brazilians Invest: 7%-35% of Investors Choosing Crypto, Bitcoin Survey Finds The regulator conducted its research in 2023. It spoke to “more than” 700 people about their investment behavior. The regulator asked respondents to classify themselves as “conservative,” “moderate,” or “bold” investors. On average, those in the former group said they hold 7.25% of their savings in crypto wallets . Brazil’s central bank announced it would sell as much as $3 billion in a spot auction on Thursday, its fourth such intervention this week amid a massive currency selloff. https://t.co/JBajlW6MS5 — Bloomberg (@business) December 18, 2024 “Moderate” investors, meanwhile, said that 21% of the “financial products” they used were cryptoassets. The most bullish of all those interviewed – those calling themselves “bold” – said that up to 35% of their portfolios were made up of crypto. Interestingly, around 50% of all those interviews said they were “bold” investors. This suggests that the majority of Brazilian investors are crypto-keen. The “conservative” investors said that over 50% of their portfolios were made up of “CDB and RDBs,” types of fixed-income securities that differ in liquidity and availability. They also favor public securities, with a smaller number of the same group opting for overseas currencies.

Stock market trading was by far the preferred form of investment for the “bold” investors, too. Over 90% of this group said their portfolios contained shares. The regulator said that it aims to “foster financial education” and forge an “increasingly democratic, transparent, and inclusive capital market.” It added: “The CVM aims to equip investors with the skills and abilities to make investment decisions in a safe and thoughtful manner. This survey highlights the fact that Brazilians seek knowledge on the subject [of investment] every year. We are resolute in our desire to help them on their journey by providing financial education.” The regulator has been proactive with approvals for both Bitcoin spot ETFs and altcoin ETFs.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

37863998,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630822,1734661918,MetaMask soft launches its debit card in the United States,"Leading self-custodial wallet MetaMask has made its debit card available to users in the United States through a limited pilot program. For now, only a few select users can access the card, and a date for the full release to the public has yet to be announced. The project shared the news via an announcement on its X account. Part of the post read, “Today we’re kicking off a limited pilot program in the United States where some of you will get your hands on MetaMask Card and try it out before it goes to a wider release.” Metamast tests the US markets The soft launch in the US is a precursor to a full-scale launch. Currently, the MetaMask card is only available to select areas in the US, with users in New York and Vermont not making the list. The MetaMask team went on to urge users who were not accepted into the pilot program to apply to join the waitlist. Users of MetaMask and other self-custodial wallets face the challenge of using their crypto funds to make payments for common goods and services directly without having to move these funds to centralized wallets or banks. The MetaMask card could be a game-changer in allowing crypto holders to easily complete transactions in real-time without first converting or transferring their crypto funds. According to Lorenzo Santos, senior product manager at Consensys, the parent company behind MetaMask, “MetaMask Card represents a major step to removing the friction that has existed between the blockchain and traditional payments. This is a paradigm shift that offers the best of both worlds.” He also added that the card pilot program gives people the freedom to spend crypto. The MetaMask card allows direct spending from self-custodial wallets To get the card, users have to first check their eligibility on their MetaMask portfolios before registering for the digital card. Once they go through these steps, they can then set it up as a payment method on their mobile devices as it can be integrated into Apple Pay and Google Pay. Funds that users can spend directly from the card include cryptos such as USDC, USDT, and WETH on the Linea network. They can also set spending limits for their card. The card launched in August of this year, and it allows users to spend the crypto they hold on MetaMask anywhere. This means that a MetaMask cardholder can use their card to make payments in fiat currency anywhere a Mastercard is accepted, thanks to their partnership with Mastercard and Baanx. At the time of its initial launch , the card was available in Europe and the UK, with the promise to roll it out in other locations. So far, the card is now operational in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Columbia. According to the partners, the card joins the Web2 world to Web3, by leveraging Mastercard’s merchant network, MetaMask’s security, the efficiency of the Linea network, and the depth of experience Baanx brings in building financial technologies and cards in the Web3 space.

37863808,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665039,1734661823,"Dogecoin Trading Volume Rises Over $6.5 Billion As Liquidations Cross $31 Million, What’s Going On?","The Dogecoin trading volume has surged in the last 24 hours, and liquidations have also risen during this period. The surge in these metrics has resulted from the significant price drop for Dogecoin, which is down over 5% in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Trading Volume And Liquidations Witness Significant Spike CoinMarketCap data shows that Dogecoins’s trading volume is up over 57% in the last 24 hours, with over $6 billion traded during this period. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Dogecoin’s liquidations have crossed $31 million, with $25 million and $5.8 in long and short positions liquidated, respectively. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Run To $11 ATH? Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer Long positions took the most hit as the Dogecoin price crashed below the $0.4 range. This development came following Jerome Powell’s speech, which painted a bearish picture for the foremost meme coin. As crypto analyst Kevin Capital revealed, Dogecoin’s technical indicators were already bearish, and the macroeconomic fundamentals only did more damage. Powell suggested that the US Federal Reserve will likely pause on the rate cuts next year, which immediately sparked a bearish sentiment among traders and led to a wave of sell-offs. This contributed to the spike in trading volume, as investors looked to offload their coins, considering how the Fed being hawkish is bearish for risk assets like Dogecoin. However, Kevin Capital believes that traders are overreacting to Jerome Powell’s speech. The crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin will recover this price correction, stating that the dip will be bought. However, it is worth mentioning Dogecoin’s correlation with Bitcoin, as Kevin Capital had previously pointed out that DOGE’s next move will depend on BTC. The Bitcoin price has dropped below the $100,000 psychological price level and looks bearish at the moment. As such, the Dogecoin price recovery is unlikely to happen until Bitcoin witnesses a bullish reversal. Increased Volatility Is Not Unusual Crypto analyst Master Kenobi also commented on the Dogecoin price drop, stating that increased volatility at this stage of the bull market is not unusual. However, the analyst suggested that traders should avoid being shaken out and instead hold on to their positions. This came as he claimed that market makers who will inject money into the market would prefer for market participants to walk away with a 90% loss rather than a 10x gain. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Recovery Toward $2 As Million-Dollar Whale Transactions Explode On The Network Bitcoinist recently reported that Dogecoin’s sentiment has turned negative once again, indicating that DOGE holders may be looking to sell their coins even at a loss. Kevin Capital had before now stated that the Dogecoin bull run is far from over, suggesting that there was no need to be bearish at the moment despite the price correction. He advised long-term holders just to sit back and wait for higher prices. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.36, down over 5% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bullish Trends Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In this bleeding cryptocurrency market, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, seems to have controlled itself from a major price decline as it holds crucial support. For XRP, the support at $2.20 plays an important role. Since the beginning of December 2024, the altcoin has reached this level more than four times, and each time it has experienced an upside rally. However, this time, sentiment appears to be similar, as the price has started moving upward. Long-Term Holders Rising Interest in XRP The current market sentiment appears negative, as the market has witnessed a significant $1.18 billion in crypto liquidations . This substantial liquidation has created fear among traders and investors, discouraging them from staying and participating in the asset. $220 Million of XRP outflow Despite the fear, traders and long-term holders seem optimistic about XRP, as they have purchased millions worth of tokens during this price decline, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from XRP spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a continuous and significant outflow of $220 million worth of XRP. Source: Coinglasss This outflow indicates a bullish outlook for XRP despite the ongoing price decline, as long-term holders continue to believe in the token. This explains why exchanges are experiencing substantial token outflows. In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to long-term holders’ wallets, signaling a potential upside rally and an ideal buying opportunity. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP appears bullish as the price is showing signs of a reversal from the crucial support level of $2.20. Based on the recent price action, the altcoin is near the buying zone, where it has typically experienced an upside rally. Source: Trading View If XRP holds the $2.20 support level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 13% to reach the next resistance level of $2.50 in the near future. On the other hand, if XRP falls below the support level and closes a daily candle below the $2.20 level, we could see XRP dropping to $2 or even lower in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.30 and has experienced a price surge of over 2.70% in the past 24 hours.

Qubetics Heats Up as the Best Coin to Buy for January 2025 Amid Filecoin’s Price Surge and Stacks’ DeFi Push,"Which cryptocurrencies could redefine financial landscapes in 2025? With so many options on the market, keeping an eye on promising developments is crucial. While many investors are focused on mainstream coins, emerging projects often hold the potential for exponential returns. Filecoin has been making headlines with its ambitious price predictions, and Stacks continues to garner attention for its innovative approach to blockchain utility. However, the spotlight is firmly on Qubetics ($TICS), a revolutionary blockchain platform that’s capturing the attention of analysts and investors alike. Its presale momentum and groundbreaking technology are turning heads in the crypto space. This article will cover the latest updates and developments around Qubetics, Filecoin, and Stacks—three of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025.

Qubetics ($TICS) has introduced a solution that makes this possible, empowering banks and financial institutions to streamline international transactions.

Filecoin: The Backbone of Decentralised Storage Filecoin is gaining traction as a decentralised storage network that aims to preserve the world’s most critical data securely.

Analysts predict the token’s value will reach an average price of $17.28 by 2024, $35.7 by 2027, and an impressive $58.8 by 2030. Launched in 2020, Filecoin employs advanced consensus mechanisms like proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime to ensure data integrity and security. Reducing storage costs and decentralising data retrieval are pivotal in the Web3 ecosystem, providing the infrastructure needed for decentralised applications (dApps). With its promising utility and growing adoption, Filecoin remains a solid choice for long-term investors. Stacks: Building Bridges to Bitcoin Stacks has positioned itself as a unique blockchain project that enhances Bitcoin’s functionality without altering its original code. It introduces smart contracts, decentralised apps, and DeFi capabilities to Bitcoin’s network. This layered approach ensures compatibility while unlocking new use cases for the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. Through its innovative Proof of Transfer (PoX) mechanism, Stacks aligns its incentives with Bitcoin miners, creating a mutually beneficial ecosystem. With a focus on usability and development, Stacks continues to attract attention as a platform that combines security, decentralisation, and scalability. Its role in expanding Bitcoin’s utility makes it a noteworthy project for 2025. Unmissable Presale Opportunity: Qubetics ($TICS) Qubetics is making waves with its presale, currently in Phase 13. Investors are snapping up $TICS tokens priced at $0.034. Weekly phase shifts bring a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% rise during the final stage. The excitement is palpable, with over $7.2 million raised, 10,800+ holders, and 359 million tokens sold. Imagine being part of a project with such robust backing and consistent growth. As the presale progresses, the scarcity and demand for $TICS only intensify, making it one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025 . Don’t miss your chance to secure tokens before the price hikes further. Conclusion: The Crypto Market Awaits Bold Investors As we head into 2025, the cryptocurrency market is brimming with opportunities for forward-thinking investors. Filecoin’s advancements in decentralised storage, Stacks’ integration with Bitcoin, and Qubetics’ groundbreaking cross-border payment solutions represent some of the most compelling narratives in the space.

The funding is part of the orgainzation’s most recent round of Bitcoin Development Fund grants. During the last round of the Bitcoin Development Fund Grant in 2022, the HRF granted $325,000 to various projects worldwide. This year, the organization has gone bigger and better, granting 7 BTC, approximately $706,000, to twenty projects worldwide according to the press release it sent to the Bitcoin Magazine. The HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund is focused on supporting projects that enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem. It especially has interests in regions where people live under unfavorable conditions. The program funds projects that promote decentralization, privacy, and education, and its goal is to empower individuals and communities facing oppressive regimes. HRF reaches a hand out The guarantees for the HRF’s Bitcoin development fund are projects in Latin America, Asia, and Africa that focus on technical education in regions with authoritarian governments. The organization did not disclose how much each of this round’s recipients will receive. However, it revealed that the 20 awarded projects will share a grand total of 7 BTC. The winning projects from this round include Stratum V2 Reference Implementation (SRI), an open-source software and Public Pool, an open-source mining pool. Both projects are centered around making Bitcoin more accessible and decentralized. Other projects include UI/UX Design for Bitcoin Core, No BS Bitcoin, Tando, YakiHonne, and many more. Each of these projects contributes to the accessibility and decentralization of Bitcoin in their various regions. HRF rewards odds-defying individuals Among the guarantees of the $706,000 grant are Naiyoma and Daniella Brozzoni. Naiyoma is the first female Bitcoin core developer from Africa. Kenya, where Naiyoma hails from, has experienced instances of electoral authoritarianism. Financial freedom and human rights are also under threat. Considering this, Naiyoma is dedicated to creating an open financial system rooted in transparency, freedom, and fairness. Her work focuses on reviewing pull requests, fixing bugs through new PRs, and improving Bitcoin Core’s code base. The HRF fund allocation is expected to support her work in advancing Bitcoin Core. Daniella Brozzoni is also a developer. She previously contributed to the Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), a software library that supports building cross-platform Bitcoin wallets. Like Naiyoma, Daniella now also focuses on Bitcoin Core, where her job includes reviewing key pull requests, contributing to new features, and improving test coverage. The work of these dedicated developers will contribute to the decentralization of Bitcoin making it more accessible, secure and resilient.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-ahead-of-first-exchange-listing-while-pepe-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Render is currently experiencing strong market momentum, indicated by its recent price increases and expanding partnerships that signal potential for future growth in its GPU-powered decentralized network. Stacks has achieved a significant milestone with the launch of the ‘Nakamoto’ upgrade, enhancing both speed and security, and it has set ambitious price targets following an increase in user engagement and smart contract activity. Web3Bay is introducing a transformative e-commerce ecosystem built on blockchain technology, aiming to revolutionize online shopping with enhanced security, community-driven governance, and versatile transaction options. As each project develops, Web3Bay is particularly notable for its innovative approach to merging decentralized shopping experiences within a community-oriented platform. Render Sees Growing Momentum Render has been capitalizing on bullish market trends, supported by its decentralized GPU rendering network that connects creators with GPU resources. This platform provides an economical and efficient solution for rendering tasks, gaining popularity among artists, developers, and creatives who require high-performance graphics at lower costs. With a significant 21.39% price increase over the past week, Render is garnering increasing market attention, especially as it nears critical price thresholds. Render’s growth is bolstered by strategic partnerships, including a recent collaboration with Apple, enhancing its credibility and market reach. Analysts are optimistic about RNDR’s potential, with projections of substantial price increases in the near future. Render’s dedication to delivering cost-effective, high-quality rendering services positions it as a preferred provider in the sector. Stacks Enhances Capabilities with Nakamoto Upgrade Stacks is strengthening its foundation for Bitcoin-based smart contracts with the Nakamoto upgrade, marking a significant advancement in transaction speed and security, which benefits developers of decentralized applications. This upgrade has contributed to a price surge of over 30% in the past month, driven by unprecedented levels of smart contract deployment and growing interest in its ecosystem. Stacks is increasingly recognized for its ability to extend Bitcoin’s functionality, attracting more users to decentralized finance and applications. With rising adoption and an increase in total value locked, there is a strong sentiment about STX’s potential for further gains. The project’s emphasis on enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities positions it as an exciting option for long-term decentralized solutions. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-commerce Web3Bay is redefining the online shopping experience with its blockchain-based e-commerce platform. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay offers a decentralized marketplace that empowers users to fully control their data and transactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay enhances security, transparency, and user experience, bridging the gap between conventional e-commerce and Web3. It supports transactions using both cryptocurrencies and mainstream payment methods like PayPal, broadening its accessibility. The 3BAY token, integral to Web3Bay’s operations, has shown impressive returns for early investors. During its presale stages, the price of 3BAY has consistently risen, achieving a remarkable 6430% return on investment for those who participated early. The strong demand and growth potential are evident as Web3Bay gears up for its full launch. Web3Bay’s unique model fosters significant network growth by rewarding active user engagement, making community interaction a key driver of its development. This community-centric approach, coupled with decentralized governance, ensures the platform remains responsive to user needs, promoting continued growth and adding value to the 3BAY token. As interest grows, many are recognizing 3BAY as a potential 100x asset, distinguishing it in today’s competitive market. With a progressive approach to e-commerce and a robust token economy, Web3Bay is positioning the 3BAY token as an attractive investment for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized, community-driven online commerce. In Conclusion While each project—Web3Bay, Render, and Stacks—brings unique strengths, Web3Bay’s comprehensive e-commerce ecosystem sets it apart as a standout choice. Render’s ongoing bullish momentum in the graphics field and Stacks’ ambitious targets with its Bitcoin-focused smart contracts are notable, but Web3Bay’s integration of blockchain technology with online shopping, creating a community-based marketplace, presents a compelling case. With high ROI potential and the prospect of becoming a next 100x asset, Web3Bay’s decentralized, user-centric model makes it an appealing choice for those exploring the innovative frontiers of e-commerce on the blockchain.

37861218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=665375,1734656451,Bitcoin’s Exchange Transactions Hit Record Lows—What This Means For BTC’s Price,"Bitcoin has experienced significant price movements in the past few days, largely influenced by macroeconomic developments and market fundamentals. Following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and a speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply below $99,000. However, the leading crypto quickly rebounded, climbing back to $104,000 earlier today before settling at $100,573 at the time of writing. This represents a 3.4% decrease over the past day and a roughly $67 billion reduction in its market cap valuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means Exchange Transactions Hit Record Lows Amid this price performance, CryptoQuant analyst known as Woominkyu provided insights into Bitcoin’s market activity, highlighting declining exchange transaction volumes. According to Woominkyu, historical data suggests a correlation between transaction volume spikes and significant price movements. For example, peaks in exchange transactions coincided with Bitcoin’s dramatic price surges in 2017 and 2021. However, recent data shows a marked decline in transaction volumes on both spot and derivative exchanges, reflecting reduced trading activity compared to previous years. This decrease, according to the CryptoQuant analyst may indicate “waning market participation,” suggesting a “period of consolidation or reduced volatility” in the near term. Bitcoin Key Support Levels and Technical Insights Market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has shed light on an important support zone forming just below the $100,000 mark. The data shared by the platform reveals that over 1.45 million BTC were accumulated at an average price of $97,500. This accumulation has established a significant demand zone, potentially serving as a “buffer” against further price declines. The importance of this level lies in its ability to provide a foundation for price stability, particularly as Bitcoin navigates its current phase of market correction. It is suggested that a breach below this zone could trigger further downward pressure, while holding above it might boost recovery efforts. Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, insights shared by market analyst Satoshi Wolf highlight the critical nature of Bitcoin’s current price levels. The cryptocurrency recently tested the $100,000 support, aligning with the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related Reading: Is The Crypto Bull Run Over? Top Exec Discusses The Market Crash This level is pivotal as it combines technical indicators with psychological significance. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nears oversold territory, signalling the potential for a price reversal. Wolf suggests that traders monitor for a confirmed breakout above $104,000 or a breakdown below $100,000, with volume confirmation being key to validating either. 📊 $BTC Analysis: The chart shows a recent pullback after a strong uptrend, suggesting potential profit-taking. Price is testing the 100,000 support, aligning with the 100 EMA, a crucial level to watch. If it holds, a bounce back towards 104,000 resistance is possible.

37861214,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313370,1734656430,"Ethereum To ‘Teleport Moonward’ Once ETH Breaks Above All-Time High, Says Guy Turner – Here Are His Targets","A widely followed crypto trader is laying out one bullish scenario for Ethereum ( ETH ) that could send the top altcoin to five digits in 2025. In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.58 million YouTube subscribers that ETH will likely break through its all-time high and enter an explosive phase this cycle. “Barring any black swan events spoiling our party, we should be able to take for granted that ETH will break through its previous all-time high of around $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Where it goes from there, though, is the real question. Because ETH has spent so much time sliding against BTC and wallowing in price purgatory, it can be difficult to imagine a parabolic repricing. However, once the all-time high is broken, there will be no historical levels of supply or resistance above. Price discovery will ensue, and ETH is likely to teleport moonwards.” Crypto traders and analysts refer to price discovery as a situation where a coin trades at levels never seen before or not having been seen in a long time. Next, the analyst uses Fibonacci extension levels to suggest that ETH may surge to $7,300 as a “base case,” which is the 1.618 Fibonacci level on the chart he shares. Traders use Fibonacci extensions in technical analysis to estimate profit targets and price pullbacks. They are based on Fibonacci ratios. Source: Guy Turner/YouTube However, he says if Bitcoin nearly doubles its current price next year and hits $200,000, ETH could surge even higher, to $14,600. “ETH has only just made it to the 0.786 [Fibonacci] level. So rather than doubling this price, we think doubling ETH price at the 1.618 level will give us a better upper limit of what could happen in 2025. This 1.618 level is about $7,300 which, again, we think is a pretty good base case target. Doubling this would give us $14,600. For an asset that has underperformed BTC so severely, this sounds like a tall order indeed, and it’s therefore the most extreme bullish case for 2025 that we can take seriously. If BTC touches $200,000 in 2025 orthodoxy suggests that profits will rotate into ETH. With BTC at such a high level, this could be enough capital to bring ETH up above $14,000.” Ethereum is trading for $3,686 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is trading for $101,143 at time of writing, down 4.6% on the day.

37877738,https://nulltx.com/?p=136010,1734656420,Best Meme Coins to Buy and Hold for Long-Term ROIs: BTFD Coin Rocks Presale Stats as Peanut the Squirrel and SPX6900 Plummet,"Meme coins are like the wildest roller coaster ride in the crypto world. One minute you’re flying high, the next you’re hanging on for dear life, screaming your lungs out. But what if there was a meme coin that not only promises a wild ride but could also deliver sweet, long-term returns? That’s where BTFD Coin comes in—stunning presale stats and all (I mean, you can’t ignore a crazy $4.2 million presale!). However, not every meme coin is built for the future. Let’s dive into the best meme coins to buy and hold for long-term ROIs, including BTFD Coin , Peanut the Squirrel, and SPX6900. BTFD Coin: Making Big Waves and Bigger Profits Alright, let’s talk about the elephant in the room—the meme coin that’s not just riding the waves, it’s creating them. BTFD Coin is here to turn the game on its head. If you haven’t heard of it yet, you’re about to, especially with its insane crypto presale stats. Currently priced at $0.00013, BTFD Coin is sitting pretty in a high-stakes presale with a major focus on staking rewards, game rewards, and an incredible 90% APY for stakers. For anyone serious about long-term ROIs, this is looking like the meme coin to really keep an eye on. Let’s break it down. If you drop a cool $40,000 into the presale (at $0.00013 per coin), you’re picking up over 307 million BTFD Coins. Now, let’s imagine a sweet scenario where the price skyrockets to $0.0006 (a conservative estimate based on market trends). That means you could be sitting pretty with a $184,200 return. Sounds like a meme coin miracle, right? Well, it’s happening, and fast. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme. It’s a community-driven movement that’s empowering the Bulls Squad (shoutout to Baby Bull and Nerdy Bull) to go full throttle in the market. The platform offers a Play2Earn (P2E) game where you can actually earn BTFD coins by playing and engaging. All of this points to one thing: BTFD Coin is here for the long haul. It’s got the meme magic, the staking rewards, and a roadmap that’s building toward a full-on token launch and even more rewards. Peanut the Squirrel: Market Drop but Not for Long Let’s get a little nutty and talk about Peanut the Squirrel, the meme coin that’s been… well, doing a little less hopping and a lot more plummeting lately. Trading at around $0.8194, Peanut has had a tough 24 hours, dipping by 19.17%. Ouch. But hey, we all know the meme coin game isn’t always about smooth sailing. It’s about holding on, laughing through the chaos, and hoping for that rebound. Peanut the Squirrel may be experiencing a dip at the moment, but it’s still holding a market cap of over $819 million and a ranking of #113. For anyone looking to buy and hold, it’s got some serious potential—if it can bounce back from this dip. The meme coin currently has a circulating supply of just under 1 billion PNUT coins, and its story’s not over yet. Whether or not it can recover from this market hiccup will depend on its ability to maintain momentum. With a 24-hour trading volume of over $643 million, Peanut’s obviously got the market’s attention. If you’re into rollercoaster investments, this one might be worth the ride. SPX6900: Advanced Tech or Just Another Crash? Okay, we’ve got another contender on the block. SPX6900, a blockchain cryptography coin, is diving deep into the scientific realm. Currently priced at $0.6463, SPX6900’s not exactly making waves, especially considering it’s down 7.92% in the last 24 hours. But it does have one thing going for it: limitless possibilities. Launched as a token capable of “limitless possibilities and scientific utilisation,” SPX6900 has a market cap hovering around $601 million, ranking at #137. The goal of SPX6900 is to enable blockchain technology for scientific research, cryptography, and more. Pretty cool, right? It’s an interesting token with 1 a billion max supply, which positions it for potential growth in the long term. Patience, folks! Wrapping Up: The Meme Coin to Hold for Long-Term ROIs When you’re hunting for the best meme coins to buy and hold for long-term ROIs, BTFD Coin is the clear standout. Its presale stats are through the roof, and with an incredible 90% staking APY and a P2E game, this token has the momentum and community support to back up its long-term potential. Let’s face it—BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme, it’s a meme coin powerhouse in the making. Peanut’s market volatility and SPX6900’s more tech-driven focus may leave them struggling now, but only savvy investors can see their long-term potential. So, if you’re looking to play the long game and cash in on a meme coin that’s got the brains and the brawn, BTFD Coin is the meme coin to keep an eye on. Join the meme coin presale now !

37860908,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630807,1734655351,SEC approves Hashdex Nasdaq and Franklin crypto index ETFs,"Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange are changing rules to list ETPs linked to spot bitcoin and ether. The SEC is reviewing these products to ensure whether they follow regulations and protect investors. This move helps bring digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem by preventing from frauds. Nasdaq and Cboe BZX Exchange crypto index ETF Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange changed their rules for listing and trading with exchange-traded products (ETPs) linked to spot bitcoin and ether ETF. Nasdaq intends to list the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, while the Cboe BZX Exchange aims to introduce the Franklin Crypto Index ETF. These ETPs will directly hold spot bitcoin and ether and cash equivalents. The goal of listing these assets on the exchanges is to increase their accessibility. SEC’s Role in Regulating The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is reviewing these listings according to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which sets rules for trading securities on exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX, for ensuring fairness and transparency. The Securities Act of 1933 regulates how securities are issued and required proper disclosures to protect investors on Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs investment products like ETFs to ensure they follow rules that protect investors. In addition to this, The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) regulates financial products linked to bitcoin and ether as commodities. The proposed Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act could shape future cryptocurrency regulations to ensure safe investment practices. The SEC believes that the proposed rule changes meet these requirements, especially those to prevent fraud and market manipulation. Additionally, the Commission emphasizes the necessity of surveillance-sharing agreements between exchanges to detect fraudulent activities and maintain market integrity. To minimize the risk of market manipulation, the SEC investigates how the spot markets for assets like bitcoin and ether that are correlated with their futures markets. In previous approvals for Bitcoin and Ether-based ETPs, the SEC confirmed that price movements in spot markets which closely reflected in futures markets. This correlation indicates that if manipulation or fraud occurs in the spot market, it is more like an evident in the futures market, which is easier to monitor. The CME’s bitcoin and ether futures markets have exhibited strong correlations with their spot markets, giving the SEC confidence that these new ETFs can be effectively supervised. The SEC has decided that the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF and the Franklin Crypto Index ETF follow all necessary rules. These products are in line with past approvals of similar bitcoin and ether-based investment products. By introducing these new ETPs, investors will have access to spot bitcoin and ether in a regulated environment, which enhances security and transparency in their cryptocurrency investments. This approval is an important step in bringing digital assets into traditional finance ecosystem, with the help of SEC.

37860580,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26795,1734654960,Debate Rekindled Over BTC’s 21 Million Supply Cap,"The question of whether Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is truly immutable has resurfaced after BlackRock released a three-minute explainer video on Dec. 17. The video included a disclaimer suggesting there’s no guarantee the cap won’t be altered. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is a cornerstone of its value as a store of wealth, and any change could fundamentally impact its perception among investors. In the video, BlackRock highlighted Bitcoin’s 21 million cap, noting it as a “hard-coded rule” that controls supply, purchasing power, and prevents excessive currency creation. However, the disclaimer stated: “There is no guarantee that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor reposted the video, sparking criticism. Joel Valenzuela, Dashpay’s marketing director, commented, “When the supply cap increase happens, it will have ‘always been part of the plan.’ And today, in 2024, people have the audacity to say Bitcoin wasn’t hijacked.” Ethereum developer Antiprosynthesis added, “BlackRock understands Bitcoin better than Bitcoiners.” Is Bitcoin’s Supply Cap Changeable? Bitcoin developer Super Testnet, known for BitVM, explained that altering Bitcoin’s supply cap would depend on how one defines “Bitcoin.” In theory, the cap could change if a majority of the community—node operators, developers, miners, and investors—reached consensus on a hard fork. Such a change would involve a proposal to gauge consensus, followed by implementing changes in Bitcoin Core. If most node operators and miners adopted the new fork, it would create a “new” Bitcoin network with an uncapped supply. However, Super Testnet argued that this new chain wouldn’t truly be Bitcoin. “The inflation cap is definitional to Bitcoin,” they said. “Eliminate that, and whatever you have isn’t Bitcoin anymore. You might as well ask what it would take to turn Bitcoin into PayPal.” In essence, an uncapped version wouldn’t be Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | FORKS,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/debate-rekindled-over-btcs-21-million-supply-cap/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Crypto All-Stars has wrapped up a stellar presale with a $22.64 million haul, solidifying its position as a meme coin powerhouse. Meanwhile, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is stealing the show with its presale, which has already surpassed $4.2 million in Stage 12. On the flip side, Mog Coin (MOG), once hailed as a meme coin with promise, is struggling to hold its ground amid bearish market conditions. Meme coins have grown beyond being internet jokes. They now represent a unique blend of community power, creative use cases, and, of course, the potential for exponential profits. BTFD Coin is leading this new wave of meme coin evolution with its P2E game, lucrative referral program, staking rewards, and a vibrant community. Let’s dive into why BTFD, Crypto All-Stars, and Mog Coin are the most talked-about meme coins right now and which of them stands out as the best for exponential returns. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Rising Star in Meme Coins BTFD Coin has taken the meme coin world by storm, and it’s easy to see why. Starting at an initial price of $0.000004, the coin has climbed to $0.00013 in Stage 12 of its presale. With over 57 billion coins sold and $4.2 million raised so far, the numbers speak for themselves. With just four stages left, the presale momentum is building rapidly, and the coin’s listing price of $0.0006 promises substantial short-term returns. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its presale. Its P2E game offers an engaging way for users to earn rewards, while the referral program incentivises community growth by rewarding users for bringing in new investors. Add in the 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a project that caters to both gamers and crypto enthusiasts looking for passive income. Here’s an investment scenario to paint the picture. If you invest $30,000 in Stage 12 at $0.00013 per coin, you’d acquire approximately 230.7 million BTFD tokens. Once the coin hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, your investment would grow to $138,420. That’s the kind of growth that has investors flocking to the project. Why is BTFD one of the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its explosive crypto presale , innovative features, and strong community backing make it a top choice for investors looking to capitalise on the meme coin trend. With the price increasing at every stage, now’s the time to jump in. Crypto All-Stars (STARS): The MemeVault Revolution Crypto All-Stars has already proven itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Its presale, which concluded with $22.64 million raised, set the stage for the launch of its groundbreaking MemeVault—a platform that allows users to stake multiple meme coins, including PEPE, Dogecoin, and Floki, under one roof. This innovation has brought a sense of unity to the meme coin community, making $STARS a must-have token for enthusiasts. The $STARS token, priced at $0.0016782 during the presale, comes with lucrative staking rewards of up to 1429% APY. This high return has attracted both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. By reducing the circulating supply through staking incentives, Crypto All-Stars creates scarcity, which often leads to price surges once the token is listed. With the $STARS token set to launch on Uniswap next week, anticipation is building. Early adopters are expected to see substantial gains as more meme coin holders flock to the platform. The MemeVault itself is a game-changer, offering a streamlined way to manage and stake meme coins while earning rewards. Why does $STARS rank among the best meme coins for exponential profits? Its successful presale, innovative staking platform, and upcoming launch make it a strong contender for both short-term and long-term gains. For those who missed the presale, the token launch presents a second chance to get in on the action. Mog Coin (MOG): A Meme Coin Facing Challenges Mog Coin (MOG) entered the scene with a lot of promise, leveraging its quirky branding and strong community backing. However, recent market conditions have posed significant challenges. Once a favourite among meme coin enthusiasts, MOG is now battling bearish pressure that has left its performance lagging behind competitors like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars. MOG’s initial appeal lay in its community-driven initiatives and its potential to carve out a niche in the meme coin space. However, the lack of new developments and a clear roadmap has made it difficult for the project to sustain its early momentum. While the coin still has a loyal following, its price movements have been lacklustre, leaving investors cautious. For MOG to regain its footing, it needs a fresh narrative or a major update to its ecosystem. Without these, it risks falling further behind in a market that thrives on innovation and community engagement. While some investors are holding on in the hope of a turnaround, others are shifting their focus to projects like BTFD and Crypto All-Stars, which offer clearer paths to exponential profits. Why does MOG make this list? Its initial success and strong community give it a place among notable meme coins, but its current struggles highlight the importance of staying ahead in a competitive market. For now, MOG is a speculative play rather than a reliable choice for significant returns. The Concluding Remarks: What Are the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Growth Next Year? Based on our research and market trends, the meme coin market offers a wealth of opportunities for investors seeking exponential profits. BTFD Coin is the best meme coin for exponential profits, thanks to its stellar presale performance, innovative features, and strong community support. A $30,000 investment in Stage 12 could grow to $138,420 by the end of the presale, showcasing its immense potential. Crypto All-Stars is another standout, with its MemeVault innovation and successful presale setting the stage for substantial gains. While Mog Coin has its merits, its current challenges make it a riskier option compared to its competitors. If you’re ready to capitalise on these opportunities, now is the time to act. Join the BTFD Coin meme coin presale today and position yourself for exponential profits in the ever-evolving meme coin market. Don’t miss your chance to be part of the next big thing in crypto.
