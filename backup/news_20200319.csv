42383450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvKT,1584650649,Traders Finding More Arbitrage Opportunities in Bitcoin,"As bitcoin (BTC) experiences vertigo-inducing gains, cryptocurrencies are breaking out of a period where they followed or even lagged behind traditional markets. In fact, prices in the crypto market are seeing such a steep upward trend that arbitrage traders are able to trade between Bitfinex and other exchanges to easily capture profit.      Bitcoin is up over 15 percent in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $6,206 as of 20:30 UTC (4:30 p.m. ET) Thursday, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Meanwhile, the Nikkei 225 index closed its day at 05:00 UTC Thursday down 1 percent. That’s notable because recently crypto traders were looking at the Asian-based markets and indexes like the Nikkei for signals, which in the past week did create a brief correlation.      “It was surprising to see bitcoin's correlation with a traditional index like the Nikkei 225 given bitcoin's similarity to traditional stores of value like precious metals,” said Marc Grens, co-founder and president at DigitalMint, a bitcoin point-of-sale provider. “That being said, since the creation of the Bitcoin protocol, this is the first time we’ve seen the behavior of bitcoin holders through a bear market.”      Volumes at cryptocurrency exchanges have jumped, with Coinbase, Bitstamp and Bitfinex combined seeing a 19 percent bump in 24-hour exchange volume, according to data aggregator CryptoCompare.      So, what’s the reason for the jump? Higher crypto volatility means traders are seeing more opportunities to make money.      “It appears that volatility play-related profit-taking and some degree of normalization of liquidity is behind the pick up in prices,” said Denis Vinokourov of Bequant, London-based London-based digital asset firm Bequant.      Trading on Bitfinex began pricing bitcoin at a discount after 09:00 UTC, sometimes by as much as $20 lower when compared to exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitstamp. This allows for traders to buy bitcoin on the cheaper exchange (Bitfinex, for example) and simultaneously sell where prices are higher in an arbitrage, a near-riskless profit.      The discrepancy narrowed, then continued again after 17:00 UTC, with spreads hitting over $30 at times.      It’s not just on Bitfinex where traders are finding opportunities. BitMEX’s perpetual contracts on bitcoin settle every eight hours and are currently paying those who buy them as much as 8 basis points (0.008 percent) of value. Traders can thus buy bitcoin perpetual futures on BitMEX and sell simultaneously in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and collect the basis payments. BitMEX allows traders to leverage as much as 100 times over what they put up.      “We are seeing most of our selling flow from basis trades, not liquidating trades,” said David Vizsolyi, Head of Trading at Chicago-based DV Chain.      Ether (ETH) was briefly down compared to bitcoin, as the BTC/ETH pair on exchanges like Coinbase showed ether priced in bitcoin moving below its 10-day moving average at around 17:00 UTC. This signals that traders were also selling ether and buying bitcoin, even though the prices of both assets were going up.      That move was short-lived. Within the same hour, the trend turned around, with ether later seeing stronger gains over bitcoin. At press time, ether is up 19 percent in 24 hours.      Elsewhere, the foreign exchange markets have been in turmoil, causing the dollar to strengthen against other fiat currencies. The S&P 500 squeaked out a half-percent gain while gold was up just 0.2 percent as of Thursday 20:00 UTC.      Other eye-popping crypto gainers on the day include bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) both up 40 percent. Traders also noted dash (DASH) in the green, up 30 percent in 24 hour trading. “Dash and other coins are rallying big time. We are pretty bullish here on dips,” said Jack Tan of Tapie-based trading firm Kronos Research.",POSITIVE,BCH,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/19/traders-finding-more-arbitrage-opportunities-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ad2f4e1dc25244b6f179a7177b4165bbedfaef5-1050x722.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383445,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvEB,1584641136,The Coronavirus API Delivers Vital Statistics Unmediated by Government Hands,"The COVID-19 pandemic arrives as Americans' trust in institutions is faltering.      According to a January 2019 Pew Research Center survey, only 35 percent of adults have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in elected officials to act in the public’s best interest, while fewer than half trust corporate or media leaders.      Further, while 68 percent had a mostly favorable view of medical research scientists, only 16 percent of those surveyed said they “know a lot” about what these researchers do.      See also: Ventilators, Crowdsourcing, VR, Personal Broadcasting: How Crypto Is Helping During the Coronavirus Crisis (Updated)      Medical research is vitally important to stymie the spread of the coronavirus. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was slow to test early and broadly, the U.S. is on its way to surpassing China in reported COVID-19 cases, two and half months after the initial outbreak.      This is largely because quality information relating to the viral spread and its potential community impacts is difficult to come by and, when presented by the media or governments, is often untrusted.      Enter Danny Yang and Susan Joseph's new project, CoronaVirus API, an effort to disintermediate data from the traditional sources of information. The website collects, collates and presents the most recent figures on the virus’ spread through all 50 states. Using a web scraping bot to gather information from relevant government sources, CoronaVirus API is a decentralized solution to presenting people with information they could grow to trust.    The CDC is not reporting enough data in a timely manner    “The CDC is not reporting enough data in a timely manner,” Yang said in a phone call. “First, they need to provide transparency in getting data out there.”      This isn’t to say Yang’s site is a replacement for the CDC’s announcements, but a way to push out real-time figures, rather than waiting for a centralized bureau to make an announcement. “The CDC is often a day behind in reporting the official state statistics,” Yang said.      In fact, the CDC states that ""since states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC’s numbers are not representative of all testing being done nationwide.""      The CDC did not respond to a request for comment by press time.      Yang’s permissionless data aggregator scrapes government websites, which in turn rely on infection, recovery and death statistics provided by local hospitals to states as required by many state public health laws. Nearly three-quarters of Americans trust their medical professionals, according to PEW. Now, CoronaVirus API has created a more direct line to these official numbers.      “Right now, there are zero ways for states to aggregate information from other states, which slows coordinated efforts to protect the public,” Susan Joseph, Yang’s legal counterpart and partner, said in a phone call. ""You can use data as a lifeline to plan in real time and help protect yourself, your community and state.""      Yang, a self-described “data guy” and founder of the block explorer (a tool that helps people examine blockchain transactions) Blockseer, said his unofficial and unverified workaround is also attempting to provide transparency in the age of Trump.      Joseph is an attorney and blockchain consultant specializing in digital assets and insurance, and has worked with global insurance consortia, enterprise, and the World Economic Forum.      See also: InterPlanetary File System Is Uncensorable During Coronavirus News Fog      This Tuesday, Yang contacted the developers behind Real Items, a VeChain-based authentication protocol, to provide historical versioning of medical statistics, so authorities are unable to censor or change the statistics at a later date.      This product, developed by David Menard, adds these medical records to the InterPlanetary File System and then hashes that information onto a blockchain using a non-fungible token (NFT) format.      “This provides double immutability,” Menard said over Zoom. “It's a way for us to easily keep records of vital statistics.”      The NFT format allows researchers and laymen to quickly find datasets related to a single day during the outbreak, he said. Currently, each hash onto VeChain costs approximately 17 cents, but it’s a cost Menard is willing to eat.      “If data is editable or adjusted, it opens the possibility for people to take the narrative and drown out the truth,” he said.      This is something Danny Yang has direct experience with. His family is from Hubei province in China, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and he is in daily contact with his family who are still there. Yang was disappointed with how the Chinese government initially tried to suppress information related to the virus before taking the extreme measure of enforcing quarantines.    You can’t ignore data.    “My family has been in a continuous lockdown for over two months,” Yang said. “What’s happened in China will happen everywhere. The whole country [United States] has to participate.”      For his part, Yang has been under self-isolation since January, only leaving the house three times since, according to a spreadsheet he uses to keep track of his time under lockdown.      He’s hoping his website will help people take similar precautions. “You can’t ignore data,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/19/the-coronavirus-api-delivers-vital-statistics-unmediated-by-government-hands,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/403d58abb84feb400533b75a6c3623ca0e1cfd8d-1920x1368.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42383441,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vv7t,1584639752,Israeli Bitcoiners See Surveillance as Unavoidable During Coronavirus Crisis,"What if the coronavirus pandemic is to data tracking as 9/11 was to homeland security?      The Israeli government approved an emergency measure this week to track civilian mobile-phone data in order to monitor the spread of COVID-19. Although Israel's parliament is still hammering out the logistics of this mandatory program, Ynet news reported the Health Ministry activated the initiative on Wednesday, texting 400 people to inform them they were exposed to the virus and must now stay in quarantine.      In the face of COVID-19’s exponential growth, governments worldwide are weighing which tools to deploy. Supporters of the emergency measures in Israel argue aggressive outreach will save lives, while critics say these government powers won’t be rolled back after the pandemic winds down.      “Both sides are justified,” Libracamp and Matchpool co-founder Yonatan Ben Simon said. “I don’t worry about what I can’t control.”      Surveillance is more widespread in this nation of nine million than in others, which is why many Israelis aren't panicking, even if they are skeptical of government intervention.      “They will do it again for other things,” Ben Simon said of the emergency coronavirus measures.      The Israeli bitcoin (BTC) community’s reaction to this news is as diverse as its participants. Some have suggested these measures are a threat to Israeli democracy itself while others are working with governments to build surveillance tools.      “We’re seeing trust in the government shattered in a power grab that might destroy 80 years of democracy as we know it,” said blockchain consultant Maya Zehavi.      See also: In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-Offs on Privacy      Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy volunteer Sarah Wiesner is also concerned about these emergency measures.      “I imagined they could do this before. It's not shocking. But making this legally easy to access is terrifying and makes you want to wear [an anti-facial-recognition] mask and walk around without a cellphone,” she said.      Given related responses to the spread of the virus, there’s reason to believe this crisis will catalyze other changes. For example, Israel’s transportation ministry is banning the use of cash on most public transit, a policy that was already in place in Tel Aviv. Instead, people use ID cards loaded at public offices.      Wiesner isn’t sure whether her movements are tracked this way as well, but she is generally concerned about the normalization of sweeping surveillance.      “They don't miss a chance to gather information,” she said of Israel’s government. “The cash ban on buses has nothing to do with the coronavirus. But they decided to push the schedule to the rest of Israel faster.”    Occupation    Many Israelis aren’t alarmed by these emergency measures because they seem to be more of the same for a country technically at war since its founding in 1948.      One East Jerusalem resident, who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak freely, said such surveillance policies don’t concern him any more than usual. The Arab-Israeli citizen who used to commute to work in Tel Aviv’s crypto industry said coming under scrutiny is already routine for him.      “[Soldiers] hang out a lot in our neighborhood. They know the color of our underwear. There’s not much to hide. It’s a small country so they know everything about everyone,” he said regarding how these surveillance tactics are already common for use against Palestinians.      That's why, he said, he’s not bullish on bitcoin. In his situation, censorship-resistance feels futile.      Bitcoin is more often viewed as another payment or investment tool in Israel these days, rarely as a political or criminal tool like in the West. In a country where most people go to the army, there’s a broad understanding that civilians and terrorists often use the same tools. Regardless of whether it’s with balloons or bitcoin, people who live under the watch of an army know tools can only be used to circumnavigate laws as long as the military doesn’t physically (or digitally) stop them.      Back at the Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy, the bitcoin ATM will be the only open aspect of the nonprofit, said co-founder Meni Rosenfeld. Gatherings of over a dozen people are now strongly discouraged, and the government can tell through mobile data who disobeys. A civil liberties group has already started petitioning the Israeli Supreme Court to suspend the monitoring program.      The East Jerusalem resident joked that now Jews can enjoy the same surveillance Palestinians have known for decades.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/19/israeli-bitcoiners-see-surveillance-as-unavoidable-during-coronavirus-crisis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7af9c1f52b902064ff8b1c49aea9ebe704f8218-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383439,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vv47,1584637805,Thousands of These Computers Were Mining Cryptocurrency. Now They're Working on Coronavirus Research,"CoreWeave, the largest U.S. miner on the Ethereum blockchain, is redirecting the processing power of 6,000 specialized computer chips toward research to find a therapy for the coronavirus.      These graphics processing units (GPUs) will be pointed toward Stanford University's Folding@home, a long-standing research effort that unveiled a project on Feb. 27 specifically to boost coronavirus research by way of a unique approach to developing pharmaceutical drugs: connecting thousands of computers from around the world to form a distributed supercomputer for disease research.      CoreWeave co-founder and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Brian Venturo said the project has at least a shot at finding a drug for the virus. As such, CoreWeave has responded by doubling the power of the entire network with its GPUs, which are designed to handle repetitive calculations.      See also: Bitcoiners Are Biohacking a DIY Coronavirus Vaccine      According to Venturo, those 6,000 GPUs made up about 0.2 percent of Ethereum's total hashrate, earning roughly 28 ETH per day, worth about $3,600 at press time.      There is no cure for the coronavirus just yet (though various groups are working on vaccines and research to combat the disease, including IBM's supercomputer). Venturo noted that Folding@home has been used to contribute to breakthroughs in the creation of other important drugs.      ""Their research had profound impacts on the development of front-line HIV defense drugs, and we are hoping our [computing power] will aid in the fight against coronavirus,"" Venturo said.      The coronavirus is taking a toll across the world. Italy and Spain are on lockdown. Conferences, stores and restaurants are closing to stem the spread of the disease; by stoking fears, it's slamming the financial markets in the process.    World computer    When the idea of using GPUs for coronavirus research was mentioned to CoreWeave, the team didn't think twice.      They had a test system up and running ""within minutes,"" Venturo said. Since then, the project quickly snowballed. CoreWeave has been contributing over half of the overall computing power going into the coronavirus wing of Folding@home.      ""The idea of 'should we do this?' was never really brought up, it kind of just happened. We were all enthusiastic that we might be able to help,"" Venturo added.      Folding@home is a decentralized project in the same vein as Bitcoin. Instead of one research firm alone using a massive computer to do research, Folding@home uses the computing power of anyone who wants to participate from around the world – even if it's just a single laptop with a little unused computing power to spare.      See also: Bitcoiners in Europe Reflect on Economic Shocks as Coronavirus Spreads      In this case, the computing power is used to find helpful information relating to the coronavirus. Much like in bitcoin mining, one user might detect a ""solution"" to the problem at hand, distributing this information to the rest of the group.      ""Their protein simulations attempt to find potential 'pockets' where existing [U.S. federal agency Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] approved drugs or other known compounds could help inhibit or treat the virus,"" Venturo said.      Viruses have proteins ""that they use to suppress our immune systems and reproduce themselves. To help tackle coronavirus, we want to understand how these viral proteins work and how we can design therapeutics to stop them,"" a Folding@home blog post explains.      Simulating these proteins and then looking at them from different angles helps scientists to understand them better, with the potential of finding an antidote. Computers accelerate this process by shuffling through the variations very quickly.      ""Our specialty is in using computer simulations to understand proteins’ moving parts. Watching how the atoms in a protein move relative to one another is important because it captures valuable information that is inaccessible by any other means,"" the post reads.    Long shot    Folding@home could use even more power. Venturo urges other GPU miners to join the cause.      Even without these calls for participation, though, miners of other cryptocurrencies are already independently taking action. Tulip.tools founder Johann Tanzer put out a call to action to Tezos bakers (that blockchain’s equivalent of miners) last week, promising to send the leading contributor to Folding@home a modest 15 XTZ, worth roughly $20 at press time.      The initiative blew up, to Tanzer's surprise. Though they might not be contributing as much power as CoreWeave, 20 groups of Tezos miners are now contributing a slice of their hashing power to the cause. Tanzer's pot has swelled to roughly $600 as Tezos users caught wind of the effort and donated.      But that's not to say all miners can participate. While GPUs are flexible, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), a type of chip designed specifically for mining, aren't, according to Venturo. Though ASICs are more powerful than GPUs, they're really only made for one thing: To mine cryptocurrency. This is one advantage Venturo thinks Ethereum has over Bitcoin, since GPU mining still works on the former, whereas the latter is now dominated by ASICs.      See also: Israeli Bitcoiners See Surveillance as Unavoidable During Coronavirus Crisis      ""This is one of the great things about the Ethereum mining ecosystem, it's basically the largest GPU compute resource on the planet. We were able to redeploy our hardware to help fight a global pandemic in minutes,"" Venturo said. (However, it's worth noting that Ethereum has seen ASICs enter the fray. Not to mention, ether miners might soon go extinct when a pivotal upgrade makes its way into the network.)      ASICs are useless for the Folding@Home effort, but if bitcoin miners have old GPUs lying around from the early days that they could contribute, too.      Even if other miners join up, though, it's still a long shot that the effort will lead to a helpful drug.      ""After discussing with some industry experts [...] we believe the chance of success in utilizing the work done on Folding@Home to deliver a drug to market to be in the 2-5% range,"" Venturo said.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/19/thousands-of-these-computers-were-mining-cryptocurrency-now-theyre-working-on-coronavirus-research,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eae32c7bfa406950ece8374d7fc7484084f63f94-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Singapore-based firm said Wednesday the new mechanism, integrated into its crypto derivatives marketplace, would halt all liquidations – where a trader's position is automatically closed – during periods when volatility starts to present a real risk for traders.      Huobi's new feature comes a week after several crypto derivatives exchanges reported record liquidations following a sudden collapse in the bitcoin price. BitMEX registered more than $700 million in just 15 minutes last Thursday as bitcoin (BTC) plummeted through its support levels.      Such sudden and large movements may catch traders by surprise leading to a sudden rise in volatility levels. Ciara Sun, Huobi's vice president of global business, said market volatility can ""lead to unnecessarily high-risk circumstances if the right measures aren't in place to protect them.""      See also: Does Crypto Need Circuit Breakers? Last Week’s Price Crash Ignites a Debate      Liquidation risk mechanisms are commonplace in traditional markets where they are used to temporarily halt trading. Known as circuit breakers, they are activated to stop panic selling when markets come under sudden and extreme duress.      The New York Stock Exchange, for example, has activated circuit breakers in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and during the 2008 financial crisis. Stock exchanges all around the world, including NYSE, have recently been forced to trigger them again as the coronavirus pandemic sparked a global sell-off in equities.      Huobi's mechanism doesn't halt trading as does a conventional circuit breaker; it only halts liquidations on leveraged positions. It can also gradually liquidate positions, rather than doing so in a single event. There are some other exchanges that use a similar sliding mechanism, such as rival crypto derivatives platforms, Bybit and FTX.      See also: Bitcoin Sees 9% Gain as Turmoil Hits the Forex Markets      In the past, crypto volatility levels have spiked following short or long squeezes – mass liquidations from unexpected changes in the underlying assets that exacerbate movements. Sun added that a partial liquidation mechanism could create a more ""robust trading experience,"" minimizing downside ""without diluting the potential upside.""

Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart of the federal court of the Southern District of Florida criticized the fees claimed by the attorneys representing Ira Kleiman – who is suing Wright for 50 percent of the bitcoin (BTC) and intellectual property he owned before 2014 – as ""excessive"" and ruled they wouldn't be granted in full.  Kleiman's four-man legal team filed for a total of $658,500, comprised of more than $592,000 in attorney fees, as well as roughly $66,000 in other expenses like subject experts.  But finding these rates too high, the judge slashed what the Kleiman team can actually claim to $113,760 in fees and $52,000 in expenses. That's a grand total of $165,800 – approximately a quarter of the amount originally sought.  Kleiman's suit against Wright – which claims Wright had tried to seize assets that rightfully belonged to his dead brother's estate – has been rocky for the Australian tech entrepreneur (who also claims he's bitcoin's inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto). Wright has been found in contempt of court for not revealing bitcoin holdings and accused of abusing privilege to withhold documents potentially crucial to the case.  In November 2019, Wright pulled out of an out of court settlement that had been tentatively agreed upon two months previously.  See also:Judge Blasts Craig Wright’s Evidence, ‘Inconsistent’ Testimony in Kleiman Trial  But in this week's order, Judge Reinhart found Kleiman's four attorneys claimed fees at rates that either exceeded their experience or were simply out of proportion to the amount usually charged in the Florida court system. He also found the legal team inflated billable hours, by either overstaffing or exaggerating the time it took to perform tasks.  ""I find all these rates to be excessive. I am personally familiar with the hourly rates charged by the top civil litigators in Palm Beach County,"" said Judge Reinhart.  In one example, the judge asked why three attorneys were needed to prepare and review the response to a motion from the defendant. ""It was not reasonable to have three lawyers involved to this extent to review a draft [for] a relatively straight-forward pleading,"" he said. In another instance, Judge Reinhart said the attendance of three attorneys at an evidentiary hearing was excessive.  The costs were awarded due to ""protracted litigation over production of documents identifying Dr. Wright’s bitcoin holdings,"" according to the order.  Wright now has until March 30 to pay out the legal team's reduced fees and expenses.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/19/judge-calls-out-kleiman-attorneys-over-excessive-fees-in-craig-wright-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b01d14aa279a2f5a4376d8ac1adbef171973fa5-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383451,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvLj,1584626400,"In Zimbabwe, Crypto Is a 'Liberation Tool': Bitcoin in Africa, Part 1 of a New Documentary Podcast Series","After three weeks of listening, recording and talking bitcoin (BTC) in Africa, podcaster Anita Posch shares her experiences in part one of this new six-part documentary podcast series.      Listen/subscribe to the CoinDesk Podcast feed for unique perspectives and fresh daily insight with Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocketcasts, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Stitcher, RadioPublica, IHeartRadio or RSS.      In this first part of the “Bitcoin in Africa” podcast documentary series, join Anita as she learns about the current living situation of Zimbabweans and the country's political history. Combining on-the-ground recordings, interviews and thoughtful narration, she paints a picture of why things are how they are, as well as the state of human rights and free speech.      ""I wanted to see by myself if this is true and how far bitcoin is known and used there,"" said Anita Posch.      Recorded February 2020 in the run-up to the growing quarantine movement and coronavirus travel restrictions, Anita traveled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to listen, learn and record about the usage of bitcoin in these countries. In the world of bitcoin, countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela are frequently mentioned as places where the cryptocurrency could or perhaps should be making a difference and where they can really help the people's economic situations.      Check out another of Anita's favorite episodes featuring Andreas M. Antonopoulos debunking arguments against bitcoin like high volatility, energy consumption, inequalities and the exaggerated risk of possible failure.      TRANSCRIPT: “Bitcoin in Africa: The Ubuntu Way” - Part 1 - Zimbabwe: Ideal conditions for Bitcoin?      ANITA      Hello friends, bitcoiners and pre-coiners alike! This is the first episode of a multipart series called “Bitcoin in Africa: The Ubuntu Way”      In February 2020 I travelled to Zimbabwe and Botswana to find out, if and how bitcoin (BTC) is used there. I spent three weeks in Zimbabwe, two weeks of that time I was in Harare the capital and I travelled for one week to Bulawayo and Victoria Falls. After that I spent some days in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana to meet and talk with the founder of the Satoshicentre, Alakanani Itireleng.      ANITA      The instrument you heard is a mbira (pronounced m-BEER-ra , IPA (ə)mˈbɪəɾə) it is an African musical instrument, traditional to the Shona people of Zimbabwe.      Why did I visit Zimbabwe?      I wanted to see with my own eyes how the living situation is for people and, more importantly, to research the usage of bitcoin. Bitcoin is in my eyes first and foremost not a speculative, trading object, where everything is about price. For me it’s a tool of liberation that enables individuals and communities to free themselves of tight restrictions by authoritarian or totalitarian nation states that harm people's human rights. This has many faces. In the so-called western world, in countries with freedom of speech, safety and a high level of wealth, it is the possibility to free oneself from the banking system. The banking system has in the last 30 years in combination with national and global regulations evolved into a very strict system of surveillance and allowances. Where we - the majority people of integrity are being policed by the banks - because of fear of money laundering and terrorism finance done by the few. In conjunction with “surveillance capitalism” - a term coined by Shoshana Zuboff in her book, well worth reading - surveillance capitalism - which is the permanent recording of all our digital traces on Facebook, Google and Co. - that are being used not only to comfort us with better search results and convenience, but also to manipulate our decisions and extort our data for money and higher profits. This has had disastrous consequences for democracy, freedom and our privacy. So in countries with high living standards, safety and a relatively good working banking system with a low inflation rate controlled by so called “independent” central banks, I would argue that governments try to regulate bitcoin in the face of “money laundering and financing terrorism” - while in countries like Zimbabwe bitcoin has to be tamed or controlled by the governing elite, because of the possibility for more “human rights and freedom” for its citizens and their loss of power.      This podcast special and my trip to Africa would not have been possible without my sponsors and supporters.      I want to thank my sponsors first: Thank you: Peter McCormack and the whatbitcoindid podcast, Coinfinity and the CardWallet, LocalBitcoins.com a person-to-person bitcoin trading site, SHIFT Cryptosecurity, manufacturer of the hardware wallet BitBox02, and many thanks to several unknown private donors who sent me Satoshis over the lightning network.      This special is edited by CoinDesk’s Podcasts Editor Adam B. Levine and published first on the CoinDesk Podcast Network. Thank you very much for supporting the Bitcoin in Africa series with your work.      Thanks goes also out to stakwork.com - stakwork is a great project that brings bitcoin into the world through earning. One can do microjobs on stakwork, earning Satoshis and cash them out without even having an understanding about the lightning network or bitcoin. I think we need more projects like that to spread the usage of bitcoin around the world.      Thank you also to GoTenna, for donating several gotenna devices to set up a mesh network in Zimbabwe and to Team Satoshi, the decentralized sports team for supporting my work.      This special is also brought to you by the Let's Talk Bitcoin Network.      Voice of captain: Mascati…. Welcome on board... Make yourself comfortable….      ANITA:      I did talks about bitcoin in both countries and introduced around 100 people to the possibilities of using and earning bitcoin and showed them how it can improve their living situation in the short and long run.      I met with many people from different backgrounds with a diverse set of goals and interests. I talked with them about their daily life, how the economic situation has changed in the last 20 to 40 years, about their hopes and fears for the future and, of course, about bitcoin and its chances and challenges in Africa. In 2014 Alakanani Itireleng a true Bitcoin OG founded the Satoshicentre in Gaborone to educate her fellow citizens about bitcoin:      INTERVIEWEE: “I want to help people get into the Bitcoin ecosystem and set the ecosystem to make it like work for Africa, not only for Botswana to make it to work for for Africa, you know, we are the very people that need bitcoin. Yeah.      We are the people. I think so too. Yeah, we are actually this is the place where it is needed the most. Like I was shocked when I was in the U.S. in Orange County [California]. I saw a drive-through bank. Yeah. I was like why do you guys have a drive through banks? You don't need bitcoin. So we need bitcoin.”      ANITA      February 2020: My trip to Zimbabwe starts. I arrive at Harare airport - before I am allowed to join the queue in front of the immigration desk my body temperature is measured - it is coronavirus season. All is good. They ask me where I come from: I say Austria. The answer is a question: Australia? I say no: Austria in Europe, next to Germany. Ah. Austria. Alright. I join the queue for the immigration procedure. I apply for a visa - and pay 30 U.S. dollar in cash. This, despite the fact, that in June 2019 the use of U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies was outlawed by the government.      So, if the government outlawed the use of foreign currencies, why did I just pay my visa fees with U.S. dollar cash? This is just one of many questions I ask myself during the three weeks of my stay in Zimbabwe.      Next step, customs control: I am very nervous because my suitcase is packed with devices for bitcoin use. I am bringing donations from my sponsors, several Hardware wallets, the BitBox02 by SHIFT cryptosecurity, several Card Wallets, a RaspiBlitz, which is a Bitcoin and Lightning Fullnode and several GoTenna devices to set up a mesh network to communicate and even send bitcoin, while being off the grid. So coming from the immigration desk I try to stay behind a couple to sneak through and I am lucky, the custom officers are not interested in me or my suitcase. I feel a great relief.      After arrival my friends immediately take me out to an event. They say, you have to see that. And they were right.      It was the Austrian new year's concert in Harare. It felt a little weird. Being in a church, with an audience of 99 percent whites - so called “Murungus” in the local Shona language - attending. A group of elderly Rhodesians coming together to listen to a classical concert in the tradition of Vienna philharmonic orchestra. That's not quite what I expected to find. But this audience is also a part of the country’s history and current life. This shows that Zimbabwe is a land of many contrasts.      In the three weeks of my stay, I showered exactly one time. Bah, you might think. No, I did wash myself, but only in a so-called shallow bath. You fill the bathtub just a little bit, like 2 cm high and then you wash yourself sitting and pouring the water over yourself with a jug. Why? Because of the water drought, there is no public water supply. So people try to save as much water as possible, you don’t even flush the toilet when you have been on the small side. You have to buy water privately that is delivered every two weeks with a truck. And if possible, you collect the rainwater. Even though there is no water supply the water company still sends bills and you have to pay them.      Same with electricity: It depends in which area you live. If you are close to hospitals or to the areas where people from the government live, then your chances to have water and electricity all the time are high. If not, then you have to suffer from power outages. At the place where I was staying, the power went on around 11 p.m. and went off around 5 a.m. in the morning. That means that people - and there are a lot of them - who cannot afford to buy a solar panel and an inverter - have to work by night. If you cannot afford a gas stove, you have to cook by night. And still: the electricity provider ZESA sends you bills and you have to pay them.      So I travelled the country and arranged a number of interviews. Three of my interview partners in Zimbabwe wanted to stay anonymous. One person is working for a human rights organization in Harare. Another one feared about his professional career and the third one is a teacher in a public school who is also afraid of possible threats. The other two I was talking with would have been ok with their names in the public, but I decided to leave their names out, too. Why? Because people are scared. As my interview partner who is working for a human rights organization puts it:      HUMAN RIGHTS SPEAKER      “The human rights situation here right now is really poor. I don't, I haven't I haven't been this pessimistic about it in 10 to 15 years. It's really is ... it's as repressive as it has been with like, an added layer of like a sinister, vindictive.      And I think that there's a small number of activists or organizations trying to do something. And in some ways, because there's so few of them, it's really easy to just sit really hard. So if you are one of those handful of people you can get kidnapped, raped, beaten up and stuff. You know, you fight [for your] life, you know, every day.      And like, how long does the energy last? So because some people, I mean, that's my observation on my feet, you know, just that you can do it for a certain period of time. And then you just, I don't know, it's almost like a, like a fading out, you know?”      ANITA      So one can say there's no free speech in this country?      HR SPEAKER      Yeah. And adding up ... Especially what you receive from a kind of like whatever in form of like a global support network coverage of it's very poor, you know? I mean, you get a headline in the media and like this, and this happens, but actually, the peer support internationally, I also like find quite poor.      ANITA      One of my interviews was taking place at a self-service restaurant in the middle of Harare. My guest and I started talking and I recorded with my audio recorder and two handheld microphones. After 20 minutes a woman from the restaurant approached us:      UNKNOWN SPEAKER:      ….recording is not allowed….      ANITA      We continued and finished our interview and left for another restaurant. But this was a disturbing experience. At least for me. I am used to being able to record my own conversations wherever I want. But people here are scared. And as I realized afterwards reports from foreigners about Zimbabwe require a permit. Also, you are not allowed to take pictures of government buildings.      With all those complicated living conditions, what are the positives about living in Zimbabwe?      HR SPEAKER      The people, the people, people it is and yeah, the climate. And the possibilities. You know, if you are an entrepreneurial person you are very free to start new things - there are not so many strict regulations for starting a business. In fact, you have to have this self-sovereign attitude otherwise you couldn’t survive here. Still, it is very different, if you have the possibility to leave the country or not.      Because It's tough. I mean, I think that's a big part of why people leave, is the combination of kind of lack of civic freedom and lack of economic prospects. And it's a little bit like what we were just saying about the colleague who's gone to work in London, like you had an opportunity like that, you take it and if you mean, even if, even if the choice was like, be a tomato vendor here or work as a waiter in South Africa, I'll work as a waiter in South Africa or for any other foreign currency I can send it home. I can support my family.      ANITA:      There are 16 million people living in Zimbabwe and only about 800,000 of them have a formal employment. That are only 5 percent of the population, that means 95 percent are informally unemployed; they hustle, they live off nothing. Of the 5 percent with a formal employment, most of them work for the government, are civil servants or teachers in public schools.      This is what the headmistress of a school told me:      TEACHER:      “And everybody else is just living [by] hustling. Yeah, we hustle. Oh, yeah, it's ... you have people who work but and who are self-employed. But very few people are, like, working ... for a proper institution, because even the institutions are in a difficult place because you'll have rentals, for example, charged in U.S. dollars, even though the government would say no, it's not allowed. Even if they rate it, it will be like astronomical prices. We, like, I don't even earn that much.      So typical rental, for example, for a one-bedroom apartment, let's call it that, which is pretty standard, you're looking at about 250 to 350 U.S. dollars, the average person at most is maybe earning 2,500 Zim dollars, which is about 100 dollars. So how do you pay your rent?... [S]o now like it's become, employment has almost become like a jail, because it's, like, because now you don't have time, because they'll take all your time, you don't have time to find that additional $200 or $250 to pay your rent. But, really and truly, you need additional maybe $400 because you've got the other bills outside of rent.      So it's almost like being employed, is almost a disadvantage ... in this country because you're locked down at that price and even if everything goes up, every month, your salary will remain the same. And a lot of companies struggle to put – what did they call it? Something allowance of, forgetting the term – an adjustment, as, yeah, it's called a salary adjustment to move with the market. It's never really completely what you actually need. They'll try maybe you get an extra 200 bond or an extra 500 bond. But it's difficult, you know, it's difficult to keep up with that corporate struggling as well. Very few corporates are able to pay people very well for it to make sense.”      ANITA      As a teacher and headmistress. she can tell about the situation in schools:      Wow, I mean, I work in education. I work in education, and I can tell you, it's difficult. It's difficult. Have a staff complement of 14 and they, my, you have to then obviously get money from school fees. So you have a lot of schools now. Trying to diversify. Because if you put all that pressure on the parents, then your parents can't afford to send their children to your school. So it's like, Okay, what do you do? We need to increase our fees because I need to be able to pay my teachers more. But if I throw that burden on the parents, I, as a parent know that I can't even afford that, you know, per term for every child, that I've got some parents of two, three, four children, and they need to bring [their] children, so what do you do? You end up subsidizing? That's when you have schools that have maybe a little Market Garden, you know, where you commercialize your kitchen and you start baking. You know, when you're not making lunch for the kids, you're selling food on the side so that you supplement your income. It is difficult and teachers have struggled the most, especially who work for state schools, public schools, they are in the worst possible position. Those who work in private schools are in a much better position because they can afford to charge more government schools can't charge what private schools are charging, because government schools supposed to the public schools supposed to be affordable for anyone to send their child to school, then they put in a difficult position where you're told you cannot not accept a child because they haven't paid fees. So you have to accept them.      So you'll have, let's say, 50 children, and maybe only 15 of them have paid the school fees. But because as a government school, you're not allowed to send children home because they have a right to education. How do you take care of the other 35 ... and still take care of your teachers and it's, it's our country, is madness, you know. The more I talk about it, you know, it sounds terrible.      ANITA      Not only that prices are rising daily, the whole society is crippled by corruption. Before 2017, when Robert Mugabe still was the country's leader, there were roadblocks by police everywhere. They would stop your car and say that you have done something wrong or mock you about small things they find in your car - ending with demanding money. Friends told me that they stopped driving through the city of Harare, because at one time they were stopped by five roadblocks inside the city and had to pay around 100 USD in fines only to get from one side of town to the other. With the new government, this has changed. No more roadblocks inside Harare. When I was there, it was almost spooky. Because I did not see any police. A friend said: If you need the police at your home, because something has happened, you cannot just call them and they’ll come, you have to go and fetch them.      And still there are roadblocks. A thing that I have never encountered in my life before: when we were on our roadtrip to Victoria Falls, we were stopped by roadblocks at the borders of each city. Coming from Austria, I have never seen something like that before. And it feels creepy. It's like, every time I see police and I have to stop - or maybe they wave us through, you never know - it feels like you have done something wrong. Uncertainty, being at the mercy of their whims - that's not a good feeling.      INTERVIEWEE 2:      As any person I hate talking ill about my country, but it's the truth, sadly, sadly is the truth. We are struggling. We are struggling. We have doctors are not paid nearly what a doctor should be paid realistically. We don't have equipment. We don't have the right medication the cost of medication alone is unbelievable. You can't afford to get sick. We were in a fuel queue with car behind us was a doctor, a doctor was in there. And he eventually was he was actually a doctor on call. And he'd also been in this queue for like, two hours or so. And the guy was supposed to be on call and knowing already that [office] was so severely understaffed. A doctor who supposed to be attending to patients but is stuck in a fuel queue is a problem. So he went up to the front and he tried to get fuel, at least in a jerrycan, and he showed them his card and the fact that he was on coal and it was a huge fight. But I think in the end, he only got like 10 liters, which is enough just to get him to work and get back home at the end of it. And as we're trying to help him sort of fill up his car. He then says, As a doctor, I can safely say to you cannot afford to get sick. Please do not get sick in this country because it's one of two things: It's either you cannot afford it because they are hospitals that are beautifully equipped, fully staffed, all the medication, all these hospitals are here right now in this country, but you know you are paying a premium for it. Even our medical aides, not all of them are accepted at these hospitals. But then you have our government hospitals, which are not as well equipped. And if you don't have the kind of money that is required to get proper health care, your chances of not making it or you know, probably not getting the best health care you possibly could a very, very high, very high and if a doctor can say, don't get sick, what does that what does that tell you?      ANITA:      While traveling from Harare to Bulawayo I met a doctor who lived a big part of his life in Zimbabwe. I would say, he is in his early 70s and he fought in the Rhodesian Bush War, which was a guerilla war to fight for the independence of Zimbabwe in the 1970s. It ended with the declaration of independence of Zimbabwe in 1980 with a new leader called Robert Mugabe. This doctor lives in Europe now, but every year he returns to his old home country to stay for some weeks. He brought a suitcase full of medical supplies with him, to donate it to a hospital, because public hospitals are lacking everything. At the airport, custom officers opened his suitcase and demanded money for the supplies.      ANITA:      Corruption is everywhere. And it seems that there are different rules for different people. Yes, I think one can say that for every country, but the differences are so big here. If you have USD, if you are in a high position, if you are in the right network, you can have a great life in Zimbabwe. I have seen private houses with swimming pools blue as the sky, many shiny SUVs and most of the better off people employ gardeners, maids and other staff.      When I was there a new rule by the government was published. The minimum wage for a gardener or worker is allowed to be as little as eight USD. Per month. And of course: this is not paid in USD, but in Zimbabwe dollar.      For instance: The maid in a house - close to where I stayed - works seven days a week, from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m., doing housework, cooking, taking care of the kids. She is a so-called live-in maid. Due to the power cuts she has to iron by night. She also sleeps in the house of her employer. For this, she earns 10 USD per month. Most of the time the families of workers like her live in another part of town, where the rents are cheaper. So, because they cannot afford a car, if they want to go home, they have to take the bus which costs them around 1-2 USD. How should anyone be able to live from that?      And now a short word from my sponsors:      Not your keys, not your coins - be the holder of your keys for your bitcoin. For that: Use a well-built hardware wallet like the BitBox02 by SHIFT Cryptosecurity from Switzerland. With their upcoming app for Android you can connect the hardware wallet directly with your phone and send and receive bitcoin on the go. Check it out at shiftcrypto.ch - that’s shift c r y p t o.ch. You get free shipping with the code ""anita""      I could go on with these examples of mismanagement and corruption. For instance: MealieMeal - which is like a cornmeal- it is the Zimbabweans staple diet… The thing people eat on a daily basis like rice in Asia, noodles in Italy or potatoes in Germany. It's part of their diet and normally relatively affordable. But it is not available at the moment. The producers of MealieMeal are being forced by the government to get paid in Zimbabwe dollars. So they decided, before they are paid in this bad money that loses its value daily, they rather store the MealieMeal in their warehouses and wait for better deals. This is something that hits people in towns worse, than those in the countryside. Because there either you have your own corn or the local chief settles a deal with the producers so that his people get MealieMeal.      Basically much of the conversation is about where to get what, at which prices:      STREET AUDIO: Do you know that they have chibage?      Anita:      And I did not even mention the fuel queues up until now. So petrol: The urban spaces in Harare, Bulawayo and other towns are not densely populated in general. That means, that distances are very great. And there is no public transport like we know it.      Yes, there are a lot of mini buses and also bigger buses to travel over land. Someone like me would be completely lost because there are no timetables or stops with signs. And yeah, there are no road signs at all. Nowhere. So you really need to know your way or ask people. That means everything is depending on cars and buses. If you cannot afford that, you have to walk. And I saw a lot of people walking. Women, who were carrying heavy bags on their heads - yes like we see it on television - and men, who interestingly enough, carry much less than their accompanying women. And yes, I have asked. It is a very patriarchal society.      Coming back to the petrol.      There are severe petrol shortages. You never know when and where you can get petrol. I was told that most of the time, when fuel shortages occurred, the price was raised afterwards. In the weeks I was in the country, I saw many, many people queueing for petrol. Long lines of cars are parked at the side of the streets waiting for the petrol station to open. People spend nights and days queueing, never knowing for how long the petrol will last. One of my interview partners excused himself for not calling me at the time we agreed upon because he was in the petrol queue for such a long time that he did not have power anymore in his cell phone.      Before we dive deeper into the current situation in the following episodes, let's take a look back and take a look into the history of this beautiful land Zimbabwe and its people.      The Encyclopædia Britannica begins its history of Zimbabwe with ""The Stone Age""      The first Bantu people are thought to have reached Zimbabwe between the 5th and 10th centuries CE. Zimbabwe is home to many stone ruins, including those known as Great Zimbabwe, which has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.      Overview of Great Zimbabwe. The large walled construction is the Great Enclosure. Some remains of the valley complex can be seen in front of it.      The Portuguese, who arrived on the east coast of Africa at the end of the 15th century, dreamed of opening up the interior and establishing a route to connect their eastern settlements with Angola in the west. The first European to enter Zimbabwe was probably Antonio Fernandes, who tried to cross the continent and reached the neighborhood of Que Que (now Kwekwe).      A second great movement of the Bantu peoples began in 1830, this time from the south. The Ndebele, carved out a kingdom. The Ndebele were warriors and pastoralists, in the Zulu tradition, and they mastered and dispossessed the weaker tribes, known collectively as Shona (Mashona), who were sedentary, peaceful tillers of the land.      For more than half a century, until the coming of European rule, the Ndebele continued to enslave and plunder the Shona. This is an important fact for the later development.      During this period, however, British and Afrikaner hunters, traders, and prospectors had begun to move up from the south, and with them came the missionaries.      In South Africa Cecil Rhodes formed the British South Africa Company, which received its charter in October 1889. Its objects were to extend the railway, to encourage immigration and colonization, to promote trade and commerce, and - of course - to secure all mineral rights, in return for guarantees of protection and security of rights to the tribal chiefs.      The Ndebele resented this European invasion and in 1893 they took up arms, being defeated only after months of strenuous fighting. The Shona had at first accepted the Europeans, but they too became rebellious, and the whole country was not pacified until 1897.      ""The Rhodes Colossus"" by Edward Linley Sambourne, published in Punch after Rhodes announced plans for a telegraph line from Cape Town to Cairo in 1892.      By 1892 about 1,500 settlers from the south had arrived in Rhodesia. The railway reached Bulawayo in 1896 and Victoria Falls in 1904. After Cecil Rhodes's death in 1902 he was buried in the Matopos Hills and they built him a monument that stands on top of these hills destroying the beauty of the land.

In 1922 - British South Africa Company administration ended, the white minority opts for self-government.      1930 - Land Apportionment Act restricts black access to land, forcing many people into wage labour. Between 1930-1960s - Black opposition to colonial rule was growing.      1965 - Prime minister Ian Smith unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom under white minority rule, sparking international outrage and economic sanctions.      The Rhodesian Bush War lasted from 1972 to 1979 it was a Guerrilla war against white rule.      According to Rhodesian government statistics, more than 20,000 people were killed during the war. Rhodesian security forces, guerrillas and around 8.000 black civilians, and 500 white civilians were killed.      In 1980 - Zanu leader Robert Mugabe won independence elections. He became the first prime minister as Zimbabwe achieved an internationally recognized independence on April 18, 1980.      He stayed president of Zimbabwe until 2017.      Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family - hence remember how the Ndebele enslaved and plundered the Shona, before the European rule.      Because between 1982 and 1985, Mugabe sent the military and the so called 5th brigade - trained by North Korean - to crush armed resistance against him from Ndebele groups - in a military crackdown known as Gukurahundi, a Shona term which translates roughly to mean ""the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains"". The Gukurahundi campaigns were also known as the Matabeleland Massacres. Approximately 20,000 Matabele were murdered in these first years after the war; most of those killed were victims of public executions.      Margaret Thatcher's U.K. government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi.      Economically, Southern Rhodesia developed an economy that was narrowly based on production of a few primary products, notably, chrome and tobacco. It was therefore vulnerable to the economic cycle. The deep recession of the 1930s gave way to a post-war boom. This boom prompted the immigration of about 200,000 whites between 1945 and 1970, taking the white population up to 307,000. They established a relatively balanced economy, transforming what was once a primary producer dependent on backwoods farming into an industrial giant which spawned a strong manufacturing sector, iron and steel industries, and modern mining ventures. These economic successes owed little to foreign aid.      In the 1990s hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the U.K. government - which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution - halted its payments.      Over the course of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy steadily deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50 percent. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans - the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce - had left the country. Mugabe increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry.      From a human rights perspective I also want to talk about Mugabe's growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an ""un-African"" import from Europe. He described gay people as being ""guilty of sub-human behavior"", and of being ""worse than dogs and pigs"". This attitude may have stemmed in part from his strong conservative values, but it was strengthened by the fact that several ministers in the British government were gay. Mugabe began to believe that there was a ""gay mafia"" and that all of his critics were homosexuals. Critics also accused Mugabe of using homophobia to distract attention from the country's problems.      In February 2000, land invasions began as armed gangs attacked and occupied white-owned farms. The farm seizures were often violent; by 2006 a reported sixty white farmers had been killed, with many of their employees experiencing intimidation and torture. A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertilizer.      The farm invasions severely impacted agricultural development. Zimbabwe had produced over two million tons of maize in 2000; by 2008 this had declined to approximately 450,000. By 2009, 75 percent of Zimbabwe's population were relying on food aid, the highest proportion of any country at that time. Zimbabwe faced continuing economic decline. Hyperinflation resulted in economic crisis. By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600 percent. By 2008, inflation exceeded 100,000 percent and a loaf of bread cost a third of the average daily wage. Increasing numbers of Zimbabweans relied on remittances from relatives abroad.      The country's lucrative tourist industry was decimated, and there was a rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem when he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.      In 2008, the parliamentary and presidential elections were held. After the election, Mugabe's government deployed its 'war veterans' in a violent campaign against his opponent Tsvangirai supporters. Between March and June 2008, at least 153 MDC supporters were killed. There were reports of women affiliated with the MDC being subjected to gang rape by Mugabe supporters. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans were internally displaced by the violence. These actions brought international condemnation of Mugabe's government.      This is only 12 years ago. No wonder that people are scared.      In 2009, Mugabe's government declared that - to combat rampant inflation - it would recognize U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilize prices. But then in November 2016 a new national currency called bond notes was introduced amid public resistance.      In 2017 Mr. Mugabe resigns after the military takes control. Former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa becomes president.      People have hope that from now on Zimbabwe might become a better place. But as it seems, nothing really has changed.      In January 2019, protests break out in major cities after the government more than doubles fuel prices in an attempt to tackle shortages and the black market.      In June 2019, Zimbabwe outlaws the use of any other foreign currency. Only Zimbabwean dollars are allowed as legal tender.      That meant that All USD one had held on a bank account in the country were changed into Zimbabwe dollar at the exchange rate of 1:1. This did not last long. Today - 9 months afterwards - the exchange rate on the streets is 1:43. So now 43 Zim Dollar are equivalent to 1 US Dollar.      INTERVIEW:      When I came here two and a half weeks ago, I think the official exchange rate was one to 17. And in the shops, we had one to 20 or 25. Today, we got one to 30 in a shop. While so in, yeah, in two and a half weeks, the rtgs or the bond, Zimbabwe bond lost a lot. I don't know how many percent that exactly now, but actually a lot of, yes, value. Yeah. So what do you see? Or what do you think is coming next? I mean, do you think you're going into hyperinflation again?      Speaker 2      We are in hyperinflation.      Anita Posch      You are still in again? Yes.      Speaker 2      Yeah. I think we are. It's just that it's not. It's not on the scale where last time we just like I feel like it just ran out of people's hands, like when we will became trillionaires. And quadrillion is like ... [it's] just there was no control left, like no one's coming and no one knew how to deal with it. We've been there before. So now it's like okay, let's try and control it. But ... we are currently in hyperinflation, I believe, so maybe an economist will tell me I'm wrong.      Anita:      In the three weeks of my stay the exchange rate on the street went from 1:20 to 1:30. This is a huge change. This is a sad situation because for the people living is getting difficult again.      And by the way: The Reserve bank of Zimbabwe maintains a Twitter account, where you can find tweets that paint a picture about what is happening in the country.      For instance, one tweet is threatening people with disciplinary measures for posting pictures of new banknotes on social media!      In the next episode you will hear more about the banking situation and how people here are used to living in a multicurrency system, which theoretically is a perfect starting point for people to adopt bitcoin.

42383437,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vv5N,1584623799,Storj's Decentralized Cloud Storage Service 'Tardigrade' Goes Live,"Decentralized storage provider Storj Labs says its blockchain-based cloud service is now available for businesses and individuals to securely store files and documents.      With the formal launch announced Tuesday, users are now able to begin migrating and backing up data onto the Tardigrade Decentralized Cloud Storage Service – named after the famously hard to destroy microorganisms.      The open-source network, which currently has 19 petabytes (19 million gigabytes) of available capacity, is hosted on thousands of nodes run by individuals and partners based all around the world. There are currently about 3,000 users on the platform.      “Decentralization benefits the cloud in many ways, and our first customers are already seeing how it improves security, privacy, and resiliency, while also lowering costs,” said Ben Golub, Storj Labs executive chairman, who joined the company from Docker back in early 2018.      When a file is uploaded, it is encrypted and then split into 80 fragments distributed on separate nodes. To hedge against the possibility an individual node could become compromised or experience an outage, users only need 29 pieces to fully reconstruct a file.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Storj's co-founder and chief strategy officer, Shawn Wilkinson, said the firm starts ""at about half the price"" of centralized cloud storage providers"" such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are also no bandwidth caps, meaning users can store as much data as they like on the platform.      Based in Atlanta, Storj raised $3 million in seed funding from Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures and Techstars in 2017 when it decided to pivot towards becoming an enterprise storage system. The protocol launched in private alpha at the end of 2018.      The platform migrated its storage service from bitcoin to ethereum back in 2017. Wilkinson said the company has no further plans to move protocols. ""Ethereum allows us to affordably send thousands of transactions to thousands of Storage Node Operators each month,"" he said.

42383434,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vuxp,1584622800,VC Deals in Crypto Remained Steady but Amount Invested Fell in 2019: Report,"Last year, crypto didn’t see as many big-bucks, late-stage VC deals as it did in 2018, a new report from CB Insights shows.      While 2019 only saw 15 fewer deals than 2018 for a total of 807 deals, the deal volume dropped by 34 percent, from around $4.2 billion to nearly $2.8 billion. This is because of the absence of a few large late-stage deals in 2018: Bitmain’s $400 million in equity financing, Coinbase’s $300 million Series E and Hyperchain’s $234 million Series B, according to the report, published Thursday.      In 2019, the industry’s largest raises were from Ripple’s $200 million and Figure’s $103 million Series C funding rounds. Still, the year saw 120 percent more volume than 2017’s $1.2 billion.      “I don’t think funding [volume] drops is indicative of the health of the industry. … A lot of younger companies are raising rounds,” said Alex Kern, fintech analyst at CB Insights. “Larger, more mature businesses didn’t come back for more capital.”      Funding fell from 2018 to 2019 across venture capital companies, corporate VC arms, angel investors, hedge funds and other investors. Corporate VCs, however, are 20 percent of the funding pie, coming up 9 percentage points since 2015. Angel investors had the second-largest drop-off, with a deal decline of 13 percent year-over-year. (“Other” was the largest category decline.) Institutions are becoming more comfortable putting their capital into the space, while angel investors “falling off” is a sign of the industry maturing, Kern added.      Over the past four years, VC deals have also been shifting from the U.S. to China. From 2015 to 2019, VC deals in the space dropped by 20 percentage points in the U.S. and rose by 20 percentage points in China.      “Part of it is regulatory, Binance is tremendously popular, and mining compares are in China with access to cheap electricity,” Kern said.      See also: After Painful 2018, Chinese Blockchain VCs Are Getting Back Into the Market      Funding to cryptocurrency companies is still multiples of funding going towards enterprise blockchain. And though mentions of “blockchain” by corporates dropped by more than half year-over-year, enterprise blockchain funding saw an increase of 61 percent from 2018 to $434 million, largely because of Ripple’s Series C. Funding for cryptocurrency firms was around $2.35 billion in 2019.      The report added that many of the corporate consortia for enterprise blockchain – such as Hyperledger and R3 – are “still in early stages.”      “We’re still seeing [corporates] launching proofs-of-concept and early trials,” Kern said. “It’s hard to say if they’re moving on pace or not because it's been hard to get good data. … If they put out not only expectations of cost savings, but also what kinds of cost savings they’re seeing as a result of deploying the tech at a larger scale, that would help.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/19/vc-deals-in-crypto-remained-steady-but-amount-invested-fell-in-2019-report,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Ripple said Wednesday DeeMoney is now using RippleNet to process transactions in a move aimed to cut costs.      Launched in 2018, DeeMoney provides same-day settlement services for Thai bank accounts. The company turned to RippleNet to increase the efficiency of transactions coming into the country, said CEO Aswin Phlaphongphanich.      ""[Ripple's] technology provides a single, automated system that speaks the same way to all its 300 partners worldwide, making it simple for our tech teams to integrate into our process,"" he said. ""This helps to reduce manual work and intervention, which in turn reduces costs, of which the savings are passed to our customers.""      Thailand is a hub for settlement and remittance services. The Bank of Thailand estimates that more than a million Thais work overseas, many of whom continue to send money back to their families.      Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), Thailand's largest commercial bank, first started testing a RippleNet-based cross-border remittance solution in 2018. The collaboration developed and SCB has added additional settlement services, including one based on a mobile app.      See also: Third-Party Cryptos Could Launch on XRP Ledger, Says Ripple’s David Schwartz      RippleNet is a 300-plus network of banks and financial institutions that use Ripple's blockchain for cross-border settlements and remittances. One of several products under its umbrella – called On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) – lets firms use the XRP cryptocurrency to avoid having to tie up large amounts of fiat currency. It's not clear if DeeMoney is using that particular service.      Ripple famously invested in MoneyGram last year, with the money-sending giant now using various Ripple products including XRP via ODL.

42383456,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvGh,1584616906,Bitcoin Sees 9% Gain as Turmoil Hits the Forex Markets,"View  Bitcoin (BTC) is gaining amid a sell-off in fiat currencies and could rise further if the U.S. stock markets track European equities higher.  Technical charts indicate scope for a rise to key resistance at $5,926.  A move higher would confirm a breakout on the hourly chart and may propel prices toward $6,400.    Bitcoin is on the rise Thursday morning (UTC), showing resilience in the face of a global dash for dollars seen in the foreign exchange markets.      At time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading near $5,670, representing a 9.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin found bids near $5,260 during the Asian trading hours and has been climbing since, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      While bitcoin is flashing green against the U.S. dollar, most fiat currencies are currently trading in the red. For example, the British pound-to-dollar exchange rate is hovering near 1.1555, the lowest level since 1980. The currency pair has dropped by nearly 8 percent this week.      The Australian dollar fell to a 20-year low of 55 U.S. cents early on Thursday and is currently reporting a 0.6 percent drop on the day.      The greenback has gained in the past six trading days against all major currencies, as noted by macro analyst Holger Zschaepitz.      The surge indicates many investors are selling everything, even safe havens like Japan's yen and Swiss francs, to move their money into dollars over fears of a coronavirus-led recession in the global economy. “If cash is king, then dollar cash is currently being world president,"" according to ING's head of global markets.      Bitcoin, however, isn't bowing down to the new cash overlord, and could see bigger gains if the U.S, equity markets put in a good performance in line with rising European stocks. At press time, the Euro Stoxx 50 – the eurozone's benchmark index – has added 1.3 percent to its value.      A risk reset on Wall Street cannot be ruled out, as central banks from Australia to Canada have launched easing programs to inject massive amounts of liquidity into the system.      Bitcoin's technical charts, too, are suggesting scope for a stronger recovery rally.    Daily chart    Bitcoin defended the psychological support of $5,000 on Wednesday and ended up producing a small hammer candle, validating seller exhaustion signaled on Monday.      A hammer candle occurs when sellers fail to keep prices at the lowest point of the day and is widely considered an early sign of a trend reversal.      The MACD histogram is printing higher lows below the zero line, indicating a drop in bearish momentum.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin produced a green marubozu candle in the 60 minutes to 10:00 UTC, which comprises a big body and small or no wicks. The bullish indicator shows buyers were in control from the session's open to its close.      The odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the top of the ascending triangle at $5,926. A high-volume break above that level could cause more bargain hunters to join the market, producing a stronger rise to the next resistance at $6,425 (December low).      Conversely, a triangle breakdown would open the doors for a re-test of the March 16 low of $4,446.

42383449,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvJD,1584612010,"CME Bitcoin Options Volume Hits Record Low, While Bakkt Goes Weeks With No Trades","Demand for bitcoin (BTC) options on regulated U.S. derivatives exchanges has dried up even as price volatility reaches record highs.      The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) traded just three bitcoin options contracts on Tuesday, with a notional amount of 15 bitcoin (approximately $80,000), the exchange told CoinDesk. That is CME's lowest daily volume for bitcoin options on record, according to crypto derivatives firm Skew Markets. The previous record low of $125,000 was registered Jan. 24.      CME’s product went live on Jan. 13 and traded a total of $2.2 million in notional value on the first day, beating its rival, the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt platform, which had traded roughly $1 million since its open on Dec. 9.      Volumes on CME rose to a record high of $5.4 million on Jan. 17, but have been declining ever since. As of Tuesday, trading volumes were down 96 percent from the minor spike of $2.1 million seen March 9.      Meanwhile, Bakkt has seen no options trading activity since Feb. 27.      Bakkt rolled out its product on Dec. 9 and saw a record volume of $528,000 in notional value on Jan. 8. However, its options volume evaporated following the launch of CME's options in mid-January.      Notably, Bakkt has traded option contracts on just four days since mid-January.      The slowdown in activity on both CME and Bakkt is perhaps surprising, given that bitcoin’s price volatility has soared over the last few days.      The cryptocurrency’s three-month implied volatility – the option market’s opinion of bitcoin’s potential moves – rose from 3.5 percent (66.9 percent annualized) to a record high of 6.8 percent (130 percent annualized) on a daily basis in the seven days to March 17, according to Skew data.      Heightened volatility typically fuels demand for hedging instruments like options, which are derivative contracts that give holders the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while a put option gives the right to sell.      However, the opposite has happened in bitcoin on regulated U.S. exchanges: volumes have actually dropped precipitously as volatility has skyrocketed.      See also: Bitcoin Sees 9% Gain as Turmoil Hits the Forex Markets      The decline in options volume seems to have been caused by institutional traders treating bitcoin as a source of liquidity during the past week’s massive stock market sell-off, which triggered a multitude of margin calls.      “Last week’s market rout saw institutional investors selling many risk assets, including bitcoin. CME is a regulated platform designed for traditional investment managers seeking bitcoin exposure without a priority of ownership or utilization, and therefore saw a drop in volume as their customers led the flight to cash,"" Tom Lombardi, director at digital asset management firm Wave Financial told CoinDesk.      Supplementing that argument is the fact that open interest, or open positions on CME’s option market, fell to a five-week low of $6.5 million of notional value on March 12 and stood at $8.4 million on March 17. That’s down significantly from the record high of $22 million witnessed Feb. 28.      Bitcoin futures listed on CME have also seen a slowdown in activity. Open interest declined to a two-month low of $171 million last week, having hit a high of $338 million on Feb, 12. Meanwhile, trading volume dropped to a three-month low of $88 million on March 6, after a record high of $1.1 billion on Feb. 18. It was $212 million on Tuesday.      The recent slide in volumes and open interest suggest traders likely closed out hedges (calls/puts) while liquidating positions in the spot and the futures market.    Broad-based slowdown    Options trading volume on Deribit, the world's biggest crypto options exchange, slipped to $52 million on Tuesday to register its lowest level since March 1.      Volume hit a record high of $248 million March. 12 as bitcoin crashed by a staggering 39 percent from $7,950 to $4,850, tracking risk aversion in the traditional markets. The downside move was likely exaggerated due to forced liquidations on the BitMEX exchange.

42383446,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vvCv,1584608400,Crypto Progressives Become Conservative With Their Own Chains,"CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the cofounder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.      Most burgeoning crypto enthusiasts go through a phase in life where they think to themselves: “Bitcoin is neat, but it would be so much better if it could just do x and y?” At this point, they either decide to hop aboard a new blockchain project (typically seeking to own a larger fraction of the supply than the share of bitcoin they own), or they reject the notion and stick with bitcoin.      I’ll call this former group (it could be better) ""crypto progressives."" Like political progressives, they are interested in making changes to society, unsatisfied with the status quo.      Crypto progressives often wonder why Bitcoiners are interested only in bitcoin (BTC), given that so many apparently technically superior alternatives exist. How could they possibly ignore a dizzying buffet of alternatives? The crypto progressive sometimes accuse Bitcoiners of falling prey to the endowment effect, of refusing to budge because of their established stake in the Bitcoin system. And indeed, there are significant transaction costs involved with taking one’s bitcoin wealth and embracing a new blockchain. But this is not the chief reason for rejecting alternatives.      See also: Nic Carter - How to Stop the Next Quadriga: Make Exchanges Prove Their Reserves      Bitcoiners tend to resent the accusation that their adherence to a sole project is merely contingent – a historical coincidence which they clung to out of habit. When pressed, they typically refer to one of two main justifications:      1. Bitcoin is the sole instantiation of a set of political and economic conditions for a successful monetary project. In a sense, Bitcoin fulfilled requirements it may have already had for a successful monetary alternative, and it was only in 2009 that these requirements were met.      2. Monetary goods rely on network effects by design; once a market leader is established, efforts at fragmentation are counterproductive.      I tend to think the first set of arguments is persuasive on its own. Bitcoin prides certain important qualities that other alternatives jettison, and is genuinely unique in this way. This is not to say that other protocols are without merit but they generally opt for different tradeoffs, tending to prioritize innovation over institutional stability. Some of bitcoin’s underlying principles include:    A strong regard for property rights, manifesting itself in a predefined monetary schedule with no discretion, a commitment to cheap validation, easily concealable information as keys to one’s assets and the minimization of Cantillon insiders – i.e. people who can monetize their proximity to the money spigot.  A development philosophy that stresses the opt-in nature of significant change. Hard forks are de-emphasized and soft forks encouraged. This allows the protocol to resist arbitrary change and protects the asset from expropriation, especially in a covert manner.  A ""governance"" regime in which power is divided among developers, miners and economic node operators, with no group having sole discretion over changes.  Fairness in issuance and an absence of seigniorage (more precisely, a free market for seigniorage, meaning that miner margins are generally slim), enabled by Proof-of-Work.    There’s other ways to describe the economic and political nature of bitcoin, but I would posit these as the most important. If you think values are important in the design of a monetary system, you are a Bitcoiner out of deliberate choice, not contingency. But there’s an even more persuasive argument to be made against mutinous alternatives. It is the logical incoherence of crypto progressivism.     Crypto progressivism    This is the idea that, if you replace a monetary standard and propose your own, you have no reasonable grounds to defend against someone else’s rebellion over your standard, and their campaign to replace it with their own. And so, if you commit to the permanent revolution, you end up with a recursive situation where no stable monetary standard is ever selected.      Hal Finney was perhaps one of the first Bitcoiners to ever make this point. In a comment on Bitcointalk in 2011, he pithily explained the issue with crypto progressivism:      “Any successful replacement of the Bitcoin blockchain will forever undermine the credibility of any successor. How is an investor to know that it won’t happen again?      Rebooting now may benefit a few thousand early adopters. What happens when hundreds of millions use Bitcoin 2? They’ll be just as jealous and envious of you as you are of others. Given the precedent you want to set, how will you argue against yet another reboot?”      Interestingly, Hal was responding to a thread (written in May 2011, when the price of bitcoin was about $8) suggesting the stash of coins Satoshi Nakamoto and others mined early in 2009 constituted a ""tax"" on late adopters, and agitating for a relaunch of bitcoin.      See also: Nic Carter - Policymakers Shouldn’t Fear Digital Money: So Far It’s Maintaining the Dollar’s Status      Hal understood that if one’s objection to bitcoin was the empowerment of early adopters this would be a problem for all other would-be replacements. Interestingly, the circumstances of bitcoin’s birth were rather favorable as far as distribution is concerned. Satoshi appears to not have claimed his million or so coins. Many cheaply acquired coins from that era are lost. And due to the lack of a pre-mine and the presence of PoW, everyone who earned coins had to pay market price for them (either at an exchange or with electricity).      It’s an inescapable reality that the rise of any novel monetary system – which entails demonetizing an existing Store-of-Value asset in favor of a new one, as has happened countless times in history – will benefit those earliest to make the switch.      This is the case, for example, in dollarization events, when it is those who are earliest to desert the local currency that benefit from favorable exchange rates, to the detriment of their laggard peers. So monetary transitions involve wealth redistribution by their very nature. So far, we have not devised a means to take a snapshot of the distribution of wealth and replicate it in a new monetary medium. The more pressing questions to me are: how frequently should we churn monetary systems? And how much better must a successor be, to justify replacing an established one?    Those who style themselves crypto progressives when rejecting the orthodoxy almost inevitably become crypto conservatives as they settle on a system they like.    The example of Ethereum is telling. Ethereum initially competed with Bitcoin on features such as a more expressive base layer, theoretically cheaper transactions, greater throughput, and a commitment to rapid innovation. But when other blockchains like EOS came about and took these ideas to their extreme (by compromising on validation costs, EOS offers more block space than Ethereum), most Ethereans did not desert their blockchain in favor of the newcomer. Even though they had justified their initial rejection of bitcoin with recourse to the exact same language that EOS fans were now using to renounce Ethereum, they for the most part held firm, making reference to the growing network effects in the Ethereum infrastructure that had been built so far. And this was a reasonable retort! From a societal perspective, it is costly to upend an established system every few years.      So, those who style themselves crypto progressives when rejecting the orthodoxy almost inevitably become crypto-conservatives as they settle on a system they like. Therein lies the paradox. Now I am not suggesting that novel alternative blockchains that explore the tradeoff space are illegitimate. Rather, their proponents should admit that they are simply positing a different set of values to those espoused by established blockchains, rather than blandly touting their improved feature-set and assuming that users will make the switch.      Monetary systems are fraught and political by their very nature, and coaxing users away is a matter of convincing them to upend an established institution that they have come to trust. The permanent revolution gets tiresome. Most people eventually want to settle down and cultivate their own garden.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | FORKS,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/19/crypto-progressives-become-conservative-with-their-own-chains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7affb845c6c7350dfc99a0b86460d7fca6f81d58-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

SDX, the digital asset trading venue being built from the ground up by Swiss stock exchange operator SIX Group, had been searching for a leader to take over from interim CEO Thomas Kindler. As the new head of business, Grant fills that role, a spokesman for SDX confirmed.      Grant has also previously served as CEO of the R3 Lab and Research Centre. SDX selected R3’s Corda platform to supply the DLT infrastructure for the new digital asset exchange in March 2019.      “I am very excited to join the leadership team at SDX as they aim to launch the world’s first end-to-end digital exchange,” said Grant in a statement. “The team has already made huge progress and I’m looking forward to contributing my experience and working with our institutional clients around the work to continue the growth and expansion of the next generation of financial market infrastructure.”      It’s unclear where this leaves Grant’s other venture, DrumG. The startup, which aimed to create interoperability between enterprise versions of ethereum and R3’s Corda network, had raised some $6.5 million in Series A funding from ConsenSys back in October 2018, and Joe Lubin, CEO of the Ethereum studio, had joined DrumG’s board of directors.      As recently as last September, Grant was taking to the stage espousing the merits of DrumG Technologies, which employs about 20 staff across offices in New York, London and Bermuda.      However, ConsenSys appears to be re-calibrating its outgoings and has been forced to cut staff this year from some parts of its operations.      Neither Grant, DrumG nor ConsenSys returned requests for comment on the state of the venture by press time.      Bumpy road      The past 18 months have been something of a bumpy road for SDX. The project was forced to delay its rollout, slated for summer 2019, until around the end of this year.      In addition, Ivo Sauter, SDX’s head of clients and products, and Sven Roth, its chief digital officer, both left their full-time positions in January, with a “disalignment” from the project’s original goals being cited after original SDX chief Martin Halblaub departed last summer.      Tomas Kindler, who was filling in for Halblaud, expressed a wish to take a senior position within the main exchange group, according to a SIX spokesman. Kindler would help oversee the planned integration of Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME), the Spanish stock exchange SIX has bid for.      “Tim has a comprehensive background in both the new and old worlds of capital markets innovation,” said Thomas Zeeb, head Securities & Exchanges at SIX Group, and chairman of SDX, said in a statement.      “This background is an essential prerequisite to successfully lead the development of SDX and to fulfil SIX’s growth ambition to build the financial ecosystem of the future.
