42377008,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzvZ,1395176739,7 Things Merchants Should Consider Before Hosting a Bitcoin ATM,"In case you've missed it, the bitcoin ATM business is exploding.  From South Korea to South Boston, bitcoin ATMs (BTC ATMs) are rapidly gaining traction in an industry that is looking to provide consumers with simple interactions that separate the notorious digital currency from its media mystique.  To this end, BTC ATMs are already succeeding, providing users with their first taste of buying (and sometimes selling) bitcoins. So far, hundreds of customers have used the machines to create their own digital wallets and make bitcoin purchases, but the real goal is imparting this experience to millions more.  This potentially lucrative mission has, in turn, given rise to new players along the value chain, namely ATM suppliers like Genesis Coin, Lamassu and Robocoin, as well as a greater number of local operators seeking to build expansive networks of machines in high-traffic locations.  Depending on the operator (and how far they're willing to go for publicity), this can mean partnering with shopping malls or even housing BTC ATMs in mobile trailers. But more commonly, it will mean striking up partnerships with bitcoin-friendly merchants – established businesses with loyal customer bases – like Imbibe, the New Mexico cigar bar that won the race to host the first US bitcoin ATM.  Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley  said he has already seen a surge in demand from small merchants who are clamouring to be introduced to ATM operators, some even offering to pay for such a meeting, and concisely explained why:  ""We're bringing in 1,500 high-paying customers [a month] in that coveted 18-40 demographic. Those are real numbers for any business.""  The figures are just as compelling for BTC ATM providers.  To date, Lamassu says it has shipped more than 200 of its $5,000 one-way bitcoin vending machines. Robocoin has likewise launched a lucrative incentive program to enlist bitcoin evangelists as unpaid sales reps for its larger, $20,000 two-way currency exchange kiosks, offering $10,000 in BTC for every new customer its reps enroll.  Manufacturers and operators  Though the exact specifications of each manufacturer differs, the responsibilities of their operators remains the same. BTC ATM manufacturers design, produce and sell the machines, while operators handle the local marketing and compliance.  Explained Kelley:  ""Our operators have three jobs. One, make sure that they're fully complying with all anti-money laundering and 'know your customer' laws in their specific jurisdiction. Two, make their customers happy [by] finding a kickass location and educating the customers and people in their community. Three, make sure [owners] never run out of inventory, so that people never go wanting for bitcoin.""  But, winning hearts and minds is no easy challenge, especially as bitcoin faces continued bad press, with the now-bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox and the now-defunct online black market Silk Road being the most obvious culprits.  Such reports were top-of-mind for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based restauranteur Kathy Turner, when she received an email from the founders of CoinShovel, a Maine-based bitcoin mining business, this January with the subject line ""Opportunity – Bitcoin ATM"".  The time had come for execs Steve Govoni and Briton Callahan to think about scaling up their company, and they were in need of a local business partner for their first ATM. Veggie Galaxy, Turner's vegetarian diner that regularly hosts local bitcoin meetups, seemed a logical first choice.  Yet, despite the promise of a partnership, Turner and her co-owner Adam Penn had their reservations. Turner was unsure of liabilities and compliance costs, as well as the potential dangers of attracting unsavory customers.  ""I [was] really worried about shady people coming into Veggie Galaxy with tons of cash that they want to anonymously turn into untraceable bitcoin.""  Ultimately, Turner and Penn needed an hour-long conversation with CoinShovel to feel comfortable about considering the deal. The resulting discussion provides an overview of the seven major points merchants should consider as they seek to make their own determinations:  1. Security  It may seem ironic, but ATMs face a security threat from the high volumes of fiat currency they need to hold to service users. Robocoin ATMs, which allow both cash-to-bitcoin and bitcoin-to-cash transactions, house up to 2,200 bills.  The Lamassu unit being considered for Veggie Galaxy is one directional, accepting only cash for bitcoin, but it still holds between $5,000 and $10,000, according to CoinShovel.  Kelly recognizes this risk, and drove home the idea that security will be paramount to increasing consumer adoption.  ""You have customers walking up to these machines with thousands of dollars. [Operators] have to make sure [their] customers are feeling really comfortable, and that means [they're] going into a really safe and secure environment.""  To assuage Turner's concern, CoinShovel suggested setting a firm figure for the levels of cash it could keep in Veggie Galaxy, opting against setting regular pickups until spending data is known.  2. Supervision  One of the more sensational stories from the BTC ATM boom has been the tale of a Canadian man who was able to cut a machine's profit simply by sitting next to it with a wallet app, siphoning off customers for trades at a reduced fee.  While this is an extreme example, BTC ATMs do require some oversight, owners acknowledge.  Anthony Di Iorio, who operates a BTC ATM in Bitcoin Decentral, a 5,500 square-foot working space for bitcoin projects in Toronto, told CoinDesk his Robocoin machine wasn't perfect. He reported issues with his BTC ATM's receipt printer that led him to stop using this functionality.  Still, Di Iorio is willing to give the machine his patience, suggesting others should to do the same:  ""We understand that this is their first unit, and that they're working on their second generation.""  Zurich-based Lamassu owner Marián Jančuška affirmed that his ATM does benefit from assistance. Said Jančuška:  ""It doesn’t take much of my time to manage the ATM, but this is thanks to a guy who rents the passageway, is nearby most of the day, and is able to restart the machine if necessary.""  3. Customer support  For a busy merchant where employee resources are scarce, customer support remains an understandable concern, as providing this function could detract from the business's main revenue stream.  In particular, Veggie Galaxy's owners were worried about their liability for dealing with customer issues and disputes.  Di Iorio said he has only had one dispute, which he was able to resolve quickly, but indicates merchants would likely need a support service, even to answer simple questions about the machine's use:  ""It's not as simple as a regular ATM. There is some handholding you have to do with some people.""  CoinShovel said it would be willing to provide phone support services to customers so that Veggie Galaxy staff would not need to directly field questions from BTC ATM users.  4. Installation  Simply getting the machine into the store is another concern.  Robocoin kiosks weigh more than 750 pounds, and require special installation to increase their security. For example, the official Robocoin website advises that owners ""bolt [their] kiosk into the ground with the included mounting blocks"".  Still, obstacles aren't necessarily removed with Lamassu units, which weigh in at roughly 100 pounds.  Jančuška said his own Lamassu set-up would have benefitted from forethought, adding that his installation process took more than two weeks:  ""I didn’t start designing the stand until the machine arrived. It took me about a week to design and another week to manufacture. The manufacturer also mounted the stand to the wall and the floor. It needed 24 hours to dry and solidify. Then it was just a question of tightening a few screws and turning on the power.""  CoinShovel noted it was considering a similar protective enclosure for its Lamassu machine, though it downplayed the ability of thieves to simply snatch up the unit even if this protection was breached.  To further assuage this fear, the company offered to install additional surveillance for the unit that could help guard against theft, a tactic Kelley agrees should be encouraged.  Still, such security measures are optional. Di Iorio chose to not protect his machine at all.  ""Our ATM just needed to be plugged in. It's in my building, so we didn't feel the need to bolt it down,"" he explained.  5. Visibility  For Veggie Galaxy, much of the discussion was centered on visibility, or more broadly, how the ATM could be installed in a way that established a synergy with the existing store and its traffic.  Owners Kathy and Adam Penn maintained that keeping the BTC ATM too close to the front window may inspire smash-and-grab attacks, whereas putting it too far in the back of the restaurant may not give it proper attention.  Ultimately, both parties decided that the goal was to ""promote awareness"" and that it was perhaps best stored near the main cash register, even though – due to transaction clearing times – customers won't yet be able to buy bitcoin and quickly make a purchase.  6. Criminal deterrents  As for Turner's concern about criminals using the machine, BTC ATM manufacturers say they already comply with know your customer (KYC) regulations so as to ensure that machines are used in accordance with the law.  Evan Rose, president and CEO of Bitcoin ATM, which produces Genesis ATMs, stressed that the enhanced security features his BTC ATMs offer, such as biometrics, help make them safer than traditional cash ATMs.  Likewise, Di Iorio suggested he was comfortable with his access to information from his customers, adding that he has imposed KYC-level security, even though bitcoin is not yet considered money in Canada.  ""We have a maximum $2,000-per-day limit per customer, tracked through their phone number, that's the maximum we allow every 24 hours. We take their phone numbers [...] to ensure they're not going over the limits we have on the machine.""  7. Service agreements  Of course, in addition to simply housing the machine, merchants will also need to pay for its power supply, and potentially cover the device under their insurance policies. Understanding these added costs, and bringing them to the attention of the operator is essential for both parties so that a rental agreement can be established.  While Veggie Galaxy is considering accepting a flat rental fee for housing the ATM, more complex arrangements that entail profit-sharing are not hard to imagine, given that CoinShovel plans to charge a 5% markup on transactions.  For example, Di Iorio is self-stocking his machine as opposed to integrating it into a bitcoin exchange, a move that reduced his costs. Now, however, Di Iorio needs to price his ATM competitively with other services, such as over-the-counter bitcoin exchanges like LocalBitcoins.com, which facilitate more inexpensive peer-to-peer transactions.  Understanding these potential added costs and dividing responsibilities between parties will likely be key to fostering a lasting agreement. In this instance, Veggie Galaxy and CoinShovel agreed informally to a trial, 30-day agreement so all concerns could be worked out.  CoinShovel is now in the process of registering with the required Massachusetts regulatory bodies to meet the compliance requirements  Ultimately, Turner suggested that while she is supportive of the bitcoin community, it's a business decision, and she'll be watching is how much business the ATM brings in over the trial before she moves forward with the deal.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/18/7-things-merchants-should-consider-before-hosting-a-bitcoin-atm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99093d0e4021281bf3807397d1150c9c137ae83b-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzml,1395172466,Western Union CEO: 'First-World' Bitcoin Not Ready for Global Use,"Western Union CEO Hikmet Ersek offered a strong criticism of bitcoin and other virtual currencies today, calling the payment methods ""first-world in nature"" and suggesting they do not currently have practical uses for consumers in underdeveloped nations.  The statements echo previous concerns from the Colorado-based global remittance giant issued last year, in which it first stated digital currencies were not yet ready for cross-border, international money transfer.  In the post, the first of what will be a three-part series for Fortune, Ersek offered his take on why bitcoin and other digital currencies may struggle to take hold in the remittance market, choosing to focus on the issue of whether recipients would be able to use the funds.  Said Ersek:  ""Up to this point, the digital currency conversation has not addressed the practicalities on the receive-side.""  Ersek indicated that while bitcoin has made a more practical use case as a payments vehicle in the developed world, adoption will need to become more widespread there before nations with less tech-savvy consumers are encouraged to develop an infrastructure.  Unanswered questions  Ersek also listed three major questions he believes the digital currency community has yet to answer when it comes to the technology's use in cross-border payments.  These included such concerns as whether persons receiving digital currency outside first-world countries would be able to use it, whether small or medium-sized enterprise recipients in these areas would be equipped to spend or transfer it and whether these consumers and businesses would not prefer another option even if bitcoin was usable for this purpose.  Ultimately, Ersek indicated that the industry's ability to enact and follow consumer protection best practices will be the deciding factor.  ""Without continued enhancements to ensure consumer protection, which ultimately translates to increased reliability, I believe consumers and businesses will continue to gravitate to cash, bank accounts and cards.""  Untapped potential  Despite these issues, Ersek suggested that he is watching virtual currency developments with ""great interest"", a fact that is evidenced by his analysis of the topic as part of a larger work.  The benefits of digital currencies clearing these hurdles, Ersek suggests, make them worthy of consideration. In particular, he noted their ability to potentially transform business models and promote financial inclusion  Still, even with consumer adoption questions resolved, Ersek suggested regulation and compliance would likely remain significant hurdles, even to their use in first-world nations, potentially hinting at topics for future articles to come.

42376991,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzaB,1395168963,Polish Bitcoin Exchange Bitcurex Relaunches Following Hacking Attack,"After last week’s hacking attack forced the site to temporarily shut down, Polish bitcoin exchange Bitcurex resumed service on 18th March.  The platform said the perpetrators did not manage to break its security measures and gain full access to its operational hot wallet.  ""Today, we launch trade in Polish zlotys, and on Thursday at 12:00 local time in euros to ensure our support team has sufficient capacity of handling bids in this important period,"" Filip Godecki, a representative of Bitcurex, told CoinDesk.  As earlier reported  , the exchange decided to temporarily close its site on 14th of March at 09:37 am local time as a result of a hack that targeted funds in user wallets.  Company representatives told CoinDesk that shutting down the site would allow its IT team to ""perform a necessary verification"".  Bolstered security measures  Bitcurex said in a statement on its website that its safety procedures prevented the hackers from further actions after the initial theft.  Explained a representative:  ""The service was shut down to carry out repair works and implement the necessary improvements to our system. Our internal procedures prevented any further losses which were limited to between 10 and 20% of our operational Hot Wallet Bitcurex.”  In addition to the installed IT security measures, the site was able to combat last week’s hacking attack thanks to its team of staff who monitor all the transactions and flag suspicious trading activity, according to Godecki.  The Polish exchange said that all the incurred losses were covered from its own funds.  ""Our fees will not be raised, nor will we introduce any other restrictions,” Bitcurex stated, adding that it has submitted a formal notification to relevant authorities regarding last week’s attack.  ""Due to this, we cannot disclose any further details on the attack which could hinder the activities of law enforcement authorities,” Godecki said.  The exchange also cautioned its users not to use a recently established site with a domain name similar to Bitcurex's.  Development plans  The company representative also said that, independently of the latest attack, the site is working on implementing additional security measures that will create additional layers of security and enhance user experience.  ""Over the following weeks, Bitcurex will enter a phase of rapid development,” Godecki said.  Several hours after the site resumed its operations on 18th of March, bitcoin was trading at a low of 1835.90 PLN ($607.80) and a high of 1969.00 PLN ($651.90) on Bitcurex. The exchange had a total volume of 238.2 BTC, according to the latest available data.  Established in July 2012, Bitcurex is based in Łódź, Poland, and is operated by local company Digital Future Ltd.

42376995,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzfD,1395163810,DigitalBTC to Enter Strategic Partnership With CloudHashing.com,"Australian investment firm Macro Energy Limited, which recently acquired digitalBTC, has announced a strategic agreement with CloudHashing.com – a company that lets customers pay to use its servers to mine bitcoin, rather than invest in their own rigs.  Macro  is planning to raise AU$9.1m as part of the digitalBTC deal and last week it said it will invest the money in mining operations and the expansion of other digitalBTC operations.  It now appears that a sizable chunk of the investment will go toward the newly announced strategic deal with CloudHashing.com.  'Win-win' situation  Under the agreement, CloudHashing.com's software will be deployed on digitalBTC's bitcoin hardware, located in data centres in Iceland and Texas. The hardware will be managed by CloudHashing.com, and the companies will have an opportunity engage in reciprocal arrangements for the supply of mining hardware.  This synergic relationship extends to trading too, as digitalBTC – a bitcoin investment and management company – will handle bitcoin trading activities for CloudHashing.com through its trade desk. Since CloudHashing.com is the largest bitcoin cloud mining provider on the planet, this sounds like a coup for digitalBTC.  “The provision of digitalBTC trading services to CloudHashing.com will create a win-win outcome for both digitalBTC and CloudHashing.com,” said digitalBTC's Executive Chairman Zhenya Tsvetnenko.  Expansion opportunities  Tsvetnenko said digitalBTC is poised and ready to expand in all facets of bitcoin operations, but it will start off by focusing on bitcoin mining:  “This agreement with CloudHashing.com will lead to the deployment of their best-in-class proprietary bitcoin mining management system to our state of the art hardware, allowing us to concentrate our software development resources on our integrated suite of retail-focused mobile applications for bitcoin and other digital currencies.""  Tsvetnenko and Macro Energy are clearly taking their bitcoin push seriously. They plan to raise a significant amount of money, but, more importantly, digitalBTC will be the first bitcoin company to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, allowing public market investors to get on board.  The market liked that idea and Macro Energy shares gained 42% following the announcement of the digitalBTC acquisition.  CloudHashing's love affair with Iceland  For its part, CloudHashing says it is proud to be the mining partner of choice to digitalBTC.  ""This is a mutually beneficial relationship and partnership for both parties. CloudHashing bringing its wealth of knowledge in the bitcoin mining space and digitalBTC is entering an exciting market with strong capital backing and proven bitcoin trading success,"" CloudHashing.com CEO Emmanuel Abiodun told CoinDesk.  Abiodun points out that interest in similar co-op deals is on the rise. He notes that CloudHashing.com has grown at ""an alarming rate"" and he expects even more success from deals with companies such as digitalBTC.  ""It is a trend I believe we will continue to see and companies like DigitalBTC are at the forefront,"" he added.  When asked to comment on CloudHashing.com's expansion into Iceland, Abiodun said mining in the country is growing at a rapid pace.  ""We have more than trebled our capacity in Iceland alone. Our overall pool size has grown over ten times since January 2014. Iceland is a great place to mine bitcoin and we have not had issues with regulators,"" he concluded.  At full capacity, CloudHashing.com expects it will be churning out between $7.5m and $10m dollars in coins a month. The sheer scale of the operation creates unique opportunities for digitalBTC and its trade desk.

42377001,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzo1,1395161066,Bank of Thailand Suggests Bitcoin Not Illegal But Warns Against its Use,"The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has issued a statement on bitcoin, warning consumers that it is not a currency and that its use comes with inherent risks, reports say.  The statement bears similarities to others issued from central banks around the world, most recently Mexico and Germany, but could be considered an improvement in the legal status of bitcoin users, as Thailand was widely considered to have implemented a bitcoin ban in the summer of 2013.  The bank stated, according to a partial translation published online:  ""Bitcoin is electronic data. Thus, it’s not considered a currency and can’t be used for payments, and [is] not considered legal tender like money. With no self worth, the value of such data varies based on the needs of the market. Bitcoin changes in value very quickly and it could became something of no value if none desired it.""  Effectively, bitcoin is just electronic data with no intrinsic value, and its value rises or falls depending upon the whims of the market.  The BOT also said that the illegal theft of data and the closing of online businesses such as Mt. Gox pose a threat to consumers.  Furthermore, consumers' legal recourse will be severely limited in the case of any claims over coins stolen or sent to the wrong wallet, or over goods purchased with bitcoin but not received.  Welcome news?  While hardly a ringing endorsement of digital currencies, the bank's words may come as good news for bitcoin users and businesses in Thailand. The key point being that they have not banned the cryptocurrency.  Over the past nine months, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Thailand has been an issue of great confusion.  Back in July 2013, Thai-based exchange Bitcoin Co Ltd suspended trading after a meeting with the Bank of Thailand in which the bank allegedly declared trading in the cryptocurrency illegal. A post on the company's website said at the time:  “At the conclusion of the meeting, senior members of the Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department advised that due to lack of existing applicable laws, capital controls and the fact that Bitcoin straddles multiple financial facets the following Bitcoin activities are illegal in Thailand.”  Then in February of this year the exchange reopened after receiving a letter from the bank seeming to indicate that it could trade after all. However, the legal status of bitcoin trading in the South-East Asian country was still unclear.  Adding to the confusion, the exchange received another letter days later, indicating that “interpreted the letter to serve its own interests”, and that it perhaps acted improperly by reinstating its services. At this stage, Bitcoin Co Ltd decided to remain trading until a clear statement was made.  Licensing issues  One issue with exchanges is not so much the legality of owning bitcoin, but whether they qualify for a licence to trade in cryptocurrencies, which could be considered a foreign exchange activity and therefore illegal.  Thailand’s Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department had also previously told Bitcoin Co Ltd that it was illegal to buy or sell bitcoins, exchange bitcoins for goods or services, or send and receive bitcoins outside of Thailand in an early hearing on the matter.  Hopefully, the legal status of exchanges in the light of the new statement will become clear in coming days.

At the beginning of the month, BTC China added litecoin support, enabling users to buy the popular altcoin using local currency CNY with 0% trading fees.  CNY-BTC trades on the site currently come with a 0.1% fee, but from 21st March, this will be removed.  A statement from the company reads:  ""In order to standardize the three trading methods, we have decided to waive the BTC/CNY trading commission fee from March 21, 11:00am (GMT +8)!""  Those who want to withdraw their litecoins from the site will have to pay a fee, though, of 0.001 litecoins (under $0.01). The current CNY withdrawal fee is 0.5%.  The company has also added a collection of new features to its service, including the option for users to add and manage multiple bank accounts.  Other new features include:    New Voice SMS Verification Code  If you are unable to receive SMS, you can opt for Voice SMS Verification Code.    New Confirmation Dialogue Box    A confirmation dialog box will pop-up when you place an order to minimize error occurrences.    No minimum CNY withdrawal limit    Even if your account balance is under 200CNY, you are able to withdraw all the remaining balance.    Litecoin API trading is now available    More Markets added to the Homepage      Back in November, BTC China beat Bitstamp and the now-defunct Mt. Gox to become the world's number one bitcoin exchange. Its daily trading volumes regularly exceeded 14,200 BTC.  At the time, Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, said: “It’s an honor to see that BTC China has been propelled ahead to number one in the worldwide rankings. The real credit goes to the people in China, for having recognized the importance and value of bitcoin.”  However, this has since changed dramatically, with Bitcoin Charts showing the exchange's current daily volume at around 3,370 BTC. Bitstamp is currently at the top of Bitcoin Charts' table, with a daily volume of around 15,625 BTC.  Bitcoin exchange data site BTCKan shows Chinese exchange Huobi as having a volume of 86,871 BTC over the past 24 hours, with OkCoin's volume reaching 79,691 BTC in the same period. There have been suggestions that both these exchanges are faking volume data, but Huobi's CEO recently emphatically denied doing so.  Lee told CoinDesk the motive behind dropping trading fees was to create consistency across the platform, having the same 0% rate for litecoin and bitcoin. However, it could be an attempt to gain back some of the customers it lost to its competitors when it imposed fees late last year.

42377005,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzrn,1395155299,US Treasury Adds Digital Currency Representative to Advisory Group,"At the latest Bloomberg Breakfast event held in New York on 18th March, David S Cohen, Under Secretary of the US Department of the Treasury, discussed the challenges of digital currencies as part of a broader conversation with the media outlet’s Matt Miller to air on Bloomberg TV.  In the hour-long talk, Cohen spoke about the organisation’s role as a global leader in educating consumers and governments on the evolving issue, paying a particular interest to the potential illicit uses of digital currencies, as well as the measures it is willing to take to ensure their proper use.  Most notably, however, Cohen revealed that the Treasury is taking an interest in ensuring that the digital currency industry evolves in a regulated manner despite these concerns.  For the first time, Cohen said, his group will be including an unnamed member of the digital currency community as part of the Treasury’s Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) in an effort to work toward this goal.  Chaired by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director, the body makes recommendations to the Treasury on issues regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, the US law that requires financial institutions to help detect and prevent money laundering.  Said Cohen regarding the decision:  “We are hopeful that formally including the virtual currency community’s voice in the BSAAG will mean that our regulatory approach as a whole, including our approach to virtual currency regulation, is better informed and more effective.”  Cohen indicated that there had already been “ad-hoc” meetings with members of the community, though this move is intended to ensure such conversation is more consistent.  Accounting for illicit use  Cohen began his prepared remarks by denoting the dangers of digital currencies in an effort to show his organization would not hesitate to take tough measures against those who abuse the technology.  For example, Cohen evoked the now-defunct digital currency Liberty Reserve, a site shut down through measures made possible by the controversial USA Patriot Act; and Silk Road, the online black market seized by law enforcement officials in late 2013, calling the negative attention paid to digital currencies in respect to these organisations “well-deserved”.  Such high-profile arrests, he said more positively, were also indicative that current regulations are working to contain the illegal use of digital currencies.  The under secretary indicated that the Treasury would take a approach that looks to encourage lawful practices, while understanding that not every entity will comply with rules. Cohen did, however, firmly warn organisations that are not in compliance with FinCEN, suggesting these entities could face consequences for this decision.  Cohen also addressed the innovative aspects of the technology, but suggested the full power of the illicit use of digital currency remains something it needs to consider:  “For terrorist financiers virtual currencies are understandably appealing: if funds could be swiftly sent across borders in a secure, cheap and highly secretive manner, it would suit their needs well. Moreover, access to a fully anonymous – or even pseudonymous – currency would allow terrorists to better cover their tracks.”  Fostering innovation  Despite these risks, however, Cohen indicated that his agency’s approach to digital currency would be rooted in two guiding principles – fostering innovation and ensuring transparency.  For the moment, at least, he indicated that the focus of the organisation is on the former.  ""We do not currently see widespread use of virtual currencies as a means of terrorist financing or sanctions evasion. The volatility associated with virtual currency, combined with its low capitaliziation and liquidity has limited its appeal to these illicit actors.""  Further, he noted that digital currency companies regulated under FinCEN are now filing more suspicious activity reports, a fact that shows evidence the industry is willing to assist law enforcement.  Cash-like restrictions  Cohen also suggested that it will seek to regulate digital currencies only at the points where digital currency is exchange for 'real' money.  “At the current adoption levels, we think that this type of oversight is sufficient to guard against money laundering and other illicit finance threats.""  However, he indicated that long-term, the Treasury may move to apply cash-like restrictions to the use of virtual currencies. Though, this he said, would come with wider adoption.  For now, Cohen said he remains focused on working with international partners, including the European Commission, to increase global understanding of the illicit finance threats associated with virtual currencies and regulatory approaches to confront them.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/18/us-treasury-adds-digital-currency-representative-to-advisory-group,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5d60b712c7310d67b296e110fba94265ed0565d-1000x729.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377007,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzuJ,1395152067,Bitcoin's Growing Role in US Politics,"Last November, the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) voted 3-3 over a proposal allowing political campaigns to accept bitcoin donations. While, in effect, the FEC didn't say no to bitcoin, it also left some important questions unanswered.  The proposal was brought to the FEC by lawyers of the Conservative Action Fund (CAF), which, as a political action committee, wanted to pressure the FEC into looking at the merits of bitcoin as a tool for fundraising.  During the hearing, FEC commissioners did come to some conclusions regarding bitcoin's role in political contributions, summarized in an advisory letter:  “The Commission concludes that CAF may accept bitcoins as in-kind contributions under valuation, reporting, and disbursement procedures.”  This statement places bitcoin in the same category as in-kind contributions, which means bitcoin must be treated like a good or a service given in donation – a 'thing of value' – and not as money.  However, the advisory also raises questions about how politicians will deal with bitcoin donations, and, given the midterm elections due in November, coupled with recent negative bitcoin events, the issue of the cryptocurrency within the political sphere is likely to see considerable attention in 2014.  Growing libertarianism  The recent news cycle regarding Mt. Gox's meltdown seems to have to shaken the political wasp's nest regarding bitcoin in the US.  Concerned about the risks of cryptocurrencies, West Virginia's Democrat Senator Joe Manchin recommended banning them altogether.  In response, Jared Polis, a Colorado Democratic Representative, wrote a satirical letter to the Fed, SEC and FDIC, among others, to request a ban on the dollar because of its use in illicit activities. His point being, of course, that, no matter the type of money, illegal things can inevitably be done with it.  Despite the doubts of some politicians, a mix of youthful optimism, along with disillusionment with the existing banking hierarchy following the 2008 global financial collapse, is leading to an increased interest in the libertarian movement, potentially exerting some influence on bitcoin acceptance in US politics.  Wes Benedict, who chairs the Libertarian Party, says that bitcoin leans towards free market ideals that the group embraces:  “We are for free market currencies, and we’re glad to see that something like bitcoin is doing well.""  Those who identify with the libertarian movement are likely to be more in tune with currency issues.  Benedict says that one reason that the party was founded in 1971 was because of President Nixon's decision to move away from the gold standard for the US dollar. ""With respect to currencies, we just support free markets,"" said Benedict.  True to Benedict's word, the Libertarian Party accepts bitcoin donations. Although he says that it represents a small percentage in proportion to the party's fundraising total. It is a growing avenue of revenue, however.    Libertarianism isn't so much about being non-conformist or non-cooperative as it is about being pro-individual and pro-entrepreneurship.      — Libertarian Party (@LPNational) March 13, 2014    Bitcoin donations  Because the Libertarian Party is more closely aligned with the concept of digital currencies, however, doesn't mean that other parties aren't looking at it as a fundraising tool too.  Steve Stockman, a Republican representative from Texas, raised funds for his Senate campaign by wearing a QR code at the NYC Bitcoin Center last New Year's Eve. He was later defeated by opponent John Coryn in the Republican primary battle for that seat, however.  Stockman is not alone in seeing advantages in bitcoin.  Last year, Cadillac, Michigan, mayor Bill Barnett also accepted bitcoin for his campaign. Barnett lost his relection effort in a narrow defeat.  Bryan Parker, a Democrat currently running for mayor of Oakland, California, is making rounds gathering support and eliciting bitcoin donations.  Speaking at a bitcoin meetup in Silicon Valley recently, Parker told the audience that bitcoin could eventually change an election result.  Upward trend  Parker's quest continues. He has teamed up with payment processor GoCoin to accept bitcoin, liquidating the funds into fiat as soon as they are received. He said that the total of donations he receives in BTC is just a small percentage of the amount raised.  However, bitcoin appears to be on an upward trend, and Parker's geographic location in the Bay Area – a technology hub – does mean he has a local audience of bitcoin enthusiasts.  Parker's use of GoCoin is one of the ways that political campaigners can accept bitcoin and turn it into fiat. But using GoCoin as a processor has limitations.  To facilitate the fundraising process further, a non-partisan organization called CoinVox has launched, providing mobile support, QR codes, and other necessities for politicians to get up and running with a systematic approach for accepting bitcoin.  CoinVox essentially wants to become the Rally.org for bitcoin donations, according to its founder Christopher David.  Bipartisan fund  One reason that the FEC was asked to come to a decision on bitcoin donations was because of Dan Backer – a Washington, DC attorney who has the Conservative Action Fund as one of his clients and made the request for clarification over bitcoin donations.  Backer, however, says he is not completely satisfied with the FEC's guidance:  ""You absolutely have the right to contribute to political candidates with bitcoin. The only question is then is: what do you do about reporting and valuation issues?""  Because he feels ignorance of cryptocurrencies is an issue, Backer recently created BitPAC.  The aim of BitPAC is to ""ensure that decisions about bitcoin are made by those who've benefited from bitcoin,"" the organization's website says.  Furthermore, Backer is keeping up the political pressure on the FEC to offer more clarity on the reporting and valuation component of accepting bitcoin donations, aspects he describes as ""technical issues"".  ""Members [of Congress] are not going to return contributions simply because the FEC cannot agree on the technical aspects of it,"" Backer pointed out. He added:  ""Let’s create a little political pressure. If there’s one surefire thing, it’s that candidates and their money are not soon parted.""  This November, 435 seats in the US House of Representatives and 33 of the 100 seats in the Senate will be contested. Over 30 states will be holding elections for governors and legislatures.  We can expect a lot of candidates and political incumbents to be talking about, and accepting, bitcoin in 2014.

42377002,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzkF,1395147529,Database Glitch Causes Blockchain Outage,"The bitcoin wallet and block explorer service Blockchain.info has been down since late last night (17th March) and it seems the issue is bigger than originally anticipated.  A problem first came to light when a reddit user started a thread about a failed 'shared coin' transaction. Blockchain.info responded to his post and quickly moved to disable shared coin functionality.  The move was followed with a tweet letting users know that shared coin transactions had been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation:  ""We have temporarily suspended shared coin transactions while investigating some transactions that are 'stuck'. The particular transaction in question is https://blockchain.info/tx-index/115315411/10. Rebroadcasting this transaction in bitcoind results in Error code -22.""  Shared coin transactions were re-enabled four hours later, but further issues came to light and blockchain.info was taken down soon after.  User funds 'safe'  The Blockchain.info team traced the problem back to a database issue and it promptly tweeted that it would take ""several hours"" to resolve.  Blockchain.info was quick to point out that it was not hacked and that all funds were safe throughout the outage, which was the result of a database bug. Since Blockchain.info does not hold any keys, there was no risk to users' coins.  Wallet function was not affected by the issue and user wallets could be restored even during the outage. A guide was published on the Blockchain.info blog, but it seems that many users did not get the message.  Once again the issue has proved that many bitcoin users aren't very informed about wallet technology, and even about some relatively basic principles.  Blockchain.info was quick to reassure the public that there was no danger to funds, but the sudden influx of users looking for information quickly brought down the company blog and allowed misinformation to propagate through social networks.  In a statement Blockchain.info apologized for the extended outage and said it is working hard to restore services.  ""As we mentioned previously, the outage was caused by a bug in some database handling code. Please rest assured that your wallets are safe and this outage does not affect the security of funds or the completion of executed transactions.""  Blockchain.info also published instructions on how to import wallet backups via MultiBit.  Limited damage  Despite the outage continuing for some hours, the issue has not been far reaching. A few services like ATM provider BitVendo have been affected, but the damage appears to be limited.    @blockchain is down, please avoid using the bitcoin ATM until they're back online - https://t.co/6CIVTHvETa      — BitVendo (@BitVendo) March 18, 2014    Blockchain.info informed CoinDesk that its team has been working around the clock and that progress is being made. All relevant updates will be posted on its blog.  ""Once we're there, we will publish a full post-mortem of this unusual database issue,"" Blockchain said.  ""Because of how Blockchain was designed, all of our users who linked an email address with their account, or manually made a backup, still have complete access and control of their bitcoins, even during the outage.""  In light of recent security breaches and the Mt. Gox disaster, it is understandable that much of the bitcoin community is edgy. At least in this case the issue seems benign, even if annoying and disruptive.  It should be noted that Blockchain.info has been on a roll in recent months. In December it acquired bitcoin price app ZeroBlock, in January it announced the creation of its one-millionth wallet, and earlier this month it rolled out a new bitcoin app for merchants.

42377003,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzqX,1395139518,"With Bifubao's Wallet, Users Can Prove Funds via Cryptography","Can bitcoin exchanges and online wallets can be trusted to hold all the bitcoins they claim to? Well, it's a contentious issue.  However, Chinese startup Bifubao claims it has solved this conundrum with its new user-verifiable wallet service.  Many bitcoiners will have faced the question: ""If bitcoin transactions are public and secure, why didn't anyone know Mt. Gox wasn't really holding their funds?"" The answer here is that Mt. Gox and many other online coin-keepers, including wallets and gambling sites, keep their transactions 'off-chain'.  Once the money is sent to the company, it leaves the public bitcoin block chain and goes into that company's proprietary transaction system, re-entering the full public chain when it is withdrawn – if it is still there to be withdrawn, that is.  Following Mt. Gox and other high-profile disappearing acts in bitcoin's short history, users are demanding more accountability from their online services. Anyone holding any amount of your bitcoin in future will need to prove the funds are there.  Proof of reserves  Bifubao has implemented what it claims is a world-first 'proof of reserves' trust system – a verifiable guarantee that most or all bitcoins it holds are actually held in reserve. Bifubao's system uses the 'Merkle Tree' technique originally proposed by bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell.  Bifubao users can also send and receive bitcoins with email addresses and mobile phone numbers. The system also includes support for merchant payment buttons and an API for application integration.  Bifubao's CEO is Jack Wang, who referred to the importance of openness in regaining user trust in bitcoin services. He said:  ""Even though this approach reveals some of our data, we think it is worth the trade-off for the additional transparency. We have also open-sourced our code so that the community can see our implementation.""  'Merkle Tree' approach  It does this by deploying a cryptographic technique named the Merkle Tree, or hash tree. Similar to bitcoin's own block chain with some extra values, it is a method of quickly proving whether data or files in certain places are true. Hash trees have been used by various P2P networks over the years to verify file segments, including Gnutella and LimeWire.  Any bitcoin-keeping company could simply publish a flat, public list of all balances for users to check, but the Merkle Tree approach allows the company to obscure most of that information while allowing users to verify their funds have been counted as part of the company’s reserves.  The Merkle Tree approach allows users to verify that their exchange has enough funds to cover their balance, without actually knowing the total or amounts held by other users. Unlike the block chain, a tree structure means not every new addition needs to be connected to every other.  An exchange would publish a hash of the 'root node', or base of the tree, publicly. Upon logging in, a user would see their own account 'node' containing their balance, and encrypted hashes of everything between their balance and the tree's base, proving that a user's account is included in that original value.  Wang explained it further:  ""The second half of the equation is proving assets equivalent to the amount shown at the root node of the tree. To that end, we provide links to two cold storage addresses. We've signed a message using the private key of each of those addresses to prove ownership.""  ""Since these cold storage addresses won’t contain 100% of the bitcoins we hold, the number of bitcoins stored at these addresses will differ from the bitcoins shown at the root node. However, this should reassure users that we control at least the vast majority of those funds.""  Still relies on user checks  For the system to be effective, however, users (or enough of them) must actually check their information against the company's from time to time.  Bifubao's code can be found on GitHub. A full technical explanation of the system with code examples is on the company's blog.  ""Trust in bitcoin is directly related to trust in bitcoin companies. We hope this encourages other companies to follow suit,"" added Kevin Pan, Bifubao’s CTO.  Fractional reserves  For those new to the 'traditional' banking system we have today, the term 'fractional reserve' means banks hold only a small (as low as 10%) amount of the total currency units their customers have entrusted to them. The rest is put to use elsewhere, usually in the form of investments or loans.  Should all customers decide to withdraw their funds at the same time, the bank has a problem. Or rather, you the customer have a problem. These 'bank runs' are not so rare, and have often happened in times of national emergency or even economic uncertainty, as was the case with the UK's Northern Rock in 2007.  It's fair to say those who believe in bitcoin due to 'sound money' principles have a problem with the current fractional-reserve banking system for this very reason. This makes claims of bitcoin storers running fractional reserve systems, without their customers' knowledge, all the more outrageous.  While a tree technique like Bifubao's does not prevent a fractional reserve system, it does force a company to be honest about exactly how much of a reserve it keeps.  Just as bitcoin itself uses cryptography to enforce transparency and honesty (at least as far as transactions are concerned) so too will cryptography build other structures to return user trust in the networked services they need to function in the modern world.

42376997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzhj,1395112095,"Mt. Gox Allowing Users to Login, Check Balances","Updated (18th March, 5:43 GMT)  Mt. Gox  has apparently updated its website, now allowing users to log in and confirm exactly how much money they have locked away.  The otherwise plain page shows balances both in unobtainable BTC and fiat currency, with no explanation given for the change. It also does not list the exchange's current bitcoin value.  Mt. Gox's customer call center confirmed the login page is genuine. A post earlier in the day on Reddit had claimed the site was compromised and someone was collecting login credentials, but this now appears to be a hoax. The call center representative did, however, mention that balances users see after logging in may not be 100% accurate.  Before anyone has their hopes raised too much, a legal announcement underneath each balance reminds users the feature is effectively, for now, of novelty value only:    This balance confirmation service is provided on this site only for the convenience of all users.      Please be aware that confirming the balance on this site does not constitute a filing of rehabilitation claims under the civil rehabilitation procedure and note that the balance amounts shown on this site should also not be considered an acknowledgment by MtGox Co., Ltd. of the amount of any rehabilitation claims of users.    Rehabilitation claims under a civil rehabilitation procedure become confirmed from a filing which is followed by an investigation procedure. The method for filing claims will be published on this site as soon as we will be in situation to announce it.    Aaron G, who joined the recent doorstop protest at Mt. Gox's Shibuya office for its duration, said:  ""Hackers already liberated the MtGox database, and I was able to confirm my balance there. I'd be much more interested in having MtGox release the wallet addresses so the supposedly stolen coins can be traced.""  He added that he too suspected the 'compromised page' warning on Reddit was a hoax, but said if Mt. Gox's homepage joined its account databases and customer information by falling into hackers' hands, it would be good reason to petition the court to end the company's current bankruptcy protection.  Everything still unknown  Users are still in the dark as to whether the balances they see upon logging in actually exist or will ever be made available, in full or even in part. For a few it may be comforting to know that at least a record exists.  Since its site went blank just under a month ago, the only additions posted to Mt. Gox's home page have been public notices that no further information is available, and more recently legal notices regarding implications of bankruptcy proceedings in Japan and the US.  There was also a warning about customers being targeted by phishing emails asking for login credentials and bank account details.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/18/mt-gox-allowing-users-to-login-check-balances,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92e2992bd91750bb6e32718041be65eb14271d6f-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
