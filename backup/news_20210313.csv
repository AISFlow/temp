Musk tweeted an exclamatory ""Yes"" on Saturday after a Twitter user asked the billionaire investor whether Coinbase should allow the Shiba Inu-represented cryptocurrency on its platform.      A listing on Coinbase would open dogecoin to a whole new breed of investor and thus unleash its potential. That's because the U.S.-regulated exchange is considered synonymous with institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Tesla bought bitcoin worth $1.5 billion in February via Coinbase.      At press time, dogecoin was changing hands near $0.059, representing a 6.7% gain on a 24-hour basis. Prices surged over 600% in January alone and have risen by nearly 1,130% so far this year.

MoonCats, Ethereum-based collectible NFTs deployed on August 9th, 2017, have now all been rescued and are now finding their way onto marketplaces like OpenSea. Users could rescue cats (from the moon, naturally) at just the gas fee cost up until yesterday when all 25,600 had been rescued. MoonCatsRescue employs an off-chain algorithm that requires users’ CPU resources to find cats. This allowed the MoonCats to be more equally distributed. At the time of writing, there are 1,644 holders . The MoonCats contract allowed only 25,600 MoonCats to be added out of a possible 4 billion unique combinations. After this point, no more cats could be rescued. Users that have rescued MoonCats can name them, but only once; once a MoonCat has been named, it is permanent. Interestingly, there are not really any rare cats . This is different from other collectibles such as CryptoPunks and may mean we see less extremely valuable cats, but all cats may hold a similar, equally good value. Genesis MoonCat Sells for 100 ETH There are 256 Genesis MoonCats, which are particularly rare cats that could not be rescued like the others. These Genesis cars are currently selling for 100 ETH on OpenSea , and others are listed for over 420 ETH . The average price for each non-genesis cat is 0.6673 ETH , significantly higher than the roughly $40 gas cost required to rescue the carts. How can I get MoonCats? Unfortunately, there are no more MoonCats available to rescue, but MoonCats can be purchased from marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible.

""Institutional investment continues to build momentum with Chinese internet firm Meitu the latest to execute a bitcoin treasury strategy, "" according to Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner of Kenetic, a Hong Kong-based trading firm.  ""Further, Beeple's $69 milllion [non-fungible token] record demonstrates the true power of crypto, adding curiosity and fuel to the retail fire. Expect volatility but a landing of $100K levels by Q3,"" he said.  The move passed the previous record of around $58,330 set on Feb. 21.  After that, bitcoin had fell to as low as $43,000 amid uncertainty in the traditional markets over stimulus expectations and their affects on U.S. bond yields.  Both stocks and cryptocurrencies across the board saw losses and sideways trading for several weeks, before rising again in the last eight days.  The new high comes two days after U.S. President Joe Biden signed a massive $1.9 trillion stimulus program into law that sends checks for $1,400 to many U.S. citizens. According to various media accounts, people have started receiving the checks, which could be another factor in bitcoin's rise.  U.S. Treasury yields have climbed back to over 12-month highs in the wake of the fresh stimulus. This time, however, bitcoin is showing resilience, contrary to the last week of February when prices fell by 20% amid rising yields.  Bitcoin's quick rise caused the liquidation of over $100 million in short positions in a matter of minutes, according to a tweet from Glassnode co-founder and chief technology officer, Rafael Schultze-Kraft.  The move to $61,000 brought bitcoin's market cap to $1.14 trillion – not far below the $1.385 trillion value of Google's parent company, Alphabet, according to CompaniesMarketCap.com.    UPDATE (March 13, 11:47 UTC): Added latest price after move over $60,000. UPDATE (March 13, 20:28 UTC): Added latest price after move over $61,000.
