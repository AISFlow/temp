42397969,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvFS,1411916417,Finland Project Beams Bitcoin Over the Radio Waves,"A new project that transmits bitcoin payments over the radio is up and running in Finland – and it’s also transmitting a national Finnish cryptocurrency at the same time.  Kryptoradio  is a data transmission protocol designed to transmit low-bandwidth information over one-way digital broadcast networks.  Joel Lehtonen  , the project’s founder, said he is focused on using Kryptoradio to transmit block chain information. The project is currently halfway through a two-month pilot phase in conjunction with Finnish broadcaster Digita, which allows the system to transmit bitcoin transaction information across its digital radio network.  Bitcoins via radio  The project transmits the data over the DVB-T network, which is a digital audio and video broadcast network used by TV and radio broadcasters around the world.  Kryptoradio’s back-end computers connect to the block chain and turn the latest block’s transactions into a data stream. This is then broadcast over the network, where it can be picked up by a Linux computer connected to a DVB-T receiver at the other end.  But why do any of this? Tuomo Sipola, who works with Lehtonen at a technology co-operative called Koodilehto, explained that one-way bitcoin block chain broadcasts offer a mixture of robustness and reachability. It’s useful for anyone taking bitcoin payments, he suggested, as they don’t need a constant Internet connection.  Sipola said:  “Its a unidirectional technology, so the person who is selling something needs only to receive the payment information. Receiving a broadcast, you just listen to it. You don’t have to subscribe to some mobile plan.”  Paying for chocolate via radio  Where and how would this be useful? One possible use case could be vending machines, which sell everything from chocolate bars to laundry cycles.  If you own a vending machine and want it to accept bitcoin, but don’t want to pay for a mobile Internet connection and associated modem, all you would need with Kryptoradio is a low-cost integrated DBV-T receiver and a pared-down Linux hardware subsystem.  The user would still need to have a mobile connection to use their own digital wallet, but your vending machine would be able to take zero-confirmation transactions entirely offline.  When you, as the machine’s owner, want to spend those bitcoins later, you could sell them for fiat or conduct bitcoin transactions in the normal way from an Internet-connected device.  The other option would enable any bitcoin-accepting vendor to receive payments from anywhere in the world, even in remote regions where mobile data coverage wasn’t available.  Transmitting a national currency  Kryptoradio isn’t transmitting the whole bitcoin block chain over Digita’s network, but it is sending a variety of items. In addition to serialising transaction blocks, it’s also sending Bitstamp’s order book and pricing information from BitPay in a communication stream that amounts to just 7.5 Kbits/sec of bandwidth.  That’s not all, though. The project is also handling an entirely different cryptocurrency called FIMK, which is a spin-off from second-generation cryptocurrency NXT. Its founders describe it as “a basic income plan for national distribution of a portion of the currency to Finnish citizens.”  The organisation behind FIMK, Krypto FIN ry, is paying a basic income of 100 FIM per month to anyone in Finland over 15 years of age that registers with the platform.  “With FIMK, we are using a simplified format which is not for full nodes, but contains everything needed for receiving payments via FIMK too,” Lehtonen said.  Krypto FIN ry is sponsoring the Kryptoradio test phase for an undisclosed sum, but Sipola said this phase will finish at the end of October. After that, more funding will be needed – Lehtonen hopes to talk with investors that understand and support cryptocurrency concepts.  A backup for bitcoin?  Reach and convenience is one benefit of the system, Lehtonen said, but the other is robustness. It provides a second channel for transaction information, beyond fixed line or mobile Internet access, which serves as a useful backup for bitcoin node operators.  Lehtonen said:  “The signal is useful for bitcoin node operators, who can add fault tolerance by connecting to Kryptoradio in addition to Internet.""  Presumably, the DVB-T transaction data could also become a point of authority on the Internet, delivering a ‘clean’ set of blocks to bitcoin nodes. This could help to prevent Sybil attacks, in which malicious nodes try to convince a sufficient number of other nodes that their fraudulent transactions are real, effectively forking the block chain.  This isn’t the only attempt to create a robust alternative channel for the bitcoin network. Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik is also pursuing his BitSat project, which proposes to use CubeSats as a means of transmitting bitcoin block chain information to nodes around the planet.  Network first, hardware later  This is all very exciting, but it won’t be much use unless people are listening, and they’ll need the hardware for that – but the average retailer isn’t about to rig up a Linux box and a DVB-T receiver on their own.  Addressing this point, Lehtonen said:  “The system is open for everybody to develop these kind of devices. Our current plan is not to go into [the] hardware business, but we would like to co-operate with others. Currently we have been busy with the transmitter part so this is something we need to focus on at the end of the pilot stage.”  As for a business model, Sipola said that the pair have discussed some profit concepts, including premium services for clients or providing a basic payment confirmation service with a delay, but nothing has been decided yet. In the interim, they just want to get the service deployed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to play with.  This could be another step along the way to a more usable bitcoin standard if a convenient and user-friendly client-side receiver could be developed. If Lehtonen builds it, it will then be up to the developers to come.

42397963,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEvCV,1411909781,4 Court Cases Helping Shape the US Stance on Bitcoin,"While the bitcoin economy is currently backed by $284m in venture capital and has a growing band of high-profile supporters, it still operates in a regulatory grey area in its largest market.  Unsurprisingly, just how the US will and should choose to regulate the digital currency is the subject of a continuing debate throughout all sectors of the ecosystem.  But, while the media focuses largely on policymakers like those currently making waves in New York, the country's courts may yet prove to have a deciding influence on the legal future of bitcoin.  Earlier this month Trendon Shavers made headlines when he was fined $40m for defrauding investors in a bitcoin Ponzi scheme. The case, brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2013, created a broad first precedent for bitcoin when the judge ruled that bitcoin is a currency and a form of money.  Other cases could also have far reaching ramifications for the world of cryptocurrency. Below are the top court cases and rulings to date that are helping shape the US view on bitcoin.  SEC vs Trendon Shavers  Shavers, the operator of the Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST), came under fire in the case against the SEC for soliciting illicit investments in bitcoin-related opportunities from a number of lenders. In total, he fraudulently accumulated 700,000 BTC in funds, an amount worth about $64m at the time of the arrest.  The ruling defied the March 2013 FinCEN guidance declaration that bitcoin is not considered a currency under the Bank Secrecy Act as it is not legal tender.  In a court document, Texas magistrate judge Amos L Mazzant said:  “It is clear that bitcoin can be used as money. It can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual living expenses. […] it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the US dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.”  The case also provided insight into how bitcoin-denominated damages may be assessed in the future, with the judge using the average daily price of bitcoin at the time the scheme was uncovered.  US vs Faiella  In August, US District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled that bitcoin is money during a case which sought to assess whether Charlie Shrem, CEO of defunct bitcoin exchange BitInstant, allegedly acted with Robert Faiella to supply bitcoins to Silk Road users.  The two were charged  with two counts of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report.  Rakoff rejected Faiella’s reasoning that bitcoins are not money and that his money transmission charges should therefore be cleared, saying:  “Money in ordinary parlance means ‘something generally accepted as a medium of exchange, a measure of value, or a means of payment’. Bitcoin clearly qualifies as ‘money’.”  Both defendants plead guilty to the charges, ultimately agreeing to pay nearly $1m in fines.  State of Florida vs Espinoza  Last month, the Bitcoin Foundation filed an amicus brief in the case of Florida resident Pascal Reid, seeking to dismiss a money transmission charge.  In February, Reid and Michell Abner Espinoza were arrested in sting operations in which they engaged in fake transactions with undercover agents through online marketplace LocalBitcoins.com and converted $30,000 of cash into bitcoin.  They were charged under Florida’s anti-money laundering law, which prohibits exchanges and business transactions over $10,000, and the unlicensed money transmission law, which permits currency or payment instruments to a maximum of $20,000 in a 12-month period.  The foundation believes that since the money transmission law applies specifically to corporations and entities qualified to do business in the state, Reid should be cleared of the charges. Further, as Florida is as yet undecided on how to regulate bitcoin, the state should not apply an “ambiguous criminal statute”.  The amicus brief allows the Bitcoin Foundation to help ensure a case outcome that sets favorable precedent for the broader bitcoin community, and does not mean that the organisation supports Reid directly.  Both defendants have filed to have the money laundering charges dismissed, invoking the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance that bitcoin is not money.  US vs Ross William Ulbricht  The Ross Ulbricht camp made a similar appeal in late March, citing flaws in the legal definition of money laundering.  Ulbricht is accused of heading the now-defunct online black market Silk Road. In February he was indicted on charges of computer hacking, drug trafficking, money laundering and engaging in a criminal enterprise.  Judge Katherine Forrest rejected the argument that bitcoin is not money, saying:  “Bitcoins carry value – that is their purpose and function – and act as a medium of exchange. Bitcoins may be exchanged for legal tender, be it US dollars, euros, or some other currency. Accordingly, [the defense’s] argument fails.”  Challenging the grounds that bitcoin doesn’t fall under the definition of legal money, she later wrote:  “There is no doubt that if a narcotics transaction was paid for in cash, which was later exchanged for gold, then converted back to cash, that would constitute a money laundering transaction. One can launder money using bitcoin.”  Ulbricht faces a series of new charges filed against him on 21st August, including narcotics trafficking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identification documents and distribution of narcotics by means of the Internet.  Ulbricht has pleaded not guilty on all charges. His trial is set for 3rd November.
