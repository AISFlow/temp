It&apos;s been tough out there, and let us not forget that September is a seasonally weak period in equity markets. Risk-off behavior has been the name of the game for most of 2022, and that&apos;s certainly true right now. There are few groups that exemplify risk-on behavior more so than Bitcoin miners, as they are tremendously volatile, and make huge moves in both directions. One such miner is Riot Blockchain (RIOT), a stock that I think is in no-man&apos;s land right now. Below, we&apos;ll discuss some of the factors to consider if you&apos;re looking to trade Riot.I last covered Riot back in May following Q1 earnings with a &apos;buy&apos; rating. At the time, we hadn&apos;t yet seen the full fury of this bear market, and while Riot has put in much higher prices since that piece, it&apos;s put in some lower ones, too. The idea at the time was that Bitcoin was trading at support, and the valuation of Riot was cheap. Bitcoin has subsequently made lower lows on panic selling during the summer, and Riot&apos;s valuation has moved around a bunch.

42416225,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4Pubz2V,1663367562,Craig Wright Could Have ‘Bamboozled’ Andresen During Private ‘Satoshi’ Signing Session: Trial Witnesses Explain,"OSLO, Norway — Expert witnesses in the ongoing trial between crypto Twitter personality Hodlonaut and Craig Wright – the Australian computer scientist who has long claimed (and failed to prove) he is the inventor of Bitcoin – told the court on Thursday that Wright could have used any number of tricks to fool Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen into believing he was Satoshi during a private “signing session” in 2016.  Andresen has since all but denounced Wright, saying he had “bamboozled” him with “funky proof” on that day in 2016. Andresen’s faith in Wright’s identity as Satoshi has been a cornerstone of Wright’s defense in his trial against Hodlonaut (real name Magnus Granath), one of two simultaneous legal battles between the two men over a series of tweets in March 2019 in which Hodlonaut deemed Wright a pretender, and called him a “scammer” and a “fraud.”  Hodlonaut sued Wright in Norway to get a judge to rule that his tweets were protected by freedom of speech – and prevent a libel case filed by Wright in the U.K. seeking financial damages in connection to the tweets from moving forward.  During his testimony on Wednesday, Wright told Norwegian District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen that he would not be providing any cryptographic proof of his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto, claiming that he not only didn’t want to, but that doing so would be “incredibly difficult” after he destroyed the hard drive containing his private keys to Satoshi’s wallets after his signing session with Andresen.  Read more: Craig Wright Tells Court He ‘Stomped on the Hard Drive’ Containing Satoshi Wallet Keys  Instead, his defense has taken a new angle: Proof, Wright says, isn’t demonstrating ownership of Satoshi’s wallet (a move that would silence most of Wright’s doubters) – “proof is people.”  Bamboozling 101  Wright previously told the court that his ability to convince Andresen that he was Satoshi by allegedly using the private keys in front of him in 2016 was enough to prove his identity to others.  Attorneys for Hodlonaut brought in three expert witnesses who testified that cryptographic proof – not personal testimony – could alone prove Wright’s claims. They also explained how that could be done.  Johan Toras Halseth, the tech director of Norwegian crypto exchange Firi, told the court that it would have been possible for Wright to organize the private signing session with Andresen in a way that made it possible for him to deceive the Bitcoin developer.  Halseth said he first heard about Wright when the Wired magazine article “outing” him as Satoshi came out.  “The alarm went off in me, personally,” Halseth said. “It appeared to be an unnatural way to come out. … I became very, very skeptical.”  He said the private signing session, which he described as “a farce,” made him even more suspicious of Wright’s claims: “A technical person would have never proved something that way. A private session doesn’t make sense [when] it is easily done publicly.”  Halseth explained that if Wright controlled the Wi-Fi used during the signing session – either by gaining control of the hotel Wi-Fi or surreptitiously connecting the new laptop used for the session to an alternative Wi-Fi controlled by Wright – he could have swapped the real Electrum wallet file for a modified version.  Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoin  A modified version of the wallet, Halseth said, could be manipulated to make it able to verify bogus signatures.  “The wallet is built from a source code … [T]he person who built the wallet is basically the one who is in control and can do whatever they want with the wallet,” he explained. “It’s really easy to modify the wallet in that sense.”  Halseth also went line by line through Wright’s controversial “Jean-Paul Sartre blog post,” in which Wright attempted to publicly “prove” he was Satoshi (proof which has been widely discredited) and explained its technological failings to the judge.  “It doesn’t make sense, technically speaking,” Halseth said. “Had it been technically sound, he would have attached the actual message that was verified. That’s not done here.”  “It’s very clear that he was trying to do something that is very technically simple in a very complicated way, to maybe mislead,” Halseth told the judge.  A climate of doubt around Wright’s claims  The other witnesses for Hodlonaut, Arcane Crypto CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen and Svein Ølnes, a professor and researcher at the Western Norwegian Research Institute, testified about a climate of doubt surrounding Wright’s claims to be Satoshi.  Jenssen recounted for the court his impressions of Wright after his “outing” as Satoshi by Wired in late 2015.  He said he didn’t have any conclusive thoughts – and, at first, thought Wright’s claims were plausible – but when a lot of the evidence was revealed to be changed or otherwise manipulated, Jenssen said he became suspicious.  “It was fishy,” he told the judge.  In his own testimony, Ølnes expressed similar sentiments.  “My first thought was this is so far from the Satoshi that I had imagined,” he said.  “The general perception is that this person is not Satoshi. I share that perception. The more I’ve read and seen, the more clear it becomes to me that it’s impossible that he is Satoshi … [A]ll the developments we’ve had in this case, it cannot be the case that he is Satoshi.”  In addition to what he saw as phony evidence, both in the private signings and the later “Sartre” post, Jenssen felt like Wright’s “breach of character” – using his “authority to change Bitcoin,” trying to get the copyright for the Bitcoin white paper and his string of lawsuits – made him unlikely to be Satoshi.  “The use of financial strength to sue and threaten others that have different opinions – that’s not in line with a free system,” Jenssen said.  KPMG lays out a pattern of fraud and deceit  Two Norwegian experts from the multinational auditing firm KPMG testified on Friday about a highly technical report commissioned by Hodlonaut’s attorneys showing inconsistencies and manipulation in the evidence submitted by Wright.  The KPMG representatives explained to the judge that there were numerous inconsistencies in the metadata for the evidence Wright submitted that could not be explained, as Wright had previously suggested, by opening documents in different versions of the same software or other normal scenarios.  The experts spent a significant amount of time reviewing discrepancies in fonts in Wright’s documents – including the use of fonts that were not released until after the alleged metadata date of several of the documents – to indicate that Wright has a pattern of backdating and otherwise manipulating evidence.  It is not the first time that Wright’s alleged document manipulation has come up in court.  Read more: Craig Wright vs. Peter McCormack: Wright Put Forward ‘False Evidence,’ Will Receive Damages of One British Pound  The experts also went over several emails submitted by Wright in the Kleiman case including emails that purported to be from 2008 but were actually created years later, in 2014, after Wright was allegedly preparing to style himself as Satoshi.  The proof is in the … people?  Wright’s side, on the other hand, put forward no new technical evidence today. Instead, his defense leaned heavily on witness testimony from his friends, family and former colleagues who described their relationships with him around the time he was supposedly writing the Bitcoin white paper.  Read more: Craig Wright Won’t Give Cryptographic Proof He’s Satoshi, His Lawyers Say at Hodlonaut Trial  Stefan Matthews, a long-time collaborator of Wright’s and the current chairman of the board of one of Wright’s companies, detailed his nearly 20-year-long relationship with Wright.  Matthews described Wright, who he met when the latter was working as an auditor for Matthews’ company, as a tech wizard with poor social skills.  “Incredibly proficient, knowledgeable, capable … he was held as a clear expert, no doubt about that,” Matthews said. Wright’s interpersonal skills were “a little different.”  Matthews testified on Thursday that Wright had begun talking to him in 2007 about “a whole raft of ideas” he was working on related to digital cash, and gave him an early iteration of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008.  Aside from Matthews, none of Wright’s other witnesses ever claimed to see an early draft of the Bitcoin white paper, instead basing their belief in his claims to be Satoshi on their knowledge of Wright’s skills and interests.  “From my experience in seeing Craig work within the IT systems … it was certainly a high probability that he would be able to do what he was claiming to do with Bitcoin and blockchain technology,” Neville Sinclair, a chartered accountant who first met Wright around 2006 when they were both colleagues at BDO, told the court.  But Sinclair added that he’d only heard Wright refer directly to the cryptocurrency after Nakamoto’s invention had hit the mainstream. “I think around 2011. … [T]hat was about the first time that I had heard him talk to me about Bitcoin,” Sinclair said.  Wright’s cousin, Maxwell Lynam, was equally effusive about his claims to have launched the Web3 revolution.  “We’d always known that Craig was the chief engineer and person who did Bitcoin and blockchain technology,” Lynam told the court, adding that he personally had never read the published white paper. “I don’t know why everyone’s upset about him calling himself Satoshi. He could be Bob.”  Lynam also said that Wright had also secretly set up a home computer to continuously mine bitcoin, and only revealed this fact after the aging hardware had been sent to a landfill site by his unwitting family. Wright estimated that the computer would have mined about 6,500 BTC by this time, Lynam said – cryptocurrency that at today’s prices would be worth around $130 million.  More witnesses will testify on Wright’s behalf next week.  Catch up on the trial so far:  Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi?

42411733,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXRA,1663362590,Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?,"Staking offers crypto holders a way of putting their digital assets to work and earning passive income without needing to sell them.  You can think of staking as the crypto equivalent of putting money in a high-yield savings account. When you deposit funds in a savings account, the bank takes that money and typically lends it out to others. In return for locking up that money with the bank, you receive a portion of the interest earned from lending – albeit a very very low portion.  Similarly, when you stake your digital assets, you lock up the coins in order to participate in running the blockchain and maintaining its security. In exchange for that, you earn rewards calculated in percentage yields. These returns are typically much higher than any interest rate offered by banks.  Staking has become a popular way to make a profit in crypto without trading coins.  How does staking work?  Staking is only possible via the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is a specific method used by certain blockchains to select honest participants and verify new blocks of data being added to the network.  By forcing these network participants – known as validators or “stakers” – to purchase and lock away a certain amount of tokens, it makes it unattractive to act dishonestly in the network. If the blockchain was corrupted in any way through malicious activity, the native token associated with it would likely plummet in price, and the perpetrator(s) would stand to lose money.  The stake, then, is the validator’s “skin in the game” to ensure they act honestly and for the good of the network. In exchange for their commitment, validators receive rewards denominated in the native cryptocurrency. The bigger their stake, the higher chance they have to propose a new block and collect the rewards. After all, the more skin in the game, the more likely you are to be an honest participant.  The stake does not have to consist exclusively of one person’s coins. Most of the time, validators run a staking pool and raise funds from a group of token holders through delegation (acting on behalf of others) – lowering the barrier to entry for more users to participate in staking. Any holder can participate in the staking process by delegating their coins to stake pool operators who do all the heavy lifting involved with validating transactions on the blockchain.  Read more: Top Cryptocurrencies You Can Stake: An In-Depth Guide  To keep validators in check, they can be penalized if they commit minor breaches such as going offline for extended periods of time and can even be suspended from the consensus process and have their funds removed. The latter is known as “slashing” and, while rare, has happened across a number of blockchains, including Polkadot and Ethereum.  Every blockchain has its own set of rules for validators. Ethereum’s blockchain, for example, requires each validator to stake at least 32 ether, which is worth around $45,000 as of Sept. 16, 2022.  What cryptocurrencies you can stake  As mentioned already, staking is only possible with cryptocurrencies linked to blockchains that use the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  The most notable cryptocurrencies you can stake include:  Ethereum (ETH).  Cardano (ADA).  Solana (SOL).  Avalanche (AVAX).  Polkadot (DOT).  Read more: How Does Ethereum Staking Work?  How can you start staking  To begin staking you first have to own digital assets that can be staked. If you’ve already bought some, you’ll need to transfer the coins from the exchange or app you bought them on to an account that allows staking.  Most of the bigger crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, offer staking opportunities in-house on their platform, which is a convenient way to put your coins to work.  If you are looking for a way to maximize rewards, there are platforms that specialize in finding the highest interest rates for your digital assets. Examples of these staking-as-a-service platforms include:  EverStake.  BlockDaemon.  Figment.  MyContainer.  It’s worth noting that any coins you delegate to a staking pool are still in your possession. You can always withdraw your staked assets, but there’s usually a waiting time (days or weeks) specific to each blockchain to do so.  It is also possible to become a validator and run your own staking pool. However, this needs much more attention, expertise and investment to do successfully. Not to mention, to become a validator on certain blockchains you’ll need to source sufficient funds from delegate stakers before you can even start.  Risks of staking crypto  As with every type of investing, especially in crypto, there are risks you need to consider.  Cryptocurrencies are volatile. Drops in price can easily outweigh the rewards you earn. Staking is optimal for those who plan to hold their asset for the long term regardless of the price swings.  Some coins require a minimum lock-up period while you cannot withdraw your assets from staking.  If you decide to withdraw your assets from a staking pool, there is a specific waiting period for each blockchain before getting your coins back.  There is a counterparty risk of the staking pool operator. If the validator doesn’t do its job properly and gets penalized, you might miss out on rewards  Staking pools can be hacked, resulting in a total loss of staked funds. And since the assets are not protected by insurance, it means there’s little to no hope of compensation.  How profitable is staking  Staking is a good option for investors interested in generating yields on their long-term investments and aren’t bothered about short-term fluctuations in price.  According to data, the average staking reward rate of the top 261 staked assets surpasses 11% annual yield. It’s important to note, though, that rewards can change over time.  Fees also affect rewards. Staking pools deduct fees from the rewards for their work, which affects overall percentage yields. This varies greatly from pool to pool, and blockchain to blockchain.  You can maximize rewards by choosing a staking pool with low commission fees and a promising track record of validating lots of blocks. The latter also minimizes the risk of the pool getting penalized or suspended from the validation process.

42411730,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXAd,1663361852,Ethereum Merge Explained: What Investors Should Know About the Shift to Proof-of-Stake,"Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, completed its transition to a new system for processing transactions on Sept. 15, 2022. The network’s shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been years in the making; however, shifting timelines, nixed plans and mixed messages from Ethereum’s core developers have raised fundamental questions about what it all means.  Will Ethereum fees decrease? Will the price of ether (ETH), the network’s native currency, increase? Why should I even care?  For these and other questions, CoinDesk has you covered:  What is the Merge?  The Merge represents the Ethereum network’s shift to proof-of-stake (PoS), its new system (also called a “consensus mechanism”) for authenticating crypto transactions. The new system replaces proof-of-work (PoW), the more power-hungry mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin.  Why is it called a Merge?  Ethereum already has a PoS network called the Beacon Chain (introduced in 2020), but it is not yet used for processing transactions. For now, it’s essentially just a staging area for computers operating the Ethereum network to prepare for the PoS upgrade.  Ethereum’s full transition to PoS requires merging the Beacon Chain (called the “Consensus” layer) with Ethereum’s PoW mainnet (the “Execution” layer).  How does proof-of-stake (PoS) differ from proof-of-work (PoW)?  Proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) differ in how they decide who has the right to record the next “block” of transactions on the network.  In today’s PoW system, Ethereum miners compete to publish blocks by racing to solve cryptographic puzzles, much like in Bitcoin.  In the upcoming PoS system, validators that stake (lock up) at least 32 ether (~$50,000) with the network are randomly selected to create blocks. The more ether one stakes, the more likely one is to be selected.  In both systems, the miner/validator that wins a block is rewarded with a mix of transaction fees and newly minted ether (ETH). PoS validators also receive rewards for doing other activities to help secure the network.  Read more: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  When did the Merge happen?  On Sept. 15, 2022 at at 6:43 a.m. UTC. Read more about it here.  The Merge didn't have a hard date and time it would finally occur. Here's why: each block on Ethereum’s PoW network carries a difficulty number representing how hard miners must work to add it to the network. Instead of kicking in at a specific date, the Merge was scheduled to take effect once the cumulative difficulty of all mined Ethereum blocks hits a certain number – the “total terminal difficulty” (TTD).  In August, Ethereum’s core developers set the TTD at 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000, which was reached Sept. 15.  Is proof-of-stake better than proof-of-work?  There are trade-offs.  According to the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit that funds Ethereum ecosystem development, PoS will cut Ethereum’s energy usage by around 99.95%. PoS advocates also argue that PoW mining centralizes control in the hands of those who can afford to buy fancy crypto mining rigs. They say PoS – which hands network control to those who “stake” crypto with the network – makes attacks economically infeasible and self-defeating.  PoW proponents counter that PoS staking carries its own centralization and security risks, making it possible for malicious actors to directly “buy” control of the network. They also point out that PoS is a less battle-tested system than PoW, which has proven resilient as the backbone of the two largest blockchain networks.  Will Ethereum fees decrease after the Merge?  No.  Ethereum transaction fees are not expected to change as a result of the Merge. Future network updates, like danksharding and proto-danksharding, may help to address Ethereum's high network fees, but these updates are not expected until 2023 at the earliest.  The main salve for Ethereum’s transaction fee woes remains rollups – third-party networks like Arbitrum and Optimism that bundle up transactions and process them separately from Ethereum’s mainnet.  Read more: Scaling Ethereum Beyond the Merge: Danksharding  Will Ethereum transaction speeds increase after the Merge?  Barely.  On average, Ethereum blocks are issued once every 13 or 14 seconds in today’s PoW system. After the Merge, PoS blocks will be issued in regular 12-second intervals. This is not an improvement that most users will notice, and it still places Ethereum behind rival blockchain networks like Solana and Avalanche (though well ahead of Bitcoin, where a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average).  Just like with transaction fees, those looking for improved transaction speeds will need to look to Ethereum’s third-party rollups.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  Will the Merge increase the price of ether (ETH)?  It’s hard to say.  With so many variables and unknowns, it is impossible to predict what will happen to Ethereum’s token price as a result of the Merge.  The Ethereum community has for years positioned the Merge as a massive upgrade to the network’s core technology. Along with addressing concerns about the network’s environmental impact, PoS will introduce a new form of utility for Ethereum’s native ether (ETH) token in the form of staking. It will also decrease the rate at which ETH is issued, which could be a boon for its price.  But not everyone is sure that the Merge will boost the price of ETH. The upgrade may already be priced-in by the market. There is also a risk (however small) that the Merge will run into hiccups, or that PoS will prove less secure than PoW in the long run.  Read more: Is Ethereum's Merge Priced-In?  Can I become an Ethereum validator or staker?  Yes, if you have some ETH.  Yes, you can “stake” 32 ether and earn rewards. We've got a detailed explainer on staking ETH here.  Staking requires some know-how; if you screw up or go offline, your stake can be “slashed” (ie, reduced).  Those with less blockchain expertise can stake via centralized services like those offered by Coinbase (COIN) or Kraken. In addition to handling the technical nitty-gritty, these services – in exchange for a cut of users’ rewards – open up staking to those with less than 32 ETH.  Also popular for those with less than 32 ETH are liquid staking pools like Lido and Rocket Pool. When users stake via these services, they are handed “staked ETH” tokens which trade at a slight discount to regular ETH.  Read more: Top Questions on Ethereum Proof-of-Stake and Ether Staking  What is happening to staked ether after the Merge?  Staked ether will stay locked up with the network until around six to 12 months after the Merge.  At that point, those who have staked ether themselves will be able to withdraw their stake, along with whatever rewards it has accrued.  Those who stake via centralized staking services or pools will need to keep an eye out for announcements on how withdrawals will be handled.  Do Ethereum users or ETH holders need to take any action now that the Merge has happened?  No.  If you hold ether (ETH) today, you won’t need to claim new “PoS ETH” or “ETH2” tokens. Your balance will remain exactly the same after the Merge, and you’ll be able to resume using the network as if nothing has changed.  While Ethereum users will not need to take any action come the Merge, Ethereum software providers and node operators (the computers that operate the Ethereum network) will need to update their software to ensure they are communicating with the latest version of the network.  What’s all this noise about PoW “forks”? Will I receive free coins if I hold ETH?  Some Ethereum miners, reluctant to let go of the network’s old consensus mechanism, announced plans to “fork,” or form a splinter network from Etheruem’s PoW chain. From what we can tell so far, these miners intend to just clone the main blockchain – balances and all – and continue operating their own PoW versions of Ethereum post-Merge. As of Sept. 16, it's not going great.  If you hold ETH before the Merge, you may automatically receive a balance of tokens on these new PoW forks. The process of claiming these tokens will differ depending on the chain. If you hold ETH on a centralized exchange like Coinbase, the exchange will need to list forked tokens in order for you to claim your share (and it’s not at all clear if they will).  But buyers beware. Some forked ether tokens might have value immediately following the Merge, but leaders in the Ethereum community warn that PoW Ethereum forks will just be thinly-veiled cash grabs.  Read more: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Forks: Gift or Grift?  Did the Ethereum network “pause” for the Merge?  No.  The Merge happened instantaneously after the final PoW block is mined. From that point forward, the network continued to operate with the issuance of the first PoS block.  Ethereum users do not need to take any action to upgrade to the PoS chain.  What’s on the Ethereum roadmap after the Merge?  After the Merge, Ethereum’s core developers will continue working on the open-source network as they did before, with improvements to network fees, speeds and security slated for the months and years ahead.  One focus for developers post-Merge will be sharding, which aims to expand Ethereum’s transaction throughput and decrease its fees by spreading network activity across several “shards” – almost like lanes on a highway. (Updates of this sort were initially slated to accompany the Merge – originally called “Ethereum 2.0,” or “ETH2” – but were deprioritized with the success of third-party rollups at addressing some of the same problems).  Also on the roadmap is enshrined proposer builder separation (PBS), which will separate the “builders” that add transactions to blocks from the “proposers” who put them forward for approval from the wider network. PBS is pitched as a way to help tackle Ethereum’s maximal extractable value (MEV) problem.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  What happens to proof-of-work miners post-Merge?  After the Merge, Ethereum miners – many of whom have invested in fancy mining-optimized computers – will be unable to mine new blocks on the network. Many miners will abandon mining and “stake” ether to earn rewards on the PoS network.  For those who wish to put their mining hardware to continued use, they’ll need to move to another proof-of-work network, like Ethereum Classic.  Some miners also plan to create a “forked” version of the proof-of-work blockchain – basically, a clone of the blockchain that still runs using the old miner-friendly system. It is unclear whether these chains will gain enough traction to become lucrative for miners in the long term.

42416227,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubzMd,1663359258,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Ether Close the Week Lower,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether both declined in price Friday, while the correlation between the two assets moderated slightly.  Bitcoin (BTC) recently declined 0.42% on moderate daily volume. Overnight prices traded in a tight range between $19,500 and $19,800. Prices declined 0.85% as U.S. markets opened around 9:30 a.m. ET before reversing course during the next hour.  Ether (ETH) fell 3% on Friday, marking the fifth decline within the last six trading days. Trading volume for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap after bitcoin aligned with its average daily volume over the most recent 20 days.  The 30-day correlation coefficient between BTC and ETH declined to 0.77, its lowest level since June 12. The correlation coefficient measures the relationship of price movement between two assets, and ranges between 1 and -1.  A correlation of 1 implies a direct relationship between assets, while a correlation of -1 signals an inverse relationship. A declining correlation, as is the case here, represents a diminishing relationship.  For some traders, a weakening relationship can signal a fundamental change between two assets, causing the traders to reevaluate their investment strategy. For others, it may represent a short-term dislocation in price that can be exploited upon expectations that the correlation will again strengthen.  Economic Calendar: Economic data was relatively light Friday.  The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment index, which measures consumers’ view of economic growth, rose to a five-month high of 59.5 in September. Consumers’ one-year expectations for inflation declined to 4.6% from 4.8%, 45% below the current inflation rate of 8.3%.  Whether in line with reality or not, inflation expectations are important in that if consumers expect prices to rise, they’re more likely to purchase items immediately rather than wait. The effect of this often results in higher prices as increased demand chases supply.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities declined, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 down 0.5%, 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively.  Commodities: Crude oil traded 0.24% lower, while natural gas fell 6.1%. Copper futures increased 1.3%, while gold’s price increased 0.4%.  The Dollar Index (DXY) was flat, rising 0.08%  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index to measure the performance across a basket of currencies, declined 0.97%.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,621 −0.9%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,434 −4.4%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $974 −1.4%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,873.24 −0.7%        ● Gold: $1,684 per troy ounce +1.1%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.45% −0.01        Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  Ether outpaces bitcoin to the downside as the relationship between the two assets weakens.  ETH fell 3% on Friday, with the price declining 15% over the last seven days. BTC, by comparison, declined 0.80%, with a seven- day performance of -3%. BTC and ETH are down 59% and 60% in value for the year to date, respectively.  The recent divergence in performance is illustrated in the decline in the two assets’ correlation coefficient to 0.77. ETH has been outperforming BTC for months, and the ETH/BTC trading pair rose 53% between July and September.  Since a peak on Sept 8, the ETH/BTC pair has declined 14%. Much of this may be a byproduct of the “sell-the-fact” impact of the Ethereum Merge, the upgrading of the blockchain, which took place early Thursday. With 180- and 365-day correlations of 0.96 and 0.97 respectively, investors could be expecting the relationship between BTC and ETH to strengthen again.  There are fundamental arguments as to why the correlation between the two assets should diminish. Ethereum’s conversion to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism puts in place a distinctly different method of securing the network than exists with Bitcoin.  The ability for ETH holders to stake their assets allows ETH to be used both as a store of value as well as a means to generate cash flow. A potential result is that staking yields may have an increased impact on the demand for ETH in both spot and futures markets. That distinction alone may change the way traders view the assets, though the extent to which they do remains to be seen.  Investors are also likely to pay greater attention to ETH’s supply growth. As stated in Thursday’s Market Wrap, the post-Merge supply of ETH declined by approximately 254 ETH as of 18:20 UTC. Today’s supply of ETH shows a post-Merge increase of approximately 395 ETH. For proper context however, estimates are that ETH’s supply would have increased by more than 20,000 as of today, had the Merge not occurred.  On a technical basis, ETH is approaching “oversold” levels when using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. RSI measures price momentum, which signals if an asset is potentially overbought (readings above 70), or oversold (readings below 30). With an RSI of 34, ETH is approaching levels where traders may wish to gain exposure.

42416217,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubyYJ,1663357068,"Two Sigma Ventures Raises $400M for Two Funds, Plans Crypto Investments","Two Sigma Ventures announced plans on Wednesday to invest $400 million across two new venture capital funds, confirming to CoinDesk that crypto investments will be included.  The early-stage focused Two Sigma Ventures IV fund and growth-stage Opportunity Fund will invest across a number of industries, including enterprise software, financial technology and consumer technology. The company doesn’t have a dedicated crypto fund, but about 15% of its capital will go toward crypto and Web3 projects, Two Sigma partner Dan Abelon told CoinDesk during an interview.  Venture capital investments in the first half of 2022 fell 26% year over year as the Ukraine conflict, the collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin and the liquidity challenges of crypto lender Celsius Network gave way to a bear market. The number of deals remained stable, suggesting that investors continued to pour into the space but were backing smaller deals.  Two Sigma Ventures is the venture capital arm of New York-based quant hedge fund Two Sigma, which has about $60 billion in assets under management. The combination drives a focus on startups utilizing data science and software, making crypto a natural investment fit.  “Decentralized finance as a whole is a category that we emphasize and focus on for a number of reasons,"" explained partner Andy Kangpan. ""One of them is our affiliation with the broader Two Sigma organization ... There’s very significant, deep financial market expertise that we can tap into to help us think through how crypto can change how financial services operate.”  Other crypto verticals of interest include developer tooling and infrastructure projects, said Kangpan.  Approximately 85% of the capital for the new funds came from external investors, primarily institutional players such as college endowments, non-profit foundations and pension funds. The remainder came from Two Sigma partners and senior employees.  Two Sigma funds typically cut checks of about $8 million to $12 million for a Series A round, but there’s flexibility in the size, said Abelon, particularly for crypto investments.  “We have to be sensitive that this is a challenging time to be a founder. It’s tough to raise money in certain fields,” said Abelon. “From a long-term perspective, it’s a great time to be a founder and a great time to be an investor. It feels like we continue to be on the cusp of the digitization of society and solving lots of big problems with software and data.”  Read more: Crypto-Focused Venture Firm Bloccelerate Is Raising $100M for Second Fund  CORRECTION (Sept. 16, 2022 19:48 UTC) – Fixes the dollar amount of the investment in the first paragraph.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/16/two-sigma-ventures-raises-400m-for-two-funds-plans-crypto-investments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a47142760ca5d09690529cc2396515fc6ef92de6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416223,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PubzCZ,1663356966,"Binance Bungles Accounting for Helium Tokens, Overpays Clients Millions: Sources","An accounting bug at Binance has led to a windfall in Helium Network’s native HNT token for some users and shouldered the world’s largest crypto exchange with a multimillion-dollar shortfall, according to people familiar with the matter.  Binance is down some 4.8 million HNT tokens that were erroneously disbursed to users, many of whom quickly sold the tokens for profit, the people said. At Friday’s prices those assets were worth about $19 million.  The erroneous payouts appear to stem from how Binance tracks token deposits from Helium network, a popular decentralized internet connectivity project, the people said.  There are two tokens on Helium: the native HNT token that Helium pays out to hotspot hosts and the MOBILE token, paid to operators of Helium 5G infrastructure, which launched last month and lacks a liquid market, and therefore any quotable price.  Though closely linked, the two tokens are, like ERC-20 and ether (ETH) tokens on Ethereum, separate assets. Binance mistakenly counted them as one: HNT. Depositors who sent MOBILE to Binance addresses got the equivalent amount of the more valuable HNT.  The bug has since been patched but not before some 4.8 million HNT tokens were sent in place of MOBILE. The timing of the payouts coincides with a massive sell-off of HNT tokens that drove the price down from the $7 range to current levels, around $4.  “The Helium Foundation was informed by Binance late in the evening [ET] on Sept. 15 that an accounting error involving HNT had occurred,” a spokesman for the organization stewarding the project said. “We can confirm that this is not a chain issue, and that this issue is isolated to Binance. To our knowledge, no other exchanges or third-parties have been affected. We advise token holders to suspend HNT and MOBILE deposits on Binance until a comprehensive situation update is provided.”  Binance had no immediate comment.",NEGATIVE,ETH | HNT,ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | HNT,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/16/binance-bungles-accounting-for-helium-tokens-overpays-clients-millions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/688bd08c790f7d8ead22140ee2fe41d690516748-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411722,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfX0i,1663356759,"What's the Point of Stablecoins? The Reasons, Risks and Types to Know","Regulatory moves concerning Paxos, the issuer of Binance's dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD, have brought renewed focus on stablecoins, the asset class within cryptocurrency that is meant to provide a haven from the highly volatile nature of most other cryptocurrencies. The investigation on Paxos has also reportedly caused payment giant PayPal to pause development on its own stablecoin. Which has led many to wonder what they need to know about stablecoins to understand the news.  You might already know that stablecoins are basically dollars in digital form. Except ... that’s not exactly true because stablecoins can also be algorithmically tied to any type of fiat (government) currency – including the euro, Australian dollars and others – as well as other forms of physical assets, like gold.  No matter the type, stablecoins exist to make cryptocurrency more predictable. While predictable cryptocurrency may sound like an oxymoron, stablecoins – like their name suggests – were designed to counter crypto’s hallmark volatility and provide a convenient way for crypto traders to preserve their fiat value without having to cash out of the market and to allow users to pay for everyday goods and services in crypto without all the budgeting drama.  See Also: Can Banks Issue Stablecoins?  Let’s take a look at how stablecoins work.  How do stablecoins work?  Stablecoins generally work the same across the board: They are cryptocurrencies minted on a blockchain that users can buy, sell and trade on an exchange just like any other crypto coin. People can store stablecoins in their hot wallets and/or cold storage devices like they would bitcoin or any altcoin.  In order to have integrity, most stablecoins are linked to a reserve of external assets of some kind, whether it be a stash of fiat currency, commodities like gold or debt instruments like commercial paper. In most cases, the company or entity that develops the stablecoin owns reserves equal to the amount of stablecoins it has in circulation. This is such that any stablecoin holder should be able to redeem one stablecoin token for one dollar at any time.  The four types of stablecoins  There are four different types of stablecoins, each with its own way of fixing the value of the tokens to a stable figure.  Fiat-backed  Cryptocurrency-backed  Commodity-backed  Algorithmic  Fiat-backed stablecoins  The most popular stablecoins in the market are ones backed by fiat currency. USD coin (USDC), for instance, is fiat-backed and pegged to the U.S. dollar (USD) at a 1:1 ratio. Other stablecoins are linked to the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Chinese RMB.  Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins  Without getting too meta, crypto-backed stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of another more established cryptocurrency. For instance, MakerDAO is one of the most popular crypto-backed stablecoins. It uses a smart contract – a type of self-executing, code-based contract – alongside the Ethereum blockchain to pool enough ether (ETH) to use as collateral for its stablecoin. Then, once the amount of collateral reaches a certain level in the smart contract, users can mint DAI – the MakerDAO stablecoin.  Commodity-backed stablecoins  As the name describes, commodity-backed stablecoins are pegged to the value of commodities like precious metals, industrial metals, oil or real estate. Commodity investors love the option of commodity-backed stablecoins because it allows them to invest in gold without the hassle of sourcing and storing it. Tether gold (XAUT) is an example of a commodity-backed stablecoin. The currency is backed by a reserve of gold kept inside a vault in Switzerland. One ounce of gold is equal to one XAUT.  Algorithmic stablecoins  Not backed by any “real-world” commodities, this category of stablecoins uses algorithms to modulate the supply based on its market demand. In short, these algorithms automatically burn (permanently remove coins from circulation) or mint new coins based on the fluctuating demand for the stablecoin at any given time.  You can think of an algorithmic stablecoin as a bucket of water left outside with a water level marked on the inside. To keep the water inside the bucket at exactly the same level, you set up a mechanism that adds or removes water depending on how far the water level has deviated from the mark. This is controlled by a computer algorithm such that if it rains and the bucket begins to fill up, the algorithm instructs the mechanism to release water out of the bottom of the bucket until it reaches the water level mark. Conversely, if it’s a hot day and water evaporates out of the bucket, the computer algorithm would instruct the mechanism to add more water to the bucket until the correct level is regained.  There’s been a lot of trial and error in the quest to successfully introduce algorithmic stablecoins to the crypto ecosystem, and the failure of Terra's UST stablecoin shows just how badly things can go if the algorithm isn't able to keep up with dramatic swings.  Read More: Algorithmic Stablecoins: What They Are and How They Can Go Terribly Wrong  Why use stablecoins?  Designed for our increasingly global economy, stablecoins theoretically solve a few key problems that inhibit the exchange of money.  Stablecoin users don’t need multiple international bank accounts to send crypto to their friends in other countries; they just need one crypto wallet.  Stablecoins make true peer-to-peer digital transfers possible without the need for third-party intermediaries to facilitate transactions.  In theory, stablecoins cut down on the fees, transfer time and potential privacy infringement we’ve grown accustomed to under the paradigm of central banking.  Say you were a Chinese business owner who wanted to pay an invoice to a client in Japan who also had subcontractors in Europe.  “You’d need to have a Chinese bank account, a Japanese bank account and a European bank account,” explains William Quigley, co-founder of the WAX blockchain and one of the founders of USDT issuer Tether. “If somebody wants to send you euros or yen or RMB, the intermediaries who can hold those accounts swap out those currencies for the currency you are able to hold and send it to your bank. And along the way, they've skimmed a lot of money off the top for that.”  We can't all have 50 different bank accounts in 50 different countries, says Quigley. But with stablecoins there’s no need.  Privacy lovers, in particular, appreciate this facet of stablecoins since they can avoid the process known as KYC, or know your customer – aka submitting photo ID and Social Security information to open a financial account. While KYC has become, for most of us, a normal part of dealing with money, crypto proponents argue KYC is prohibitive when applied to central banking institutions in other countries.  “This is why it's extraordinary to me that an individual in New York, California or Texas can hold in their Ledger [wallet] 10 different tokenized currencies that stay in their native form,” said Quigley. “You don't need a Chinese bank account. You can keep a token representing that Chinese currency and use it as though it is Chinese currency without ever converting.”  This direct, peer-to-peer model of stablecoins helps save money that otherwise goes to pay processing fees and administrative costs for third-party intermediaries.  “There's a trillion dollars each year siphoned out of the global economy – from businesses and consumers – to these ‘money changers,’” Quigley says. “That disappears if the currency can be maintained in its original form because it's been tokenized and held on a blockchain accessible to the user instantly, rather than in a bank.”  How do you pick the right stablecoin?  There’s a wide variety of stablecoins now available within the broader ecosystem of 16,000+ cryptocurrencies, so choosing which ones to buy, trade or simply use for everyday transactions remains a challenge even for experts.  As with all things crypto, there’s a perpetual balance to keep in mind between centralization and decentralization, stability and freedom, regulation and permissionless-ness.  Fiat-backed stablecoins, for instance, are popular because they are as stable as the U.S. dollar (USD) or other widely accepted currencies. However, linking crypto to a federal currency makes fiat-backed cryptos a target for governmental regulation and overall more centralized – a certain trade-off when compared with algorithmic stablecoins, the most decentralized option.  There’s also the issue of what exactly is backing each currency. For instance, not all the USD-backed stablecoins (USDT and BUSD – to name a few) are backed by an exact 1:1 ratio of dollars to crypto. What’s inside the reserves varies depending on the entity behind the coin.  Tether (USDT), for instance, used to be set up where the dollar amount in reserves was identical to the amount of minted USDT. But that has changed, says Quigley, adding: “What Tether [the issuing company] has done now is they have a certain quantity of the outstanding tether [USDT] held in fiat and then a certain quantity held in liquid marketable securities.”  So instead of dollar bills, there might be liquid reserves in the form of bonds, CDs, treasury bonds and cash equivalents.  “They periodically disclose the mix,” Quigley says of Tether.  Another difference is on which platforms and exchanges you can find each stablecoin. Binance, for example, announced in Sept. 2022 it would convert USD Coin into its own stablecoin, BUSD.  When considering which stablecoins to add to your portfolio, consider the following questions:  Where can I buy and exchange the stablecoin?  On what platform is the stablecoin minted?  How often are the reserves audited and how transparent is the reporting?  What’s the market cap and circulating supply?

42411735,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXeO,1663356490,What Is a Stablecoin?,"Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to another asset class to keep a stable, steady value.  The most popular kind of stablecoins are fiat-backed stablecoins, which are tied to currencies such as the U.S. dollar.  On August 7, 2023, payments giant PayPal announced they were issuing their own stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, PayPal USD (PYUSD). It marks the first time a major financial company is issuing its own regulated stablecoin, leading many newcomers to crypto wondering what a stablecoin is and why they are used.  A “stablecoin” is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset class, such as a fiat currency or gold, to stabilize its price.  Here's why stablecoins are useful to crypto: Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether offer a number of benefits, such as not requiring trust in an intermediary institution to send payments anywhere and to anyone. But one key drawback is that cryptocurrencies' prices are unpredictable and have a tendency to fluctuate, often wildly.  This makes them hard for everyday people to use. Generally, people expect to be able to know how much their money will be worth a week from now, both for their security and their livelihood.  Cryptocurrency's unpredictability comes in contrast to the generally stable prices of fiat money, such as U.S. dollars, or other assets, such as gold. Values of currencies like the dollar do change gradually over time, but the day-to-day changes are often more drastic for cryptocurrencies, which rise and fall in value regularly.  The following graph shows the price of bitcoin vs. the U.S. dollar (USD) compared to another fiat currency, the Canadian dollar (CAD), to see how much each currency fluctuates in relation.  Stablecoins in a nutshell  Stablecoins try to tackle price fluctuations by tying the value of cryptocurrencies to other more stable assets – usually fiat currencies. Fiat is the government-issued currency we're all used to using on a day-to-day basis, such as dollars or euros.  See Also: Fiat-Backed Stablecoins: What You Need to Know About Tether, USD Coin and Others  Usually, the entity behind a stablecoin will set up a ""reserve"" where it securely stores the asset or basket of assets backing the stablecoin – for example, $1 million in an old-fashioned bank (the kind with branches and tellers and ATMs in the lobby) to back up one million units of a stablecoin.  This is one way digital stablecoins are pegged to real-world assets. The money in the reserve serves as collateral for the stablecoin – meaning whenever a stablecoin holder wishes to cash out their tokens, an equal amount of whichever asset backs it is taken from the reserve.  There is a more complex type of stablecoin that is collateralized by other cryptocurrencies rather than fiat yet still is engineered to track a mainstream asset like the dollar.  MakerDAO, perhaps the most famous stablecoin issuer that uses this mechanism, accomplishes this through a service called “Vault” (formerly known as a Collateralized Debt Position), which locks up a user's cryptocurrency collateral. Then, once the smart contract knows the collateral is secured, a user can use it to borrow freshly minted dai, the stablecoin.  A third variety of stablecoin, known as an algorithmic stablecoin, isn’t collateralized at all; instead, coins are either burned or created to keep the coin’s value in line with the target price. Let’s say the stablecoin drops from the target price of $1 to $0.75. The algorithm will automatically burn a tranche of coins to introduce more scarcity, pushing up the price of the stablecoin. This type of stablecoin protocol is difficult to get right and has been tried and has failed several times over recent years. Yet, entrepreneurs keep trying.  Types of stablecoin collateral  Using this framework, stablecoins come in a range of flavors, and the collateralized stablecoins use a variety of types of assets as backing:  Fiat: Fiat is the most common collateral for stablecoins. The U.S. dollar is the most popular among fiat currencies, but companies are exploring stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies as well, such as BiLira, which is pegged to the Turkish lira.  Precious metals: Some cryptocurrencies are tied to the value of precious metals such as gold or silver.  Cryptocurrencies: Some stablecoins even use other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, the native token of the Ethereum network, as collateral.  Other investments: Tether’s USDT was once supposed to be backed 1-for-1 with dollars but its collateral mix has shifted over time, and in a breakdown provided in 2021 the company said nearly half its reserves are in commercial paper, a form of short-term corporate debt. It has not disclosed the issuers of this paper but claims it is all rated A-2 or higher (A-2 is the second-best grade available for a corporate borrower from credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor’s). Circle’s USDC, similarly, lists unspecified “approved investments” alongside accounts at federally insured banks (notably, it does not say whether the accounts themselves are insured) in its monthly disclosures.  What are the most popular stablecoins?  To give you a taste of the experimentation happening in stablecoin land, let's run through some of the most popular stablecoins.  Tether  Tether (USDT) is one of the oldest stablecoins, launched in 2014, and is the most popular to this day. It's one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies overall by market capitalization.  The primary use case for USDT is moving money between exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities when the price of cryptocurrencies differs on two exchanges; traders can make money on this discrepancy. But it has found other applications: Chinese importers stationed in Russia have also used USDT to send millions of dollars worth of value across the border, bypassing strict capital controls in China.  Tether Ltd. the company that issues USDT, was embroiled in a 22-month legal battle with the New York Attorney General over allegations Bitfinex (a sister company of Tether) tried to cover up an $850 million shortfall using funds taken from Tether.  Eventually, the case was settled on Feb. 23, 2021, with Tether and Bitfinex forced to pay $18.5 million and submit quarterly reports showing Tether’s stablecoin reserves for the next two years.  Read More: How USDT Works  USD Coin  USD Coin is a stablecoin launched jointly by cryptocurrency firms Circle and Coinbase in 2018 through the Centre Consortium.  Like tether before its shift towards a mix of collateral assets, USD Coin is pegged to the U.S. dollar. USDC is an open-source protocol, which means any person or company can use it to develop their own products.  On July 8, 2021, Circle announced plans to go public through a $4.5 billion SPAC merger deal with Concord Acquisition Corp. The news came one month after Circle closed a $440 million funding round involving big industry names such as FTX, Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk) and Fidelity Management and Research Company.  Read More: How USD Coin Works  Dai  Running on the MakerDAO protocol, dai is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in 2015, dai is pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by ether, the token behind Ethereum.  Unlike other stablecoins, MakerDAO intends for dai to be decentralized, meaning there's no central authority trusted with control of the system. Rather, Ethereum smart contracts – which encode rules that can't be changed – have this job instead.  There are still problems with this innovative model, however; for example, if the smart contracts underpinning MakerDAO don't work exactly as anticipated. Indeed, they were gamed in 2020, leading to losses of $8 million.     Do stablecoins have any drawbacks?  There are a few drawbacks to stablecoins to keep in mind. Because of the way stablecoins are typically set up, they have different pain points than other cryptocurrencies.  If the reserves are stored with a bank or some other third party, another vulnerability is counterparty risk. This boils down to the question: Does the entity really have the collateral it claims to have? This has been a question frequently posed to Tether, for instance, over whether it maintains a true 1-1 backing between USDT tokens and U.S. dollars.  In the worst-case scenario, it's possible the reserves backing a stablecoin could turn out to be insufficient to redeem every unit, potentially shaking confidence in the coin.  Cryptocurrencies were created to replace intermediary companies that are typically trusted with a user's money. By their nature, intermediaries have control over that money; for example, they are typically able to stop a transaction from occurring. Some stablecoins add the ability to stop transactions back into the mix.  USD Coin openly has a back door to stop payments if coins are used in an illicit manner. Circle, one of the firms behind USDC, confirmed in July 2020 that it froze $100,000 of the stablecoin at the behest of law enforcement.

42411736,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfXb5,1663354037,What Is Proof-of-Stake?,"Proof-of-stake is a method of maintaining the integrity of a cryptocurrency, preventing users from printing extra coins they didn’t earn. While a different method, called proof-of-work, is currently used by Bitcoin and Dogecoin, for example.  Both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are what are called “consensus mechanisms,” the method by which a blockchain maintains its integrity. Consensus is what addresses the ""double spending"" problem of digital money. If there were any way the user of a cryptocurrency could spend their coins more than once, it would undermine the entire system. The currency would be worthless.  This is a tricky problem, especially with online currencies that have no central authority, such as a bank or a government, to keep track of how much money each person has, how they’re spending it, and whom they’re paying.  The Bitcoin network was the first to solve this problem with proof-of-work. Proof-of-stake has emerged as a possible alternative that some researchers think is both more energy efficient and more secure.  Why is proof-of-anything needed?  It's not so hard to prevent double spending in a centralized manner, when there's one entity managing a ledger of all the transactions. When Alice sends Bob $1, the manager of the central ledger simply takes $1 from Alice and gives $1 to Bob. PayPal does exactly that.  But cryptocurrencies are different. The goal is not to have one leader or entity in control of the system, which makes this record-keeping more complicated.  Instead of just one leader, thousands of users run the Bitcoin software all over the world. These ""nodes"" ensure the rules of the network are followed. This sprawling infrastructure needs to be tied together so all the software is in agreement. Otherwise these nodes will be disconnected islands.  It turns out it isn't easy to get these users around the world to agree with each other, so decentralized money was out of reach for researchers for a long time. Until Bitcoin came along. Proof-of-work is the innovative algorithm that Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto came up with, making decentralized money without a leader come to life for the first time.  Proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake  Some argue proof-of-work has problems. As bitcoin mining has become concentrated, some groups have become more powerful than Bitcoin's creator intended. You often hear critiques that Bitcoin uses as much energy as all of Argentina or some other nation. Recently, a report from the White House said that crypto mining's energy consumption undermines U.S. sustainability goals. On the other hand, some argue Bitcoin's energy use is not that bad because the current financial system also uses plenty of energy.  In a nutshell, these proof-of-X schemes help to verify what transactions are added to the blockchain by way of blocks, which are filled with the latest transactions. The winner gets a reward.  Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake each pick a ""winner"" – the entity that will create the next block – in a different way.  With proof-of-work, miners are the participants. They are more likely to add additional blocks to the blockchain if they have more computational power, which is fueled by electricity.  In proof-of-stake, miners are more likely to win additional blocks if they have more money – ether, in the case of Ethereum. In other words, proof-of-stake relies on ""proof"" of how much ""stake"" users have.  Critics argue it hasn't yet been proven that proof-of-stake can eradicate all these problems. But advocates think it could be the way forward.  Proof-of-stake FAQ  How does Ethereum's proof-of-stake work?  The most ambitious proof-of-stake rollout to date is the Merge, a series of upgrades that transitioned Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Here's how it works, at a high level.  Special entities in proof-of-stake known as ""validators"" are charged with selectingthe next blocks for the Ethereum blockchain.  Validators tie up some of their ether so they can't use it as they're participating in the proof-of-stake process. Similar to miners in proof-of-work, they are rewarded for taking part in this process.  Validators are awarded when:  They attest to a new block, meaning they accept it as accurate, saying it follows the rules.  They attest to a new block, meaning they accept it as accurate, saying it follows the rules.  They ""win"" a block.  To make sure validators don't fool around, Ethereum's proof-of-stake doles out penalties as well.  Penalties are dispensed when:  If a validator proposes a block with a false transaction or false data history, a significant portion of the validator’s staked resources are slashed by the protocol. Further, the validator is banned from the network to punish this bad behavior.  Smaller penalties are allotted if the validator goes offline.  To become a validator for Ethereum, you will need to stake 32 ether, worth roughly $45,000 as of September, 2022, to run a validator node.  Is proof-of-stake better than proof-of-work?  Not necessarily. This question is still up for debate.  Proof-of-stake has drawn more than a few critics. Blockstream Director of Research Andrew Poelstra wrote a mathematical paper back in 2015 saying proof-of-stake is ""fundamentally unable to produce a distributed consensus within Bitcoin’s trust model.""  Critics also argue the system risks leading to more centralization. While blockchains are supposed to not have leaders in charge, critics worry that proof-of-stake would unintentionally steer blockchains back in the direction of centralized control, since users who have the most ether have the most power over the system.  But if proof-of-stake could be a greener alternative that can accomplish the same goals as proof-of-work, but more efficiently.

42373821,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVKJB,1663353503,Ethereum Proof-of-Work Fork Stumbles as Justin Sun's Poloniex Supports Rival Fork,"In stark contrast to the mostly flawless execution of the Ethereum Merge, technical snafus and defections have marred the new “fork” blockchain by crypto miners aiming to preserve the old proof-of-work network.  The project, tagged as EthereumPOW, fell flat right at the start as users complained about glitches, and crypto exchange Poloniex, where Tron founder and early cheerleader of EthereumPOW Justin Sun is an investor, decided to support a rival proof-of-work fork.  On top of that, it appears many crypto miners shifted their resources to focus on the Ethereum Classic (ETC) blockchain, data suggests.  The new ETHW token’s price tumbled to as low as $8 Friday on some exchanges that listed the cryptocurrency, a 70% drop from the $30 level where it mostly traded earlier this week.  On crypto exchange BitMEX, which had listed a derivative contract on the token in early August, ETHW futures dropped to $11 on Friday from $96 since trading commenced.  Rival forks  As Ethereum got close to finishing its transition to proof-of-stake technology with the Merge – a shift that rendered the miners’ processes and equipment obsolete – Chandler Guo, a China-based Ethereum miner, came up with an alternative plan.  He proposed in August to create a duplicate version of the Ethereum blockchain with a fork that would retain the mining-based proof-of-work consensus mechanism after the Merge. Everyone who held ether (ETH) would be entitled to receive the same amount of the new blockchain’s native token, ETHW, with an airdrop. The fork was scheduled to happen a day after the Merge.  Amid the initial buzz, some exchanges rushed to list a derivative of the potential blockchain’s would-be token, including crypto exchange Poloniex. Sun, an investor in Poloniex, became one of the loudest proponents of the proof-of-work fork of Ethereum, saying that it is a tried-and-tested system for the second largest blockchain.  Read more: Justin Sun Says Proof-of-Work 'Essential' Part of Ethereum  Then, on the day before the ETHW fork, Poloniex surprised many by announcing that it would support a little-known, different fork of the network, EthereumFair, with its native token ETF.  “Based on the market situation, consensus of users and the community, Poloniex has decided to choose the fork chain EthereumFair (ETF) which is supported by the community's majority and more PoW computing power as the main chain for ETHW tokens,” the crypto exchange said in a statement Thursday.  Information is scarce about EthereumFair. According to the project’s Twitter feed, ETF tokens will be distributed among bitcoin (BTC), dogecoin (DOGE), ether classic (ETC) and classzz (CZZ) token holders. Notably, ether (ETH) holders are about to miss out of the airdrop.  Poloniex said users already received the tokens, indicating that the blockchain went live. Crypto exchanges such as Huobi and Gate.io also listed ETF, and trading started early Friday.  Guo, the originator of the EthereumPOW, said in a tweet that Poloniex made a “huge mistake” by backing a rival fork.  Sun didn't immediately return a request for comment.  Kevin Zhou, head of crypto hedge fund Galois Capital, predicted earlier that proof-of-work forks would proliferate after Ethereum’s Merge.  At press time, EthereumFair’s token traded at around $17 on Poloniex. ETHW changed hands at $12 on crypto exchange FTX.  No buyers  Analysts doubt the longevity of any proof-of-work fork, but many traders planned to make money on them well before the Merge.  Their strategy was to buy or borrow ETH to be selected for the airdrop. Then after claiming the ETHW (or any hard fork’s) tokens, they would dump them on the market. Since the tokens were free, any profits were seen as a bonus for holding ETH.  This put a huge selling pressure on ETHW – especially because few big investors ever took the breakaway project seriously.  ""I spoke to a couple OTC (over-the-counter) desks, and they're saying everyone is selling. There's no buyer,"" Kevin Kang, co-founder of digital asset hedge fund BKCoin Capital, told CoinDesk.  Guo said Friday to CoinDeskTV that 90% of the miners of the EthereumPOW network will go bankrupt. When asked about the initial technical problems, he rated the start “mediocre.”",NEGATIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/16/ethereum-proof-of-work-fork-crashes-as-justin-suns-poloniex-supports-rival-fork,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9cc1f30de7d38632fa660e3579216c0a3fb55f3b-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Purchases of companies with U.S. operations by overseas entities are reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which blocks deals it worries pose a national security risk.  Under U.S. President Donald Trump, CFIUS took a dimmer view of takeovers by Chinese companies, and his successor Joe Biden just this week signed an executive order “designed to sharpen the federal government’s powers to block Chinese investment in technology in the United States and limit its access to private data on citizens,” the New York Times reported.  Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, was born in China but grew up in Canada. Binance has defended itself against claims the company is Chinese, with Zhao spelling out details about his lineage as recently as this month. “I am a Canadian citizen, period,” he wrote in a Sept. 1 post.  In the Voyager auction, Binance has been asked to add money on top of its bid as insurance in the event of a CFIUS review, which could delay an acquisition, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.  “Binance has made investments into countless American companies both directly and through Binance Labs,” Patrick Hillmann, the company’s chief communications officer, said Friday. “Binance has never been the subject of an inquiry officially or unofficially by CFIUS.” He added: “Binance is a Canadian company owned wholly by a Canadian citizen. The xenophobia underlying the very nature of us receiving [a question about CFIUS concerns] is almost as shocking as the violation of confidentiality” represented by information leaking from the bankruptcy auction.  Another Binance spokesperson, Jessica Jung, subsequently reached out and said Hillmann misspoke and Binance is an ""international company,"" not a Canadian one.  Voyager declined to comment.  CoinDesk reported Thursday that FTX currently has the highest bid for Voyager, though additional offers could come in soon. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s billionaire founder and CEO, was born in California. His company is headquartered in the Bahamas and incorporated in Antigua. Voyager is headquartered in Canada but has U.S. lending customers.  The contest to acquire Voyager’s assets is not officially decided until the end of this month, giving time for Binance or someone else to potentially top FTX.

42421457,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMbF,1663350865,Craig Wright’s Abnormal Psychology,"This week saw the latest in Craig Wright’s international tour of courthouses, presumably on Calvin Ayre’s expense account. He took the stand in Norway as part of his larger attempt to pursue a U.K. libel suit against a Norwegian schoolteacher named Magnus Granath, aka Hodlonaut. It was another invaluable chance to see Wright’s beautiful mind in action as he continued his campaign to prove, against all verifiable evidence, that he is pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  Hodlonaut initially accused Wright of being a fraud in 2019, after Wright’s attempts to claim the Satoshi identity were repeatedly shown to involve apparent deception. Wright had been called out by forensic blockchain experts and others for seemingly backdated documents and the misrepresentation of “private” cryptographic keys.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  When confronted about misrepresentations, Wright has a tendency to get entertainingly baroque. For instance, he has claimed that backdated documents were planted on his computer in a hack by Blockstream. Another creative explanation involved the theft of private keys to the Satoshi coins through a confusing welter of home invasions, clandestine router swaps and security camera outages.  Wright’s most fascinating contortions, though, rely on his psychological self-diagnosis. Wright has repeatedly explained inconsistencies in his Satoshi claims by depicting himself as a careening wreck, beset by autism and binge drinking and deeply conflicted about confirming his Satoshi identity.  This week brought us a sterling entry in this genre. Wright’s lawyers have said they will try to establish his identity as Satoshi without relying on his control of the private keys that would definitively prove it. By way of explanation, Wright claimed this week that he “stomped on” the hard drive containing the keys. (This seems to supplant his earlier claim that the keys were stolen in an elaborate home invasion.)  See also: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial  Wright explained his destruction of the keys, which would have amounted to destroying his own access to billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin, by saying it was “the only way” to avoid being forced to prove his identity cryptographically.  A reluctant Satoshi?  All this in part advances Wright’s repeated claims that he never wanted to be “outed” as Satoshi, which he has also used to explain past failed proofs. In the case of the bungled “Sartre proof” in 2016, for instance, Wright now claims he intentionally got it wrong to throw people off the trail. This isn’t even internally consistent – if you are tortured by the pressure to prove something, why would you destroy the only evidence that would conclusively prove it?  But the entire “reluctant Satoshi” pose is even more obviously false than that. Wright was helping promote his own identity as Satoshi circa 2015-2016, rather than being unwillingly outed by “leaks.”  The clearest evidence of Wright’s involvement in the claims comes from journalist Andrew O’Hagan, who was approached by a lawyer named Jimmy Nguyen with Wright’s story before the claims appeared in Wired or Gizmodo. Nguyen told O’Hagan he was representing Wright through an entity then known as nCrypt, and is now president of the BSV Blockchain Association, an arm of the Wright/Ayre network.  Regardless, demonstrating control of the Satoshi keys would also be bad, Wright said this week, because he “didn’t want to encourage the arguments that you need keys.” That’s the hinge between Wright’s purportedly tortured psyche and his even-more-tortured claims about how blockchains work.  A misunderstood genius who misunderstands his own invention  Since at least early 2020, Wright has been advancing the patently false idea that a court order is sufficient to unlock blockchain tokens without using the owner’s private keys. I can’t even begin to explain his logic here, because there is none – it’s just something he says again and again, loudly and angrily. Some have speculated that these claims relate to an attempt to gain real control of the Satoshi coins.  Wright has made other, even more bizarre claims about blockchains with far less motivation, such as recently writing on his blog that “if you are ever told that any blockchain network can have more than ten nodes controlling the network, know that you are being deceived … There is no way to create a blockchain system that is maintained by thousands of nodes.”  This sort of hokum is hard to explain. Why would someone claiming to be Satoshi rattle off clearly incorrect claims about a system he supposedly invented?  The nChain connection  Back in 2016, O’Hagan uncovered relationships that would seem to explain Wright’s many strange and increasingly contradictory stances.  As GQ Australia’s Stuart McGurk summarized O’Hagan’s findings, nCrypt had agreed to “buy up [Wright’s] companies and settle his debts,” including huge debts to the Australian Taxation Office. “In return, [Wright would] work on patents linked to the underlying blockchain technology behind bitcoin. And [Wright] would publicly out himself as Satoshi. The package, [nCrypt] felt, was worth billions. They planned to sell it to Google.”  nCrypt, to no one’s surprise, is one of the brands claimed by nChain, where Wright has been chief scientist since nChain was unveiled in 2017. In other words, O’Hagan described the plan accurately in print – a year before it was publicly unveiled.  See also: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi? | Opinion  This would provide a sane explanation for Wright’s insane posturing as a tortured autistic genius and his convoluted Russian-doll claims of hacks within frauds within pineapple routers. He has to cling to his claim to be Satoshi long enough to capitalize on it, even if that means tying himself into incomprehensible knots.  Tragically, the nChain plan doesn’t seem to be panning out – it’s hard to imagine Google touching Wright or his patents with a 10-mile pole at this point. And if his recent track record is any indication, the Norwegian court will treat his claims with equal skepticism.",NEGATIVE,BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | BSV,David Z.

The companies, which were chosen from a pool of 54 applicants, will each focus on developing one specific use case for the design trial. The group of service providers were chosen because they met &apos;specific capabilities&apos; required to test the use cases. E-commerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN), for instance, will be responsible for e-commerce payments, while Spanish bank CaixaBank (OTCPK:CAIXY) will work on peer-to-peer online payments for a mobile app. The offline version of peer-to-peer payments will be in the hands of French payments platform Worldline (OTCPK:WWLNF). EPI and Italian payments firm Nexi (OTCPK:NEXPF) will explore point of sale payments initiated by the payer and payee, respectively. Prototyping is expected to be completed in Q1 2023, when the central bank will also publish its findings from the exercise. The move comes in the midst of the ECB&apos;s two-year investigation into whether a digital euro, serving as an alternative to cash, should be issued.

Last week, the digital asset lost its prized crypto top 10 positions when Polkadot (DOT) rallied, and it overtook the meme coin. However, as the week draws to a close, DOGE has taken the lead over DOT once more. Dogecoin Makes Top 10 After spending about a week out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap list, Dogecoin has reclaimed the 10th spot on the market. It is less a result of a rally in the price of Dogecoin and rather a decline in the price of Polkadot (DOT) over the past week. Related Reading: Ethereum Merge Fails To Move ETH Price, $2,000 Remains Elusive Where DOGE had seen a price decline of 6.24% in the last 7 days, Polkadot had suffered a worse fate, losing more than 12% of its value in the same time period. DOT had inevitably lost its footing above $7, and its market cap dropped to $7.64 billion. At the time of writing, Dogecoin&apos;s market cap was sitting at $7.9 billion, less than $300 million higher than the market cap of DOT. This means that the meme coin is not completely out of the woods, and DOT could overtake the 10th position if DOGE&apos;s price fails to hold up against the market.

With the change to a proof-of-stake system, miners and their energy-burning computers are no longer needed to validate transactions.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  Some of those miners have turned to a proof-of-work (PoW) fork of Ethereum so they can continue mining. But even Chandler Guo, one of the fork's strongest advocates, thinks only 10% of miners using PoW to mine ETHPOW (the token of the Ethereum Merge fork) or ETC (the token of Ethereum Classic) will ultimately survive.  Ethereum miner Guo told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program on Friday the miners with access to cheaper electricity will be the ones that survive.  “Some people [miners] have free electricity and can [continue] to work on that,” Guo said, referring to the PoW fork. “The other 90%, bankrupt.”  Read more: Ethereum PoW Network Sees Complaints on Day 1 Amid Data Goof-Up  Early Thursday, Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain after Bitcoin, smoothly made the historic move of migrating from its proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a faster and less-energy-consuming protocol known as proof-of-stake (PoS).  As for the PoW fork, things didn't go as smoothly. There were complaints about problems accessing the blockchain's servers while attempts to set up a crypto wallet failed.  ""Some people can connect, some people cannot connect,"" Guo responded. ""It depends on your speed of the network.""  Guo has been a strong advocate for keeping Ethereum as a PoW system, and told CoinDesk in August that he would issue a fork to support that protocol.  Now, however, Guo rates the PoW fork debut a ""mediocre"" 5 on a scale of 10. He expects that will change with time as more miners get involved.

42373823,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVKKR,1663343426,"ECB Picks Amazon, Nexi, 3 More to Prototype Digital Euro Apps","The European Central Bank chose five organizations to help develop user interfaces for a potential digital euro, it said Friday.  The organizations include Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce company by market capitalization, and the European Payments Initiative, a group of 31 banks and credit institutions. The other participants, selected from 54 applicants because they met “specific capabilities” required to test a range of uses, are Spanish multinational CaixaBank, French payments platform Worldline and Italian payments-focused bank Nexi, the ECB said.  The ECB is in the middle of a two-year investigation into whether to issue a digital euro, which it says would be a central bank-issued alternative to cash. While a decision has yet to be taken, current thinking is to use it exclusively to facilitate personal payments within the European Union, if issued. A decision on whether the ECB will issue one is due September 2023. In the meantime, the prototyping project will test potential design options, with results expected in the first quarter of next year.  The EU is among some 100 jurisdictions actively exploring central bank digital currencies, which are digital forms of sovereign currencies like the U.S. dollar or the euro. Although the EU might be considered far behind countries like China – which already has citizens using a CBDC in real-world trials – it is ahead of other major jurisdictions like the U.S., which has yet to decide if one is of national interest.  For the ECB's design trial, each of the five companies was chosen to test specific uses. Amazon, for instance, will work on e-commerce payments, according to the ECB.  “The future will be built on new technologies that enable modern, fast, and inexpensive payments,” said Max Bardon, vice president of Amazon Payments, in an email to CoinDesk.  CaixaBank will be developing a mobile app that simulates the steps users will take to transfer digital euros to their bank accounts or transfer digital euros to other individuals. Worldline will explore offline payments between individuals, while EPI and Nexi will work on point of sale retail payments.

42421448,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMaD,1663343400,Tornado Cash Ban Will Aid China’s AI Goals,"If the U.S. government fears China’s progress in artificial intelligence, why is it giving Beijing a treasure trove of highly valuable crypto data with which to train its machine-learning models?  That’s the rhetorical question that developer Anish Mohammed left with me when we caught up at the NEARCon gathering in Lisbon this week.  It gave me a new, rather alarming perspective on the anti-privacy, self-censoring crackdown that’s playing out in crypto circles following the U.S. government’s sanctioning of Ethereum-based transaction mixer Tornado Cash.  I and many others were making the positive case long before the Tornado Cash action that the U.S. and its allies would gain a geopolitical advantage if they allowed the expansion of decentralized, privacy-protecting, open-access crypto protocols.  The idea is that Western society can unleash a “killer app”: the enshrining of individual rights into code, enticing the world’s digitally-mobile citizens to vote with their pocketbooks in favor of Western monetary systems that encourage open-access and privacy over authoritarian control and surveillance. The model would win, we said, because dictatorships and single-party states cannot match it without losing control over their money and thereby sowing the seeds of their own downfall.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Until my conversation with Mohammed, the chief scientist at privacy-protecting Panther Protocol, the failure to embrace that open approach to crypto policy was a major source of my frustration with the United States’ draconian regulation of crypto projects, where users are compelled to identify themselves, comply with “accredited investor” requirements and meet excessive reporting demands from government authorities. All of that activity, I’ve argued, defeats crypto’s decentralization principles and diminishes its potentially vast value to society.  But, sadly, I now have a more ominous take on the problem. It seems we’re not only relinquishing the opportunity to use the “carrot” of privacy to out-compete China, we’re also handing it a “stick” with which to subjugate us and accelerate its march toward AI dominance.  Data is the fuel of the AI economy  We have reached a stage in the evolution of digital technology where progress is largely determined by access to data.  First, Moore’s Law, which described the mechanism by which semiconductor capacity was rapidly expanding in the last decades of the 20th century, marched us into an age of super-fast computing hardware. Then, the arrival of the internet in the 1990s exponentially expanded human civilization’s capacity to generate and share the digital information that’s processed and transmitted by those computers. Now, at a time when AI systems are influencing virtually all aspects of our lives – to both good and bad ends – the machine-learning algorithms that drive them are becoming the primary consumers of that data. They need it to develop ever-more-powerful predictive and behavior-adjusting algorithms.  These AI systems compete in a race for the “profits” generated by their deployment, whether in the form of payoffs to corporate shareholders, greater control for government agencies, or positive public outcomes such as improvements in our collective ability to process and respond to environmental change. That competition is giving them an ever-growing, voracious appetite for data.  Also important, this is happening at the precise time that money – containing the informational traces of much of society’s person-to-person, institution-to-institution and person-to-institution interactions – is also going digital.  Monetary digitization is being driven by governments, by companies and by communities of open-source blockchain developers. Their models fall on a spectrum between ones where a state entity manages the ledger and has full, exclusive visibility on all users’ data to open protocols run by decentralized networks that integrate cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs to shield transaction histories from everyone. In the middle lie public blockchains with no privacy protection, where the transaction data is visible to all.  Read more: The Coming Privacy Wars  The data gold mine  If you're an authoritarian government with an AI system trained to undermine the interests of foreign states you regard as enemies, you will want the data from those states’ societies to be as accessible as possible. And if you’re developing a centralized form of programmable, digital money, as well as an economy-wide distributed ledger network to bring transaction-processing efficiencies to multiple industries, you’ll take a special interest in publicly available blockchain data.  That description, of course, matches China, whose central bank digital currency, the Digital Electronic Payments system, is being rolled out to hundreds of millions of users in parallel with the development of its industrial Blockchain Services Network. As these systems develop, machine-learning programs controlled, or endorsed, by the Chinese government will gain access to voluminous economic data generated by Chinese citizens.  Read more: What China's Blockchain Services Network Means for the World  China’s goals go beyond making its domestic economy more efficient. It aspires to lead the world in digital technology while protecting what it views as its strategic geopolitical interests. If it is to use AI to pursue those goals then the real prize lies not in data generated by the citizens of the U.S, Europe, Japan and other democratic regions.  It’s hard to access U.S. and European data protected by firewalls within centralized corporate and government systems. In contrast, open blockchains produce publicly available information. The question for policymakers is how well that transaction source data is shielded, for example with sophisticated cryptography such as Tornado Cash.  Therein lies the problem with the U.S. Treasury Department’s recent decision effectively barring Americans from transacting with Tornado Cash. In taking the unprecedented step of treating open-source software as the equivalent of a person or a company, the U.S. has stripped the Ethereum blockchain of a vital privacy option and blown open its data.  The long arm of the law is such that crypto providers everywhere responded rapidly, if reluctantly, to Treasury’s order by blocking wallets that have transacted with Tornado Cash users. In an extension of this wave of mass self-censorship, many are now also fearful of interacting with other privacy-protecting smart contracts that could be hit with similar sanctions.  Listen: Unsatisfying Clarifications on the Tornado Cash Sanctions  But what about North Korea?  We could say we’ve entered the post-privacy era of blockchains. What’s not being discussed is that, as digital currency and blockchain systems grow, this new phase will bring informational advantages to authoritarian regimes.  That description not only fits China and Russia, but also North Korea. That’s ironic because the reason the U.S. Treasury Department gave for its sanctions against Tornado Cash was that North Korean hackers had used it to launder funds in an attack against online video game Axie Infinity.  Last week, analytics firm Chainalysis announced it helped U.S. officials recover $30 million from that attack. One might ask, then, why it was important to shut down Tornado Cash at all.  Clearly there’s a public interest in preventing such hacks. But there are all sorts of ways in which blockchain analytics and sophisticated encryption solutions can make it hard for rogue actors to get away with money while also protecting user privacy.  Whatever the solution, regulators need to understand that the price they pay for imposing broad-based constraints on privacy is nothing short of a threat to Western democracy.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION,Michael J.

The charges, filed in the federal district court in Manhattan, allege that Creative Advancement LLC and Edelman Blockchain Advisors LLC, and their owner, Gabriel Edelman, raised $4.3 million by offering and selling securities to four investors using “false and misleading statements” between February 2017 and May 2021. Those statements included promises to invest in digital assets, when, in reality, Edelman used their funds to bankroll his personal expenses, according to the complaint.  The complaint also alleges that Edelman engaged in “Ponzi-like” activities by sending some investors early repayments to encourage them to make larger investments in the scheme. It described the investors as elderly and “relatively unknowledgeable” about crypto.  The SEC is seeking court orders to halt the firms’ operations and force the businesses to relinquish the profits they made off the fraudulent transactions.  The case marks the second time this week SEC regulators have gone after bad actors in the crypto space. On Wednesday, the SEC sued a Chicago-based crypto company that allegedly sold $1.5 million in unregistered tokens and misled its investors about the nature of the sales. The crackdowns followed SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s comments doubling down on the agency’s stance that “the vast majority” of crypto currencies are securities and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC.

42373815,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVKBd,1663340400,Blockchain Tool Developer Infura Plans to Launch Decentralized Protocol,"Blockchain development tool Infura plans to launch a decentralized infrastructure protocol early next year to address concerns that its product is too centralized to underpin the Ethereum ecosystems’ decentralized applications (dapps).  Read more: What Is a Dapp?  The introduction of a decentralized infrastructure protocol is a significant development in Infura’s plan to progressively decentralize its Web3 API services — a process that involves developing open-source code for the key components that power the tool as well as decentralizing the JSON RPC API that users utilize to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.  Infura enables roughly 350,000 users to easily connect dapps to the Ethereum blockchain without having to run a full node, which requires greater storage and has higher costs. That ease of access comes at a price, however. While running a full node enables users to protect sensitive activity, Infura collects wallet addresses and IP data from its users.  Despite its push toward decentralization, Infura will not discontinue its more centralized product, which utilizes a single provider, ConsenSys, and Amazon-hosted cloud services. Instead, the decentralized protocol will exist alongside the company’s existing offerings.  Infura co-founder Eleazar Galano says Infura’s decentralized protocol will complement its more centralized offerings to offer its users the best customer experience.  “What we're focused on decentralizing is the lower level infrastructure layer beneath that so there's more interoperability between operators that serve this type of traffic,” Galano told CoinDesk. “There's certain things that you just can't decentralize in the customer experience. We have customer relationships with dedicated support engineers and customer success managers – things like that.”  Galano says Infura will move toward decentralization by kicking off an open-source initiative that will foster partnerships between Infura and the greater DeFi community to open source a lot of the key components that drive Infura.  “We're starting this call out for early partners that want to help work with us standing up this decentralized infrastructure,” said Galana “We want to provide the type of quality that people expect of a node provider service like Infura.”  Qualified infrastructure providers can apply to an early access program to be a participant in the new protocol, beginning Friday.

Coinbase’s joint venture with USDC issuer Circle alone could contribute about $700 million of incremental revenue, JPMorgan estimates. The two firms formed a joint venture in 2018 called the CENTRE Consortium, which included a revenue share on interest income from USDC reserves.  Additional ways Coinbase caould earn interest income are from customer fiat and its corporate cash balance, JPMorgan noted, adding up to a potential total of $1.2 billion in added revenue next year.  The bank said that a key risk for Coinbase realizing its interest income is the possibility of a reduced holding of USDC and fiat currency with the exchange.  “We see the potential for institutional investors to hold less USDC given the opportunity cost of holding quasi-cash that doesn’t offer a yield. We also see retail holding less of its fiat at Coinbase since it doesn’t get a yield. As such, we see the potential for USDC balances and fiat balances to decline for Coinbase,” JPMorgan wrote.  JPMorgan kept its neutral stock rating on Coinbase, though it raised its price target to $78 from $64.  Shares of Coinbase were trading at about $74.60 Friday morning, down 2.6%. The stock is down about 70% year to date.

42421445,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMW5,1663336068,How the Ethereum Merge Could Lead to Improved On-Chain Privacy,"Ethereum has been attacked over the years for its prohibitively expensive gas, or transaction, fees. It’s this often well-placed criticism that has inspired a historic network redesign that culminated in the much-anticipated “Merge” event this week. While many are eager to rejoice for a gas-optimized future, the greater implications of the Merge span far beyond basic product viability.  It shouldn't be controversial to say the Merge will not improve network performance itself. Instead, it will lay the groundwork for a series of powerful scaling upgrades down the line called the Surge and the Verge. These upgrades pave the way for groundbreaking innovation in computation-heavy decentralized applications – most notably, those that provide protections for on-chain privacy.  Alex Shipp is the chief strategy officer at Offshift.  Setting the record straight: size matters  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has taken heat for his infamous declaration that “the internet of money should not cost 5 cents a transaction” to run. Likewise, his steadfast focus on making scaling a cardinal priority across the ecosystem has sometimes been called into question for missing other necessary improvements.  However, growing networks bring about second-order effects. Improved on-chain privacy may not be the prime motivation for Ethereum's switch to proof-of-stake, but it will likely be its result due to network effects, the reduced cost of computationally-expensive ""zero-knowledge"" transactions and the sheer number of developers focused on privacy solutions.  It is without a doubt that bringing down Ethereum gas fees is absolutely imperative for the network to attract more mainstream users. But what is yet to be seen is the innovation that expanded network capacity will produce; for it would be naive to envisage post-Merge Ethereum as merely a low-friction environment for cheaper, faster decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) minting.  Looking back: what performance improvements meant for the internet  In the early days of the “dot-com boom,” the internet was mostly seen and presented as an ultra-efficient tool for communication. This was an enormous value proposition for its time, which today can only be seen as an understatement. Likewise, when infrastructural improvements were planned, they were mostly attributed to their most immediate effects: faster emails, shorter load times and the like.  There were also downstream consequences to every improvement to the internet, culminating today in a network that allows for instantaneous information transfer across the globe. In truth, only a small crowd of visionaries were able to see where things were heading and began work developing features like real-time streaming, cloud computing, file sharing, RSS and torrenting.  Read more: Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know  These are the innovations that make the vibrant internet landscape what we enjoy today. They paved the way for new applications including social media, dating apps, interactive content streaming platforms, monetization models, e-commerce, personal financial tools and, yes, those obnoxious banner ads that make free web services profitable.  Many in the emergent Web3 movement have a bad habit of looking down on the incumbent internet paradigm crypto aspires to replace. It is perhaps worth considering that Web2 – parasitic and imbalanced though it may be – was itself the product of sophistication, ingenuity and much creative spirit. It might not hurt to take a note or two.  Looking forward: what performance improvements will mean for the cryptoverse  With the Merge completed, Ethereum has kicked off a multi-phase scaling journey, one which Vitalik Buterin said may take up to six years in his Jan. 3 appearance on Bankless. Buterin went on to say that if no further modifications were to be made to Ethereum, he “would be very happy.”  Now that Ethereum is successfully running proof-of-stake, developers are now focused on building out a scalability system called sharding. That will be introduced in ""the Surge,"" which will also improve layer 2 scalability by supporting roll-ups.  After that, the Verge will introduce a vector-based commitment system to replace Ethereum’s present Merkle tree model, vastly reducing proof sizes and speeding up verification times – an immense leap forward for layer 1 operations.  Read more: Ethereum Merge Explained: What Investors Should Know About the Shift to Proof-of-Stake  The immediate benefits of improved transaction throughput are obvious and certainly worth celebrating: a more level playing field, affordable DeFi and meaningful adoption potential. But as per the growth trajectory of the internet, innovation often works in epochs and has a compounding affect.  Growing networks, privately  Privacy-centric tools and applications have long been one of cryptocurrency’s most powerful and demanded use cases. And the necessity of these tools is becoming clearer each day. As authoritative surveillance operations and Big Tech business models close in on individuals in lockstep, privacy in today's version of the virtual realm is rapidly becoming a pipe dream.  In response, zero knowledge (zk) proofs have emerged as Ethereum’s magic bullets, as the underlying cryptographic instruments powering not only Ethereum’s leading layer 2 roll-ups, but its most promising and robust on-chain privacy solutions. The only problem: zks are computationally intensive.  Translation: Privacy was ludicrously expensive on pre-Merge Ethereum.  From PLONKs to zero-knowledge identity technologies, cryptographers and Solidity developers alike are hard at work building cutting-edge zk implementations to power the future of privacy-protecting decentralized applications. Until recently, Ethereum’s inability to conduct the necessary computation to protect user privacy on-chain has left users stranded.  But with the completion of the Merge – and subsequently, the Surge and Verge – Ethereum kicks off a new era of innovation, one powered by robust infrastructure, and guided by uncurbed ingenuity and innovation. The future of Ethereum is as bright as it is cheap, fast and private.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH,Alex Shipp,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/16/how-the-ethereum-merge-could-lead-to-improved-on-chain-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8248f8878a9ad4b305682caf857a05d9ab50accb-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Chainlink's LINK and Chiliz's CHZ both make gains on the day following new announcements.  Market Moves: The Merge has made the ether futures market more sensitive to staking yields and could theoretically keep the futures curve in ""backwardation.""  Chart of the Day: S&P 500 follows 2008 analog in a bad sign for crypto.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Ether was trading down 7% over the last 24 hours after the Merge, a software update where the Ethereum blockchain successfully moved its consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work. Following the Merge, the cryptocurrency briefly spiked 3% and then resumed its downtrend.  “It seems likely that a mix between the still-high correlations and investors looking to 'sell the news' led to ether's severe drop in spite of the milestone accomplished,” IntoTheBlock wrote in a research note Friday.  David Scheuermann, a trader at Crypto Finance AG’s, said it will take time to see the full effect of the Merge on the price of ether and the consequences should prevail once we are “out of this bear market.”  Ethereum classic was also trading down 10% on the day, and bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, was down by 2%.  Chainlink’s LINK token climbed 5% after the project announced it is collaborating with engagement platform, bountyblok. It integrated Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) into Chainlink’s giveaway and distribution tools on Polygon’s mainnet to replace its previous centralized randomizer service (random.org).  Bountyblok tweeted, “This allows for provably fair and tamper-proof distributions and drawing of winners.”  Chilliz (CHZ), the token that powers socios.com, a blockchain-based fan and rewards platform, was up 10% after Chilliz tweeted Thursday that it will introduce a fan token made in Brazil on its launchpad.  In traditional markets, futures for the S&P 500 were down 0.9%. Contracts for the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 were 1% lower.  In the news, Celsius Network, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, has asked for authorization to sell its stablecoin holdings in order to generate liquidity to help fund its operations, according to new court filings.  And exchange giant FTX is in the lead to buy the assets of Voyager Digital, the cryptocurrency lender whose bankruptcy filing deepened this year’s industry crisis, but higher offers could still come in the days ahead, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Market Moves  Ethereum Merge Has Tied Ether Futures Activity to Staking Yields, Traders Say  By Omkar Godbole  The Ethereum Merge, which happened on Thursday, has introduced several structural changes to the blockchain, promising to make it more environmentally friendly and reduce the supply of its native token ether (ETH).  According to traders, one consequence of the upgrade is that the activity in the futures market will now be closely tied to staking yields – rewards earned by locking ETH in the network in return for a chance to verify transactions under the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  The bigger the reward for staking, the greater the number of stakers and the stronger the demand for shorting or selling futures. That's because staked ether cannot be withdrawn before the next upgrade called Shanghai fork, due in mid-2023, and will earn rewards in ETH, which makes stakers vulnerable to potential ether price slides. Therefore, they will likely hedge their ETH exposure by selling futures contracts tied to ether.  ""Stakers have been and will be natural sellers in futures and perpetual futures. That's why open interest [number of open positions] is so high, and it will only grow if staking yields go higher,"" Zaheer Ebtikar, portfolio manager at crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, told CoinDesk.  Ethereum's network switched to the PoS system on Thursday after the PoS Beacon Chain launched in December 2020 merged with the Ethereum mainnet that used a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism whereby miners solved algorithmic problems to validate transactions in return for rewards. In other words, stakers are new validators.  While the Merge has taken away substantial miner selling from the spot market, it could bring more sellers to the futures market and cap the basis or the difference between prices in futures and spot markets or perhaps push futures into backwardation.  Read the full story here.  Chart of The Day  Bitcoin's Mean Net Inflows Surge to a Six-Year High  By Omkar Godbole  Stocks may be heading to new lows, as the chart provided by Mott Capital Management's Michael Kramer shows the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark index, is closely tracking the 2008 bear market slide.  Cryptocurrencies tend to move in line with stocks and could challenge June lows if S&P 500 keeps tracking the 2008 analog.

42373806,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVK0J,1663333200,DeFi Mobile Wallet Railway Wallet Launches,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) privacy protocol Railgun has launched the Railway Wallet mobile app, enabling users to privately carry out DeFi activities on the Ethereum blockchain.  Railway Wallet protects users’ transaction histories and ensures they cannot be tracked with tools like Etherscan, allowing users to privately interact with decentralized exchanges (DEX), decentralized apps (dapps) and liquidity provisions. The mobile wallet, which is the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) prover to run completely on mobile, is compatible with both Apple’s iOS system and Android.  Railgun co-founder Alan Scott says it’s important for developers to build effective privacy apps as the DeFi space continues to expand.  “If the future of finance is going to be DeFi, there has to be a privacy infrastructure in place, just from a consumer protection standpoint,” Scott told CoinDesk.  As a layer 1 application, Railway Wallet will take advantage of security features provided by the Ethereum blockchain’s main network, in addition to utilizing Railgun’s open-source code. In the run-up to the on-chain wallet’s launch, cybersecurity firms Trail of Bits, Hacken, and ABDK Consulting have audited the code, with Zokyo Security Team giving the code a 100 rating.  In recent months, regulators have pushed back against some privacy protocols, which they claim may be used to obfuscate dirty money trails. In August, for example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned the Tornado Cash protocol and roughly four dozen wallets associated with it, reviving discussions about reasonable expectations of privacy in the crypto community.  Read More: Tornado Cash Sanctions Are Spiraling Into Compliance Nightmares  But although some regulators are concerned about privacy services enabling nefarious activities, Scott argues it's normal for users to have high expectations of privacy in DeFi spaces, just as they would expect privacy in other aspects of their lives.  “Whenever I go to a restaurant, I may tell them about my nut allergy, but I don't hand them the entirety of my medical records, '' Scott said. “And I think the same thing is quite applicable to finance.”  In 2021, Railgun DAO struck a $10 million deal with Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk, to create a privacy protocol for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

42393942,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDJ5,1663331300,"Crypto Miners From US, EU Stay Put in Russia Despite War, Sanctions","After Russia started the war in Ukraine in February, the European Union and U.S. expanded sanctions. Western companies fled Russia, leaving behind facilities, goods and local staff.  You would think the Russian cryptocurrency mining market, long popular for cheap Siberian hydropower, would feel the heat, too. In April, one of the largest mining companies in Russia, BitRiver, was hit by U.S. sanctions.  That immediately affected BitRiver’s business: Compass, a U.S. mining company, ceased doing business with BitRiver and reportedly tried to sell the hardware it placed in BitRiver’s facility in Siberia. The machines got stuck in negotiations between the erstwhile partners. Then, Japanese bank SBI said it was out of Russia – meaning, out of BitRiver’s farm, as CoinDesk reported.  Read more: Sanctioned Bitcoin Mining Firm BitRiver Loses Another Client as SBI Leaves: Sources  However, no other Russian mining firms have been sanctioned so far, and clients from the EU and U.S. aren’t leaving in a panic – on the contrary, old clients have stayed and some new ones have come in, say people in the industry.  “Nothing changed. In crypto, people don’t care about these sanctions. Everyone who has been working here keeps working,” said Artem Eremin, CEO of Chilkoot, a mining hardware reseller.  The reason: Russia is still an attractive place for mining thanks to cheap electricity, even more so now when other previously popular jurisdictions have made life harder for miners. China outlawed mining last year. Kazakhstan cut off all power to mines for several months in early 2021 and increased energy costs for miners with a new tax this year.  “There is nowhere else to go,” Eremin said.  ‘No one’s leaving’  MEATEC, a German company, is operating a mining facility at a former abandoned factory in Irkutsk, one of the largest cities in Siberia. The firm currently has 110 megawatts (MW) of hosting capacity, of which 40 MW are unoccupied, and is looking to add another 60 MW before the end of this year, Dan Haas, MEATEC’s CEO and co-founder, told CoinDesk.  This capacity, comparable to BitRiver’s, is in high demand among clients from Germany, the U.K., the U.S., Canada, Iran, Japan, New Zealand and other countries as well as local Russian miners, said MEATEC’s head of foreign relations, Alexander Swid. Europe accounts for around 50% of the mix; Russia, up to 30%. The U.S. makes up about 10% and “a big request” for placement of specialized mining chips, known as ASICs, came from the U.S. recently, Haas said.  “No client is leaving,” Swid said. Even now – with the ruble stronger against the U.S. dollar than it was before the war and electricity prices (which are set in rubles) higher – Russia remains a preferable mining location, Swid said.  MEATEC started its mining business in 2017 in Austria, Haas said. However, electricity prices there were not attractive. Later, MEATEC partnered with a U.S.-based mining farm (neither Haas nor Swid would name it), but the collaboration was not satisfying, Haas said: according to him, the uptime on the facility was usually around 60% to 70%, meaning the hardware was running no more than 70% of time.  In 2017, MEATEC moved to Russia, repurposed the abandoned factory into a mining farm and signed a 65-year contract with Irkutskenergo, the local power grid company, according to Haas and Swid. For several years the company kept a low profile and didn’t do any marketing, so clients had to find MEATEC through word of mouth.  The reason miners from the U.S. and Europe are interested in MEATEC’s Siberian venue is that the local electricity grid has a lot of spare capacity. In the U.S., by contrast, the recent heat wave stretched power resources thin and miners had to unplug a few times, noted Tatiana Yakim, the chief financial officer of Summit Mining, an Ireland-based mining company working mostly with customers in France.  Read more: The End of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Gold Rush  Summit Mining’s business essentially started in Russia, Yakim told CoinDesk, when founder Mathieu Vincent asked her to help set up his mining equipment there in 2019. Now, Summit has hardware in the U.S., Canada and Iceland as well, but Russian farms in Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk still host 40% of the 20,000 machines the firm is operating worldwide, Yakim said. All the machines in Russia were purchased before the war started in February 2022, she said.  Expansion on hold  The news of the war and sanctions did not worry Summit’s clients, Yakim said: The matter hardly came up during Vincent’s weekly ask-me-anything (AMA) sessions. However, the firm decided to scrap a plan to build its own mining facility in Russia, which had been in the final stages of approval just this winter.  In early February, the company was about to invest 1 million euros (about US$1 million) in building its first mining farm in Russia, Yakim said. So far, Summit has been hosting its machines in venues owned by big Russian mining firms – she wouldn’t say which ones. But after the war started the project was shut down.  “It’s not clear how far the sanctions will go,” Yakim said. “If something goes wrong, it’s not clear how to get money out of Russia and back to our European company.” Now, Summit only considers expansion into the U.S. and Canada, Yakim added.  The main problem with Russia now is that no European bank will send money to a Russian company, Yakim said, even if the Russian company uses a bank not on any sanction list.  “If you’re a new miner in Europe and are trying to send money to Russia for the first time, your bank would ask questions [about] why you suddenly started doing business with Russia,” she said.  However, banks in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates continue to do business with their Russian counterparts, Yakim said. As for Summit, it has found a solution to send money to and from Russia through a bank outside of Europe, Yakim said, without naming the institution.  Ninety percent of Summit’s clients are French, Yakim said, mining mainly bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH mining machines are on sale now due to Ethereum’s switch to a different consensus protocol, proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work).  Scary precedent or nothing?  BitRiver was the first mining company to have the dubious honor of being listed on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list, and its case was different from other sanctioned crypto projects such as the over-the-counter (OTC) broker Suex, the Chatex exchange and non-custodial mixer Tornado Cash (all with Russian roots as well).  BitRiver was not accused of any wrongdoing, such as money laundering; the problem was that mining companies “help Russia monetize its natural resources,” according to an OFAC press release from April.  “The United States is committed to ensuring that no asset, no matter how complex, becomes a mechanism for the Putin regime to offset the impact of sanctions,” the document explained.  MEATEC took the news in stride: The company’s main legal entity, MEATEC LLC, is registered in the republic of Georgia, and the firm owns two companies registered in Russia, so “there is no risk,” Swid said.  “We are working with lawyers specializing in global sanctions and they said we’re not violating any sanction at the moment,” Yakim said.  These days, miners working in Russia are hiding their actual beneficial owners more often than they once did, Chilkoot’s Eremin said, but the demand for Russian mining farms stays high.  Some miners from the West left their equipment in Russia and quit, but others are sitting tight and continuing to mine, Nikita Vassev, founder of a popular mining conference in Russia, TerraCrypto, told CoinDesk.  Every four years, the Bitcoin network’s software reduces by 50% the amount of new bitcoin paid to miners for mining a block, making this business more challenging over time.  “Now it's an important time: only two years left before the next halving, and everyone understands they need to work hard to make some money before the rewards are cut in half,” Vassev said.  “Not a single client [from Europe and America] has left,” Sergey Arestov, co-founder of a Russian mining firm BitCluster, told CoinDesk, adding that Chinese clients, in the meantime, are as willing to mine in Russia as ever.  He acknowledged that purely pragmatic issues have arisen after the war started and sanctions were imposed on Russia. As the country became more isolated from the global financial system and payments to and from Russia became problematic, clients from the West stopped importing new mining equipment to Russian mining sites.  Plus, the extraordinarily high exchange rate of the Russian ruble against the greenback, combined with the low dollar price of bitcoin, makes mining in Russia less profitable, Arestov added. When the war started, some of BitCluster’s clients put on hold transporting their machines to Russia, but then, everything resumed as usual.  “People looked around, saw that the nuclear war didn’t start and got back to work,” Arestov said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/16/crypto-miners-from-us-eu-stay-put-in-russia-despite-war-sanctions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d772c5e935d225fea24c45ed8ebaaba7b16d0b0d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVK45,1663326216,"Ethereum Merge Has Tied Ether Futures Activity to Staking Yields, Traders Say","The Ethereum Merge, which happened on Thursday, has introduced several structural changes to the blockchain, promising to make it more environmentally friendly and reduce the supply of its native token ether (ETH).  According to traders, one consequence of the upgrade is that the activity in the futures market will now be closely tied to staking yields – rewards earned by locking ETH in the network in return for a chance to verify transactions under the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  The bigger the reward for staking, the greater the number of stakers and the stronger the demand for shorting or selling futures. That's because staked ether cannot be withdrawn before the next upgrade called Shanghai fork, due in mid-2023, and will earn rewards in ETH, which makes stakers vulnerable to potential ether price slides. Therefore, they will likely hedge their ETH exposure by selling futures contracts tied to ether.  ""Stakers have been and will be natural sellers in futures and perpetual futures. That's why open interest [number of open positions] is so high, and it will only grow if staking yields go higher,"" Zaheer Ebtikar, portfolio manager at crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, told CoinDesk.  Ethereum's network switched to the PoS system on Thursday after the PoS Beacon Chain launched in December 2020 merged with the Ethereum mainnet that used a proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism whereby miners solved algorithmic problems to validate transactions in return for rewards. In other words, stakers are new validators.  While the Merge has taken away substantial miner selling from the spot market, it could bring more sellers to the futures market and cap the basis or the difference between prices in futures and spot markets or perhaps push futures into backwardation.  Backwardation – a situation where futures trade at a discount to the spot price – is sometimes taken to represent weak institutional demand. Potential backwardation from increased staking, however, would probably mean anything but weak demand.  ""The futures curve could theoretically trade in backwardation for Ethereum going forward,"" Ebtikar noted.  Staking yield could keep ether futures in backwardation, according to Jeff Anderson, chief investment officer at a quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider Folkvang Trading.  ""It's basically two different stories. With bitcoin, it's far easier to just own futures for convenience (without having to worry about keys, etc.) and margin efficiency, and thus curve is in contango,"" Anderson told CoinDesk.  ""With ETH, staking yield is very attractive, which > [greater than] convenience yield and thus curve tends towards backwardation,"" Anderson added.  Staking is likely to pick up  More than 13.7 million ETH was locked in the so-called staking contract ahead of the Merge, according to data sourced from Glassnode.  That number will likely increase in the coming weeks as the decline in net ether issuance (inflation) brought on by the Merge, together with the fees paid to validators or stakers, will lift the so-called real staking yields, according to Daniel Chen, a partner at Sequoia Capital.  ""Post-Merge, real yields will match nominal yields as inflation goes to zero. In addition, miners will go away, so the fees they get paid directly to prioritize transactions (called 'tips') will now go to validators,"" Chen wrote in the Merge guide published on Tuesday. ""This is expected to increase real staking yields from ~0% pre-Merge to ~7% post-Merge.""  ""We expect an immediate increase in staking,"" Chen added.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/16/ethereum-merge-has-tied-ether-futures-activity-to-staking-yields-traders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4c5a253acfede39012d282e82fa00a50cf8cf434-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In March, the SEC said all U.S.-listed public companies that function as crypto custodians should account for their crypto exposure as liabilities instead of assets on their balance sheets and disclose risks associated with those liabilities to investors. The custody of crypto assets by lenders presents unique technological, legal and regulatory risks compared with other assets, the SEC guidance said.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the global standard setter for banking regulation, is planning to issue international rules for banks exposed to crypto, including strict capital requirements and exposure caps. The Basel committee's upcoming standards combined with the SEC guidance could drive U.S. banks further away from participating in digital-asset markets.  Accounting for crypto held on behalf of their clients as liabilities is particularly harsh on banks because they are required to hold cash to match liabilities on their balance sheets, according to the report published on Friday.  U.S. Bancorp (USB) told Reuters it was pausing the intake of new crypto clients until it evaluates the ""evolving regulatory environment,"" while investment bank BNY Mellon (BK) declined to comment on the status of its crypto projects.  An unnamed European bank looking to offer crypto custody services in the U.S. was quoted in the report as saying it would be ""prohibitively costly"" to do so under the new guidance.  Crypto custody specialist Anchorage Digital told Reuters that all banks working with the firm are ""now waiting on regulators before proceeding to work with Anchorage on crypto custody solutions.""

SmartBCH, a scaling tool for Bitcoin Cash, pointed out in a tweet that the network issues were likely the result of Ethereum PoW using the same Chain ID used by a SmartBCH testnet. Several confirmed the issue.  A Chain ID is a set of numbers used by the browser-based crypto wallet MetaMask to sign transactions for the network. An incorrect Chain ID causes transactions to fail because users aren't connected to the correct network, rendering a network unusable.  Meanwhile, the price of ETHW, the native token of Ethereum PoW, fell in the past 24 hours, likely because users received the new tokens and instantly sold them on the open market.

42373818,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVKFP,1663323338,El Salvador's Debt Rating Cut to CC by Fitch,"Seven months after lowering El Salvador's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR), Fitch Ratings has downgraded it again.  El Salvador, which made bitcoin (BTC) legal tender a year ago, was cut to CC from CCC by the ratings company, which said the country is likely to default on a bond maturity payment that's due at the start of 2023.  President Nayib Bukele, who said Thursday that he plans to run for another term, pushed for the adoption of bitcoin and has been adding the cryptocurrency to the country's reserves.  ""El Salvador's tight fiscal and external liquidity positions and extremely constrained market access amid high fiscal financing needs and a large USD800 million external bond maturity in January 2023 make default of some sort probable,"" Fitch said in a report on Thursday.  The country's adoption of bitcoin has limited its access to markets, hampering its ability to finance the bond repayment, Reuters reported in January, citing Moody's, another ratings agency.  “Policy differences related to the government’s embrace of bitcoin have lowered the probability that an IMF (International Monetary Fund) deal will be reached in time to address the government’s upcoming January 2023 $800 million bond maturity,” Moody's analysts wrote at the time, according to Reuters. The country has been negotiating a possible $1.3 billion loan with the IMF since March 2021.  To possibly curb speculation of a potential default, earlier this month, the country offered to buy back all external debt due from 2023 to 2025.  El Salvador made bitcoin a legal tender last September, and most of the bitcoin purchased by the country is now worth less than it paid.  In February, Fitch downgraded the country to CCC from B-, just weeks before the country was expected to start issuing its bitcoin bond. The $1 billion bitcoin bond, announced in November and scheduled for mid-March, still doesn't have a launch date.

42393941,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brdDOD,1663322400,Biden’s Executive Order Produces Few Answers in Crypto Reports From US Treasury,"Crypto firms have been eagerly awaiting a series of U.S. government reports they hoped would clarify what the Biden administration and regulators intend to do about digital assets. Most of the documents are out now, but the picture remains murky.  However, one aspect is becoming increasingly clear: the federal government sees a lot of potential risks in crypto, and the various agencies believe stepping up enforcement actions may be an important step.  The reports from the Treasury Department – three of them released Friday – largely recommend the government continue assessing crypto risks, keep up enforcement actions and push forward with work on a digital dollar (without recommending the U.S. should have one).  The White House Office of Science Technology and Policy likewise published a report assessing the technical aspects of a digital dollar, while the Commerce Department's report addressed competitiveness more broadly. The Justice Department said it would launch a ""Digital Asset Coordinator Network,"" a group of 150 federal prosecutors nationwide who would specialize in investigating and prosecuting crypto crimes.  ""The reports clearly identify the real challenges and risks from digital assets used for financial services,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told reporters in a briefing. ""If these risks are mitigated, digital assets and other emerging technologies could offer significant opportunities.""  The reports are a response to President Joe Biden’s executive order on digital assets, signed in March, which directed federal agencies to analyze different aspects and issues around the cryptocurrency ecosystem and provide recommendations for how the U.S. can both be a leader in the digital asset sector worldwide, as well as address any monetary stability or consumer protection risks posed by the burgeoning industry. Agencies will publish a total of 21 reports.  Previous reports – one from the Treasury Department, one from the Justice Department and one from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy – were published over the past few months. Treasury published three more reports on Friday, and the White House issued what it described as its “first-ever framework for responsible development of digital assets.”  Read more: Biden Issues Long-Awaited US Executive Order on Crypto  In a statement, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the different reports lay out concerns around consumer protections and illicit activities, and suggest how the administration can address these issues.  “Together, we are laying the groundwork for a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to mitigating digital assets’ acute risks and – where proven – harnessing their benefits. We remain committed to working with allies, partners, and the broader digital asset community to shape the future of this ecosystem,” the statement said.  After six months of study, the federal agencies made it clear that they're devoting a lot of attention to crypto, but they aren’t ready to declare a definite course of action. Still unanswered is the single biggest U.S. question in crypto: What makes a token a security, and which ones should be regulated as commodities?  Token issuers and trading platforms are hungry for an answer, and not knowing could bring costly enforcement actions as the industry continues to complain it’s navigating without a map. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler insists crypto businesses have a clear and simple map that leads through his agency’s doors.  Gensler repeatedly asserts that existing federal securities laws apply to the crypto industry, going so far as to tell a U.S. senator on Thursday that “the asset-backed securities market took 10 or 11 years where they did these … exemptive orders or relief to individual issuers,” implying that a similar process may need to occur in crypto first.  A senior administration official told reporters that the reports recommend regulators “issue new rules and guidance” to close gaps around how existing financial regulations apply to cryptocurrencies, but noted that the agencies are independent of the executive branch.  “The recommendation is for the agencies to review their rules, clarify, coordinate and I think that the view is just saying … they have the necessary authorities … for firms that are not complying,” the official said.  Digital dollars  On another titanic question for the industry – whether the U.S. will issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) – the reports offered some ideas and suggested the Federal Reserve “continue its ongoing CBDC research, experimentation and evaluation,” but federal officials concluded that no digital dollar should be created unless it’s found to be in the “national interest.”  Who decides what’s in the national interest? That’s not so clear. The Fed will have a definite say, because the central bank would be responsible for managing it. It may further require a decree from the administration, and Congress may also have to get involved. The answer could be steered by a future legal interpretation from the Justice Department, which is expected to outline the authorities the Federal Reserve needs before it can issue a digital dollar.  A senior administration official told CoinDesk that, in practical terms, the answer is all of the above. The Fed is independent but will collaborate on an answer with lawmakers, the administration and other federal agencies to decide the national interest.  Read more: US Treasury to Recommend Issuing Digital Dollar if in National Interest: Source  For their part, Fed officials including Chair Jerome Powell have said they don’t intend to press forward without agreement from both the White House and Congress. Meanwhile, the Treasury will lead a dedicated working group to coordinate the ongoing CBDC work, according to one of the reports.  Yellen, during the press briefing, said, “Right now, some aspects of our current payment system are too slow or too expensive. The report encourages us to continue working on innovations to promote a system that is more efficient and inclusive.”  One of the recommendations in that report is to advance CBDC policy and technical work, she said, though Yellen did not address how the government might make a decision to actually issue one.  The White House science office, in its own report, said it would form a research and development agenda with the National Science Foundation to further study CBDCs.  Other recommendations  When asked what other practical next steps the reports are suggesting, senior administration officials responded that they’re seeking a “redoubling” of investigations and enforcement efforts against the industry. Friday’s White House document pointed at the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The White House also emphasized that agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Trade Commission, two federal regulators that have not been as active as the earlier regulators in the crypto sector, should “redouble their efforts to monitor consumer complaints and to enforce against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices.”  The Treasury will also work on further reports – one to assess risks in decentralized finance (DeFi), due in February, and another looking into non-fungible tokens, due in July. But the next report that could carry significant weight is expected next month, detailing potential finance-stability risks from the crypto industry. While the Biden administration continues to study crypto and pursue “aggressive” enforcement, several efforts are underway in Congress to establish industry regulations. Many of them focus on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a central watchdog for crypto activity, though none of them are nearing completion as the current legislative session winds to a close at the end of the year. The bill that had the most momentum this year – a narrower effort to regulate stablecoins – has so far been stuck in committee negotiations.  Read more: US Fed Opens Pathway for Crypto Banks to Tap Central Banking System  The White House document suggested Biden could recommend a federal licensing or oversight regime for nonbank payment providers. One of the Treasury reports expanded on this, saying a payments regulatory structure would minimize risks but support these types of companies.  “Nonbanks are increasingly providing payment services, including issuing money (or money-like) liabilities and processing payments. On the one hand, participation by nonbank payments companies may contribute to higher levels of competition, inclusion, and innovation. On the other, if these firms are not adequately regulated and supervised, there may be risks to consumers, the financial system, and the broader economy,” one Treasury report said.  However, the report did not specify what this structure might look like. The crypto industry has long sought a federal regulatory regime that might allow crypto exchanges to apply for only one license that would allow them to operate nationwide, rather than have to apply for a money transmitter license in each state where they wish to operate.

42373810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVK7r,1663318171,ApeCoin's APE Could See Selling Pressure Ahead of Major Token Unlock,"ApeCoin’s APE tokens slid early Friday ahead of a token unlock over the weekend that will release more than 25 million tokens and add to selling pressure.  APE is the native token of the ApeCoin decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), a community-focused effort established to steer the growth and development of the Bored Ape ecosystem. The tokens were launched in March and airdropped to holders of the Bored Ape NFT (non-fungible token) lineup.  The 25 million tokens – representing 8% of ApeCoin’s current circulating supply – are part of a planned series of unlocks that will eventually lead to a final supply of 1 billion APE tokens, up from the current 314 million.  Of the 1 billion total supply, 62% belongs to the ecosystem fund, 16% to ApeCoin issuer Yuga Labs, 8% to Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) founders and 14% to independent launch contributors. The unlocks for Yuga and BAYC founders are scheduled for next March, and this weekend’s unlocks are part of the token supply earmarked for contributors.  Information on who these contributors are isn't publicly available, but crypto research firm Delphi Digital said in a Friday note that it was “reasonable to deduce that it includes investors such as a16z, Animoca Brands and FTX,” because those firms participated in funding rounds for Yuga Labs and supported the development of ApeCoin DAO.  “The million-dollar question is whether these launch contributors will sell their tokens once released,” Delphi analysts added. “This will lead to significant sell pressure on $APE.”  APE traded at $4.80 during Asian morning hours, down 6.5% in the past 24 hours, even as the prices of other major cryptocurrencies were mostly flat. The APE tokens have lost 21% of their value in the past month, even as bitcoin and ether remained range-bound.  But despite the upcoming unlock, some analysts pointed out that ApeCoin staking – which would allow holders to borrow cryptocurrencies against their Bored Ape NFTs – is likely to act as a fundamental catalyst in the coming months.  “The upcoming staking feature will be the much-needed boost that will remind investors of the essence of the coin: Which is to create value for everyone in the Bored Ape ecosystem,” Chris Esparza, founder of Vault Finance, said in a Telegram message.  “ApeCoin holders can be sure of the fact that another viable income stream is set to be launched, this would undoubtedly revitalize the interest in the token and lead to accumulation,” Esparza added.  Horizen Labs, the company selected by the ApeCoin DAO to build the staking product, confirmed in July that development was underway and that its team was aiming to release the product this fall.",NEGATIVE,APE,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | APE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/09/16/apecoins-ape-could-see-selling-pressure-ahead-of-major-token-unlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b544ba3ff0d0ce5717b1c59e11165ee648b90e5b-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
