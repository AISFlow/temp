42402701,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVVC,1553640471,Grin Cryptocurrency to Discuss Change to Mining Difficulty Schedule,"The open-source developers behind the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Grin are discussing potential changes to the project's mining difficulty schedule.  Specifically, those developing the code for the project are looking to potentially adjust what goes into an upcoming Grin hard fork. However, the effects of this possible adjustment would not be seen until 2021.  Prominent Grin developer John Tromp, who invented the proof-of-work mining algorithm ""Cuckoo Cycle,"" suggested changes to what will go into the next hard fork currently set for mid-July during a bi-weekly Grin Governance meeting Tuesday. He also proposed that the matter be put to a vote during the next Grin Governance meeting in two week's time.  Tromp argued in conversation with other developers:  “The announcement of single chip ASICs for [Cuckatoo-31] has undermined our phase out schedule... which looks like it won’t be able to serve its original intended purpose of thwarting single chip ASICs in the foreseeable future.”  Stepping back, ASICs are expensive, specialized hardware devices designed to optimize earnings for a specific mining algorithm. Developers think it's bad that ASICs have come to dominate many cryptocurrencies since they view manufacturers as a centralizing force in what's supposed to be a more open competition.  When Grin started off, its developers aimed to prevent ASIC manufacturers from gaining an advantage over others on the network, attempting to promote healthy competition with manufacturers of GPUs, which are less expensive to purchase and run. To keep ASICs at bay, Grin developers agreed to hard fork the network every six months and tweak the mining algorithm slightly for a period of two years.  As such, developers agreed that over time the network would gradually transition to an explicitly “ASIC-friendly” variant of Tromp's Cuckoo Cycle called ""Cuckatoo31+."" This would give ample time for many ASIC manufacturers to optimize for this algorithm and hopefully ensure a broad network of miners.  But this might not be going as planned. At present, roughly 81 percent of Grin blocks are being mined using the ASIC-resistant variant of Tromp’s Cuckoo Cycle called ""Cuckaroo29."" The other 19 percent of blocks are mined using Cuckatoo31+, according to Grin ASIC manufacturer Obelisk CEO David Vorick.  In a phase referred to in Tromp's statements today as the ""Cuckatoo-31,"" this ratio continues to gradually decline. As developer Daniel Lehnberg estimates in today's meeting, Cuckatoo-31 is expected to end August 19 of next year. The following phase – Cuckatoo-32 – will result in a total of 55 percent of Grin blocks mined using Cuckatoo31+. Thereafter, the beginning of Cuckatoo-33 in 2023 marks the phase transitioning to a fully Cuckatoo31+ mined Grin network.  However, this current schedule might lead to problems. Both Tromp and Vorick argue that the present schedule needs to be delayed. If not, Vorick maintains that “it will almost guarantee there will be an [ASIC] monopoly at [Cuckatoo-32],” which is exactly what the Grin developers were trying to prevent.  Vorick told CoinDesk:  “We’ve demonstrated with our single-chip [Cuckatoo-31] miner that multi-chip designs are not competitive, and if the phase-out is not delayed, we will be producing a [Cuckatoo-32] single-chip design as well.”  Calls to action  This Cuckatoo-32 design “will be expensive and difficult [to build] and will make competing very difficult,"" Vorick adds.  “We believe that the mining ecosystem for Grin would be better if it stayed at [Cuckatoo-31], where costs are lower and it's easier for new competitors to get involved,” said Vorick to CoinDesk.  In light of this information, Tromp proposes:  “Any change to [Cuckatoo31+] cannot take effect until at least 18 months into the future, unless agreed upon by all affected parties.”  “I’m proposing to proceed with more caution, to take a wait and see approach,” said Tromp. “But also to keep our commitment for the next 18 months as ASIC manufacturers must be able to rely on that for investment decisions.”  Writing on a public Grin forum, Vorick shared his concerns about the phased hard fork roadmap. He explained that while other mining hardware manufacturers ""are not upfront about the nature of their hardware,"" his motivation for disclosing the matter came down to Obelisk wanting ""give the community all the information it needs to make informed decisions.""  ""We really would like to see Grin [succeed] and we would like to do so by collaborating with the Grin community and letting them know what's going on before it happens,"" wrote Vorick. ""We're looking forward to your thoughts and discussion.""

The article has been corrected to reflect that the potential change would only affect what goes into one of the hard forks.",NEUTRAL,없음,MINING | FORKS,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/26/grin-cryptocurrency-to-discuss-change-to-mining-difficulty-schedule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee9bb97ed6bf06decc6ca68e8edef094cf1f35f5-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402705,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVXA,1553632203,From Law to Lawlessness: Bits of the Untold QuadrigaCX Story,"Christine Duhaime, BA, JD, CAMS, practices law with Duhaime Law in Vancouver.      Many of the stories being told about the early operation of the digital currency exchange, QuadrigaCX, are based more on fiction than fact.  How do I know? I know because in 2015, I was Quadriga Fintech Solutions Corp.'s regulatory attorney, hired to help its securities attorney in Canada draft a statutory prospectus.  But here’s the thing, and I’m not embarrassed to say it, our firm was terminated after six months. We were terminated because QuadrigaCX executed a management hard fork overnight, which started the company down a path of lawlessness. When I say lawlessness, I mean it solely and only in the regulatory sense.  Before we get into that, let me dispel some myths about QuadrigaCX.  Our firm agreed to act for QuadrigaCX because it was subject to the oversight of several regulatory agencies across Canada. It was registered with FINTRAC, Canada’s FinCEN, and subject to compliance examinations, which are akin to the examinations the IRS conducts on U.S. exchanges with MSB registration; it was a reporting issuer in two Canadian provinces and subject to the oversight of two securities regulators, which is akin to being subject to two SECs supervising its activities; and it was registering in the province of Quebec for anti-money-laundering purposes with that province’s securities regulator.  Not only that, QuadrigaCX had cold storage insurance over its customers’ digital currencies. This was 2015, and if you were in the space back then, you know what a feat it was to secure cold storage insurance for a digital currency exchange.  I believe it may have been the first exchange in the world to have cold storage insurance.  QuadrigaCX had, at that time, four different law firms advising it on different matters, two national law firms and two specialized firms, ourselves included. It had a public chartered accountant who prepared financial statements of all its bitcoin trades, its finances and customer holdings. And it also had an independent auditor from an accounting firm and it had audited financial statements.  In 2015, it was pretty much unheard-of for a digital currency exchange to have an auditor and to prepare audited financial statements that it made available to the public. It was more transparent than many exchanges today.  Early days  Back then, QuadrigaCX wanted to launch a blockchain R&D lab and while it barely got off the ground, it did create one project – a refugee payments app that was operational to tackle financial inclusion that would allow the UN and refugees to process payments in bitcoin in areas where banking was inaccessible.  I personally, on my own time and in my personal capacity, jumped in to help QuadrigaCX with that tech because financial inclusion was important to me, as it is important to most digital currency exchanges. I believe QuadrigaCX was the first exchange in the world to launch an R&D lab, and probably the first to develop payments tech for bitcoin acceptance for financial inclusion.  QuadrigaCX’s vision back then was to be the first listed, regulated exchange in the world and dominate the market with superior, self-managing technology. They walked away from the former goal, but considering that, long after my time, they grew to 350,000 customers managed by four employees with a platform built in 2014, they certainly succeeded with the latter, becoming Canada’s largest exchange by a wide margin.  No story of QuadrigaCX is complete without understanding one more fact – six months before we were retained, it had gone through a court-approved plan of arrangement and become three companies, and as a result, it inherited a slew of new shareholders it knew nothing about. (A fourth company was later set up.)  It is my belief that the whole QuadrigaCX team came to believe that the company may have unwittingly become involved in a Vancouver pump-and-dump scheme. Whether it had been drawn into a pump-and-dump is not for me to say because it was before my time, but I can say that QuadrigaCX was run by tech geeks, who were competitive, ambitious and smart but who were unfamiliar with the capital markets ecosystem in Vancouver.  The shareholder question  The QuadrigaCX story has other weird twists.  Our law firm, for example, was recently the target of an extortion event. What happened was that a person demanded, at the beginning of the ongoing creditor protection case in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, that we give them privileged and confidential information of QuadrigaCX, failing which they would defame us on social media, cause harm to our firm and file a false criminal report against our law firm to law enforcement.  We did not, obviously, give privileged information to strangers but as a result of the extortion of our firm, other people who have relevant information and key documents that could assist with the court process, are now not willing to come forward and be seen as being associated with QuadrigaCX.  I think we all can understand the angst of the loss of our funds, and our firm is one of the larger stakeholders with over $100,000 owed, but I think it’s worth remembering that we’re not each other’s enemy in this process.  If you’ve guessed by now that it’s not accurate, as has been stated, that there are no QuadrigaCX records or documents, you’d be right. There are voluminous records in British Columbia, including court records, accounting records, audited financial statements, bank records, records of contracts, trading volume records, and importantly, records of the cold storage insurance that was still in force a year after our firm exited the client relationship, and still may be.  No party to the proceedings reached out to ask us for the records of QuadrigaCX in our possession, so we wrote to QuadrigaCX’s attorney to let them know what documents we have to assist with the process, and offered to make them available.  People have spilled a lot of ink writing about the shareholders of QuadrigaCX. It is not accurate that there are three QuadrigaCX companies – there are four and therefore, there are four sets of shareholders. It is true that QuadrigaCX re-purchased and canceled much of its issued and outstanding shares up until early 2016.  There were few shareholders left by the time we exited in early 2016, and the shareholder lists publicly available do not appear to be up-to-date. Three shareholders have recently told me that they have never received notice of any annual general meetings and didn’t receive so much as a $1 dividend from QuadrigaCX in three years, despite how profitable it appears to have been.  If that is true, it means shareholders may not have been allowed to vote on QuadrigaCX matters or vote on the direction of the company.  Decisions made  The QuadrigaCX story is by no means over but our bit of the story ended abruptly one morning when its CEO, Gerald Cotten, made the decision that he no longer wanted QuadrigaCX to be a listed company.  On that day, he terminated the professionals that were, in his mind, the ""law and order"" folks – the accountant, the auditor and me, the regulatory attorney.  From that moment onwards, Mr. Cotten solely took over QuadrigaCX and operated the exchange as if it had no investors, no shareholders, no regulatory agencies and no law that applied to it – no corporate law, no securities law, no anti-money-laundering law and no contract law. I don’t know why Mr. Cotten decided to eschew regulatory law but I never spoke with him after that day. (In January of this year, QuadrigaCX announced he had died a month earlier.)  Like everyone else, there are a lot of other things I don’t know about QuadrigaCX – I don’t know if there is $137 million parked in a few wallets; I don’t know why the bitcoin addresses that were supposed to be holding $92.3 million turned up empty; I don't know why the wallet address holding $44.7 million of other cryptos can’t be disclosed; I don’t know why no law firm has applied for a Mareva injunction to preserve assets; I don’t know why the litigation is in Nova Scotia when British Columbia Courts have jurisdiction and the witnesses and evidence are in British Columbia; I don’t know why there are statements that there are no records; and I don’t know why the shareholders haven’t tokenized the exchange and made it operational so that customers can start to recover some of their assets.  But I do know this – I’m glad we were let go by QuadrigaCX for being one of the ""law and order"" folks.  Our legacy with QuadrigaCX covered the period of time when it was as regulated as it was possible to be regulated in Canada in 2015 for a digital currency exchange, when it had Canadian bank accounts and audited financial statements and when customers were protected with cold storage wallet insurance.  Let me end on this note – I didn’t want to write this article but I did it because customer assets held by exchanges must be subject to greater regulation and oversight, and unless we improve the accuracy of the available information by hearing from those who have factual knowledge of QuadrigaCX, to understand what allowed QuadrigaCX to be both heavily regulated yet at the same time to resile from that regulation, we won’t be able to fix gaps, restore consumer trust and move the industry forward.

42402709,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVg1,1553616029,Staking Startup Claims 'Up to 30%' Returns for Just Holding Crypto,"Blockchain staking-as-a-service startup Battlestar Capital says customers can earn a return of “up to 30 percent” annually on their idle cryptocurrency holdings.  Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Tuesday, Battlestar said that it has partnered with cryptocurrency lending startup Celsius Network to launch a large-scale staking service that provides the potentially high returns. While the announcement did not provide a lower guide for the estimated returns, its website currently states that returns could also be as low as five percent annually via its staking service.  Individuals and funds who do not have expertise or time to manage the day-to-day tasks of staking – supporting a proof-of-stake (PoS) network by holding its token and getting rewards in return – would benefit from the service, Battlestar said, as it protects investors' holdings, as well as providing portfolio yield.  “Most custody players sidestep staking, and most staking agencies avoid custody because of the risks. Battlestar strategically combines both under one roof,” said Meltem Demirors, an advisor to the company.  Battlestar Capital CEO Adam Carver said:  “After bitcoin['s] significant 85 per cent price drop, investors looked to diversify their portfolio through staking other coins. PoS coins [have] emerged as a profitable avenue for investors – including bitcoin maximalists – to gain sizeable yield with their passive holdings.”  Celsius Network aims to add “at least five” more PoS coins (likely tezos, zcoin, decred, horizen and cardano) to its existing 17 crypto assets “over the next three months,” according to a statement.  “Battlestar makes hosting masternodes, like Zcoin’s Znodes, more accessible,” said Zcoin’s chief operating officer, Reuben Yap. “One of their unique features is the use of a secure MPC [multi-party computation] key solution, which fragments a private key and stores its pieces separately to eliminate the risk of a single entry point.""  Battlestar said it has been privately participating in PoS networks since December 2017 when its founders developed a series of algorithms to optimize staking rewards.  UPDATE (March 26, 19:35 UTC): A sentence in an earlier version of this article misdescribed the return users can earn with the Battlestar service. It is a block reward for staking coins, not interest. The passage has been corrected.

The country’s Financial Service Agency (FSA) announced the news Monday, stating that the new exchange, Rakuten Wallet, is now registered with the Kanto Local Financial Bureau as a virtual currency exchange service provider under the country’s Payment Service Act. Rakuten also confirmed the news in a separate statement.  Rakuten Wallet is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rakuten and replaces an exchange called Everybody’s Bitcoin Inc. that it acquired for $2.4 million last August.  The firm rebranded the exchange offering to Rakuten Wallet on March 1. In its announcement, Rakuten also said it is ceasing the older service at the end of this month and that users can sign up for the new Rakuten Wallet service from April.  The firm also said Everybody’s Bitcoin had been operating as a ""deemed” cryptocurrency exchange provider since its launch in March 2017, having applied for a license at the time. The firm received a business improvement order from the Kanto bureau last spring, and has ""officially restructured"" its management system and upgraded internal systems in order to receive the license for the rebooted entity.  The FSA at the same time issued a license to another exchange called DeCurret, which says it will provide spot trading of four cryptocurrencies from April 16 in Japan. New accounts start opening from March 27. DeCurret’s shareholders include notable firms such as MUFG Bank, Nomura Holdings, Internet Initiative Japan Inc., Daiwa Securities Group and the Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, among others.  In January, the FSA also granted license to Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck, which suffered a $530 million hack early last year.

IdentityMind announced on Tuesday that it has partnered with Binance to “improve existing data protection and compliance measures” for the exchange’s global operations.  IdentityMind provides cryptocurrency exchanges a “real-time” platform to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations worldwide to prevent fraud, according to the announcement. The startup helps cryptocurrency exchanges with client onboarding, transaction monitoring and case management solution.  IdentityMind CEO and president Garrett Gafke said:  “Our risk and compliance platform powered by a patented digital identities engine meet the scale demands of Binance’s global operations while providing a highly accurate system for assessing any global risk factors from outside entities for transactions.""  The news appears to indicate a shifting stance from Binance, which has previously avoided the strict compliance route chosen by other top exchanges such as Coinbase.  Binance’s KYC processes are “the industry’s least rigorous,” said a report from Bloomberg last year. Users only need an email address to open trading accounts with the exchange, the report said, adding that this “level of anonymity” makes it hard to track money laundering and market manipulation.  Since then, however, Binance has been making efforts to raise its compliance game. Back in October, the exchange partnered with cryptocurrency compliance and investigation software provider Chainalysis to monitor cryptocurrency transactions in real-time and potentially avoid any criminal or illicit activity.  It also, the following month, collaborated with Refinitiv, formerly the financial and risk business division of Thomson Reuters, for an automated KYC solution.

42402727,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVZ8,1553603438,TrueUSD Stablecoin Holders Can Get 'Up to 8%' Interest Via CredEarn,"Holders of the dollar-pegged stablecoin TrueUSD can now leverage their funds to generate returns under a new partnership between the token's developer TrustToken and crypto lender Cred.  The deal will enable TUSD holders take part in the CredEarn program, which pays back interest for loans of digital assets to Cred's platform. Within the U.S., TUSD holders in 29 states can participate in the program.  David Steinrueck, marketing and communications manager with TrustToken, told CoinDesk that individuals who send their funds to Cred can earn ""up to 8 percent"" in annualized returns.  Under the terms of the partnership, TrueUSD holders must transfer their tokens to a CredEarn wallet for a minimum six-month commitment. They will earn interest quarterly, and can renew their accounts for three months after their initial term expires.  ""The reason that we say 'up to' is that at the current time … legally, we can’t say guaranteed … because it is an investment,"" Steinrueck explained. ""If you lock your funds in here, you’ll get an 8 percent return, you’re locked into that rate and after a 6-month rate or quarterly [you get your return].""  CredEarn will, in turn, lend the assets to miners, investment funds, retail investors and other digital asset companies ""on a guaranteed and collateralized basis,"" though it will not lend to short-sellers. Returns from these entities will be passed on to holders.  Steinrueck likened the feature to a bank account or a certificate of deposit (CD) investment (a comparison he later rescinded), saying:  ""I would say that ... there’s definitely risks and you’re taking out some risks because it’s an investment, but there’s not a scenario here where they’ll say ‘oh we’re only giving you 7 percent or 5 percent,’ you’re locked in. So the risk the consumer is evaluating is ‘do the people who stand behind these assets [have] insurance … do we trust those people to generate those returns and evaluate their consumers and load process accurately?'""  As such, he added, any risks from a consumer standpoint would be evaluating the companies participating in providing the accounts.  Uphold, BitGo, Bittrex and Ledger are acting as custody providers for the funds sent to CredEarn, according to a press release. BitGo will provide insurance on customer assets up to $100 million through its separate partnership with Lloyd's of London. The firm noted that BitGo Inc., and BitGo Trust Company would custody different assets separately, but assets will be insured either way.  The new CredEarn offering sounds similar to BlockFi, another crypto lending startup which announced a crypto deposit account at the beginning of this month. The company said users would be able to earn 6.2 percent interest on their holdings annually, though it later cut this figure for its institutional investors.  BlockFi said it has already taken in more than $35 million for the deposit accounts, with $25 million coming in the first two weeks after the accounts were announced.  UPDATE (March 26, 20:00 UTC): After publication, TrustToken's marketing manager said he misspoke when he compared CredEarn to a bank account or CD. The relevant passage has been amended.

42402704,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdcVa7,1553601637,Louis Vuitton Owner LVMH Is Launching a Blockchain to Track Luxury Goods,"Luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, owner of the iconic Louis Vuitton label, is preparing to launch a blockchain for proving the authenticity of high-priced goods, CoinDesk has learned.  Code-named AURA, the cryptographic provenance platform is expected to go live in May or June with Louis Vuitton and another LVMH brand, Parfums Christian Dior. It will then be extended to LVMH ‘s other 60-plus luxury brands, and eventually those of its competitors.  LVMH has enlisted a full-time blockchain team who have been in stealth mode for over a year, working closely with ethereum design studio ConsenSys and Microsoft Azure, according to two people familiar with the project.  AURA has been built using a permissioned version of the ethereum blockchain called Quorum, which is focused on data privacy and was developed by JPMorgan.  Neither LVMH nor its partners ConsenSys and Microsoft would comment ahead of the project's official launch. But a source involved in the build told CoinDesk:  “To begin with AURA will provide proof of authenticity of luxury items and trace their origins from raw materials to point of sale and beyond to used-goods markets. The next phase of the platform will explore protection of creative intellectual property, exclusive offers and events for each brands' customers, as well as anti-ad fraud.”  White label  Stepping back, LVMH controls over 60 luxury brands including many well-known names like Dior, Dom Pérignon and Hublot. The group reported revenues of $53 billion in 2018.  But it’s not the first to propose an authenticity-tracking blockchain; there have been other luxury provenance platforms and mini consortia, such as Arianee or Vechain.  According to the source involved in the project, LVMH questioned why it would allow third parties to position themselves between its brands and their partners – especially since blockchain is supposed to be a technology for eliminating intermediaries.  The source added:  “This should be done in the form of an industry consortium rather than a third party actor coming into the marketplace.”  As such, LVMH intends to offer the service in a white-label form to other brands including the group’s competitors. So rather than creating an app of some kind, AURA will run behind the brands using it.  “So if you are a customer of a luxury brand, you are not going to see AURA; you are going to see the Louis Vuitton app or the app of another luxury brand,” the source explained.  Equal footing  This all sounds great – in theory. But it can be tricky getting your competitors onto a blockchain platform, particularly if you happen to be as big and influential as LVMH.  To avoid the sort of problems experienced by the blockchain venture between IBM and Maersk, LVMH will donate all intellectual property (IP) to a separate entity and that entity, in turn, will be owned by the participating brands, said the source, who added,  “So Gucci, for example, could decide to join the platform and be a shareholder – in which case their claim to the IP would be as great as Louis Vuitton's claim to the IP. That is the main difference between this project and the IBM Maersk project, which hopefully makes it much more comparable to Komgo, the trade finance consortium.”  In addition, Quorum’s data privacy tools should ensure that no information will be leaked between brands or their customers.  Further facilitating cooperation among firms, the project is very much in line with luxury-goods industry standards, the source said, and particularly with the recent anti-counterfeiting efforts of the European Union Intellectual Property Office.  Beyond CryptoKitties  It’s not surprising LVMH chose an enterprise variety of ethereum since it’s the blockchain which gave birth to the ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) standard. This allows for digital representations which are not only immutable but provide a hallmark of a one-and-only, unique item.  While the most famous example of NFTs is the whimsical game CryptoKitties, this kind of token has serious business potential.  For example, it could conceivably identify an individual handbag and trace the whole journey of its lifecycle from an alligator farm to the store where it was sold for the first time, and then the multiple chains of owners that have owned and sold it.  Another fundamental reason LVMH chose ethereum is that the group sees today’s permissioned version as merely an intermediate step to a grander vision, once the technology matures, said the source, adding,  “They [LVMH] see down the line permissioned and public networks as needing to be interoperable if they are to put the power back to customers. It’s also a way for a global network of distributors and resellers to connect to a network without restriction.”    Louis Vuitton store image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/26/louis-vuitton-owner-lvmh-is-launching-a-blockchain-to-track-luxury-goods,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f9bc1ba04560039b02f49eb48aba4274e60b8dc7-1500x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430335,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGZh,1553598024,Bitcoin Probes Key Price Support Below $3.9K After Range Breakdown,"View  Bitcoin fell below $3,920 yesterday, as expected, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. As a result, the crucial support of the 30-day moving average, currently at $3,883, could be breached in the next day or two.  A break below the 30-day MA, if confirmed, would strengthen the case for a deeper drop toward the key support levels lined up at $3,775 and $3,658.  A strong bounce from the 30-day MA would weaken the bearish case. That said, a UTC close above $4,055 is needed to revive the bullish view.  Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive after briefly falling below $3,900 at around 07:00 UTC this morning.  The cryptocurrency fell to a 10-day low of $3,850 on Monday, confirming a downside break of the recent trading range of $3,920–$4,055. Further, BTC closed (UTC) yesterday below $3,920, reinforcing the bearish outside reversal candle created on March 21.  The repeated failure to scale $4,000 in a convincing manner followed by the drop below $3,920 validates the bearish view put forward by the historically strong resistance of the downward sloping 21-week moving average (MA).  As a result, the cryptocurrency risks falling below the 30-day MA, currently flatlined at $3,883, in the short-term. Notably, that average has put brakes on the sell-off at least three times in the last three weeks. Hence, a break below $3,883 could further strengthen the bear grip around the cryptocurrency.  The bearish case, however, would weaken if the price bounces up strongly from the 30-day line.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,906 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.73 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  4-hour and daily charts        As seen on the 4-hour chart, BTC has found acceptance below the 100-candle MA support, having dived out of the sideways channel yesterday.  While the 200-candle MA has held ground in the last 12 hours, its repeated defense has failed to produce a stronger bounce – a sign that bullish sentiment has waned. Validating that argument is the fact that the major averages (50, 100 and 200) have shed bullish bias (are flatlined).  On the daily chart, BTC has breached the ascending trendline and the 5- and 10-candle MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating yesterday's bearish close below $3,920.  Hence, both the 200-candle MA on the 4-hour chart and the 30-day MA, currently at $3,888 and $3,883, respectively, could take up the role of resistance in the next 24 hours.  3-day chart  The previous three-day candle closed below $3,920 – the low of the preceding doji candle – confirming a bearish reversal. As a result, the path of least resistance appears to be on the downside.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42430345,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGnh,1553592046,The RadicalxChange Movement's Crypto-Cypherpunk Appeal,"Vitalik Buterin, Zooko Wilcox, Simon de la Rouviere, Santiago Siri – all are prominent leaders in the blockchain technology sector who regularly attend and speak at conferences around the world.  In this way, the RadicalxChange Conference in Detroit this weekend might not have seemed different than the many crypto conferences globally, but if its lineup bore similarities, the conversations did not. In place of discussions of crypto theory were serious talks on the social change needed to bring about and maximize the technology and its possible benefits.  It should be noted, however, that RadicalxChange was also not a ""crypto conference.""  Put on by the RadicalxChange Foundation, this weekend’s event was rather the first mass gathering of individuals inspired by Glen Weyl and Eric Posner’s 2018 book “Radical Markets,"" published by Princeton University Press.  “It struck a chord and found resonance with many people,” noted Jeff Lee-Yaw, executive director of the RadicalxChange Foundation in the event's opening address. ""[The book showed us that] we can reinvent institutions to fix problems like inequality, that we can find a way to build a more prosperous world.”  It's this message that has seemed to resonate with those building new economies on cryptocurrencies and blockchains, as noted by Buterin in his keynote address.  There, the creator of ethereum explained his belief that movements to reinvent social order for the betterment of society at large are not unlike what certain communities in the blockchain and crypto space have been trying to do since the advent of bitcoin in 2009.  Buterin spoke at length about the similarities and differences between the cypherpunk movement and RadicalxChange movement, telling the audience:  “In general, there’s an interest in making the world better, a kind of idealism, an excitement about new ideas, and a commitment to not just thinking and talking but actively doing and experimenting and really many other commonalities.”  To this, newly appointed co-leader of the RadicalxChange Foundation and advisor to cryptocurrency investment firm Amentum, Matt Prewitt, couldn’t agree more.  “The connection is obvious in my mind,” said Prewitt to CoinDesk. “I got interested in ethereum and cryptocurrency because they are new tools for collaboration and collective action. It’s that kind of vision of more distributed power centers that attracted me to blockchain that I see [in RadicalxChange.]”  Giving life to ideas  Other speakers included director of growth at blockchain identity platform uPort Joshua Shane, Ethereum Foundation research fellow Eva Beylin, head of growth for crypto governance startup Commonwealth Labs Thom Ivy and co-founder of blockchain-backed cloud computing registry Wireline Lucas Geiger appear to agree.  Several RadicalxChange chapters across the U.S. were actually founded by those who otherwise work on blockchain projects. Joshua Shane in Seattle and Thom Ivy in Detroit are just two examples.  What’s more, many of the ideas being espoused by the RadicalxChange movement are being tested and experimented on blockchains.  Former developer for ConsenSys and founder of ethereum-based music software service Ujo Simon de la Rouviere launched last Thursday a blockchain art project implementing a version of the Harberger Tax promoted in the ""Radical Markets"" book.  The digital art piece is perpetually on sale and can be transferred to the hands of a higher bidder at any given moment in time. However, the owner of the piece must pay a 5 percent tax per annum on the price of that item.  “It would present some form of subsistence for the artist and some reasonable amount of knowledge of cash flow for the artist to continue creating more art,” Rouviere told CoinDesk.  Since launch, the art piece has changed hands three times and currently is worth 888 ETH or roughly $120,000. Still, Rouviere emphasized to CoinDesk that it was still too early to tell whether this method of art sale could be deemed entirely effective or not.  The point is, however, that the design for experimentation was inspired by ""Radical Markets.""  “When I read the book, I saw that a lot of the ideas could help the arts. I’ve always been a creator and the startups I’ve created have always been for creators,” said Rouviere.  This is by no means the only example of blockchain enthusiasts taking the ideas suggested in Weyl and Posner’s book to heart.  Another such idea experimented on by open-source bounties platform Gitcoin since as early as February is Capital-constrained Liberal Radicalism (CLR). CLR is based on a separate idea called quadratic voting presented in ""Radical Markets"" and iterated on in a paper written by Buterin, Weyl, and Harvard PhD student Zoë Hitzig.  In essence, the CLR mechanism suggests a way by which to optimally distribute a public goods fund such that fund distribution is “credibly mutual and not biased towards specific organizations,” as explained by Buterin in a past interview with Unchained podcast host Laura Shin.  The first CLR experiment hosted by Gitcoin distributed a total of $38,242 across 26 different projects in the ethereum space. As specified in a blog post, over 130 different individuals participated in this experiment.  It has since encouraged future rounds of CLR matching on Gitcoin, as well as greater interest in the ethereum community for inflation funding mechanisms such as the one proposed in ethereum improvement proposal 1789.  Ethereum Foundation research fellow Eva Beylin told CoinDesk:  “We’ve definitely had conversations with people adjacent to EF grants and even other kinds of grant programs like MolochDAO about the potential for them to experiment [with CLR].”  ‘A natural set of allies’  To some extent, it could be argued that such experimentation and interest by folks at least within the ethereum community is due to the close collaboration and friendship between founder of ethereum Vitalik Buterin and author of ""Radical Markets,"" Glen Weyl.  But on a broader level, Joshua Shane, head of growth at ConsenSys-backed identity startup uPort, pointed out in a panel discussion that the crypto community in general “is much more open to new systems and much more open to changing the mechanisms of how we approach the world in ways the general population is not.”  “As such, they’re a natural set of allies,” Shane said during the panel. “Within a blockchain environment, you have a completely coherent economy and so you can reproduce a lot of the things experimentally that would otherwise happen in a perhaps damaging way out in the broader world.”  Ethereum especially is a blockchain “friendlier” to developers who seek to design such novel and untested applications, highlighted Rouviere to CoinDesk.  Even outside of being a testing grounds for ideas, Buterin argues the characteristics of blockchain as a distributed ledger has merits that can and most likely will in the future be helpful to implementing certain RadicalxChange ideas within society.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Buterin said:  “I see a lot of things like quadratic voting, Harberger tax and auctions, all of these systems as being based on top of blockchain because they’re just a convenient platform to do it.”  The main ‘wedge’ between the two  At the same time, there are key limitations and unanswered questions for blockchain both as a technology and social movement that Buterin noted creates a “wedge” between the two communities.  The main one is on the matter of identity. “Identity systems have a mix of different functions,” explained Buterin to CoinDesk.  On one hand, these systems would have to be able to associate ownership and action to a particular agent. Blockchain networks do this in a variety of ways as it relates to verifying the private keys of wallet addresses holding cryptocurrencies to a particular user.  “One other [function] is basically identifying between distinct people, between 10,000 real people and 10,000 sock puppets,” said Buterin. “The third kind of identity problem that I care about and that people don’t talk about as much is formalizing membership in communities.”  Buterin asked:  “How do you measure consensus? Is there a consensus for ProgPoW? Is there a consensus for fund recovery? Is there a consensus for implementing storage rent?”  All very real and contentious topics on the ethereum blockchain at present, Buterin concluded that building a multi-faceted identity system on a blockchain is very difficult and has not been solved yet.  And this is because the right data structure for a system of decentralized identity is fundamentally not on a blockchain, argues Weyl.  “The right data structure I increasingly think which [Microsoft researcher Nicole Immorlica] presented on is what I call an intersectional social data structure,” said Weyl to CoinDesk.  He elaborated:  “If you think about your mother's date of birth that's also your mother's date of birth and it's your grandmother's date of birth of her first child. So there's already a whole bunch of people for which that is an independently important piece of information. That's true about pretty much everything about you.”  As such, a data structure flexible in design to host silos of personal data that are as Weyl puts “relational” and connected to many other stores of data in his mind would be a greater step in the right direction for building improved identity systems than a blockchain.  “The thing is the blockchain creates this polarization between the global chain and your private key. I think that is the fundamentally wrong primitive. I think the right primitive is a network or sort of overlapping community-based primitive,” said Weyl.  Differences in value  And while Buterin maintains that “blockchains can definitely be part of identity systems” in some capacity, both Buterin and Weyl recognize stark differences in the way identity systems are valued broadly within the blockchain movement and the RadicalxChange movement.  “There’s too much of an obsession with privacy,” said Weyl to CoinDesk about the majority of people in the blockchain space. “Many have this notion of ‘I’m going to own my own data. I’m going to be able to sell it to whoever I want to sell it to.’”  Weyl argues:  “The problem with this is that it neglects a whole bunch of things that are important from the RadicalxChange perspective which is that almost any data about you is data about other people. So, should you be able to freely, independently totally just on your own sell it?”  Even on the matter of decentralization as a value, Weyl calls it a “mistake” to associate the term with individualism because in his view “individualism and extreme centralization are actually two sides of the same coin.”  “It’s the diversity of different collective organizations given that collective organization is necessary what I would call decentralization,” said Weyl.  In essence, Weyl maintains that at present “there’s no notion of an individual human being on a blockchain” and without formalizing human beings, the system is “fundamentally broken.”  Differences in organization  What's more from an organizational standpoint, Weyl hopes to make a clear distinction between the way these two movements have started and will continue to progress.  ""If you think about the ratio of people who became random billionaires to actual things [in the blockchain space] that are going on on the ground, it's totally different between blockchain and RadicalxChange,"" said Weyl. ""There's no people getting wildly wealthy off of RadicalxChange, but there is actual social change happening.  And while many in the blockchain space are focusing on achieving greater levels of adoption, Weyl argues that adoption is not at the forefront of the RadicalxChange agenda.  He told CoinDesk:  ""This stuff is moving faster than I would have hoped that it would have moved. I don't think the problem at this point is getting adoption. The problem is making sure that it happens at a pace that allows us to understand the flaws of the system and improve upon them.""  As such, from a technology and value-based standpoint, both Weyl and Buterin see differences that cause the blockchain movement and RadicalxChange movement to diverge.  “There’s some synergy between the two [movements] but it comes from different perspectives,” noted Rouviere to CoinDesk.  Despite differences, both movements, according to uPort’s Joshua Shane, are “calls to action” that possess highly similar cultures of experimentation and “reimagining how systems work in a plastic way.”  It is ultimately this mixed spirit of disenfranchisement and eagerness to find better solutions that makes these two communities align towards similar – not identical – goals.  Ethereum Foundation’s Eva Beylin told CoinDesk:  “Everyone’s a little disenfranchised from not only incumbents like banks but the incumbent ways of achieving objectives. All of these are very new ways of doing things so why not try them?’""  Vitalik Buterin image via Christine Kim for CoinDesk  Correction: Matt Prewitt in addition to being co-lead at the RadicalxChange Foundation is also an advisor at Amentum.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/26/the-radicalxchange-movements-crypto-cypherpunk-appeal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8567a70bf134329b778f9f2e74f4c1b2bd018f2a-1500x985.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Reddit user posted the news on Saturday, saying that, while Twitch had allowed users to pay in bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) through blockchain payments processor Bitpay, the option has been removed in the last couple of weeks “for all countries.”  A tweet from Twitch dating from last January does indicate that bitcoin at least was one of the accepted payment options, among other methods including Amazon Pay and Apple Pay:  Its terms and conditions currently state that the firm accepts ""major credit cards, certain debit cards, PayPal, various payment methods through Xsolla and/or such other payment methods we may make available to you from time-to-time through our site, as forms of payment.""  Another Redditor said they had sometimes used BCH as a payment option for subscriptions, but with Twitch removing the option, they have canceled all subscriptions and notified the firm.  While cryptocurrencies have been widely touted as having a strong potential role in online payments, issues such as price volatility have sometimes frustrated the best intentions of merchants attempting to offer the option.  Microsoft, for example, suspended bitcoin payments on its store last January, citing ""instability."" They were later reinstated, however.  Online gaming platform Steam also dropped its bitcoin payments feature in late 2017, citing chronic problems with the cryptocurrency’s high transaction fees and volatile price.

42430338,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrGdh,1553568139,Crypto Mining Giant Bitmain's IPO Application Has Officially Expired,"Cryptocurrency mining equipment maker Bitmain’s application for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) has officially lapsed, meaning no such transaction is happening anytime soon.  According to an update on the HKEX’s website, Bitmain’s case has been moved to a group of “inactive” applications and is now labeled as lapsed, six months after the company filed the prospectus on Sept 26.  If it still wishes to pursue a listing, Bitmain can re-file the application, but the company would be required to provide additional financial records beyond what was included in its initial filing.  According to a listing rule from the HKEX, “the latest financial period reported on by the reporting accountants for a new applicant must not have ended more than six months from the date of the listing documents."" However, the last public filing from Bitmain only covers the period ending June 30, 2018, nearly nine months ago.  The application drew wide attention last fall as Bitmain disclosed eye-popping profit growth over the past several years. For instance, just for the first half of 2018, the mining giant brought home a net profit of nearly $1 billion, after having made over $1 billion for all of 2017.  Despite such rapid growth in the bottom line, reflecting the surging cryptocurrency market of 2017, the HKEX was hesitant to approve applications from Bitmain and its mining rivals Canaan Creative and Ebang, due to the industry's volatility.  Indeed, in line with the market slump of 2018, Bitmain suffered a loss of about $500 million in the third quarter of last year.  It’s unclear at the moment whether Bitmain is contemplating another attempt any time soon to go public. The company published an announcement on Tuesday stating:  ""Bitmain’s listing application to HKex in September 2018 has reached its 6-month expiration date. ... We will restart the listing application work at an appropriate time in the future.""  The company also confirmed in the same announcement that its co-founders Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan have stepped down as co-CEOs. Haichao Wang, previously a director of product engineering at Bitmain, was officially appointed Bitmain’s CEO, months after news report said a management shakeup was in the works.  But if it does not find another way to go public, the company may be on the hook to repay more than $700 million to its venture capital investors.  $700 million redeemable  As of June 30, 2018, Bitmain had a $715 million liability on its balance sheet labeled “redeemable, convertible and preferred shares,” resulting from its Series A and Series B funding rounds closed over the past two years. This amount accounted for nearly half the company's total liabilities at the time.  According to the company's IPO prospectus, the terms Bitmain agreed to with these investors included a redemption clause, which gives shareholders the right to require Bitmain to redeem or repurchase all or part of their shares if either one of two events happens.  One such situation is ""neither a qualified [REDACTED] nor a qualified trade sale defined in the terms has occurred by the fifth anniversary of the preferred shares’ issue date,"" the document says. The other is the occurrence of a breach by the company or its controlling shareholders that has a ""material adverse effect"" on the firm's overall businesses and ""has not been cured within 30 days as defined in the terms.""  Shirley Wang, a partner at the law firm of Baker McKenzie FenXun with expertise in debt capital markets, said such redemption clauses are a common and typical way to protect investors and it's not unusual for investors to initiate a redemption procedure. But the conditions under which redemption rights can be exercised vary from deal to deal, she added.  While it's unclear what exact type of event was redacted from the passage in Bitmain's prospectus, a clue can be found in a term sheet for Bitmain's B+ round, in which the firm raised $440 million.  According to a copy of that document obtained by CoinDesk, investors have the right to redeem all or part of the B+ preferred shares at any time after the earlier of:  ""i) 5 years from the closing date (if no qualified IPO), or ii) upon any breach by any Group company or any founder parties of the terms of the transaction documents in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby which amounts of a material adverse effect and is not cured within 30 days."" [Emphasis added]  Under such conditions, Series B+ round investors could require Bitmain to redeem the shares in an amount equal to the purchase price plus ""all declared and unpaid dividends"" and ""an assumed 10% compounded"" annual return for each year such shares are outstanding from the closing date, less any amount received by the investors.  This term sheet further specified what a qualified IPO means for Bitmain's B+ round investors, stating:  ""Qualified IPO is defined as an underwritten public offering of ordinary shares of the Company at a public offering price per share (prior to underwriting commissions and expenses) that values the Company at least US$18 billion in an offering of not less than $500 million).""  Although the amount of money Bitmain intended to raise from the IPO was also redacted from the HKEx prospectus, documents obtained by CoinDesk last summer indicated the proceeds would have been as high as $18 billion at a market capitalization of $40 to $50 billion.
