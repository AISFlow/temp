42377977,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LjAp,1423262774,Bitcoin Panel Seeks New Take on Regulation at New Jersey Hearing,"A group of nine business owners and legal experts pitched a panel of New Jersey legislators this week on why they should make the Garden State a hub for bitcoin development.  To get there, the panel urged, would require creating an environment in which digital currency developers, startups and ideas could flourish without the risk of onerous financial rules stifling innovation.  The 5th February hearing was hosted by the New Jersey Legislature's Assembly Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee. Among the topics discussed were the multi-signature wallet technology, the nature of transaction verification and coin creation, and the general state of bitcoin regulation in the US today.  Echoing a number of US regulators, legislators asked about Mt Gox and how the failed bitcoin exchange’s mistakes can be prevented in the future; and the BitLicense proposal, of which the New York Department of Financial Services’ released a revised draft version this week, was invoked as a cautionary tale for how to not regulate cryptocurrency.  Also mentioned were the potential rewards for New Jersey should the state roll out the proverbial welcome mat for digital currency, including job growth, tax revenue and the chance to play home to an experimental yet fast-growing economy.  New York-based attorney and Blockchain global policy counsel Marco Santori pointed to the growth of capital investment in digital currency companies during the hearing, telling legislators:  “That is a lot of money that could be spent creating New Jersey jobs, leasing New Jersey office space, leasing New Jersey apartments, buying meals from New Jersey restaurants and paying New Jersey taxes, and employing New Jersey residents.”  “But right now, all that money is being spent in California and New York,” Santori added.  Potentials of bitcoin explored  Those present at the hearing pushed lawmakers to bring regulatory clarity to the US digital currency ecosystem, at the risk of pushing that development – and the possible rewards thereof – out of the country. Speakers at the event included New York Law School professor and Coin Center fellow Houman Shadab, CoinComply managing director Brian Stoeckert, Ziftr CEO Robert Wilkins and Coinware general counsel Quentin Page.  Coin Center director Jerry Brito offered his organization’s assistance to the panel in the future, and called for clarity on how either new laws or existing statutes will apply to businesses in the space, saying:  “This technology, again – we don’t know where it’s going. But there are many positive uses, and we want to make sure those can meet their potential.”  Brito fielded a number of technical questions from legislators, and notably defended the industry during discussions of Mt Gox by saying that developers and stakeholders are working to prevent a similar collapse – and the ensuing fallout – from taking place again.  Santori suggested that legislators could create financial incentives, including tax breaks and business grants, to entice developers and investors to New Jersey. He cautioned against using a framework like the BitLicense, urging lawmakers to create a flexible environment that welcomes digital currency businesses instead of turning them away.  “Digital currency entrepreneurs are building this economy, and I ask that you give them good reason to build it here in New Jersey,” he said.  Regulation today  Legislators asked the panel about the risks for consumers and businesses when using bitcoin and how regulation has developed in the United States thus far.  ItBit  CEO Charles Cascarilla told the committee that businesses that use digital currency should be judged on a case-by-case basis owing to fact that, with bitcoin, there are both financial and non-financial uses of the technology.  “It comes down to: how are you using bitcoin?” Cascarilla explained. “If you’re moving a practically worthless amount of bitcoin, you probably shouldn’t have any real regulation.”  TeraExchange  co-founder and president Leonard Nuara, joined by CEO Christian Martin, told the committee that their New Jersey-based company has long operated under the jurisdiction of US regulators. They suggested that federally-regulated exchanges that handle bitcoin can offer tools to help people hedge against price volatility, a topic discussed numerous times during the hearing.  One legislator asked about the maximum coin supply and how the price and bitcoin-denominated financial instruments might be impacted when all of the coins are in circulation.  “In the first instance, it’ll be the year 2140 – so I may not have to worry about that,” Nuara joked, drawing laughter.

42377968,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LiyF,1423258533,Industry: BitLicense Revision Leaves Room for Continued Debate,"New York’s bid to become the first state with a dedicated regulatory regime for the digital currency industry took a step forward this week when the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) published an updated draft of its BitLicense proposal.  While only released on 4th February, the digital currency industry is already beginning to develop a loose consensus on the revisions and their potential impact.  Overall, the community lauded the NYDFS for its willingness to incorporate feedback from those who provided comment, even if there was an equally strong belief that some parts of the regulation remain unclear and onerous.  Non-profit research firm Coin Center has to date released the lengthiest public response to the latest proposal, and was perhaps most indicative of this centrist view. Coin Center praised the agency even as it critiqued its approach to conditional licenses and mandated that those who want to issue digital currency will fall under its scope.  Authors Jerry Brito and Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote:  ”NYDFS has shown a willingness to embrace criticism that should be celebrated by the bitcoin community. This new draft clearly indicates that the many comments submitted in the previous comment period were reviewed and considered.”  Despite challenges ahead, there was a sense from the business community that the BitLicense debate is nearing completion and that this will spur interest and growth for the industry, even if there are likely to be disagreements that arise in the coming 30-day comment period.  The more critical view was perhaps best characterized by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, whose bitcoin services startup has raised $26m in two public rounds.  “Throughout the document, there remain an enormous number of clauses that leave issues open ended and to be decided at the discretion of the superintendent,” he argued. “This lack of specificity and open-ended review will create an environment which discourages innovation and instead focuses on risk mitigation.”  Allaire’s criticisms came even despite his belief that the revision includes a number of “significant and important changes”, and that upon its passage, bitcoin will take an important step on the road toward being integrated with the wider financial system.  This more optimistic outlook was echoed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs behind New York-based digital currency exchange Gemini.  “The revisions demonstrate New York’s commitment to being the center of the financial world – both for fiat and digital currency,"" the brothers told CoinDesk.  Boon for non-financial bitcoin technologies  Perhaps most notable was the inclusion of a previously announced exemption for startups that are using bitcoin’s decentralized ledger, the blockchain, as well as the ledgers of other protocols, for non-financial means.  The addition of this provision was cited by a number industry members, including Allaire and the Winklevosses, but was of particular focus for crypto 2.0 companies, the sector most concerned with these applications.  Taariq Lewis, CEO of bitcoin and gold trading platform DigitalTangible, told CoinDesk he was “comforted” by the fact that software distribution is exempt from the current proposal.  “We're still digesting, but believe this clause allows companies like DigitalTangible to avoid licensing requirements by building more software tools,” he said.  Tim Swanson, business development head at digital asset exchange Melotic, however, suggested his opinion that the definition of “software” still remains vague.  Such an interpretation would put New York in line with the growing global consensus that non-financial blockchain applications require less oversight, a development that could potentially push more investors to consider the sector as its growth continues in 2015.  Business burdens remain  While noting that “important improvements” were made, Allaire critiqued the most recent revision for its failure to remove potentially onerous mandates that he argued will restrict the competitiveness of startups.  In particular, Allaire took aim at the requirement that licensees receive permission to introduce all new products and features.  “This cuts deeply against the grain of agile, Internet-based software innovation, and is nearly inconceivable,” Allaire said. “Internet technology companies deploy new features into products on a daily or weekly basis, responding to immediate customer and market demands.”  The latest revision did allow for digital currency startups to ask the NYDFS if certain changes need to be reviewed, but Allaire suggests that such oversight be limited to certain “highly specific” changes.  Such a take was seconded by Bitcoin Foundation board member candidate and Bitcoin Embassy director Francis Pouliot, a resident of Canada who spoke to the proposal's broad reach. Pouliot said that US bitcoin companies should push for bitcoin to be regulated under existing law.  “Compliance with existing laws is crucial for the bitcoin industry to obtain legitimacy, but such new rules and requirements will certainly reduce New York's potential to be a leader in cryptocurrency innovation,” he said.  In current form, Pouliot suggested, the proposal would do much to convince startups to head to “more friendly jurisdictions” outside the US.  At least one respondent provided evidence of this response, with Coinkite’s Rodolfo Novak telling CoinDesk:  ""It seems that it was toned down, but it is still absurd to ask a startup [for] $265,000 to register in all states. Happy to be in Canada.""  Verdict still out  Still, while the community applauded the willingness of the NYDFS to make changes, others were unimpressed by what they characterized as slight revisions given the scope of the critical feedback the department received.  “None of these changes address the structural flaws that many industry members, such as Coinbase, addressed in the comments they submitted,” Andrew Ittleman, founder and partner of Fuerst Ittleman David & Joseph, PL, told CoinDesk. “If anything, subject to a few exceptions, NYDFS has doubled down.”  Other respondents were positive in their remarks, while suggesting that more in-depth reading needs to be done before decisions can be reached.  This take was put forth by Perianne Boring, president of US bitcoin advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce, who indicated her opinion is perhaps still being formulated.  “The NYDFS clearly listened to many of the community's concerns and was very responsive in addressing some of the identified issues. We are continuing to analyze the proposal and look forward to providing comments to the NYDFS,” Boring said.  In yet another sign opinion is still being formulated, many individual companies contacted for comment did not return responses at press time.

42377972,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lj21,1423249503,VICE Tours a Bitcoin Mine in China,"A detailed exploration of a bitcoin mine in Dalian, a major city in the north-east of mainland China, has been published by VICE's technology title Motherboard.  The facility is called the No. 1 Bitcoin Mine. It contains 3,000 miners and costs $80,000 a month for 1,250 kW of electricity to keep them running, according to the film. It's located in the Changcheng area, in the waterfront Lushunkou district.  The mine appears to be cooled by huge industrial fans mounted on the walls of the building. According to Motherboard, a ""persistent, deafening buzz"" emanates from the fans in the hot summer months, where temperatures hit 27 degrees celsius.  Jin Xin said he is one of four shareholders who own and operate the mine. The group, described as ""secretive"" by Motherboard, operates five other sites. This one mines 20 to 25 bitcoins a day, although it was producing 100 coins a day at its peak.  The mine manager likens bitcoin's current state of development to its eventual role as the ""the currency of the future""; to China's own transition from a cash-based economy to a debit and credit-card based one.

42377974,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lj5n,1423241766,Comparison Site Seeks to Boost Bitcoin Remittances in Latin America,"A new price comparison site hopes to boost bitcoin remittances in Latin America by placing traditional and digital currency-based services side by side.      Mondome, which has already partnered with exchanges such as Bitso, MexBT and Ripio, has been designed to let people understand bitcoin's benefits by letting them to compare it with other existing payment methods.      Pelle Braendgaard, co-founder at Mondome, said:      “Bitcoin is clearly a great technology for remittances. However, for most people there are no alternatives to the two or three remittance companies you see signs for every day on the street.”              “If bitcoin is going to change this”, he added, “we need to first of all show normal, non-technical people in immigrant populations around the world the benefits there are.”      In practice, users are able to input source and destination countries and an amount to be remitted and Mondome will bring up a dynamic list of search results. Users will even be able to see bitcoin entries move up and down the list in real time as its price fluctuates.      The technological process was ""a bit more complex than we first thought we would need"", said Braendgaard, adding:      ""It turns out that it is a very complex multi-step procedure. We have to somehow combine different exchanges and their various supported payment methods and compare them with the apparent simplicity of traditional remittance.""              Even though it originally set out to be ""a simple search engine, it is actually a lot closer to the flight search engines such as Sabre and Amadeus rather than Yelp or Airbnb"", he explained.      Mondome officially entered beta on Tuesday.    Need for education    Braendgaard, who is based in Nicaragua, said that “there is a lot of interest [in bitcoin] but the problem in most countries in the region is the lack of exchanges”.      There is still a need for education about bitcoin in Latin America, he said, adding that ""the people who could most benefit from it are the ones least likely to know about it"".      Braendgaard believes that there are “many opportunities” in South America, and that that the region has “some of the largest and most competitive remittance corridors in the world”.      He continued:      “There are also many remittance corridors that people outside the region don’t know about. Some of them such as Costa Rica–Nicaragua and Panama–Colombia are fairly well serviced, but other important ones like Argentina–Paraguay are extremely expensive.""              Long-term plans      Competing against ""actual top money transmitters such as Western Union"", Braendgaard said that he would like to add all possible exchanges, but explains that ""there is development work and considerable research every time we add one"".      Mondome is planning to integrate additional features and expand its English version to North America and Europe in March. Eventually, the team also hopes to add support for other cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple.      The service has already partnered with Coinbase in Europe and North America. Braendgaard said: ""When picking exchanges we are specifically prioritising based on ease of use and signup for people in our target communities"".",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/06/comparison-site-seeks-to-boost-bitcoin-remittances-in-latin-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f25234f96cb22f0ea69599408ca1d35072adc68a-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lj3H,1423222054,"Payments Processor ChainPay Launches to Challenge Coinbase, BitPay","A bootstrapped startup in the Isle of Man has launched a payment processor called ChainPay that it hopes will compete with the likes of BitPay and Coinbase in the European market.  The firm, called AltXE, says it is focused on signing up European merchants to use its payment processor and that its fee schedule and personal attention to customers will distinguish it from its much better funded competitors.  ""If you sign up with Coinbase you might be just another merchant in their box. If you sign up with us, we'll be engaged with the merchant, making sure that everything is functioning well,"" said AltXE co-founder James Carter.  Customer benefits  Carter also pointed to his firm's fee schedule as another possible benefit to customers. ChainPayhttps://chainpay.com/features/ takes 1% of every transaction and offers bitcoin exchange rates from Kraken or Bitstamp, depending on which provides the better rate any given time.  ChainPay also imposes a lower withdrawal limit on merchants for GBP than BitPay, for example. Merchants can withdraw as little as £500 from ChainPay, but must withdraw at least double that amount at BitPay.  However, BitPay's limit for euro withdrawals is just €20 euros, while ChainPay's is €400.  Carter acknowledged that his firm couldn't beat incumbents on many measures because it lacks their high levels of VC investment and processes fewer transactions. Coinbase has raised $106m to date, making it the world's best funded bitcoin startup. BitPay has raised $32m in venture capital so far.  Carter said his firm has signed up a handful of merchants since launching at the end of January and that some of those merchants are pleased with the results so far.  Exceeding expectations  One of ChainPay's first merchant customers was SWR Auto Design, a Manchester-based designer and manufacturer of after-market automobile body kits.  SWR has already completed two sales in bitcoin, for full body-kits for a Ford Focus and a Ford Fiesta. The kits cost upwards of £700 each.  The firm's director, Stewart Wilson, said : ""It's more than we expected, which is good.""  Wilson said he signed up with ChainPay because he has followed bitcoin's development over the last three years and wanted to reduce his dependancy on banks and card issuers.  ""We want to get away from the banks. They run our lives. The main thing is encouraging a fairer form of money in the future,"" he said.  For ChainPay's Carter, the processor's launch is a long-awaited milestone. He and co-founder Chris Wood were on the verge of launching the business when its payment services provider, Capital Treasury Services, announced that it was cutting ties with its bitcoin clients due to pressure from the banks it worked with.  Original launch delayed  Plans for ChainPay were thrown into confusion after the CTS announcement. Carter and Wood had planned to announce the launch at the Crypto Valley Summit, an inaugural confab for cryptocurrency businesses on the Isle of Man. Instead, they were left wondering if they would be able to launch the business at all.  ""The plan was to tell people about it today. We were going to come here and tell everyone we were ready to go. But CTS has pulled out and it has been really disappointing,"" Carter said at the time.  Now ChainPay has its banking relationships set up, although Carter would not name the bank involved. He said the Isle of Man connection has been crucial to obtaining banking facilities for his startup.  Carter, who used to work on enterprise software at Barclays and Credit Suisse, says he envisions adding the ability to broker bitcoins through ChainPay, just as Coinbase does. For now, though, he must make his personal funds stretch far enough for future plans to materialise.  ""I'm funding ChainPay myself, so we've got a reasonable amount of runway. We can do the next 12 months,"" he said.
