Those coins circulating at least once in the last three years are at a loss of nearly 31.11%. Top holders have moved off nearly 52.5% of their holdings. Average stakeholders may be continually accumulating LINKs. Investment Thesis Though the Chainlink (LINK-USD) project has been finely developed by its core team, it has not been massively adopted by the crypto community during this bear market. In the meantime, some top holders may be distributing their holdings while the network value is relatively low. This may cause the short-term volatility in the trading price of LINK. How The Chainlink Network Has Developed One of the fundamental aspects of cryptocurrency projects is the development process as it shows how the developer team and its community engage in the project. Looking at the metric of ChainLink development activity, it measures the pure contribution to the project conducted by the developer community. It only counts the real update that itself affected the project building on github and excludes all development-unrelated substances. This metric suggests that the core team has continually enhanced the project in spite of the recent bear market. Development activity has been heightened over time as the core team keeps engaged in Chainlink. (Santiment) Besides, the metric of Dev contributors count, which is the sum of total events and activity on github that relates to the project, has gradually increased. Therefore, the Chainlink developer community is generally thriving during this bear market. Development activity contributors count has gradually increased as the Chainlink community is close-knit. (Santiment) Although the sum count of contents that mention Chainlink related terms has increased, the number of new addresses being created on a daily basis has gradually decreased since the May 2021 peak. It indicates that there are not many new users interested and participating in the Chainlink despite the increasing social media discussion and promotion. This may not be good for the network because new users can make a huge contribution to the network growth. The total number of documents mentioning Link related terms have increased during this bear market. (Santiment) The speed of the network growth is relatively low as not many new users have adopted Chainlink. (Santiment) Top Holders Might Have Sold Off Their LINKs While the network has not grown, top holders might have sold off when they just moved nearly 52.5% of their holdings out of their wallets. This is largely attributed to the wallet addresses with the balance from 10,000,000 LINKs. The total number of coins held by top addresses has recently dropped roughly 52.5%. (Santiment) The number of coins held by top exchange addresses has recently dropped about 35.25 millions LINKs. (Santiment) The number of coins held by top non-exchange addresses has recently dropped around 290 millions LINKs. (Santiment) The number of wallet addresses with the balance from 10,000,000 LINKs have plunged recently (Santiment) The Network Activity Is Not Heightened In addition, the network activity is not heightened as the number of daily active addresses -the total number of sender and receiver addresses- has declined since the market top in May 2021. It is normal during bear markets when users are not actively transacting their coins over the network, clearly shown in the transaction volume. As shown in the aforementioned sections, both these data of the network activity have recently increased because top holders have moved off their coins but not due to the network growth. The number of daily active addresses in a downtrend since May 2021 makes the network value relatively low. (Messari) The amount of transactions has recently surged after a downtrend since May 2021. (Messari) The Network's Value Is Relatively Low Meanwhile, the ratio of daily on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss shows the ratio of those coins that move in profit to those coins that move in loss on a daily basis. Its value has been in a downtrend since May 2021, which possibly causes short-term holders to sell at a loss. It can make the network healthy in the long term but volatile in the short term as most coins being sold in loss is a good sign for the reversal pattern. There are more coins that move in loss than that move in profit. (Santiment) The worst thing that makes the network look bad is that the value of the 3-year MVRV ratio is at 31.11, which means all coins that moved at least once in the past three years are at a loss of about 31.11%. Nonetheless, it suggests that the Chainlink network is relatively undervalued in the long term until the saturation point appears wherein holders already sell most of their coins in loss, that is, the reversal zone. Those coins that have circulated at least once in the last three years are at a loss of nearly 31.11%. (Santiment) Historically, the annualized standard-deviation of daily returns over a specific interval of time has been highly correlated to the LINK's price for over the past year. This indicator shows that a volatility in the value of the LINK network should be expected in the next short-term price movement. The volatility indicator suggests that LINK's price is in the locally overbought zone. (Messari) Regarding the investment return, the LINK's price has been strongly correlated to its Sharp ratio's value for over the last year. At the moment, this metric is likely to form a local peak, which suggests that the network is locally overvalued. The Sharp ratio suggests that the network is locally overvalued. (Messari) In particular, the realized market capitalization is like the traditional market capitalization, but the formula is calculated based on the price of each UTXO when it was last moved instead of its current trading price. This metric has recently spiked which can be assumed from top holders' movement as mentioned above. However, the LINK's price does not fluctuate so does its market capitalization, that is not normal. Historically, the LINK's value should have spiked with the realized market capitalization, but this time was different. It is suspicious that this can lead to the short-term volatility. The unusual spike in realized marketcap can cause a volatility in price. (Messari) No Accumulative Selling Pressure From Retail Investors The major concern is that the liquid supply of Link reserved on exchanges has risen since the peak of May 2021. This may increase the potential selling pressure over the marketplace. The increasing supply of LINK on exchanges since May 2021 may build up the selling pressure. (CryptoQuant) However, the amount of transactions that involve daily deposit addresses of centralized exchanges has been in a downtrend since May 2021. It shows that there could be no increasing selling pressure from retail traders. Transactions depositing LINK to exchanges have decreased, reducing the selling pressure on exchanges. (Santiment) Average Whales May Be Slightly Accumulating LINKs Additionally, the amount of transactions associated with daily withdrawal addresses of centralized exchanges has been volatile since May 2021. It suggests that there may be a slight accumulation among stakeholders because the aforementioned network growth's data shows that not many new users have adopted the Chainlink network. Withdrawal transactions from exchanges are volatile indicating some may be purchasing LINKs. (Santiment) Last but not least, a good sign for long-term holders is that both the total number of addresses holding from 100 to 10,000,000 LINKs and the total number of all tokens of all addresses holding from 100 to 10,000,000 LINKs have overall moved upward since the early 2022. It means that average whales are slightly accumulating more LINKs during the first half of 2022. The total number of addresses holding 100-10,000,000 LINKs has increased since the early 2022. (Santiment) The total number of all tokens of all addresses holding 100-10,000,000 LINKs has increased since the early 2022. (Santiment) Conclusion In summary, it can be seen that not many new users have adopted the Chainlink network since May 2021 in contrast to the high discussion on social media platforms, and this trend may continue as the crypto community is still skeptical about the bear market. Although many stakeholders are continually accumulating LINKs as the network is undervalued, some giant whales are possibly distributing their holdings, which likely causes the short-term volatility.",NEUTRAL,LINK,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4525430-chainlink-top-holders-might-have-moved-off-holdings-while-network-is-undervalued?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/365202.jpeg

Bitcoin Funding Rate Has Been At A Positive Value During The Last Few Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current funding rate suggests that the price is in a new decline right now. The “funding rate” is an indicator that measures the periodic fee that traders in the Bitcoin futures market have to pay each other. When the value of this metric is above zero, it means long traders are currently paying a premium to the short traders to keep their positions. Such values indicate that a bullish sentiment is more dominant in the market at the moment. Related Reading | On-Chain Data: Bitcoin Whales With 10k+ BTC Have Been Growing On the other hand, negative values of the indicator imply the majority sentiment is bearish right now as shorts are paying longs currently. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin funding rates over the last six months: The value of the metric seems to have been positive in the past week | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, whenever the Bitcoin funding rate has reached a relatively high positive value during the last few months, the price of the crypto has generally observed a decline not too long after. Similarly, negative spikes have resulted in the value of BTC seeing some uptrend. Here’s what’s going on here: high positive values mean longs are piling up in the market. So, a significant enough sudden decline can liquidate a lot of these, which can end up driving the price further down, and thus liquidating even more long positions. Such an event where liquidations cascade together is called a “squeeze” (or in this case, a long squeeze). Related Reading | Bitcoin NUPL Shows Average Holder Back In Profit, But For How Long?

42411447,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNlnn,1658674200,Accounting Rules Make the Outcome of Tesla’s Bitcoin Sale Unclear,"“The only thing that’s certain is death and taxes.” This idiom may be overused, but adding a third item to that list is usually pretty clever.  For example, my editor would probably say: “The only thing that’s certain is death, taxes and a lot of misplaced commas that I have to edit out.” My personal favorite use comes from The Roots’ Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter’s freestyle where he says: “The only thing for sure is taxes, death and trouble.”  This week we’ll dive into the less-commonly used version of this phrase: “The only thing that’s certain is death, taxes and a whole bunch of off-base accounting rules governing the treatment of digital assets on corporate balance sheets leading to a misrepresentation of corporate earnings.”  That’s right, we’re talking about U.S. accounting rules this week. And right on cue, Tesla announced last Wednesday that it sold 75% of its bitcoin in the second quarter. So let’s dive in.  That (and maybe more …) below.  – George Kaloudis  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Regrettably, we will first have to dive into the story everyone was squawking about on Wednesday so that we can cleanly set up a transition to our main accounting topic. That story is Tesla selling $936 million worth of bitcoin (BTC), which made up roughly 75% of its holdings.  Even more regrettably, I am sorta kinda coming to the defense of Tesla. Corporations are people too!  So it goes.  'I might pump, but I don’t dump'  Unlike what most of the internet wants you to believe, Tesla did not “paper hand” the bitcoin it bought last year for a loss. From Tesla’s second quarter earnings call:  “Additionally, we converted a majority of our bitcoin holdings to fiat for a realized gain offset by impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the [income statement].”  Not sure if you realize this, but a realized gain means Tesla realized a gain. And to realize a gain, you have to sell something for more than you bought it for. Otherwise, it would be a realized loss.  And when you realize that it made those sales sometime between April and June 2022, that’s when it gets a little interesting. For context, here is the price of bitcoin from April 1 to June 30, 2022  Bitcoin opened the quarter trading around $45,000 and ended it below $20,000. Somewhere in there, amid a lot of selling, is Tesla unloading some ~30,000 BTC. Also featured in this timeframe is the Luna Foundation Guard selling ~80,000 BTC during the UST/LUNA death spiral. That’s a lot of liquidity for the bitcoin market to soak up, and while it did cede 58% of its market capitalization, it didn’t cede 100% of it (a low bar, I know, but still).  Before we can dive into accounting rules, we need to highlight why Tesla sold any of its bitcoin at all. From the same earnings call:  “We were uncertain when the COVID lockdowns in China would alleviate so we sold bitcoin to bolster our cash position.”  Tesla’s most recent bitcoin sale is certainly not a critique of bitcoin. When Tesla sold some bitcoin last April it did so to “test liquidity.” Now, in the second quarter, when it needed cash, there was ample liquidity to supply that cash. So even though bitcoin was referred to as a “sideshow to a sideshow” on the call, Tesla’s CEO added that “we are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in the future.”  Tesla isn’t in the bitcoin business, and neither are most companies. But hey, bitcoin can sit on balance sheets and act as a treasury asset for cash management if these companies so choose. Part of cash management means moving in and out of different assets as the needs of the business evolve.  Tesla, and other companies, will be back for more in due time.  Those off-base accounting rules governing digital assets  I promised to cover some off-base accounting rules, so I will because they’re somewhat important. It also aligns with my general view that “going public is dumb” and that “infinite growth is not only impossible, but bad.”  I’ll keep it brief.  Right now, bitcoin is treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. That means the companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets need to mark down its balance sheet value if bitcoin’s price decreases. This is sensible and gives an accurate representation of the financial reality that the asset it holds is now worth less.  Unfortunately, because bitcoin is treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, the company is not allowed to increase the value of the bitcoin to accurately represent the financial reality that the asset it holds is now worth more. Mark-to-market assets, in contrast, allow companies to adjust the value of an asset to reflect its value as determined by current market conditions. If bitcoin were allowed to be treated as a mark-to-market asset, companies could do this.  The rule that requires bitcoin to be treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the U.S. And they should change the rule for two reasons.  First, it makes sense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets include things like goodwill, a made-up asset that allows acquiring companies to overpay for a target. Goodwill doesn’t trade on any sort of liquid market, but bitcoin does. Marking goodwill to market is basically impossible; marking bitcoin to market is easy.  And second, it would give a more accurate representation of companies’ financial positions. Public companies in the U.S. are already onerously tasked with providing quarterly financial reports to shareholders. If these companies hold bitcoin that is impaired one quarter and not allowed to be marked up the next, that will give an inaccurate representation of the company’s financial position without additional information from the company.  To that point, we should bring it back to Tesla. Remember it converted a majority of its bitcoin holdings for a gain offset by “impairment charges on the remainder of our holdings netting a $106 million cost to the [income statement].” So Tesla’s income statement doesn’t show the sale of bitcoin that made money (which is normal; it shows up on the cash flow statement), but it does show an income statement loss associated with bitcoin it didn’t sell. That makes no sense.  In the spirit of … ahem … making sense, perhaps we should start treating bitcoin like the mark-to-market asset it is.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/24/accounting-rules-make-the-outcome-of-teslas-bitcoin-sale-unclear,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e73411161b5f3c3db6fca1b4d7cfaa89b1ddb185-2253x1690.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MANA has sustained its bullish streak despite minimal decline seen in the past trading session. The coin opened at a lower price but quickly maneuvered and retraced after retesting at $1.02. Consequently, a breach above $1.0 is set to generate massive gains. Looking at the daily chart, MANA price has skyrocketed with an increase of 2.20% in the past 24 hours, and has been up 15% in the last three days. The price action shows how MANA is holding it strongly at the $0.99 mark. Suggested Reading | Solana (SOL) To Hit $166 By 2025, Despite Current Bearish Conditions Decentraland (MANA) Consistently Bullish Seeing the Inverted Head and Shoulder formation shows a bullish trend predictive of a breach on the higher zone. Further, MANA’s price is consistently trading above the 50-day EMA as seen in the past few days which confirms a potential breakout. MANA buyers are looking at the $1.12 mark which may be followed through at $1.30. While MANA moves into an asymmetrical triangle pattern, it’s shaping up to form a double top. With the price having retraced from that point and could now test at $0.92. Additionally, the price also gave way to a bearish Bat pattern which rarely happens. MANA is definitely shooting for an upward trend on the higher timeframe but a correction moving near $0.90 is possible with a lower time frame. So, once the price breaches $1.0, it signals a great buying opportunity. Suggested Reading | Cardano (ADA), After 35% Spike, Locks On Next Target: $0.55 Despite the rapid price fluctuations of Decentraland (MANA), analysts have always been bullish on the token. Being a metaverse token, MANA has strengthened in price since last year with the launch of Meta (formerly Facebook). In a world that is said to be owned by users or the metaverse, MANA has proven time and again that as a frontrunner in crypto gaming, it can be the king of the metaverse or of the 3D virtual world.

More so, Decentraland has a DAO pretty much like RoboApe. With that being said, MANA hodlers have the say and can vote about changes they want in the Decentraland. The meme token culture is continuously shaped and modified in a safe metaverse. To date, the Decentraland marketplace has a total of 160,000 sales plus a trading volume that peaks at as much as $348.84 million.

Analysts are looking at a retracement to $0.58 if the coin goes below $0.77. Polygon, self-proclaimed as “Ethereum’s Internet of Blockchains” looks ready for a major move after it has skyrocketed in market value as seen in the past weeks. On the flipside, there is still a strong support zone that may anchor the coin to hold its price. MATIC is currently set in anticipation of a correction but is still has to break the support line. It has been on an upswing and has spiked by more than 200% after it bounced back from a low of $0.32 and reaching a high of $0.98 as seen in July 18. Suggested Reading | Solana (SOL) To Hit $166 By 2025, Despite Current Bearish Conditions MATIC Sell Signal Strong The token looks like its basking on what is referred to as an overbought terrain. A sell signal has been remarkable in the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator on MATIC’s daily chart. It shows green nine candlesticks or forming a bearish pattern which shows a correction. The weak outlook was supported with the two red candlesticks that appear to be trading below the other red candlestick. Despite its passive movement, MATIC has Parabolic SAR, a strong support cluster, and also the retracement seen at $0.77, and the 100-day moving average keeping it all stable. A daily candlestick that would slide below the critical line may trigger a downward pressure and lead to a correction of 22% at $0.58. MATIC total market cap at $6.87 billion on the daily chart | Source: TradingView.com MATIC To Regain Strength, Move Towards $1.20 If MATIC can breach its July 18 high set at $0.98, then that can shake off its weak outlook. Once it slices through that critical resistance level, MATIC will regain the strength to move closely towards the $1.20 200-day moving average. The token has been getting a lot of eyeballs as it gets ready to upgrade to a multi-chain platform and also as it soared higher over the past month. The entire crypto market has been recovering over the past couple of weeks; and MATIC price has also recouped and risen as a result. Polygon is on track to roll out quicker and more affordable Ethereum transactions. The future looks promising for Polygon as it works its way up to become a multi-chain network, its involvements with NFT, and also with its collaborations and projects with Stripe, Disney, and Adidas.
