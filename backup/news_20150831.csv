US users of the Chinese bitcoin exchange see the following message when trying to make bitcoin, litecoin or US dollar deposits:  ""Notes: Due to regulation, we don't accept the charge from the US.""  The company called the measure ""temporary"", but offered few details when asked when the restriction will be lifted. A representative described the situation as ""not very clear"".  OKCoin head of international Jack Liu offered additional details by email, telling CoinDesk:  ""The latest change is part of an internal review we made on our policies and affects Level 1 individuals who self-indicated as US citizens.""  Liu suggested the move was voluntary, but provided no additional comment on the situation.  CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story.

42398627,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAmH,1441046626,African Remittance Firm Beam Stops Bitcoin Service in Pivot,"Beam has announced it will no longer focus on using bitcoin in an attempt to disrupt the Ghanaian remittance market.  Launched last October, Beam emerged as one of a number of ""rebittance"" firms seeking to use the bitcoin blockchain as a means to enable low-cost cross-border payment services.  Beam had sought to appeal to local remittance users with a variety of payout options, allowing bitcoin received by its users to be applied to mobile phone airtime and utility bills, and by using charitable donations as a way to promote its efforts.  In a new interview, however, Beam CTO Falk Benke told Disrupt Africa that a revamped version of the service will not use bitcoin, saying instead that it would focus on international debit and credit cards.  The media outlet indicated that Benke cited the lack of local bitcoin adoption, the high cost of exchanging bitcoin for Ghanaian cedi and the volatility of bitcoin against fiat currencies as the reasons underlying the decision.  The news source suggested that Benke remains optimistic about bitcoin's potential as a means of payment on the continent, but that the move was a business decision, writing:  ""[Falk] said he was not saying that bitcoin would not work in Africa, but said it was no longer on Beam’s agenda for the time being.""  Despite the closure, other African startups remain focused on using bitcoin to unlock new savings in remittance markets, with $1.7m startup BitPesa focusing on East African markets.  Representatives from Beam did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42398628,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAkJ,1441044014,Goldman Analyst: Blockchain Tech Will Change Asset Ownership,"A Goldman Sachs analyst has revealed further insight into the global investment banking giant's developing thesis on bitcoin and blockchain technology.  In a podcast released this summer and highlighted by a recent New York Times piece, global investment research analyst Heath Terry addressed both bitcoin and the blockchain, praising the distributed ledger as a technology that would have ""massive implications"" for asset and ownership transfer.  ""We're first pitch, first inning in terms of seeing how companies are going to use the technology,"" Terry said, adding:  ""It's fascinating in really early stages, but it's hard to see a world where blockchain technology doesn't change the way we think about asset ownership.""  Part of the firm's ""Exchanges at Goldman Sachs"" series, the talk, recorded in June and published in late July, was meant to promote ""The Future of Finance"", an annual report on disruptive financial technologies and concepts produced by its research team.  The three-part paper is the latest from Goldman Sachs to highlight bitcoin and the blockchain's potential applications for asset transfer. Previous entries have spotlighted the technology's applications for remittances and among merchants.  Elsewhere, the podcast discussed trends in finance including peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding and mobile payments, while focusing on the financial habits of millennials.  Notably, Terry and fellow analyst Ryan Nash chose to describe this demographic as credit card and debt averse, stating that they believes these consumers better understand the cost of financial products, including the transaction fees associated with their use.  Bitcoin adoption  The podcast found Terry addressing various questions about bitcoin as an implementation of blockchain technology as well, though his conclusions as to the viability of this application were markedly more negative.  Terry indicated that he believes the adoption of bitcoin as a currency has been held back by its fluctuating price against fiat currencies.  ""The volatility around bitcoin scares a lot of people, it was great in those periods when bitcoin only seemed to go up,"" he said. ""It's gone up, it's gone down and it's gone up. For a lot of people, the point of having a secure currency the way bitcoin is supposed to be is having a secure store of value, having a way to transfer value.""  Terry further suggested that he has concluded bitcoin is not currently competitive against traditional payment methods, noting it has been primarily used in instances when alternatives are not available.  Still, he implied he was bullish that bitcoin or blockchain-based systems could succeed on their value proposition as a kind of digital cash, concluding:  ""Over time though bitcoin is going to mature, a lot of that volatility will likely come out of the system. You'll probably see more use cases as it does.""

42398629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdAnG,1441026008,Coinbase Expands Bitcoin Services to Canada,"Bitcoin users in Canada can now buy and sell bitcoin using Coinbase.  The bitcoin services firm, which has raised $106.7m in four public venture rounds, is now available in 27 countries in North America and Europe. The move follows the company's expansion to Europe in September 2014.  CEO Brian Armstrong had previously indicated that Coinbase is seeking to extend its services to 30 countries by the end of 2015, a goal he disclosed at the time of the startup's $75m Series C round, announced in January.  As a result of the move, Canadian residents can now buy and sell bitcoin using Canadian dollars (CAD), deposit CAD funds into bitcoin wallets and trade CAD/BTC using the Coinbase bitcoin exchange.  In an interview, Armstrong explained that, while the company has so far found success launching in more developed markets, it remains active in its efforts to extend its services to developing markets. However, he suggested the regulatory environments have so far proven easier to navigate in countries where English language proficiency and technology literacy are high.  Armstrong told CoinDesk:  ""It's not where we would want to launch first, it's actually where the partners we have to work with are able to work with us first. But certainly Canada has a huge population of people that are interested in bitcoin that didn't have easy ways to buy and sell it.""  The company indicated its legal counsel does not believe Coinbase to be ""engaged in any regulated activity"" in Canada, a factor that encouraged it to launch its brokerage and exchange services across all Canadian provinces.  Notably, the company's CAD/BTC exchange will be kept in a separate order book, meaning, for now, US exchange users will not be able to access the pair via their US accounts.  ""There's certainly an advantage to multiple currency pairs, but we wanted to be more conservative from a legal and regulatory sense,"" Armstrong continued.  As part of the launch, Coinbase said it would waive retail conversion fees for users of its bitcoin brokerage service through 6th September. Trading fees on its exchange product will not be subject to the promotion.  Wall Street shoe-in  Armstrong also commented on the increasing competition in the US bitcoin exchange space, which has seen the launch or announcements of expected launch by well-capitalized competitors including itBit and Gemini.  While those exchanges may have garnered the lion's share of media discussion, Armstrong feels Coinbase is best positioned to capture investment from this demographic. In particular, he cited the New York Stock Exchange's (NYSE) investment in the company and co-founder Fred Ehrsam's experience at Goldman Sachs.  ""If Wall Street is doing to do anything [with bitcoin], they're going to do it with us. Perception here is that we're a shoe-in in the banking crowd,"" he said.  Coinbase Exchange is currently available in more than 30 states, as well as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico, partly through licenses secured in each jurisdiction. Rival itBit has alternatively secured a New York banking charter, which it has claimed gives it the ability to service customers in all 50 US states.  Though he spoke positively of rival itBit, Armstrong called Gemini's effort, including its recent filing for a banking charter in New York, ""embarrassing"", suggesting the investors and entrepreneurs behind the project, brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss don't have a reliable track record of product delivery.  Business model questions  As for Coinbase's long-term revenue model, Armstrong said the startup is likely to add additional financial products to its exchange product, potentially including derivatives.  Armstrong described the company's brokerage and professional trading tools as its ""Google AdWords"", the revenue-generating arm of the firm that will allow it to pursue more innovative, low-cost, consumer-facing services.  Still, he acknowledged that, across the industry, wallets and exchanges are having difficulty raising revenue, but he believes Coinbase is well-positioned to monetize through its brokerage service, given that the company has established a trusted name in the industry.  ""It's more an Apple than a WalMart model,"" he continued. ""I think the consumer business is going to be defensible and profitable and allow us to offer the developer platform for free.""  For now, he reiterated Coinbase is seeking to build an ""open and efficient payment network"" for a global user base, emphasizing that its services in Canada are yet another step toward that goal.

42398648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbdB12,1441019737,15-Year-Old 'Bitcoin Kid' Wants to Make Ethereum Easier,"Depending on who you ask, Whit Jackson is anywhere between 10 and 16 years old, his elastic age a testament to the general awkwardness of male puberty.  Jackson, aware of this, quickly clarifies in conversation. He's 15, a soon-to-be sophomore at Brentwood School in Los Angeles, a K-12 coed day school that boasts an A-list of alumni including child actors Ben and Fred Savage as well as three current members of the pop rock band Maroon 5.  At school, Jackson already has a distinction, however. He's ""the bitcoin kid"", a nickname that seems to have stuck even if it's origin story is less clear.  ""All my teachers know me as 'the bitcoin kid'. I told a few of my friends and it spread just because I'm really passionate. I'll wear bitcoin t-shirts. They tease me for it,"" he tells CoinDesk.  One reason for the attention is that after school and on weekends, Jackson works on cryptocurrency projects. He's currently the CTO of Etherparty, a platform that aims to make issuing smart contracts on Ethereum easier for developers, and serves as a summer intern at blockchain-based currencies trading platform Tether.  Jackson said he was inspired to begin work on Ethereum, the decentralized app development platform invented by another young wunderkind, 21-year-old Vitalik Buterin, shortly after reading the white paper. At the request of Etherparty CEO Lisa Cheng, a friend and colleague, Jackson joined Etherparty earlier this year.  ""The idea of Etherparty is to make Ethereum development a lot easier,"" Jackson explained. ""When you write code and deploy it on a server, you don't need to build your own server and use the command line to build the contracts. We make it straightforward to do it.""  Ultimately, he says the goal of Etherparty is to ""bring mainstream developers to Ethereum"", replicating the process by which he first became enamored with the technology – and its community – a year and a half ago.  ""It's a product of meeting the right people,"" Jackson says of his continued notoriety among the technology's core community.  ""I can't imagine where I'd be at this point without bitcoin.""  Doge discovery  Though he cites bitcoin as the impetus for his work, it's another cryptocurrency that perhaps has more to do with Jackson's interest in the technology.  Jackson said he first learned of bitcoin in fall 2013, but it wasn't until the debut of the once-popular dogecoin that his interest was piqued.  ""I saw dogecoin on Reddit and was like 'Whoa Doge! Wow!' At first, I thought it was a joke, I didn't realize there was anything but bitcoin,"" he recalled.  ""It wasn't really finance that got me interested in dogecoin. It was dogecoin that got me into finance.""  Jackson missed the ""crazy price inflation"" that happened as the cryptocurrency's popularity grew. However, he remembers being swept up in the real-world impact the project had, even watching the dogecoin-sponsored Jamaican bobsled team race in the Olympics on TV.  Soon, he fell deeper into the community, hanging out in forums where he got his first experiences learning to code. At the beginning, Jackson indicates he was a total novice, but that others were eager to help him learn.  ""I wanted to be cool and learn with the developers,"" he said. ""For me, it wasn't anything super libertarian, it was 'Whoa, I love doge', and I thought it was funny and the community was great.""  Jackson is still friends with the dogecoin developers but says he isn't the biggest altcoin supporter these days. The remarks come with the air of someone who's been around long enough to have seen what happens when these communities turn sour.  ""I realize the scene is not that great, most innovation happens in bitcoin. All these altcoins really only serve for price manipulation,"" he added. ""But I know a ton of people because of dogecoin.""  Entrepreneurial spirit  Even after dogecoin fell out of the spotlight, Jackson stuck around to hone his skills.  For a while, he was a moderator for a subreddit for tacocoin, a short-lived offshoot of the dogecoin community and was a developer at opalcoin, an anonymous cryptocurrency, even serving as its spokesman during a high-profile hacking incident.  This constant exploration of the bitcoin and blockchain space leads in part to the confusion around Jackson's age and expertise. Cheng, the Etherparty CEO who recently hired Jackson, notes it was she who was first hired by Jackson a year ago for the Opalcoin project.  ""My first interaction with him was when he hired me,"" she said.  ""We had only messaged through Skype and email so I didn’t realize he was young until we had a phone call sometime later.""  It also comes with its own set of challenges, as Cheng notes that Etherparty is only a part time project for the team during the summer, as Jackson has had a busy summer schedule complete with summer camp and debate camp.  Technology advocate  This confusion surrounding Jackson's age makes sense when divorced from his sometimes spritely voice. He peppers his comments with all the typical industry colloquialisms.  ""I saw use cases and it just kind of clicked,"" he says, recalling his first interactions with Ethereum, his current project of choice.  Jackson also attests to a love of decentralization, as well as an underlying support for the movement's ethos, noting that he often gets ""preachy"" on the subject.  ""I think it has the potential to change our modern interactions,"" Jackson said. ""I think decentralization causes so many benefits, it reduces trust you have in individuals. It's very idealistic for me. It's the way the future will be.""  So far, Jackson believes the Ethereum platform is off to a ""good start"", even though the price of ETH, the network's native token, has declined since trading began.  ""All the haters are going to be, 'The price is down 33%' from when it opened', but I think the fact that people are running applications on it and the community base is strong,"" he said.  Further, he expressed his belief that Etherparty will find an audience given that it's still ""really tricky"" to use the platform in its current developer beta stage.  ""It's already not going to be the safest, but having to learn a new coding language, Serpent or Solidity, whether or not you're just going to compile it, it just gets really complicated,"" he says, adding: ""We realized there was a gap in the market.""  Future aspirations  As for now, Jackson is happy honing his skills. He visited a family friend at Google this August, and expressed an interest in working for the tech giant some day.  While he's not the most proficient coder, he believes his knowledge of bitcoin is high, and that he'll be able to have a full-time career in the space.  ""To the dismay of a lot of people, I do plan to go to college and get a job in bitcoin and blockchain,"" he quips.  As for his internship at Tether, he said he's been working on ""really cool projects"" and ""complicated stuff he's not allowed to discuss"".  Tether CTO Craig Sellars was positive in his remarks about the 15-year-old, calling him a ""young genius"".  ""He really gets it, and has the perfect talents and the best possible attitude to contribute to the digital currency ecosystem,"" Sellars said. ""It continues to be exciting to work with him.""  He takes his online detractors and minor celebrity in the community less seriously, brushing aside posts that have sought to poke fun at his age like a true industry veteran.  ""I've seen them all,"" he said.
