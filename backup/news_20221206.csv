Gresham's Law and Metcalfe's Law invalidate claims that Bitcoin lacks uniqueness. Threat of quantum computing to all cryptos is real but ultimately unfounded. Mining incentives will remain sufficient even after the last Bitcoin is printed. Bitcoin will again prove the adage: ""What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger."" Mahatma Gandhi, India's famous independence leader, once said of his movement's chances of success: ""They ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" This, I believe, is the path of Bitcoin (BTC-USD). When it emerged in 2009, it was largely ignored. Nobody had heard of it; it was hopelessly complicated and you barely use it to even buy a pizza. As it improbably grew and thrived, despite inevitable challenges, crises and missteps, Bitcoin entered the second phase, that of ridicule: ""Probably rat poison squared."" said famed investor Warren Buffett in a 2018 Business interview . After the long Bitcoin winter of doldrums from 2018 to 2019, following its meteoric rise in 2016 from $16 billion to $266 billion in market cap, Bitcoin was again on the move and had survived another round of multiple 80% drops since its inception in 2009. Market cap of Bitcoin (coinmarketcap.com) With the recent run up to $67,000 in late 2021, Bitcoin was shedding the phase of ridicule. Its market cap had reached $1.2 trillion, or about 3% the size of the entire US economy. More and more former critics recognized the potential of Bitcoin and global bankers knew it was a force to reckon with. Now we've entered the period of ""then they fight you"". Over the last three years the US government began cracking down on all cryptocurrencies. US regulators prohibited the launch of Initial Coin Offerings - designating these as illegal security offerings. Pressure was put on foreign crypto companies to prohibit them from catering to US investors. Governments across the world mobilized to put limitations on crypto currencies. The government of China took the most extreme measures, banning all crypto miners and crypto trading in 2021, with tight criminal enforcement against violators. Bitcoin is Too Good For The Government To Allow It One of the most heard criticisms about Bitcoin centers around the power of governments to ban it: Bitcoin, the argument goes, would be immediately suppressed by all governments if it ever achieved even a modicum of success. Let me respond to that criticism, because it's based on a true assumption. Governments do view all cryptos as a threat to government authority, and Bitcoin as well. Why would governments want to fight cryptos or Bitcoin? Simple. Governments derive their power from the ability to control the national currency. This is especially true of the United States. This is because the dollar is the de-facto global monetary standard. As such, the US government derives a tremendous amount of political power from its ability to control the dollar, and that power extends well beyond its national borders. Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is a form of money that is founded on the very principle of being non-manipulable by governments and non-inflationary once it achieved a pre-determined maximum supply of 21 million coins. In fact, when it was launched by its mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto - in 2009, Bitcoin was deliberately intended to be the very antithesis of fiat currencies. The protocol was brilliantly devised to be rigorously and programmatically controlled by an immutable algorithm, not by any individual or group of individuals. As is commonly known, all fiat currencies in the history of mankind have been inflated by governments to serve their financing needs. The effect has been that all fiat currencies inexorably go to zero over time. The Ever Shrinking Dollar (shtfplan.com) Bitcoin adherents - and I count myself among them - are deeply aware of this weakness of fiat currencies, and therefore so passionate in their embracement of Bitcoin. They view Bitcoin as an asset that cannot be arbitrarily manipulated by governments or special interests, whose limited supply will ultimately cause it to hugely increase in value as awareness of it spreads. If Bitcoin catches on and more and more individuals can opt out of the national currency, exchanging into fiat currency only to settle their tax payments, this would represent a tremendous decrease in the power of central governments. Governments are made up of individuals, and those individuals cherish their positions of power and influence. They will not relinquish their monopoly over the currency without a fight. So the critics are dead right about the government's incentives to repress Bitcoin. Where they are wrong, I believe, is in overestimating the government's power to do so. Governments around the world are already battling Bitcoin, to varying degrees and with varying approaches - but in the long run, they will ultimately fail. For one thing, for governments to successfully suppress Bitcoin, they would all have to agree to do so. If only one government accepts Bitcoin and the mining of Bitcoin, that would allow the propagation of new Bitcoin to continue from that country. Once created, Bitcoin knows no borders, and can skip across the world in the time it takes to hit a keyboard key. Granted, governments could declare transactions in Bitcoin illegal. But to actually enforce those new laws, a government would need to adopt totalitarian controls on all internet transactions. You cannot stop all internet transactions in any modern economy. That's economic suicide. So the alternative would be for the government to inspect all internet packets as they are transmitted, to ensure compliance. But then people would resort to using encrypted data. So then governments would have to ban all forms of cryptography as well. Either that or provide the government a backdoor denied to others. But cryptography experts know that that is tantamount to not having any cryptography at all, given how leaky most governments are. Yet cryptography not only protects cryptocurrencies, it also ensures corporate privacy, military security, legal privacy and the smooth functioning of most banking and stock exchange transactions. Eliminating cryptography would be extremely deleterious to a modern information economy. It would represent an enormous tax on every citizen in the economy, and be an enormous drag on economic growth. Just ask Soviet Russia or North Korea. Apart from the economic disadvantages, I really can't visualize most Americans accepting this degree of government repression of basic liberties. ""We may be sheeple, but we're not stupid, you know."" Nor, for that matter, would the majority of people in most countries of the world I've lived in. They would quickly overthrow the governments trying to impose them. Such governmental controls exist today in China, and Russia, and other authoritarian states, but it remains to be seen how long those regimes will last. In fact, the shocking fact is how difficult it is to suppress Bitcoin miners even in a state considered to be among the most authoritarian today. Despite the official banning of Bitcoin mining, the hashrate of China continues to represent 21% of all global mining . This is a huge reduction from the 60-odd percent of pre-ban periods, but it's still a lot of illegal bitcoin mining continuing to take place. If an authoritarian government like the Chinese Communist Party has such a difficult time suppressing the usage and mining of Bitcoin, just imagine how difficult this would be in the US. But wait, you say, if all governments have an incentive to bolster fiat currencies and hamper Bitcoin, can't they all collude and together suppress it? I would say no, there's little chance of that happening. I'm far more convinced that we're entering a new geopolitical phase of a breakup into at least two, and most likely three, political alliances. (See a discussion of that in my SA article on ASML .) When you have three different competing blocks, it's difficult to get an agreement on crypto policies, or for that matter, any other issues like global warming or nuclear arms control. And surely enough, after first cracking down on Bitcoin and cryptos in 2020, Russia reversed its stance in early 2022. Perhaps Russians expected to encounter economic reprisals from the US for their impending invasion of Ukraine. This would be one way of countering those measures, while ensuring that Russia could more easily circumvent US banking controls. “The Central Bank does not stand in our way of technological progress and makes the necessary efforts to implement the latest technology in this area,” Putin stated in a Jan 2022 meeting with members of the Russian government, addressing the divergent opinions held by the government body and the central bank. In fact, Russia has risen to the third spot in the list of countries with the highest share of hashrate in the Bitcoin network last year after China banned the asset and its underlying mining industry in the summer of 2021. In a world of over 300 countries, there will always be jurisdictions that will refuse to follow the diktats of the major countries, or will implement any globally imposed restrictions with less-than effective rigor. Moreover, in the US itself, Bitcoin has already overcome its regulatory hurdles and been declared a legal asset governed by the same regulations as commodities like gold or iron ore. It will be difficult to reverse these decisions. Any reversal would be certain to be juridically appealed by Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin investors, and the issue would likely need to be adjudicated at the level of the Supreme Court. Bitcoin backers - myself included - argue that Bitcoin should enjoy the protection of the 1st Amendment . The legal case is certainly subject to debate. My point is that any change to the legal treatment of Bitcoin as a commodity in which Americans can legally transact will not occur easily, and will be bitterly fought in the courts. That said, the US governments successfully banned gold in 1932, setting an important precedent. Similarly, they banned the use of alcohol in the 1920's, a great restriction of personal liberties, under the guise of being a danger to public health. The case of Prohibition, and the more recent relaxation of drug laws decriminalizing marijuana, are cogent cases that show the ineffectiveness of government enforcement of the law, even when a practice is deemed illegal. If China - able to lock up millions of Uighurs in concentration camps for failing to culturally assimilate - is unable to stop Bitcoin, how can one possibly view the relatively democratic US governments successfully banning all Bitcoin transactions? This would require draconian measures only really enforceable in the Orwellian police states that prohibit the use of all forms of encryption unless the government has backdoor access to the encrypted data. The United States is not there today, nor are most other countries of the world. Thus Bitcoin will not be stopped even though it's an inconvenient thorn in the side of Big Government. Bitcoin Is Nothing Special - It's Easy To Copy So It Has No Value It's amazing how time and again, I hear the argument made that while Bitcoin itself is limited to 21 million coins in all eternity, that does not make it a scarce asset. These critics say it's perfectly trivial to copy the entire Bitcoin protocol, and commit exact carbon copies of the original Bitcoin. Bitcoin II, Bitcoin III, Bitcoin IIIIICCCVVVVV. So how can Bitcoin possible be scarce? So goes the argument. The argument is deeply flawed. Let me be brief in my counterargument: Mona Lisa. The last time I looked, that picture was trading for some $3.4 million. I don't want to know the talents of Leonardo da Vinci, but I'd venture to say that the average art student with a few years of art study under his/her belt could knock out a decent copy of that famous painting in just under a couple of weeks. Why don't they? Because they'd never get anywhere near the value people are willing to pay for the original. People value the first one because it was the first, and because a rich history and lore surrounds the painting that people are willing to pay to associate themselves with. Similarly, there is only one Bitcoin. People have tried to do knockoffs, and improvements, to Bitcoin, which are called forks. The list is in the thousands. Guess what? None of them ever caught on with the public, despite possible minor improvements to the original Bitcoin protocol. A great part of the reason why has to do with a principle called Metcalfe's law. This principle proposes that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. So the larger a network already is, the easier it is to grow even faster. Cryptocurrencies, by their social nature, are subject to the growth metrics defined by Metcalf's Law. The more people that adopt any given cryptocurrency, the more attractive it is for other people to use it. And the more other people use it, the more attractive it is for merchants to adopt it. And the more merchants adopt it, the more valuable it becomes for the original users. Repeat ad infinitum, or at least until all humans are using it. So let me ask you. Would you prefer to own Bitcoin, even a fraction of it, knowing you can immediately sell it to 190 million other people in the world, instantly? Or instead, please buy my new ""BetterBitcoin"" coin. Nobody's using it yet, but trust me they will. What do you think most people will choose? Thought so. Ok, you say, but what about the twenty-thousand odd cryptocurrencies that you've heard are out there? Well, those do temporarily distract people away from the original Bitcoin. And for a while, they will slow down Bitcoin's growth and hence the steepness of the exponential network curve. But then there's another law that governs monetary instruments: Gresham's Law . Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that ""bad money drives out good."" Bitcoin is by far the superior money. Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency (see eCash), but it was the first to be endowed with just the right mix of characteristics to guarantee its success. And once it achieved a certain size, Metcalf's Law ensured that it would become much more secure and robust than other crypto's also based on the similar proof-of-work protocols. Unlike fiat money issued by governments, Bitcoin is not susceptible to government greed and profligacy. Unlike Gold, Bitcoin, is eminently divisible, measurable, and transportable. Unlike Litecoin (LTC-USD), Bitcoin is more secure, since its network is much larger, making it more immune from 51% attacks. Unlike Ethereum (ETH-USD), Cardano (ADA-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), or Avalanche (AVAX-USD), to name just a few other popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is more decentralized, and thus less susceptible to private manipulation or government repression. So just as the US dollar will drive out the official bolivar in today's Venezuela - as the ""better"" money, Bitcoin will eventually drive out most of the other 20-some thousand crypto-competitors. Before the advent of cryptocurrencies, there were a few ""global"" currencies and hundreds of national currencies. In the future, there will be probably be one major crypto-currency - Bitcoin - and very likely a half-dozen other global cryptocurrencies more attuned to solving unique economic tasks or attuned to the unique political and social mores of its users. Will Quantum Computing Kill Bitcoin? Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. Computer engineers estimate that these machines could emerge as a viable mass technology within a period of 10 to 20 years. The first proven quantum computers that exist today do not have that power. However, within 1 or 2 decades, security experts believe quantum computers could harness such computing power as to break the encryption protocols fundamental to the security of the Internet that we have today. These security protocols lie at the heart of Bitcoin security, and almost all other cryptocurrencies. Most cryptos use a hashing methodology deploying 256-bit encryption to secure Bitcoin from hackers. If this encryption can be easily broken by quantum computers, then the security of Bitcoin could be compromised by an attacker and the entire Bitcoin blockchain network could be irrevocably compromised. These claims are accurate, and they are a real danger that threatens Bitcoin. However they also threaten the entire modern economic system of the internet, including all banking and brokerage transactions. But the danger is overblown. Because as quantum computers become more common and more powerful, so too will the technologies evolve in order ensure continued security. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is taking quantum computing’s threat to cybersecurity very seriously. As early as 2015, NIST has been seeking new encryption algorithms to replace those that a quantum computer could potentially break. Already, NIST had identified the best algorithms out of a shortlist of 7 finalists and 8 alternate candidates. Bitcoin's unique decentralized mining system makes any changes to the protocol difficult to adopt, because it requires buy-in from a majority of miners and users with widely varying incentives, needs, budgets and jurisdictions. This is a source of Bitcoin's strength: new ideas are robustly debated and scrupulously examined. But it can also be a source of Bitcoin weakness, since important or desirable changes to the protocol take longer to occur. However, when faced with a threat to their very livelihood, I have no doubt that the new, more secure algorithms will be adopted. After all, everyone loses if Bitcoin is hackable. We may even see one or two forks of Bitcoin occur, with various of the new algorithms being adopted by differing ""camps"" of Bitcoin investors. But just as in nature's law of natural selection, the better solution will eventually be adopted by more people and thrive, while the lesser solution will shrivel and eventually fall into disuse. Bottom line, though, Bitcoin will survive quantum computing. So will most cryptocurrencies, and so will the internet. Bitcoin Will Die Because Miners Lose Their Financial Incentives Another common criticism leveled at Bitcoin is that the protocol will become insecure once all future Bitcoin have been mined and the currency enters into its deflationary phase. This will be approximately in the year 2140, so 118 years from today. Right now, each miner is paid a certain amount of newly minted Bitcoin (created out of thin air) as a reward for verifying and securing a specified block of Bitcoin transactions. This stops when all 21 million coins have been minted. At that time, miners will only be paid a smaller transaction fee for their activities. Because that could be a big drop in rewards, critics argue that many miners would cease their activities. That in turn, would mean that there would be fewer miners globally verifying transactions. According to this reasoning, that would make it easier for one single very large entity to gain control of more than 51% of all the computing power on the Bitcoin blockchain. Since there would be far fewer Bitcoin miners, requiring far less computing power, it would be less expensive to corner the market by buying a majority of Bitcoin miners and maintaining that majority. Once that dominant position is established, that miner could essentially ""recreate real history"" to its own financial benefit, by altering the amounts of transactions and the real identities of buyers and sellers. Because it would control the majority of the outputs on the blockchain, this would become the ""accepted"" version of truth. This is akin to a Congress deciding who owns a given asset or right, but all members of the Congress being fully controlled by one individual. There goes democracy. The argument also has some substance. Bitcoin mining revenues would certainly drop when new the Bitcoin mining reward is only derived from transaction fees. However, by my estimates those fees will be enormous, since they are a percentage of the value of Bitcoin itself times the number of transactions in a block. It's hard to know what happens in 100 years. But the most likely scenario that I see is that Bitcoin will largely serve as a store of value (similar to Gold today). A secondary, less expensive protocol, based on the Lightning Network will be used for billions and trillions of small day-to-day instant transactions. Every thousand to 100 thousand transactions though, the Lightning nodes will autoclose and settle on the Bitcoin network. So the average number of Bitcoin transactions will still go up over time. How expensive could Bitcoin rise to if say half the planet is using this protocol? Well that would be 50% of humanity, up from around 4% today. So 40 times today's price of $16 k does not sound unreasonable. That's $640k per Bitcoin. But that's if it only served as a store of value. It's value as a settlement layer for Lighting Network or other level 2 blockchain protocols that use Bitcoin to settle up will propel Bitcoin up to values many times higher. I would be surprised if Lightning or some other level 2 protocol did not replace most credit card and bank transactions done today. In that case, we can only take a wild guess at the number of daily transactions. Let's see. 4 billion people buy a gallon of milk or a pack of gum or top up the electricity in their (finally) flying car. That's 12 billion Lightning transactions per day! But since an average Bitcoin block can only fit around 2500 transactions (this is not a max but an average), and a block occurs every 10 minutes, this means that only 360,000 transactions can be done per day on the entire Bitcoin blockchain per day. This means that Lightning nodes (or other level 2 or level 3 emerging technologies) would have to settle less frequently on Bitcoin. If they settled up once every 16 days, the Bitcoin network would be able to process all transactions within 24 hours. Every 32 days settlement to Bitcoin means average transactions would take 1/2 day. This does not mean users of Lightning need to wait a day. Their lightning transactions would be sub-second, especially for smaller amounts where final Bitcoin blockchain recording is less critical. If you're selling your house, you'd want to wait out that 24 or 48 hour period before giving the new owners the keys to the house. But if you're selling a bag of groceries for $80, you'd relinquish to goods immediately without sweating it. The likelihood of a chargeback would be infinitely small. Besides, you can expect insurance companies to fill this void and insure the transactions for both parties for small fractions of a penny. Because the Lightning nodes would be competing for scarce Bitcoin block space, the cost of a transaction would grow exponentially, and far surpass today's block rewards. This back of the envelope example of mine fits in with the much more detailed analysis of the issues published recently by Blockware Solutions . I invite readers to read the report , which is excellent. Here's their conclusion: In the long run, the market may naturally find an equilibrium for on-chain fees. It could reach a point where there is not much more demand for scaling technology and fees are high enough to avoid censorship after X blocks. When will this occur? Impossible to know, but it’s safe to say that Bitcoin’s long-term “security” is probable and that miners will likely experience more scaling cycles where they earn a significant amount of transaction fees as Bitcoin adoption accelerates and the use of it as a medium exchange begins Bottom line, my conclusion is that Bitcoin is not threatened when it approaches its 21 million coin limit. Bitcoin mining will continue to be a competitive marketplace, with promising growing income for miners and a continued natural defense against security breaches and 51% attacks. Where Does Bitcoin Go From Here? So if I believe Bitcoin's critics have it wrong, where do I see Bitcoin going from here? The short answer is: temporarily down, while the recent FTX fiasco plays out and drags down most of the crypto industry. I still believe the technical analysis I published on SA last August is valid. I see Bitcoin dropping to the $10k support level, at minimum. There is even a minute chance that it can go as low as $3k though I would be very surprised. Myself I will load the boat at $10k. Readers will think: ""Wow, that's another 60% drop"". True, but then Bitcoin will be the proverbial Phoenix soaring from the ashes to new as yet unclaimed heights. Remember the old adage: ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"". That's Bitcoin.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562788-where-bitcoin-critics-are-wrong?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5237125.jpeg

CoinDesk published its annual Most Influential series on Monday, highlighting a number of regulators, lawmakers and similarly impactful individuals. I spoke to Carole House, one of the authors of the White House executive order on crypto, to take a look at the document, its origins and where we are now.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  6 month review  The narrative  I spoke with Carole House, a former National Security Council official with the White House and one of the authors of the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets, about how the document came together and the results to date.  Why it matters  You can read the bulk of this in CoinDesk’s Most Influential series. But here’s some additional detail from our conversation.  Breaking it down  It’s worth noting up front that many major questions about how the U.S. will regulate digital assets remain up in the air. A simmering turf war between the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission is no closer to conclusion than it was when the order first published. Whether and how the federal government may adopt policies supportive of blockchain development is also up in the air.  Still, we now have a clearer sense of how the government is approaching this. The White House and various executive branch departments have published the first few sets of reports, addressing a number of issues including considerations for a central bank digital currency, how crypto-related crimes might be prosecuted and how the U.S. sees itself on the world stage.  More reports are expected, including one addressing whether the Federal Reserve has the authority to issue a digital dollar and one examining what sort of regulatory gaps still exist within crypto oversight.  One of the White House’s documents, published in September, proposed a “comprehensive framework for [the] responsible development of digital assets,” which suggested a federal regulatory regime for nonbank payment providers, something crypto companies would want, given the current system of applying for state money transmitter licenses in each state the companies want to set up in.  “I’m totally thrilled with the reports that the White House issued, and I'm so proud of the entire interagency, for coming together and just creating this first ever comprehensive framework for responsible development of digital assets,” House said. “There's some incredibly innovative content and things that we've never seen before, certainly under any U.S. approach, and that I really don't see under many, if any, international approaches.”  To date, the departments of Treasury, Commerce and Justice, as well as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, have published responses to the executive order. The Justice Department may have taken the most concrete action through two reports, creating a network of prosecutors who specialize in cryptocurrency crimes and recommending a number of laws to both better pursue cryptocurrency crimes and share more information about them with the department’s international partners.  The Commerce Department took a slightly different approach, reflecting the agency’s mission. In a September report, the department recommended more engagement with both private companies and international regulators “to promote development of digital asset policies … consistent with U.S. values and standards.”  This could include supporting educational initiatives and developing a workforce, the report said.  The Treasury Department has published the most reports and launched a request for comment process asking the general public to weigh in on certain illicit finance concerns.  “We had totally complementary White House documents, like research and development guidance that came out from the Office of Science Technology Policy, the critical emerging technologies list that pointed to distributed ledger technologies and digital assets as critical emerging technologies, lots of mutually reinforcing policy objectives that are pointing to the responsible development of the space as being beneficial to the U.S. for economic and national security purposes, but also demonstrating that it must be responsible development,” House said.  House stressed the importance of the “responsible development” aspect of the reports. Financial inclusion through decentralized systems could be greatly beneficial, but if this develops without any protections for consumers, “that is not, in fact, a desirable outcome.”  Broader impact  Much of the executive order does focus on assessing and mitigating risks, whether that’s money laundering risks, terrorist financing risk or financial stability risk.  “The second part of the [executive order], after it outlines all the policy objectives that the president had … that's where there were some very specific concrete actions that were directed or requested, like the request for the Financial Stability Oversight Council to assess the financial stability risks that are present in the space in the future of money reports,” House said.  The administration has willingly called for more public information in answering questions about cryptocurrencies’ role in illicit finance, the same area the executive order actually began. The department’s brief request-for-comment filing asks a number of questions.  Intriguingly, the analysis of risks goes all the way down to the personal. Part of the order directs an analysis on the potential of crypto to address financial inclusion concerns.  “[The order] recognizes that our assessment of the risks and potential benefits of digital assets must include an understanding of how our financial system does and does not meet the current needs of consumers in a manner that is equitable, inclusive and efficient,” a White House official said in March. “[Our] antiquated payment infrastructures [is] leaving the United States and its consumers with options that are slow, costly or altogether inaccessible, as is particularly true of cross border payments. That is why this executive order directs a report on the future of money and payments.”  This would seem to support the U.S.’ current research into central bank digital currencies and, in particular, whether the Fed should issue a digital dollar. The idea remains controversial, with CBDC opponents just generally disliking the concept of the U.S. central bank getting involved, and others skeptical that a token-based digital currency like what has been suggested would be able to meet the needs of this ambitious goal.  But to this end, one of the reports “tried to assess, from a very holistic picture, what the future of money looks like,” House said.  Noting the expansiveness of the executive order, House pointed to concerns over climate risks (on which the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published a report earlier this year) as an example of one of the wide range of issues addressed.  The order didn’t only look at companies, it looked at broader ecological issues, namely climate change.  “Every policy objective, which outlined a lot of different discrete issues like we had, we pointed to climate risks, which is a huge priority for the administration,” House said.  Mind you, things are different now than they were when this order was drafted and published. Crypto’s 2022 has been marked by failures, bankruptcies and millions of dollars worth of crypto likely lost by investors. The collapses have run the gamut of issues regulators are paying attention to, ranging from stablecoins to lenders to exchanges.  Regulators are already evaluating whether existing or new laws would prevent the next Terra or Celsius. The scope of the issues crypto has seen this year should demonstrate the need for transparent communication about the industry, House said.  This ranges from decentralized finance (DeFi) to more centralized projects.  “A lot of this was foreseeable, and it's extremely unfortunate so many people have been hurt in these circumstances,” House said. “But ultimately, … there are the things that some members of the sector don't want to hear, which is that there has to be more effective regulation, in some cases, enforcement in other cases, and just implementation and compliance in others.”  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (New York Magazine) Congress passed, and U.S. President Joe Biden signed, a bill intended to force U.S. rail unions to accept a new contract giving workers a raise and an additional personal day off, but not giving them any paid sick leave or addressing some of the broader concerns rail workers had about the industry.

42414776,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBKu4q,1670368227,Signature Bank to Reduce Crypto-Tied Deposits by as Much as $10 Billion,"CORRECTION (Dec. 7, 21:32 UTC): A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Signature was specifically looking to exit the stablecoin business.  Signature Bank (SBNY) will shrink its deposits tied to cryptocurrencies by $8 billion to $10 billion, signaling a move away from the digital asset industry for the bank that until recently had been one of the most crypto-friendly companies on Wall Street.  “We are not just a crypto bank and we want that to come across loud and clear,” Signature Bank’s CEO Joe DePaolo said at an investor conference in New York hosted by Goldman Sachs Group on Tuesday.  Nearly a quarter of the New York-based bank’s $103 billion in total deposits, or roughly 23.5%, came from the crypto industry as of September 2022. But given the recent “issues” in the space, Signature will reduce that amount to under 20% and potentially under 15% eventually, DePaolo said.  FTX was one of the bank’s clients, although the crypto exchange’s deposits with Signature amounted to less than 0.1% of the bank’s overall deposits. Still, the relationship between the two caused Signature’s shares to drop almost 20% in November.  Stablecoin firms represent a sizable portion of Signature's crypto-related business, with Circle adding Signature as its leading financial institution for USDC reserve deposits in April of last year.  “We recognize that in certain cases, especially as we look at stablecoins and other parties in that space, that there’s a better way for us to utilize our capital,” DePaolo said.  Signature Bank had been considered one of the most crypto-friendly banks on Wall Street alongside rival Silvergate Bank, which on Tuesday was asked by several U.S. senators to address its supposed role in facilitating transfers between FTX and sister company Alameda Research. Silvergate said FTX made up nearly 10% of its $11.9 billion in deposits from digital asset customers, and its stock has tumbled as a result of FTX’s collapse.  UPDATE (Dec. 7, 21:32 UTC): Updated to reflect that Signature plans to reduce its cryptocurrency exposure to between 15% and 20%.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | RESEARCH | USDC,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/signature-bank-to-reduce-crypto-tied-deposits-by-as-much-as-10-billion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dee43957ca59e634fc8570944ccfb0341a25e32-2403x1802.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The ex-FTX CEO, who has yet to be formally charged with any crimes, has retained Cohen as U.S. authorities investigate the implosion of the short-lived crypto empire. Just days before FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 9, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched a probe into whether FTX properly handled customer funds. The failed company is also facing regulatory scrutiny from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Against the usual legal advice, SBF has been quite vocal following FTX's abrupt downfall, making a number of appearances on media outlets. At the New York Times Dealbook conference last week, the 30-year-old said he ""never tried to commit fraud."" Seeking Alpha contributor Victor Haghani raised attention to SBF's shortage in attention to risk. Recall in mid-November when ranking members of the House Financial Services Committee called on SBF to appear at a hearing on next week to talk about the demise of FTX, though he expressed that he might not be ready by then. ""Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain,"" SBF wrote in a recent Twitter post .

On the daily chart, AXS registered a 4.8% spike. This positive price sentiment can be tied to the recent developments within the AXS ecosystem. Axie Infinity’s community made its first move into developing the project into a decentralized future just a day ago. According to the technical outlook, buyers have made a strong comeback in the market. This has caused major accumulation over the past trading sessions. AXS formed a tall green wick tied to increased trading activity to corroborate the same. The chance of a price pullback cannot be ruled out, considering that the coin surged substantially overnight. Buyers might have difficulty sustaining the price breakout, so that AXS will travel close to its immediate support level. Only if this rally pushes the coin above the $10 level can AXS continue its bullish price action. Related Reading: Buyers Rule Over Algorand’s (ALGO) Price Action, Enough To Break Above $0.26? Axie Infinity Price Analysis: One-Day Chart AXS was priced at $8.96 after the recent surge in price. Overhead resistance for the coin was $9 and then at $9.72. Moving above the $9.72 level will help AXS to breach the $10 resistance mark. The aforementioned price ceiling has proved difficult for the bulls as the altcoin has been rejected at that level over the past few months. Clearance of the $10 mark will pave the way for AXS to reach $12. On the other hand, a price pullback will bring AXS to $7.20. The amount of AXS traded in the last session increased, which portrayed the bulls taking charge of the price action. Technical Analysis In correspondence to the tall green wick Axie Infinity Price formed in the recent trading session, the coin was nearing the overvalued zone. The Relative Strength Index shot past the half-line and stood below the 80-mark. With a slight push from buyers, AXS will enter the overbought zone. AXS was also above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which meant that the altcoin registered substantial demand. It denotes that the buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. AXS was also above the 50-Simple Moving Average line, which shows strong bullish price momentum. AXS depicted a buy signal on the daily chart in conformity with increased accumulation. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence identifies the price trend and reversals in the same. MACD assembled green signal bars over the half-line, which was the buy signal for the altcoin. Bollinger Bands forecast price volatility and the chance of fluctuations. The bands widened, indicating that the coin would continue to rise in value on its chart. Moving above $9.20 should not be difficult if the broader market is strong.

5234663,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511410,1670366254,This Report Suggests Crypto Sector Bearing A Final Flush-Out,"The crypto market is currently undergoing a series of unfortunate events. From the crash of stablecoin Terra to the fall of Celsius, it has been a gloomy year for crypto investors. More recently, the capitulation of the Bankman-Fried-led popular exchange FTX has further amplified this negative trend. In addition, exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase have laid off a significant chunk of their workforce. Related Reading: For First Time Ever, Bitcoin Hash Ribbon Golden Cross Has Failed According to Glassnode reports, the collapse of FTX has led to one of the largest; deleveraging events in the history of crypto. As a result, the market has dipped in recent weeks. Glassnode emphasized the size of losses felt by all market players in the deleveraging event. In the long term, this forced-priced flush-out might prove beneficial to the prices of assets. However, Glassnode also believes that a capital reset is at hand. How Is The Crypto Market Faring? With current events, the crypto market has pulled back 1.1%. The total market capitalization stands at $892 billion. With the fear and uncertainty high in the market, resistance levels will be tough to break through for any asset. Most altcoins have maintained neutrality today- neither posting significant gains nor losses. Bitcoin is close to the $17,000 level retracing from $17,400 in less than 24 hours; Ethereum has pulled back 2%, retreating to the $1,266 level. The crypto market is generally downtrend today with a reduction in market capitalization. Record Breaking Capitulation Two massive capitulations reshaped the crypto space in 2022. The events; occurred in June and November. The FTX saga led to a loss of $4.43 billion in one day. Terra’s capitulation caused a deficit of $700 million in 14 days as investors withdrew their capital in droves. Glassnode compared the ratio of realized profits to realized loss, with the latter outstripping the former. As per the data, these losses were fourteen times larger than the gains in the market. According to historical data, previous ratio lows of similar effect occurred at the cycle of bottoms. Again, this pattern was observed – in the 2011,2015, and 2018 bear markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears? After these significant losses, a trend shift occurred after each bear market – leading to a bull market in all three years. Glassnode stated that the size of the losses had reduced in recent weeks after the crypto flush-out. The prices will likely consolidate – in the coming months before a significant trend reversal. According to CNBC’s Jim Cramer, investors need to cash out on crypto while they can. However, with the recent event that has created a negative impression on crypto investment, Cramer emphasized that the decision be made sooner rather than later. How investors will react to the flush-out, and its resultant effects remains a mystery.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Fir Tree also wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut fees for the trust, which is the world’s largest publicly traded crypto fund, with $10.7 billion in assets. It allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to price movements of bitcoin without buying the asset itself.  GBTC is selling at close to a record 43% discount to the price of the underlying bitcoin in the trust and is down almost 75% this year following bitcoin's sharp decline and the collapse of several high-profile crypto firms such as FTX.  Fir Tree wants to use the information it's seeking to pressure Grayscale to resume redemptions, which are not immediately available to investors, and to cut fees from the current 2%, according to Bloomberg's sources.  Fir Tree is known for making a large short bet against the stablecoin tether earlier this year.  A Grayscale spokesperson told CoinDesk the company's ""mission is to help investors access the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem through familiar, secure and transparent investment vehicles. We respect the views of our shareholders, and appreciate engaging directly with them on the details of our product structures and operating model.""  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at roughly $17,000, flat in the past 24 hours. Despite investors’ nervousness about industry contagion linked to crypto exchange FTX’s implosion and other crises, BTC's share of the total crypto market has held steady at around 40%, countering its history of rising sharply during stressful times. Observers said the stagnant dominance rate reflects an exodus of investors from the market, among other factors.  Chainlink (LINK): The provider of price feeds and other data to blockchains has introduced staking of its native token LINK to its network to help keep the protocol secure. Staking will provide incentives that will enable the Chainlink system to grow, according to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. He said the Chainlink network has enabled more than $6.6 trillion in transaction value this year. LINK was recently trading around $7, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.  ApeCoin (APE): Over $30 million worth of APE tokens has been deposited into its contract one day after the Ape Foundation opened staking for its APE currency. The token, which is the native currency of the Yuga Labs ecosystem, was airdropped to holders of the Web3 collective’s mainstay non-fungible token (NFT) collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club, back in March. APE was trading up 5.4% to $4.1 as of publication time.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Two Technical Bitcoin Indicators Diverge; Each Has Value Depending on Investors' Timelines  By Glenn Williams Jr.  An often-used measure of value in technical analysis and a more recent valuation metric specific to on-chain analysis are at odds at the moment. Each is relevant, depending on how fast an investor is looking to generate gains.  The more recent, bitcoin's MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio, measures the ratio of BTC's market capitalization to its realized capitalization. It implies BTC is trading cheaply on a relative basis and foreshadows likely future trends. MVRV readings above 3.7 indicate that an asset is overvalued, while readings below 1 indicate that an asset is undervalued.  With a current reading of 0.85, bitcoin's MVRV ratio has fallen to levels last seen in 2019, implying that current prices present a compelling entry point for long biased investors. For context, BTC prices were trading sub $5,000 during that time period.  Read the full technical take here.  Other News  Crypto firm Orthogonal, the victim of FTX-induced contagion, now faces internal dissent: Blockchain-based lending platform Maple Finance said Monday it had severed ties with Orthogonal Trading after the firm failed to make a $10 million payment that was due, triggering defaults across all of its debt within lending pools for the stablecoin USDC and wrapped ether (wETH). Maple said Orthogonal Trading had misrepresented its exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed FTX exchange. Now, officials with Orthogonal Credit have come forward with a Medium post claiming they were kept unapprised on the depth of Orthogonal Trading’s financial troubles and weren’t aware of the hole in the trading book.  Crypto-friendly bank Silvergate shares are adding to their roughly 50% decline since the FTX collapse, falling another 6.15% and touching a new 52-week low in Tuesday morning trade. The drop came after Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), John Kennedy (R-La.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), in a letter late Monday evening, asked Silvergate for answers to its supposed role in facilitating transfers between bankrupt exchange FTX and its sister firm, Alameda Research.  Macro continued to struggle on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 closed down 2% and 1.44%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 1.03% as investors weighed the U.S. central bank’s likely 50 basis point interest rate hike at its next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14.

Marathon – which doesn’t own its mining facilities and uses third-party data centers to park its computers – previously said that it paid about $50 million in operating deposits to Compute North. In its update on Tuesday, the company said it has now written off $8 million of that total, and expects to recover about $22 million of the $42 million still remaining.  That would leave $20 million of the deposit still unaccounted for, and Marathon said it continues ""to work with the various parties involved to determine [its] ultimate recoverability.""  In addition to that $50 million deposit, Marathon previously said that it invested $10 million in convertible preferred stock and $21.3 million in an unsecured senior promissory note in different entities within Compute North.

Marathon is one of Compute North's largest customers, placing its heavy-duty bitcoin mining rigs in Compute North's data centers for a fee.  In other updates, Marathon said it reduced its revolver borrowings to $30 million from $50 million and – after mining 472 bitcoin in November – has 4,200 unrestricted bitcoin and 11,757 total bitcoin as of Nov. 30. That 472 bitcoin mined last month was down 23% from October thanks to higher energy costs and lower bitcoin prices that affected its King Mountain site in Texas.  Marathon shares were unchanged in post-market trading on Tuesday but were lower by 5.7% in the regular session, and now off 82% this year, roughly in line with mining peers.

Several markets, including the stock markets, are still facing a crisis. Unfortunately, there are no signs of a reversal in the interim. Moreover, several investors, financial experts, and institutions still wonder whether or not the market will recover soonest. BTC’s Return on Investment (ROI) is still very high. But it currently shows a -74.96% drop from its all-time high in November 2021. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lacking Momentum Above $17k, BTC Holders Are Safe: Here’s Why The bearish price movement of BTC is also visible in the prices of several other altcoins – bringing the broader crypto market cap to approximately 900 billion dollars. Bitcoin Price Might Drop Even Further In 2023 The world’s largest digital coin, Bitcoin, recently recovered the $17K price. However, this positive movement doesn’t guarantee broader market recovery, considering the FTX contagion about a month back. Bitcoin began the year at around the $50K price and steadily declined. From the market watch, BTC hit its year’s low of $15,700, which can be traced to the FTX crash in November 2022. Experts believe the crypto market may see more falls in the coming year. The Head of Research at the Standard Chartered bank, Eric Robertsen, announced that the BTC could decline to the $5,000 price mark in 2023. Should this occur, it would be an additional price drop of approximately -70%. There are chances that more crypto companies will file for bankruptcy in 2023 due to the market’s fall. The analyst believes that such an event will discourage more crypto investors, which would cause them to back out from the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears? Meanwhile, the present look of the crypto market has become a cause for worry to many investors. This particular to the new entrants in 2021, when BTC was at its peak of $68K. Since the remarkable price growth, market projects have been experiencing back-to-back failures. However, such occurrences lack macroeconomic factors birthed mostly in 2022. The Future Is Still Unclear Crypto experts’ price predictions of Bitcoin in 2023 surfaced when the market was still encouraging to investors. However, the bear run in 2022 has shattered all hopes and expectations of the token in 2022 and 2023. According to the founder of Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead, crypto adoption may alter the dynamics of demand and supply. This is in line with the crypto prediction of certain industry insiders for September 2022, stating that the worst of the crypto market is already out. As a result, the future of BTC is still uncertain. Meanwhile, Bitcoin stands at $17,016, displaying a 24-hour positive price change. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed index of the token currently shows 26, which implies that investors presently have a fear sentiment.

42420848,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVef,1670360842,Two Technical Bitcoin Indicators Diverge; Each Has Value Depending on Investors' Timelines,"An often-used measure of value in technical analysis and a more recent valuation metric specific to on-chain analysis are at odds at the moment. Each is relevant, depending on how fast an investor is looking to generate gains.  The more recent, bitcoin’s MVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio, measures the ratio of BTC’s market capitalization to its realized capitalization. It implies BTC is trading cheaply on a relative basis and foreshadows likely future trends.  MVRV readings above 3.7 indicate that an asset is overvalued, while readings below 1 indicate that an asset is undervalued.  With a current reading of 0.85, bitcoin’s MVRV ratio has fallen to levels last seen in 2019, implying that current prices present a compelling entry point for long biased investors. For context, BTC prices were trading sub $5,000 during that time period.  Bitcoin’s current relative strength index (RSI), however, implies that BTC's price is fairly valued, given its current reading of 48. RSI ranges from 0-100, with readings above 70 implying that prices are overvalued and those below 30 indicating the opposite. RSI’s reflect likely, immediate price movement.  Despite the neutral reading, a look at historical pricing when BTC’s RSI trades at or around 48 shows a hint of promise. In over 120 occurrences since 2015, following a reading between 47 and 49,BTC has increased on average 6% after 90 days and 2% after seven days.  A look at BTC’s Bollinger Bands shows a series of six consecutive narrow-range trading days, with prices briefly touching the upper range of its bands and now trending in the direction of the 20-day moving average.  The narrow trading range implies a lack of conviction among traders. The reversion to the 20-day average suggests that BTC is trading relatively close to where it should be.  To be sure, the discrepancy between the indicators is small.  MVRV holds primary relevance for investors, who tend to look longer term for payoffs. RSI and Bollinger Bands are most relevant for traders, who seek to accumulate gains more quickly.  Ultimately, the MVRV ratio appears to be a valid indication of BTC’s current intrinsic value. Technical indicators such as the RSI and Bollinger Band indicate the length of time in which BTC will remain undervalued.  Investors who are long bitcoin have an opportunity to acquire bitcoin as it trades near three-year lows relative to its realized value, but only if they can tolerate current price levels, which are unlikely to move much for the foreseeable future.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/06/two-technical-bitcoin-indicators-diverge-each-has-value-depending-on-investors-timelines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c0fcc5fad504f2fcf96dd8deff4a186fcce116a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42414766,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBKteJ,1670360792,Bitcoin Miners Offered Way to Cut Texas Electricity Usage to Help the Grid,"Texas is offering an interim, voluntary power curtailment program for “Large Flexible Loads (LFL),” intended to give bitcoin miners incentives to lower their power consumption during periods of high electricity demand.  The program should help the state’s grid operator, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), ease worries about mining adding extra stress during periods of high system demand.  “Due to the anticipated interconnection of an increasing number of large flexible Loads in the ERCOT Region, ERCOT is establishing an interim, voluntary curtailment program that would allow these Loads to assist ERCOT in ensuring reliability during periods of high system demand,” ERCOT said in a statement.  LFLs are large-scale power consumers that have the ability to turn on and off electricity uses at a moment’s notice in order to divert energy to other grid participants. Bitcoin miners and data centers are the main type of LFLs that operate in Texas. They require immense amounts of energy and have been able to curtail their power consumption during the peak power demand with a flick of a switch.  The temporary program is expected to go live on or about Jan. 1, 2023, according to ERCOT. However, the program might be terminated at any time because ERCOT said it plans to develop a permanent reliability framework for LFLs.  The miners have already been curtailing their operations during winter storms and heat waves in Texas to serve the grid’s energy needs via so-called demand response programs. As participants of the program, the miners power down their operations in exchange for energy credits they can use in the future, thus releasing power back to the struggling grid.  However, the practice has come under scrutiny recently as a group of seven Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C., led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has questioned the impact of the miners' power usage on the grid and how it's affecting local consumers.  Earlier in July, Texas’ Large Flexible Load Task Force discussed the possibility of integrating bitcoin mining operations into the ERCOT system, which was described as “the core issues that must be resolved.”  Read more: The End of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Gold Rush",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING,Xinyi Luo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/texas-bitcoin-miners-are-offered-to-cut-electricity-usage-to-help-the-grid,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc803586201e2a9376b51146995896e5dbc275e1-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin 7-Day MA Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Sets New All-Time Low As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the realized profit/loss ratio has assumed its lowest value ever recently. Whenever a coin sits idle on the chain and the price of Bitcoin changes, it accumulates some amount of profit or loss, depending upon the direction of the price fluctuation. This profit or loss is called “unrealized” so as long as the coin holds still in the same wallet, but as soon as the holder moves/sells this coin, the total amount of profit/loss it was carrying is then said to be “realized.” The realized profit and the realized loss metrics keep track of such amounts of profit and loss being harvested by investors across the BTC market. Related Reading: For First Time Ever, Bitcoin Hash Ribbon Golden Cross Has Failed Now, the “realized profit/loss ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the current values of these two metrics. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average of this Bitcoin ratio over the history of the crypto: The 7-day MA value of the metric seems to have been quite low in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 49, 2022 As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin realized profit/loss ratio has plunged deep below a value of 1 following the FTX crash. When the indicator has values in this zone (that is, when it’s less than 1), it means BTC investors are realizing a higher amount of loss than profit right now. In the latest plunge, the metric not only dropped to pretty low values, it in fact recorded a new all-time low. This bottom level corresponded to the loss realization being 14 times more than profit realization. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears?

The House Committee on Ethics released a report on its investigation into Cawthorn’s crypto activity on Tuesday. It concluded Cawthorn broke congressional rules in promoting his personal, undisclosed crypto investment and in receiving an improper gift of favorable rates when he acquired his $150,000 in “Let’s Go Brandon” meme coins – named for a phrase meant to be considered “F*** Joe Biden.”  The panel’s investigative subcommittee “found substantial evidence that Representative Cawthorn promoted a cryptocurrency in which he had a financial interest in violation of rules protecting against conflicts of interest.”  House investigators couldn’t agree, however, on whether Cawthorn pumped the LGB token in order to personally profit from it. Accusations of insider trading were set aside after investigators couldn’t find “sufficient evidence” that the lawmaker had used nonpublic information about a NASCAR sponsorship to time his investment. The report also blamed his failure to disclose the investment on bad advice from an accountant.

The subcommittee that conducted the Cawthorn probe and wrote the report “recognizes that Members will continue to grapple with questions about how ethics rules apply in the context of digital assets and takes seriously the precedent it sets in this Report.”  The investigators, noting Cawthorn’s waning time as a member of Congress, said they couldn’t agree on a sanction and suggested the admonishment of the report would be sufficient.

On Monday, Maple said it had severed ties with Orthogonal Trading after the firm failed to make a $10 million payment that was due, triggering defaults across all of its debt within lending pools for the stablecoin USDC and wrapped ether (wETH). Maple said Orthogonal Trading had misrepresented its exposure to Sam Bankman-Fried’s collapsed FTX exchange.  Now, officials with Orthogonal Credit have come forward with a Medium post claiming they were kept out of the loop on the depth of Orthogonal Trading’s financial troubles and weren’t aware of the hole in the trading book. Orthogonal Credit, which oversaw a $30 million stablecoin lending pool named Orthogonal Trading - USDC001 on Maple, was also booted from Maple’s protocol.  “We are shocked and dismayed,” Orthogonal Credit said in the statement. “We are speechless by the extent of the exposure and liquidity position of Orthogonal Trading’s book of business.”  Orthogonal Trading, in its own brief statement released late Monday, acknowledged that it was “severely impacted by the collapse of FTX” and had been “working closely with a potential strategic investor regarding fresh funding to cover all outstanding liabilities, with good progress being achieved,” but the money didn't come through in time to meet the $10 million payment due.  “This resulted in the default of this loan and subsequently the unsuccessful conclusion to the talks we were engaged in,” Orthogonal Trading wrote.  Orthogonal Credit said in the Medium post that it operated as structurally separate from the trading business. But it said the credit business was affected because the trading unit provided funds for the so-called “first-loss capital” for the Maple lending pool managed by Orthogonal Credit. This first-loss capital is supposed to be available as a form of security back-up fund – liquidated first when a borrower defaults, per Maple’s mechanism.  That first-loss capital “will become a claim” to creditors of the lending pool, according to Medium post.  “In light of this development, the Credit Team is actively seeking strategic solutions to continue to provide Credit-as-a-Service across self-custodial decentralized finance protocols,” Orthogonal Credit said.  Orthogonal Trading, which hasn’t returned CoinDesk’s requests for comment, is the latest crypto trading firm to get caught off-guard by FTX’s stunning collapse, with assets effectively stuck on the crypto exchange after a withdrawal freeze and subsequent bankruptcy filing.",NEGATIVE,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/06/crypto-firm-orthogonal-victim-of-ftx-contagion-now-faces-internal-dissent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0904d27bddd79b792b813b16b0637d841613b412-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The letter was in response to ""new and disturbing allegations about the company’s business practices,"" the state senators wrote. They raised concerns specifically regarding Sivergate's ( SI ) role in “facilitating the improper transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda.” Media reports last week highlighted that some FTX ( FTT-USD ) customers were directed to send wire transfers through Alameda, FTX's affiliated trading firm, which was allowed to have accounts at Silvergate. That being said, FTX was said to have used more than half of its customer funds to fund risky bets . “This arrangement between FTX and Alameda relied on Silvergate’s depository services, and Alameda’s depository account with Silvergate appears to be at the center of improper transfers of customer funds,” the senators noted. SI has until December 19 to respond to the letter. In the wake of Silvergate's ( SI ) ties with FTX, investors have dumped their SI shares. Since FTX and its over 130 affiliates filed for bankruptcy protection on November 11, SI stock has plunged around 30% , and -86% year-over-year.

42421253,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXklRt,1670356996,DESK Upgrade on CoinDesk’s Website Offers Tokenized Reader Experience,"Today marks the next phase of DESK as we integrate our social token into our broader user experience. Now, our readers have the opportunity to earn DESK by reading articles, watching videos and other interactions on CoinDesk.com.  We built DESK, our evolving social token product, to be a mechanism for returning the value of engagement directly to the users who create it. We first experimented with this engagement-rewards model when we piloted a beta version of DESK at Consensus 2021, a virtual-only experience. A year later, we brought DESK out of beta and into the IRL Consensus experience on the ground in Austin, Texas.  Now we’re ready to fuel the DESK experience year-round. To amplify this week’s launch of Consensus Magazine, we’re using DESK to drive engagement with our content ahead of the upcoming Consensus 2023, the most important conversation in blockchain, crypto and Web3, happening April 26-28, again in Austin.  How to use DESK  Readers can find claimable DESK rewards on Consensus Magazine articles, Carpe Consensus podcast episodes, and Consensus-related CDTV episodes. They only need to create a coindesk.com account to claim DESK rewards on our website.  Claimed DESK rewards will accrue in each reader’s CoinDesk balance found in the DESK Hub. When they’re ready to use their tokens in the broader DESK ecosystem, readers can transfer their DESK from coindesk.com after connecting their Web3 wallet. Starting today, readers can redeem their tokens for a variety of non-fungible tokens (NFT) – pieces from featured artists, community PFPs, Consensus discounts and more. They can also use their DESK to access token-gated channels and Web3 features in our Discord community.  DESK can also be used to participate in tokenized polls and community proposals in our SnapShot space. We’re hard at work developing more DESK redemption opportunities, including a merchandise store where readers can redeem curated physical items and ways to super-charge their Consensus 2023 experience in April.  Joining the Web3 Movement  By doubling down on our experimentation with Web3 models through DESK, we’ve become active stakeholders in the space that we’ve been covering objectively since 2013. We view this work as critical to deepening our understanding and highlighting the potential of this paradigm-shifting technology.  These rewards serve as recognition and thanks to our engaged readers. By integrating our content with a tokenized layer, we aim to continue breaking away from legacy media’s one-directional model and build a virtuous feedback loop. As we continue to build out DESK functionality, this feedback loop will help us better align with our readers and empower them to participate in the development of our social token model.  DESK is utility, not money  While some social token models aspire to deliver financial gain to their holders, DESK is different. We have no plans to monetize DESK. DESK does not have a limited supply, making it inflationary by design. In fact, buying, listing or selling DESK on decentralized exchanges is against our Terms of Service to protect users from treating DESK as an investment product. DESK is not a money-making opportunity, and the tokenomics almost guarantee attempts to monetize the token will end in a net loss.  The blockchain provides a system where strangers can contribute to a collective effort, laying the foundation for a new type of organization: the tokenized community. We've seen examples of this new type of community over the past few years with NFT communities and distributed autonomous organizations (DAO). DESK is meant to highlight this non-financial application by tokenizing the value of audience engagement and returning this value to community members by providing access, influence and utility.  What’s next for DESK  This rollout marks only the beginning in developing our Web3 model for DESK on coindesk.com. While we’re proud of this upgrade, we recognize there’s room for improvement – especially our wallet functionality, currently in beta. By opening the doors to the public to claim and use DESK on the site, we aim to collect data and reader feedback to continue improving the experience.  At the heart of every successful Web3 product is a strong relationship between the participants and the developers. DESK is no different. Now that we’ve brought this experiment in innovation to our media platform and opened it to the world, we look forward to building the future together with our amazing and passionate community.

Fir Tree wants Grayscale to resume redemptions and cut fees for the trust, which is the largest publicly traded crypto fund in the world, with $10.7 billion in assets. It allows U.S. investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin without buying the asset itself.  GBTC is selling at close to a record 43% discount to the price of the underlying bitcoin in the trust and is down almost 75% this year in the wake of bitcoin's sharp decline and the collapse of several high-profile crypto firms such as FTX. Fir Tree wants to use the information it's seeking to pressure Grayscale to resume redemptions, which are not immediately available to investors, and to cut fees from the current 2%, according to Bloomberg's sources.

42411292,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMlmO,1670349159,Economic Unreality: What SEC ICO Precedents Mean for Ripple,"The story of the initial coin offering (ICO) in American law is a play in four acts: Kik Interactive, Telegram, LBRY and Ripple Labs.  With three of those four cases decided, and Ripple Labs exchanging dueling replies to motions for summary judgment on Friday, Dec. 2, we now enter the dénouement of a 10-year-long saga.  Preston Byrne, a CoinDesk columnist, is a partner of Brown Rudnick’s Digital Commerce Group. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The story begins with long-forgotten projects like Mastercoin and Counterparty, was blasted into public consciousness with projects like Ethereum and now slowly dies as American crypto developers shun the mother country for greener pastures abroad.  If Ripple loses, as I expect it will sooner or later, its defeat would be highly symbolic. The company and its associated protocol are among the longest-running and significant cryptocurrency projects in the world. XRP is practically a household name.  Back in 2012, when Ripple was founded, the term “initial coin offering” did not exist. Neither did enforcement actions against the then-miniscule crypto industry. In fact, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wouldn’t announce its first settlement for alleged registration violation until November 2018 with the Airfox and Paragon ICOs. For context, Ripple’s network went into production on Jan. 1, 2013 – nearly six years earlier.  Apart from the fact that XRP has sat in the top 10 coins by market cap for nearly a decade, the Ripple project also represented a unique approach to consensus at a time when alternative approaches to blockchain coordination of any kind were only a few years old.  Generally speaking, blockchains in the 2013-2015 period worked in one of four ways:  proof-of-work, which requires computation energy to secure the network  proof-of-stake, which enables token holders to validate blocks  permissioned, i.e., where block creators are chosen by some entity, and  that weird thing Ripple does  Ripple utilizes a novel consensus mechanism where a list of nodes, the so-called “UNL” or “Unique Node List,” conduct round-robin voting until 80% of them agree as to which transactions should be appended to the end of a chain. This is similar to a model more commonly known today as delegated proof-of-stake (except, without the stake). Tendermint or Cosmos take similar approaches to this voting process, except without the UNL (and markedly more decentralization).  The advantages of this round-robin approach, it was claimed by Ripple’s proponents, are that the network can process many more transactions at far lower cost. The disadvantages, detractors say, are that it requires a higher degree of trust and is not truly decentralized.  See also: SEC Wants to 'Remake the Law,' Rather Than 'Apply It,' | Opinion  Thankfully, Ripple’s legal troubles are not about the protocol – they’re about the tokens. On genesis, Ripple Labs, or its predecessor OpenCoin entity, minted 100 billion XRP tokens, which were subsequently distributed to the company and early officers and then sold into the wider crypto markets to fund Ripple Labs’ operations.  At the time, there was much spirited debate about whether tokens sold in such a manner constituted securities. On one side were crypto entrepreneurs who claimed that token sales could serve as a lightly regulated governance mechanism and crowdfunding tool. On the other were many lawyers, myself included, who thought that the SEC would eventually get wise and crack down on the practice.  As we now know, the skeptics were right.  The first ICO to go down in a big way was Kik Interactive. Kik was, or rather still is, a lightly-used messaging app which pivoted into crypto at the height of the first great ICO boom in 2017. Kik sold tokens directly to the public without a registration statement in effect. The SEC sued and, 16 months later, Kik lost on a motion for summary judgment.  Telegram was the SEC’s next scalp. Telegram is a popular, allegedly encrypted messaging app founded by Russian billionaire Pavel Durov. Famously, despite being one of the most used messaging apps on the planet, Telegram generates no revenue. To remedy this, Telegram issued and sold a staggering $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency tokens in various private fundraising transactions via private placement over the course of 2018.  Telegram differed from Kik Interactive mainly in that Telegram sold tokens first via private placement to high net worth and offshore investors, who would presumably later unload those tokens onto U.S. markets and thus to U.S. retail purchasers. Mere days before the tokens were to be issued, the SEC sued Telegram and obtained an emergency restraining order halting the token conversion. Here, too, the SEC would quickly win on a motion for preliminary injunction. The official Telegram token project died immediately (but has continued on in various and unrelated forms).  LBRY (pronounced “Library”) was the next project on the chopping block. LBRY is a reimagining of YouTube with decentralized monetization tools, designed to solve the problem of politically-motivated censorship at companies like Google and Facebook. The token performed a real function in a real application. The sale of that token, however, was deemed to be an offering of investment contracts.  As in Kik Interactive and Telegram, LBRY too lost a motion for summary judgment, this time in New Hampshire. LBRY has said that “LBRY Inc. will likely be dead in the near future.”  This brings us to the present day. The SEC argues that between 2013 and 2020 Ripple raised $1.3 billion by selling XRP, which represented an “investment contract.” On Dec. 2, the SEC and Ripple exchanged dueling motions in what should be the last shots fired (or at least among the last shots fired) between them, before a judge in the Southern District of New York will rule, once again, on the legality of a token project.  Boiling down Ripple’s argument in this case to a single line on Twitter, company counsel Stuart Alderoty resorted to something akin to denial. He argued, among other things, that there is no investment contract because there is no formal contract between Ripple and XRP purchasers, and that the tokens were sold for consumptive use.  The SEC, for its part, refers to “economic reality” of Ripple’s sales not less than 15 times, asking the court to look “beyond boilerplate disclaimers” to the facts as they stand – including who bought tokens and how they were used. This economic reality allegedly “forecloses any argument that Ripple offered and sold XRP primarily for consumptive use.”  Reviewing the precedent lawsuits, it’s pretty clear which argument has been more successful in federal courts. In Kik, Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote that “form should be disregarded for substance and the emphasis should be on economic reality,” (citing 1967’s Tcherepenin v. Knight, 389 U.S. 332, 336).  In Telegram, Judge P. Kevin Castel pointed out that “Congress intended the application of [the securities laws] to turn on the economic realities underlying a transaction, and not on the name appended thereto,” (citing Glen-Arden v. Constantino, 493 F.2d 1027, 1034 (2d Cir. 1974)).  See also: SEC Could Use BlockFi as Object Lesson for Clear Crypto Rules | Opinion  In LBRY, Judge Paul Barbadoro wrote that “the focus of the inquiry is on the objective economic realities of the transaction rather than the form the transaction takes,” (citing United Housing Foundation v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 848 (1975)).  The SEC concluded its reply brief to Ripple and the court by stating “the registration regime established by the federal securities laws does not regulate ‘industries.’ It regulates conduct … for the benefit of investors.”  Does it really?  At this point, the crypto industry has more or less resigned itself to the fact that a garden-variety ICO likely satisfies all of the limbs of the Howey Test, a foundational set of standards to determine what is a security. I expect the outcome of the Ripple litigation will only confirm that.  However, there is another economic reality that needs to be considered: today, it is abundantly clear crypto is never going away. For all the precedents discussing “economic reality,” the more material fact is that there are hundreds of millions of crypto users around the globe, and that number is growing exponentially, and many are Americans.  Telling next-generation crypto projects that the only path to compliance is to “come in and register” or drop dead is like trying to take a Ford Model T into space. Crypto’s basic mode of operation is by self-custody and directly peer-to-peer transactions over the Internet, not via paper forms signed with wet ink and mailed to a transfer agent or broker-dealer. There are no national securities exchanges which support crypto asset trading. The SEC won’t even approve a regulated exchange-trade fund (ETF), despite many proposals and much market demand. The list goes on.  It's pretty clear that a huge class of investors doesn’t want what the SEC’s selling. In fact, they want the opposite. Millions of digital natives use trustless smart contracts daily for loans and other financial beasties, or grant and purchase assets like fractional royalty cash flows. They do so in an instant, from anywhere in the world, with anyone in the world, on handheld supercomputers smaller than a chocolate bar. Very soon they will do so with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Investors will literally have superhuman abilities at their fingertips.  For the last six years, crypto has accepted the economic realities of a Depression-era regulatory scheme. The only question for America, at this juncture, is whether we want to back off from that regime just a little bit so we can nurture and supervise these new crypto companies right here at home – or persist, and drive them offshore.  The old ways are finished, whether Congress likes it or not.

42411308,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMmZz,1670348591,"BTC Dominance Is Behaving Weirdly, and That’s Sort of Good","In the current whirlwind of dismay and disappointment (or should I say shock and shame?), many in the Bitcoin ecosystem are no doubt fondly remembering simpler times when the bitcoin currency crashing was all we had to stress about. In 2011, BTC’s drawdown reached 93%, a market cap loss of $172 million. The 2014-15 crypto winter saw bitcoin market cap lose over 80%, wiping out $11.3 billion of value. Sigh, those were the days.  Obviously, I’m not serious – that time was, no doubt, shockingly painful for anyone in the industry back then. The Mt. Gox implosion at one stage felt existential – sure, the Bitcoin blockchain would continue to exist after the largest exchange turned out to be engaged in fraud, but would anyone care? The fallout, however, was limited to a relatively small circle of libertarians, cryptographic experimenters and the techno-curious. It was barely covered in the mainstream press. This turned out to be a blessing because the bruised could get to work rebuilding, out of the glare of mainstream attention.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  The contrast with today’s market could not be more stark because the world has been flooded with a torrent of headlines covering every possible angle of the FTX exchange’s implosion. Wednesday’s Andrew Ross Sorkin/Sam Bankman-Fried interview at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit was viewed by probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. The extent of the fallout is as yet unknown, there is serious talk about how it might impact traditional finance and skeptics feel they should be involved in shaping what the reconstruction might look like. The damage has hit thousands of assets, costing almost $160 billion in market cap.  Back in 2011-2015, bitcoin was the whole market. Now, that is far from the case. This is unreservedly good – the range of technological spin-offs and evolving use cases has probably surprised even the most optimistic of the early adopters. And the rapid spread of interest and adoption has grown the value of the entire market. It has also, through diversification, reduced overall market risk.  This last assertion may sound out of place, given the implosion the industry has just witnessed. But it has been an industry implosion much more than a market implosion. The market still works. Crypto assets (with a couple of notable exceptions) are still doing what they do. Bitcoin still produces secure blocks, Ethereum still pays staking rewards, decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens continue to incentivize platform participation, value is still transferred on-chain. The market infrastructure has changed; the market itself, not so much.  Read more: Steps to Crypto Recovery: Where 'We' Go From Here | Opinion  We can see this in a key metric that serves as an indicator of sentiment, and that I subliminally introduced in the previous paragraphs: bitcoin dominance. This is simply the percentage of total crypto market cap accounted for by BTC, and is tracked through the BTC.D index. Up until the emergence of Ethereum in 2015, it was around 99% (a few smaller tokens had emerged, none of which gained significant traction). Ethereum’s early success triggered a Cambrian explosion of innovation, new tokens emerged at an astonishing pace and the initial coin offering frenzy of 2017 pushed bitcoin’s dominance down to 37%. The drop coincided with a 470% increase in the overall crypto market cap in the space of approximately three months.  This introduces a salient feature of bitcoin’s dominance: its role as a sentiment gauge. In times of high speculation, such as in late 2017, BTC.D drops. BTC is the least volatile of the nonstablecoin crypto assets, and when traders and short-term investors are feeling confident they tend to prefer the high risk/high reward offered by some of the smaller tokens.  The 2018 crash and the ensuing bear market reversed that trend. The speculative assets fell by much more than the relatively “stable” bitcoin and its dominance climbed, reaching over 70% in August 2019. Then the market got confident again, new layer 1 blockchains attracted attention, and BTC.D headed down, reaching 58% a year later. We then saw an unusual phenomenon – a speculative market in which bitcoin was a star performer. In August 2020, MicroStrategy announced its first major BTC purchase; in the following weeks, several other firms, funds and millionaires revealed BTC holdings. The institutions had arrived.  In early 2021, BTC corrected from its highs just as institutional and celebrity interest in other tokens started to take off, with a flurry of new funds, new listings and new services. BTC.D dropped as lower-cap tokens took the spotlight, outshining BTC’s performance even as it reached its all-time high of $69,000 on Nov. 10. The following chart shows how the normally high 60-day correlation between BTC and other tokens dropped sharply during this period.  We’re getting to the weird part: BTC.D spiked during this year’s May/June market drama along with a rotation into the relatively “safe” crypto asset, although the metric remained below 50%. It then understandably declined as the dust settled. But it hasn’t really moved since, even though there has been plenty of cause for fear.  Over the month of November, as the FTX contagion rippled through the system, crypto’s market cap lost 15%. Yet, BTC.D oscillated between 40.0% and 40.9%. It can’t possibly be telling us that sentiment is flat.  Has BTC.D lost its role as a sentiment gauge? That would imply that BTC has lost its role as the “safe” crypto asset. Or could there be something else going on?  It’s possible that BTC has not outperformed other crypto assets because, rather than rotate into relative safety, investors have largely left the market. BTC spot volumes have dropped to local lows after the panic spike earlier this month. But they are still above levels at the beginning of the year, while those for ETH are notably lower. This feels like an exit but not a massive one.  It's more likely that we are witnessing the consolidation of the crypto market’s speculative nature.  This may sound alarming as many of us now instinctively recoil at the thought of more speculation, after the damage done to portfolios and reputation by shady actors over the past year. We also flinch just imagining how regulators are sharpening their knives to excise heightened risk from the market. All this is reasonable, as is the relief felt by builders and creators that the industry can focus on the constructive aspects of crypto potential now that risky froth has been washed out.  Only, it hasn’t. We’re seeing this not only in the flat BTC.D but also in the performance of some smaller tokens. Over the past month, one of the worst for crypto in recent memory, litecoin (LTC), is up over 25%, OKEx’s token OKB is up more than 36%, the Binance ecosystem wallet’s token TWT is up over 110% and DeFi exchange GMX’s token is up over 33%. The past week has produced scores of 10+% jumps among medium-cap tokens such as dogecoin, AAVE and Uniswap, among others.  The FTX implosion has not removed speculation; nor has macro uncertainty plus the broad withdrawal of liquidity from crypto and traditional markets. What will? Nothing. Speculation is here to stay.  As much as some of us may wish it away, speculation is a feature of free markets. It is also a feature of sophisticated ones, and we want crypto markets to be both. Speculators may be all about buying an asset and selling at a higher price (or selling an asset and buying lower if they’re shorting) rather than actually contributing to a project’s growth. But that is a key feature of markets – the freedom to buy and sell at prices we deem fair. Without the ability to express different opinions, markets become predictable and altogether uninteresting.  See also: After FTX: Rebuilding Trust in Crypto's Founding Mission | Opinion  They also become less useful – speculators may contribute to volatility, but they also enhance price discovery by reflecting opinions weighted by capital, closing arbitrage gaps and providing exit liquidity.  Speculation is not harmless: It can destabilize markets, especially if done with high leverage. But in most cases the issue is more with the facilitating platforms than with the trading behavior. Many critics point to the price distortions as evidence of speculative damage, conflating aggressive trading with market manipulation. In the confusing aftermath of the FTX implosion, even industry insiders are assuming that speculation rather than a violation of trust was at fault. And for many of us who are in this industry because of its potential to improve financial freedom and integrity, the desperate rush for returns feels, well, uncomfortably superficial.  Speculation bashing may align with many core crypto values, and it does have a certain cathartic utility, but it is pointless. The strange behavior of BTC.D during the recent turmoil tells us that the market composition has changed. Bitcoin is still the anchor asset, by a wide margin, but the volatility of its protagonism is weakening. This is a sign of a maturing asset class. That this should become apparent during one of the industry’s darkest times is cause for hope.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/06/btc-dominance-is-behaving-weirdly-and-thats-sort-of-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26d07b842e7a70e575b54bac741eeecfa63692f6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42388488,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHIKb,1670348348,Over $30M Pours Into ApeCoin Staking in First Day,"One day after the Ape Foundation opened staking for its APE currency, over $30 million worth of the tokens has been deposited into its contract.  The token, which is the native currency of the Yuga Labs ecosystem, was airdropped to holders of the Web3 collective’s mainstay non-fungible token (NFT) collections, Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club, back in March.  The price of the token itself hasn’t changed much in the weeks leading up to the staking – at the time of writing, APE was trading at about $4.20, the same price as two weeks ago. At its peak in the days before Yuga Labs’ Otherside metaverse land sale last April, APE was trading for over $22.  Holders can stake their APE tokens or Bored Ape/Mutant Ape NFTs on ApeStake.io to start earning rewards on Dec. 12. According to the company’s website, 96.2 million $APE (worth around $391 million as of writing) has been allocated as a reward for users who participate in staking.  Staking remains restricted in several countries, including the U.S., where the majority of Bored Ape holders live. The Ape Foundation, which is a decentralized autonomous organization run by a handful of prominent community members, cited regulatory concerns as reasoning.  “Unfortunately, in today’s regulatory environment, we had no good alternative,” the company said in a statement.  All my APE gone  An important thing for people considering staking their NFTs should note: If someone staking their Bored Ape NFT sells it, they will also be giving up their staked APE to the new buyer, a problem that a handful of Bored Ape holders have already fallen victim to. Community members have made an effort to alert stakers of the caveat via Twitter:  On Tuesday morning, Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, announced that an APE staking program would be arriving to its NFT marketplace when rewards begin accruing on Dec. 12.  The staking hoopla has done little to energize prices for Bored Ape NFTs, which are still down significantly (more than 50% in ETH) since the summer. At the time of writing, the floor price for a Bored Ape on NFT marketplace OpenSea was just under 70 ETH, worth about $87,000.",NEUTRAL,ETH | APE,ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | APE,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/06/30m-pours-into-apecoin-staking-in-first-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b544ba3ff0d0ce5717b1c59e11165ee648b90e5b-960x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

UNI is the token associated with the exchange. UNI has no real utility within the platform. The biggest justification for holding the token is for participation in platform governance. With the recent revelation that Uniswap is collecting some user data, a decision for which token holders never voted, I think UNI's fundamental bull case has diminished. Back in May of this year, I added Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) to the BlockChain Reaction portfolio. Shortly after that, I provided a public article detailing some of the key trends and metrics that I felt justified a UNI long position. Given the recent collapse of FTX (FTT-USD) and the market response to that centralized exchange blowup, I think it's important to provide an update to my view on UNI. Centralized Vs. Decentralized As I've detailed in previous articles for both Seeking Alpha and BlockChain Reaction, it's important to remember that FTX is a failure of a centralized business. It is not a failure of any decentralized network or decentralized exchange. The FTX collapse is theoretically a great catalyst for platforms like Uniswap and various other decentralized exchanges, or DEXes. Since FTX paused withdrawals, we've seen a widespread movement through crypto to remove assets from centralized custodians: ETH Exchange Transactions (CoinMetrics) Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the network where Uniswap was built, had a large spike from a little under 38k exchange withdrawal transactions on Monday November 6th up to 82k exchange transactions on the 8th when market participants became nervous about third party risk. November 8th was the largest single day for Ethereum exchange withdrawals since June 14th - two days after Celsius halted withdrawals. 1 ETH Min Wallet Addresses (CoinMetrics) We can see the move to self-custody following FTX reflected in some of the on-chain wallet address metrics as well. Wallet addresses with at least 1 ETH spiked from 1.61 million the day before FTX to 1.76 million at the start of December. Crypto holders have rightly become more uneasy about leaving assets on exchanges. DEXes like Uniswap should thrive in a larger movement toward self-custody. Uniswap Usage As can probably be expected, with more ETH moving off exchanges and into self-custody wallets, DEX platforms like Uniswap have seen spikes in application usage compared to previous averages in 2022. Uniswap Daily Active Users (TokenTerminal) The sustained move to a new high in Uniswap daily active users for 2022 actually started before the FTX collapse. Interestingly, the bigger increase in Uniswap DAUs happened in late October rather than early November. That said, even after a little dip since the October spike, Uniswap daily active users are still higher than the pre-October move and much higher than the activity in the summer months. What has fallen though is the trading volume. After a massive spike from $1.5 billion in trading volume on Monday November 7th, Uniswap trading volume combined for over $16 billion over the next three days. Volume has generally been steadily declining since that initial surge last month. Uniswap's Tokenomics Problem Even after the enormous surge in trading volume a month ago, the UNI token price didn't really reflect the increased usage of the protocol: 1 Month Performance (Seeking Alpha) UNI behaved very similarly to top crypto assets Ethereum and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The token suffered a large drawdown and has failed to regain pre-FTX price levels despite a fundamental setup that should favor the protocol for the token. The question is why? The last few weeks have exposed what I now believe to be a serious flaw in Uniswap's tokenomics; UNI is not a utility token. It isn't required by users to facilitate swaps. Holders of UNI don't get reduction on fees. The only conceivable purpose for holding UNI for any fundamental purpose is if you want to vote on governance proposals. None of this is new. But now we're seeing that governance may not really be as strong of a reason for holding as initially thought. Do UNI Holders Really Have Control? Governance over a protocol is a fine reason to hold a token if you want to be able to vote on the protocol's future direction. I don't personally think it's a great reason to hold a token by itself. But I can get past that if the governance story is strong enough. For Uniswap, I now question if the idea of platform governance is a good enough reason to hold UNI specifically. Uniswap recently announced the platform is collecting quite a bit of user information. While it is not collecting names, physical addresses, or IP addresses, it does collect device-level information to better personalize the platform for users: We and our third-party services providers may access and collect information from localStorage, mobile deviceID, cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to provide and personalize the Services and features of the Services for you across sessions. Many in the DeFi space were very upset about this because it seemingly flies in the face of ""web3"" for a crypto application to be doing what is very much viewed as ""web2"" behavior. At present, governance is the only fundamental reason to have exposure to UNI. And this type of data collection was never voted on by the token holders. Until token holders are rewarded with platform fee distributions or given some sort of in-app benefit for holding, ""governance"" over the platform may no longer be a valid reason to hold the token in my view. The Airdrop Uniswap tokens were originally airdropped to roughly 300,000 early users of the Uniswap platform. It's been a little over two years since that airdrop and incredibly, only 6.7% of the wallets that claimed airdropped UNI tokens are still holding those UNI balances: Dune Analytics/Jhackworth Almost 220k wallets actually claimed the token of the 300k or so that were eligible for the drop. Of those 220k wallets that claimed, less than 15k airdropped wallet addresses still hold the UNI. That means that more than 205k of the original protocol users didn't feel the token was worth keeping and several thousand more never even claimed the token airdrop to begin with. Summary Another potential headwind facing Uniswap is what liquidity providers do in response to a "" fee switch "" vote. Later this month, DAO members will likely decide to turn on a 10% fee that will impact liquidity providers in the Uniswap platform. This could conceivably push LPs away from Uniswap and into alternative DEX platforms. But to this point that remains to be seen. Uniswap will be testing the theories should the voters approve the switch. The current environment should theoretically favor decentralized exchange adoption. Uniswap is among the top DEXes in the entire crypto market but has seen an exodus of token holders following a token airdrop two years ago. There are still hundreds of thousands of UNI token holders at this time but the only fundamental reason for holding the token is platform governance. Given the recent finding that important platform decisions like data collection aren't actually being voted on, there is a centralization of power concern pertaining to Uniswap that I think raises some alarm. Until there is utility for the token within in the protocol either through fee reduction or revenue payout, I can't see much of a purpose in holding UNI other than as a digital collectible or to simply speculate on a higher token price. I sold UNI from my crypto investment portfolio in November and broke even from the May purchase. There may come a time when UNI has a fundamental justification as a token investment, but I don't think we're there yet.",NEUTRAL,UNI,EXCHANGE | ICO | TRADING | UNI | AIRDROP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562660-uniswap-token-governance-no-longer-good-enough?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5224665.jpeg

The asset’s price has crossed the $14 mark, which has acted as a stiff resistance for the coin. Despite that, SOL has not secured the $14 mark as a solid support line. If buyers start to wane, SOL could fall to its next support line. SOL trades at a 94% discount to its all-time high set in 2021. There are two important price resistances that SOL has to break through to target a move to $15. A move below $14 will land the altcoin near the $13.60 support line. Related Reading: Santa Came Early In Crypto? Bitcoin Rally May Have Passed Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was exchanging hands at $14 on the one-day chart. The bulls could finally push through the $14 resistance mark; however, demand for the coin remains wobbly despite an uptick. Bulls must ensure that the Solana price remains above the $14 mark to surpass the two vital trading levels. Immediate resistance was at $14.20, above which SOL would face resistance at $14.90 before revisiting $15. The nearest support line for Solana was at $13.60; however, a fall to $13.60 could further drag the asset price to $12. The amount of SOL traded in the last session was green, which showed short-term bullishness. Technical Analysis SOL had broken above its descending resistance line, and the coin has been attempting to move north ever since that. In the shorter time frame, Solana formed a bullish divergence. The Relative Strength Index was past the 40-mark, which meant that buyers were slowly gaining strength and that SOL was registering demand. A bullish divergence is related to positive price action. Similarly, the price of Solana was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line; this sign means that the buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Of the increase in buyers, the altcoin registered a buy signal on the one-day chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence underwent a bullish crossover and formed green histograms, which were a buy signal for SOL. Buyers could profit in a shorter time frame. The Chaikin Money Flow indicates the capital inflows and outflows; although CMF was above the half-line, there was a significant decline in capital inflows at press time. For Solana to continue to make gains, the asset has to trade above the $14.20 price mark. Related Reading: TRON Ecosystem To Undergo Changes – A Bane Or Boon To TRX Price?

Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lacking Momentum Above $17k, BTC Holders Are Safe: Here’s Why This move has removed the popular meme coin from their list of top ten assets. Shiba Inu is also feeling the effects of the recent downturn in prices. Investors’ faith in crypto is low due to the FTX crash. However, some investors are still optimistic about the rise of crypto with more adoption and utilization. Vital data from WhaleStats reveal that the top 100 whales on the Ethereum blockchain have switched allegiances from the SHIB coin. This move makes crypto observers wonder if there is any hope left for the token. The recent hack and subsequent theft of Ethereum tokens from FTX might also have a part to play in this decision. SHIB Setting A stage For Bull Run Shiba Inu showed signs of life jumping by 5.94% in the last 24 hours. The price of the token moved from $0.00000935 to $0.00000990. SHIB displayed a long green hourly candle. It represents a surge from the price levels maintained since November 22, when the price was at the $0.00000821 level. SHIB’s price has increased, posting a gain of up to 20% on the former price. In seven days, Shiba Inu has risen to 8.38% showing signs of a positive trend. However, it is still 88.91% below the all-time high of $0.00008845 achieved on October 28, 2021. Whales dump SHIB Holdings However – It Is Still Relevant To Investors. According to WhaleStats, the past weekend had whales dropping SHIB from their list of top 10 assets. Whales have now shifted their attention to other altcoins like MANA and stETH. These two assets are top of the list and where the holding volume among the whales is much. Also on the top ten list are ANT, ENJ, UTK, CVC, TKN, DAWN, and SNT. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears? SHIB is also not available on the top twenty list held by the whales. In contrast, the rich list on the WhaleStats platform shows that the largest Ethereum Investors still have Shiba Inu holdings. The top whale on this list holds an enormous 18,113,302,000,496 SHIB worth $178,053,759. Other ETH whales possess around $100 million worth of SHIB or less. The top ten whales behind the largest – ETH whale hold; between $98 – $100 million worth of SHIB tokens each. It means that each wallet holds around 10,000,000,000,008 SHIB. The statistics show that all is not lost for Shiba Inu since investors still regard it as a store of value. The total number of SHIB holders is currently at 1,255,976.

The senators' letter comes at a time when the investment community is suspicious about what role Silvergate may have played in this activity.  FTX and the related entities in Bankman-Fried's crypto empire held around 20 different accounts at Silvergate, according to a bankruptcy filing.  ""[There are] reports that Mr. Bankman-Fried ‘secretly transferred some $10 billion of customer funds to his trading vehicle, Alameda Research,’ to fund ‘risky bets,’ violating both U.S. securities laws and FTX’s own terms of service,"" said the letter. ""We are concerned about Silvergate’s role in these activities because of reports suggesting that Silvergate facilitated the transfer of FTX customer funds to Alameda.""  Silvergate shares are adding to their roughly 50% decline since the FTX collapse, down another 6.15% and touching a new 52-week low in Tuesday morning trade.

Members of the Financial Stability Board underlined the urgency of having a global framework for regulating and supervising crypto, as set out in an October consultation. They said the FSB would look closer at “DeFi-specific vulnerability indicators,” examining the interlinkages of a sector that is fast-growing and can replicate traditional activities like lending, but which is hard to regulate using traditional tools.  “Crypto trading platforms, combining multiple activities that are normally separated in traditional finance, can lead to concentrations of risk, conflicts of interest, and a misuse of client assets,” the FSB said, noting it had drawn “preliminary lessons from the recent failure of FTX.”  The Financial Stability Board includes central bankers, financial regulators and finance ministry officials from 24 jurisdictions including the U.S., U.K. and European Union, and its standards have been influential for regulating the traditional finance sector since 2008.

Related Reading: TRON Ecosystem To Undergo Changes – A Bane Or Boon To TRX Price? As of this writing, Bitcoin is moving between $16,900 and $17,100. The cryptocurrency still maintains profits from its previous week, but today’s trading session has leaned towards the downside. No Christmas Miracle For Bitcoin? In a recent market update, trading desk QCP Capital highlighted the positive performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in December. These digital assets have been closely following the trajectory of the stock market. The firm believes equities have been showing strength on the back of a potential U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) pivot. The financial institution hinted at moderating its monetary policy and reducing its interest rate hike program. This potential change triggered “strong” bullish momentum for the stock market, allowing Bitcoin and Ethereum to rise 13% and 22% in the past two weeks. Despite the collapse of FTX in November and the fear of contagion, its value is almost back to October levels. In this context, market participants have been quick to call out the end of the bear market, but QCP Capital claims that there are reasons to maintain a bearish bias. For example, robust economic data from the U.S. might support the Fed to continue its tightening policy. QCP Capital stated the following regarding the current price action in the legacy financial market and its impact on the crypto market: While many are saying that BTC and ETH are lagging equities and should play catch up, rather we see it as equities having overshot fundamentals and will soon be reeled back. Thus, the possibilities of the stock market pushing down on Bitcoin and Ethereum are high. There are indications of possible downside pressure for stocks, crypto, and risk on assets. Analyst Caleb Franzen pointed to the VIX index; an indicator used to measure volatility in legacy financial markets. This metric has provided a solid strategy for risk asset buyers in 2022. The analyst said: The CBOE Market Volatility Index #VIX fell below 20 last week, but has launched higher today! As I’ve shared since August, the top strategy of 2022 has been: • Buy risk assets when $VIX > 30 • Sell risk assets when $VIX < 20 Related Reading: Peter Schiff And Jim Cramer Present Their Doom Scenarios For Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin Regardless of the bullish expectations, the crypto market might see more selling pressure in the coming weeks.

42393927,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brcRZd,1670338560,Most Influential Blockchain Projects,"In November 2008, a pseudonymous user by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper on the Cryptography Mailing List, outlining plans for a decentralized digital currency. Almost a year later, Satoshi went on to create the first major cryptocurrency, bitcoin.  The meteoric rise of bitcoin led to the creation of new digital assets and emerging use cases. Inspired by the success of bitcoin, Vitalik Buterin published the Ethereum white paper in 2013. While Satoshi helped create the standard for cryptocurrencies, Vitalik’s Ethereum blockchain created a baseline for what has become the modern crypto economy.  While the Bitcoin blockchain created a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that created a new financial paradigm, Ethereum was designed with a different purpose. What made Ethereum unique was its smart contract functionality. Smart contracts are contracts that can automatically execute transactions if certain conditions are met without any intermediaries. These can facilitate financial transactions, voting, governance, among other things.  Ethereum is an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that provides the foundation for any developer to build decentralized applications (dapp), which use smart contracts, on its platform.  The launch of Ethereum brought a wide range of use cases to blockchain technology. In turn, Ethereum-based projects have influenced the modern crypto economy. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most influential blockchain projects and how their roots in Ethereum led to emerging crypto sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).  Uniswap  Although it wasn’t the first DeFi project, Uniswap has solidified its place as one of the most influential blockchain projects in decentralized finance. Specifically, Uniswap created the standard practice of implementing autonomous trading mechanisms known as automated market makers (AMM) for decentralized exchanges. Unlike traditional, centralized exchanges, AMMs eliminate the need for intermediary parties for trading by replacing order books with self-executing computer programs.  Before it became the largest decentralized spot exchange in the world, Uniswap started out in 2016 as an idea in a Reddit post written by Vitalik Buterin, which explored the concept of AMMs and the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEX) that didn’t require a traditional order book. After seeing Vitalk’s vision and receiving encouragement from the Ethereum Foundation to learn how to code, Hayden Adams went on to launch Uniswap two years later.  The development of AMMs stands as one of the most transformative milestones in DeFi. Since the launch of Uniswap, the majority of DEXs are either AMM or AMM-based, including Curve, PancakeSwap, Osmosis and many others.  Etheria  Just three months after the launch of the Ethereum mainnet in 2015, Cyrus Adkisson put his virtual world Etheria on display for Ethereum’s DEVCON 1 conference. In Etheria, players could buy and sell hexagonal plots of land for a price of one ether (ETH). Because land is non-fungible and Adkisson needed a way to verify that the owners had a proper “title,” he represented the land using non-fungible tokens.  Etheria represents an important moment in NFT history because it was the first time an NFT was created on the Ethereum network. Today, many NFTs and NFT marketplaces (OpenSea, Nifty Gateway and Rarible, for example) are based on the Ethereum blockchain. Etheria not only introduced the world to the modern NFT, but it also served as an early model for NFT collectibles, metaverse-based land sales and blockchain-based gaming.  The DAO  In 2016, some early members of the Ethereum community got together and announced their community-developed project: Genesis DAO. Dubbed “The DAO” by the Ethereum community, the project was the first decentralized autonomous organization on the Ethereum blockchain.  Using smart contracts, DAOs create a corporate structure that’s open, transparent and void of any hierarchical management. The DAO was specifically designed to operate like a venture capital fund for decentralized projects, however DAOs can take on many forms, serve different purposes and bring value to virtually anything.  The DAO helped inspire future DAO-based projects and introduced the idea of decentralized governance through code. Today, the top 10 DAOs hold nearly $2 billion in their treasuries and DAO governance is being used for everything from buying one-of-a-kind Wu Tang Clan albums to managing DEXs like Uniswap that handle over $1 billion in transactions each day.  Though the DAO was incredibly influential, its existence on Ethereum was short-lived. Shortly after its launch, a code issue resulted in the hacker exploiting The DAO for $60 million. As a result, the DAO has also become infamously known for the 3.6 million ether hack that resulted in the split of the blockchain into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

42388503,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHJEj,1670337133,"Bitcoin Underperforms S&P 500 as Stocks Have Overshot Fundamentals, Crypto Trading Firm QCP Says","While some expect bitcoin (BTC) to catch up with the recent rally in stocks, Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital suggests otherwise.  According to QCP Capital, stocks have overtaken fundamentals and could soon fall back.  ""We say this because the two-year Treasury yield, which has been a reliable indicator of the market's direction all year, is, in fact, moving in line with BTC and ETH, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have rallied away,"" QCP said in Monday's market update.  Risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, have mostly moved in the opposite direction to the two-year U.S. Treasury yield this year as the Federal Reserve embarked on its most aggressive rate hike cycle in decades. The two-year yield closely tracks the near-term interest rate and inflation expectations.  While bitcoin and ether continue to respect the negative correlation with the two-year yield, stocks have decoupled since mid-October on hopes that inflation has peaked and the Fed will pivot toward liquidity-boosting rate cuts in the second half of next year.  The chart by QCP compares the inverted graph of the two-year yield with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, bitcoin and ether going back to January.  The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have chalked up double-digit gains since mid-October, moving away from the two-year yield. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has dropped 6%.  If bond markets, considered more rational and unsentimental than equities, believed in the narrative, the two-year yield would have seen a sharp drop. In other words, the inverted graph of the two-year yield would be much higher and in sync with the indices than it is right now.  Therefore, stocks appear to have run ahead of themselves in pricing the Fed pivot.  The relative resilience of the two-year yield compared to the 10-year yield suggests the same. The two-year note yielded 4.40% at press time – 48 basis points less than the year-to-date high of 4.88% reached on Nov. 4. On the contrary, the 10-year note yielded 3.55%, or 75 basis points less compared to the 2022 high of 4.33% hit on Oct. 21.  Looking ahead  The two-year yield could climb toward 5%, putting downward pressure on risk assets.  That's because the new projections from the Fed's 19 policymakers scheduled for release next week are likely to show rates continuing to rise next year and peaking at the terminal rate above 5%, contradicting hopes for rate cuts next year.  ""Assuming the two-year yield is still the market's way of pricing the Fed's terminal rate next year, then we potentially still have more downside, as the Fed warns it will now hike rates past 5%,"" QCP noted.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/06/stocks-have-overshot-fundamentals-crypto-trading-firm-qcp-says-as-bitcoin-underperforms-sp-500,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9349f1e208511c551d1ef50b232e931c30fbe33d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the Stax, Ledger was hoping to develop a more stylish and functional device than the previous Nano S – which looks more like a USB thumb drive – and one that can win mass adoption by crypto users, according to Pascal Gauthier, Ledger's CEO and chairman.  “We wanted to do something that is more fun and fits with where culture is going,” said Ian Rogers, Ledger’s chief experience officer, in an interview with CoinDesk.  The wallet is a credit card-sized device with embedded magnets so that multiple devices can easily be stacked. The outside is a wraparound e-ink display that can show transaction details and even NFTs.  The Ledger Stax will retail for $279, compared to $79 for the Nano S Plus and $149 for the Nano X wallet.  It's perhaps a propitious time Ledger has chosen to launch a new hardware wallet as interest in self-custody appears to be picking up following the collapse and asset freeze at centralized crypto exchange FTX and other crypto firms.  “We were ready for this moment,” Rogers noted.  Indeed, Ledger said Nov. 14 – three days afterFTX filed for bankruptcy – was the best sales day ever for its devices, while the previous daywas its second-best sales day ever. And November was its best sales month ever.  Ledger said it has sold over five million hardware wallets in 200 countries since the company was founded in Paris in 2014.  The Ledger Stax will be available in the first quarter of 2023 with pre-ordering available on Ledger.com. It uses secure USB-C to connect to the Ledger Live app on a laptop, and Bluetooth to connect to the mobile app on a smartphone. It will also utilize the upcoming wallet extension Ledger Connect to connect to Web3 apps.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | WALLET,Nelson Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/ledger-taps-ipod-creator-tony-fadell-for-new-crypto-hardware-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/49d6ed050bb697fb3abe8f488afa7dfb693bfb1e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX, which was once valued to the tune of $32B, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11 following its abrupt implosion, spreading financial contagion throughout the crypto ecosystem.

The marketplace aims to streamline access to decentralized applications for users and developers.  Recently, relationships between centralized entities and Web3 technologies haven’t been very productive. Last week, Coinbase halted mobile non-fungible token (NFT) transfers due to Apple’s app store demanding 30% of the gas fees associated with transfers.  Jason Shah, head of growth at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that while its app store is centralized it's not a monetized product, and aims to provide free access to Web3-curious users and developers eager to put their technologies to use for an audience.  “We are all about getting free resources to the community that we think can grow with it,” said Shah. “Again, we’ve built ways into the system to have the community actually shape it.”  Shah told CoinDesk that while other marketplaces may be motivated by earning royalties, Alchemy is motivated to onboard users new to Web3 by providing an organized, accessible marketplace.  Oftentimes, Web3 products are fragmented, meaning dapps are scattered across different websites and protocols, which can reduce users’ trust when using blockchain technologies.  “We wanted to really step in and help provide an open, community-oriented product while still providing a kind of clarity and trust to consumers,” said Shah. “If we believe in the future of Web3, we really need to make it really simple for [users] to get the word out there, and educate consumers about the benefits that they provide.”  As Alchemy noted in its third-quarter report, Web3 developers are still building applications, and Alchemy continues to develop technologies as well.

The industry has found itself in a fight with the local grid operator provider, Ande, and some members of the legislature who claim that the grid's infrastructure cannot handle the excess load and that the industry doesn't greatly benefit the local economy and society. Ande asked the government to increase the electricity tariff for miners in August by as much as 60% over the industrial rate.

Goldman sees a need for trustworthy and established players in the crypto market. ""We do see some really interesting opportunities, priced much more sensibly,"" Mathew McDermott, Goldman's head of digital assets, told Reuters.  Bitcoin mining difficulty has dropped the most since July 2021. Miners are caught between rising costs and the declining price of bitcoin. The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block fell by 7.32% Tuesday. The adjustment at block height 766,080 is the biggest downward change since July 2021, data from mining pool BTC.com shows. That was when hordes of miners dropped off the network following China’s ban on the industry.  Gridless, a bitcoin mining company, has raised $2 million in a seed funding round led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey’s payment company Block (SQ) and venture firm Stillmark. Gridless helps generate new sources of energy in East African rural communities. The investment will support the company’s expansion of bitcoin mines across African markets. In its first year, Gridless has contracted five project pilots in rural Kenya with African hydroelectric energy company HydroBox.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury inflation-indexed security going back to July 2021.  The so-called real or inflation-adjusted yield has pulled back to the bullish trendline representing the rally since March.  A potential turn higher from the trendline might lead to renewed risk aversion to traditional markets and add to the gloom and doom in the crypto market.  Like gold, bitcoin moved in the opposite direction to the real yield early this year.

5217516,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511309,1670332315,Price Slump For Bitcoin Looming As VIX Rises Back Above 20,"The Bitcoin price has currently stabilized strongly around the $17,000 mark. However, the price could face further headwinds in the coming days, as the VIX exposes. The VIX is a real-time volatility index from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). It was created to quantify market expectations of volatility. In doing so, the VIX is forward-looking, meaning that it only shows the implied volatility of the S&P 500 (SPX) for the next 30 days. Basically, if the VIX value goes up, the S&P 500 will likely go down, and if the VIX value goes down, the S&P 500 will likely remain stable or go up. This is exactly what was seen yesterday. The VIX bounced up to 19, a level that was last seen in mid-August. As a result, the S&P 500 lost the weekly support area at 4040 and fell 1.8%. In August, the last time the VIX was this low, it rebounded, and the S&P 500 fell 15%. The Importance Of The VIX For Bitcoin Besides the VIX and the S&P 500, it is important to understand that Bitcoin, with higher beta, is highly correlated with the S&P 500. This means that the Bitcoin price is more sensitive to changes in the market in both directions. As predicted by the VIX, BTC bounced off the $17,400 horizontal resistance yesterday and dropped below $17,000. Related Reading: Peter Schiff And Jim Cramer Present Their Doom Scenarios For Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin In October, when the VIX was down, and the S&P 500 was up, Bitcoin experienced a black swan event with the FTX collapse, after which BTC fell to $15,500. Thus, the Bitcoin price did not enjoy the momentum of the VIX. At the moment, a possible reversal of the VIX at 19 could serve as a kind of sentiment barometer for the S&P 500 and Bitcoin for the next few weeks. The VIX is being compared to the 2006-2009 crash, a nasty outlook that would mean much lower prices. Analyst Sam Rule writes that the recent BTC rally following stocks is occurring at a time when the VIX is depressed to a level of 20. Although there has been a massive industry leverage wipe-out in the crypto industry, the stock market has yet to experience such an event. Given Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500, this could mean another price drop, as Rule writes: Is 25% drawdown from ATH all we’re getting in S&P 500 this cycle during the popping of the great everything bubble? Would you expect #BTC to bottom here if SPX scenario fell >40% from ATH in coming months? SPX drawdowns from ATH 1-week, Source: Twitter Why VIX Has Limited Applicability To BTC However, the VIX should not be used as the sole deterministic indicator of future market direction. Why? The VIX relies on expectations set by past events rather than what will happen in the future. Investors are notoriously prone to irrational exuberance.

5218064,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511280,1670331647,TRON Ecosystem To Undergo Changes – A Bane Or Boon To TRX Price?,"As the newest committee proposal nears completion, Tron will undergo dramatic changes. An update tweet states that the fee cap for smart contracts will be raised from 10,000 to 15,000 TRX coins. The developers believe this would mitigate the risk connected with smart contracts by reducing the number of low-value smart contracts created on the ecosystem. At the same time, it will greatly increase the #TRX staking rate and burning volume, further expand the #TRX deflation rate to 3.17%, and the annual burning volume of #TRX on the #TRON network will reach 5 billion. 👀For more analysis, please refer to: https://t.co/AM8YebxxvG — TRON DAO (@trondao) December 4, 2022 Let’s take a quick look at TRX’s performance: Improvements to the Tron ecosystem have boosted investor confidence. The indicators point to the formation of a robust uptrend. Price could rise to $0.05560 or higher on a rebound from the current level of $0.05274. As the burn rate of TRX increases with the increase in fee limit, the deflection in the ecosystem would also grow, from -1.39% to -3.17%. According to the developer’s Medium post, a rise in fee limitations would also impact the staking rate. In aggregate, the shifts herald the beginning of bullishness in TRX, however CoinGecko reports a 1.1% decline in the daily timeframe price of TRX. Will these changes influence the price of TRX? Related Reading: Axie Infinity Price On A Tear With 22% Spike In Last 24 Hours – How Long Can This Last? What The Coming Days May Bring For Tron There is an indication that TRX is beginning to rebound from the market downturn that followed the FTX disaster. In Tuesday’s trade, TRX shows a red candle at $0.05278. It would appear that the RSI statistics are bullish in the short and intermediate term, however this is negated by the fact that the RSI has a bearish crossover. Chart: TradingView The MACD indicator corroborates this. Despite the fact that the market appears to favor buyers, bearishness can still be observed as the EMAs of the MACD indicator trend downwards. Chaikin’s money flow index suggests that bulls are still in charge of the market, and this optimistic sentiment is reinforced by the MFI of TRX, which opposes the price decline. This indicates that the developing decline has no actual impetus. Investors and traders could rely on the $0.05 support, which halted additional declines on November 11, when both cryptocurrencies and equities collapsed following the November 10 release of the Consumer Price Index. Solid Bullish Momentum For TRX? According to Messari’s measures of volatility, TRX is relatively stable. This further reinforces the optimistic conclusion anticipated by the community. With Bitcoin’s price breaking past the $17K barrier and TRX’s increasing link to BTC, we can anticipate further bullishness. Even though the price trend is falling, a rebound from $0.05274 to $0.05560 and above is inevitable. Related Reading: Quant Shows Potential For Surge Beyond $150 – Can QNT Hit Its Target?

In a statement, the company explained how and why it was sharing MetaMask user internet-protocol information with Infura, the ConsenSys-made ""RPC (remote procedure call) service"" for reading and writing data to the Ethereum blockchain.  A change in wording to the ConsenSys user agreement last month revealed that MetaMask, by default, shared users’ transaction data with Infura alongside their IP addresses. The revelation sparked outrage in a vocal corner of the crypto community, with some users worrying aloud that their transaction data wasn't as private as they assumed.  Read more: Ethereum Software Firm ConsenSys Reveals It Collects User Data  In its statement, ConsenSys clarified that it would only ""collect wallet and IP address information in connection with 'write' requests, also known as transactions, when MetaMask users broadcast transactions through Infura's RPC endpoints.""  ""We do not store wallet account address information when a MetaMask user makes a 'read' request through Infura, for example in order to check their account balances within MetaMask,"" the company said.  According to MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay, the platform began collecting and sharing IP-linked transaction data with Infura in 2018 to prevent network overload and to monitor pending transactions.  When users learned about the practice last month, many of them viewed it as a violation of Ethereum's privacy-focused, decentralized ethos.  ""By being increasingly clear about exactly how data was managed by various ConsenSys products, there were some valid critiques and concerns raised – especially by people who ultimately have the highest privacy standards,"" Finlay told CoinDesk.  Finlay said MetaMask cannot stop logging IP addresses entirely; if a user interacts with an RPC service like Infura, their IP address will always be visible. ConsenSys, however, will stop logging user IP information directly alongside their transaction data, thereby making it more difficult for the firm to trace transaction activity back to specific users.  ConsenSys said it will also make updates to the MetaMask interface. Previously, ConsenSys advised privacy-conscious users to configure MetaMask to bypass Infura by setting up their own Ethereum node or configuring a non-Infura RPC service. However, people quickly pointed out on Twitter that doing either of those things was difficult and non-intuitive via MetaMask’s current user interface.  ConsenSys said that over the next week, it will be ""rolling out a new advanced settings page"" that ""will give all new users an opportunity to choose their own RPC providers at onboarding and to opt out of third-party services that are otherwise used to enhance the user experience.""  Addressing concerns that non-Infura RPCs received second-class treatment on the platform, ConsenSys said, ""We previously showed a gray question mark next to custom-added RPCs in order to caution users against rogue or unknown RPC risks.  ""We think this was overly cautious and are not intending to scare anyone away from using their chosen provider,"" the company added.  ConSensys warned, though, that users may need to take extra precautions should they wish to retain their privacy by bypassing Infura.  ""From a privacy perspective, we caution that these alternatives may not actually provide more privacy,"" ConsenSys said in its statement. ""Alternate RPC providers have different privacy policies and data practices, and self-hosting a node may make it even easier for people to associate your Ethereum accounts with your IP address.""",NEGATIVE,없음,ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/consensys-to-update-metamask-crypto-wallet-in-response-to-privacy-backlash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e9f0594bed997ea25235e351dfe9ec778796b5c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed limiting the number of firms that are able to approve marketing communications by taking away the authority of companies authorized under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and requiring an additional level of authorization to allow the FCA to monitor firms more closely.  The FCA published its proposals in a ""consultation"" paper as it kicked off a two-month consultation period, during which interested parties can weigh in on the proposals, on Tuesday. The deadline for responses is Feb. 7.  “Historically, we have seen too many noncompliant promotions being approved and then communicated by unauthorized firms to retail consumers,” the FCA stated in the consultation document.  Crypto companies would be hit by any regulatory change resulting from the consultation if the Financial Services and Markets Bill that is now in Parliament becomes law in its current form. Recent amendments to the bill require crypto businesses’ ads to be approved by an FCA-authorized firm, and that could produce a bottleneck.  The number of applications “with sufficient competence and expertise to approve crypto asset financial promotions will be limited at first,” the FCA said. It expects the number to increase over time.  Read more: Proposed UK Rules Will Make Advertising Crypto a Lot Harder, Industry Warns  The Treasury is also expected to publish a consultation paper in the coming weeks on how it plans to regulate the crypto industry. That is expected to give the FCA more guidance on how crypto will fit in with its rules about ads.  The FCA is consulting on whether a company that wants to be allowed to approve promotions should be checked for having “adequate systems, controls and processes in place” and whether it is able to maintain the records of the financial promotions it wants to oversee. Among other things, it would have to assess the viability of the financial product being promoted.  The FCA may also require that approving firms report twice a year on their approval activity. They may also have to notify the regulator when they approve, amend or withdraw the approval of a financial promotion within seven days of doing so.  ""These proposals will ensure those approving ads have the appropriate expertise and are held accountable for the promotions they sign off,"" Sarah Pritchard, executive director of markets at the FCA, said in a statement.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/06/uk-financial-regulator-seeks-comments-on-ad-approval-process-that-covers-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/beebb7d49f8b6ed0cc958a0b1aca66fa18042d24-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5214318,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511293,1670325875,"Peter Schiff And Jim Cramer Present Their Doom Scenarios For Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin","Notorious CNBC host Jim Cramer has once again made controversial predictions for Bitcoin and the crypto market in the latest episode of the show “Mad Money”. Cramer has made a name for himself on the crypto scene in recent years, but possibly to the extent that he wanted to. Cramer’s mixed track record in crypto-analysis led to the creation of the “Inverse Cramer ETF,” a fictional exchange-traded fund that recommends the opposite of everything Cramer says. Great news for crypto! pic.twitter.com/uKJznTn1Pr — Inverse Cramer ETF (Not Jim Cramer) (@CramerTracker) December 6, 2022 Consequently, the crypto scene pays little credibility to the host’s predictions. Still, Cramer is not always wrong. In June, for example, he predicted that cryptocurrencies would continue to fall. He based this on the actions of the Federal Reserve. Cardano, XRP And Dogecoin Going To Zero? In the latest episode, the Mad Money host said that investors still have time to sell their crypto holdings. According to Cramer, the markets will continue to crash in 2023, so crypto investors should sell “before it’s too late.” “You can’t just beat yourself up and say, ‘hey, it’s too late to sell.’ The truth is, it’s never too late to sell an awful position. And that’s what you have if you own these so-called digital assets,” Cramer said. Specifically, Cramer predicted that Cardano (ADA), XRP, Polygon (MATIC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) could crash to zero. According to him, these cryptocurrencies are still highly overvalued, so those who hold them should sell them. BREAKING: Goldman Sachs mouthpiece Jim Cramer urges investors to exit crypto & says it’s never too late to sell. Jim is evil & dishonest. This is good news for Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/YdSWi54OHV — Gill Bates (@GillBatesVax) December 6, 2022 However, his reckoning with crypto didn’t end there. The moderator made serious accusations against Tether (USDT). Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Lacking Momentum Above $17k, BTC Holders Are Safe: Here’s Why According to Cramer, the largest stablecoin in the crypto market could meet a fate similar to Luna’s TerraUST, which fell to zero in three days in May this year. Tether, a so-called stablecoin that’s supposed to be kinda-sorta pegged to the dollar, still has a $65 billion market cap. There’s still a whole industry of crypto boosters trying desperately to keep all of these things up in the air. Not too different from what happened with bad stocks during the dot-com collapse. Remarkably, Cramer’s Bitcoin bear market low of $12,000, which he predicted in previous broadcasts, is still a long way off. Peter Schiff Shares Bitcoin Prediction At $5,000 Cramer, however, is not the only Bitcoin critic spreading doom and gloom. Gold bug Peter Schiff has shared an assessment from Standard Chartered that Bitcoin is still overvalued at its current price of about $17,000. According to the word-strong Bitcoin critic and multinational bank, BTC is at risk of another 70% crash in 2023. Standard Chartered claims Bitcoin could fall to $5,000 next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears? In a note entitled “The financial-market surprises of 2023,” Standard Chartered states that a negative surprise could be Bitcoin falling to US$5,000 next year. Rising yields along with a slump in tech stocks will lead to an acceleration of the Bitcoin sell-off and cause more bankruptcies in the crypto world, according to the bank. Goldman Sachs To Buy Up The FTX Mess Despite all the dystopian predictions, however, there is also extremely bullish news today. As Reuters reports, Goldman Sachs is on the hunt for cheap crypto companies after the FTX collapse and plans to spend tens of millions of dollars to buy or invest in crypto companies. Regardless of how the Bitcoin scene views this on ideological grounds, this should be a strong catalyst for maturation and progress for the institutional sector.

42388502,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHJA3,1670324400,A16z Elevates Former US CFTC Commissioner Quintenz to Policy Chief,"Brian Quintenz, a former commissioner with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission who left the regulatory agency last year, is amplifying his role at crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) from advising to taking over as its head of policy, the company said on Tuesday.  Quintenz had been a reliable supporter of the cryptocurrency industry before exiting the CFTC, which may take a leading role in overseeing the U.S. trading of some digital assets. Now he’ll be facing his old agency directly as part of his job seeking to steer crypto policy with U.S. regulators and lawmakers.  “We’re believers in transparent, bipartisan, tailored policymaking that provides clear rules of the road, that embraces the technology and respects consumers’ needs,” Quintenz said in an interview. “The events of this year have really crystalized the need for legislation,” he said, and much of the current legislation would position his former agency at the forefront of digital assets oversight.  Quintenz, who observed a one year cooling-off period in which he couldn’t seek to directly influence policy after leaving the CFTC, will now “educate policymakers” on the advantages of crypto innovations. He said he’s also willing to use his “very meaningful personal and professional relationships” at the CFTC for the same purpose.  The former regulator said he understands some policymakers will be suspicious of digital assets in light of the industry’s dramatic 2022.  “I think it’s perfectly appropriate to be focused on customer protections given what we’ve seen happening in the marketplace,” he said.  His employer has been among the biggest crypto contributors to U.S. political candidates, including as one of the the top donors to industry political action committee GMI PAC Inc.  “Ensuring that advocates keep their roles in Congress is important in this space,” Quintenz said, though it’s “yet to be determined” how involved the company will get in the next election cycle, which will include the 2024 presidential race.  The company’s previous policy head was Tomicah Tillemann, the former U.S. State Department official who left a16z for a similar policy role at Haun Ventures. Quintenz has worked as an adviser to Crypto.com and had previously taken a smaller scale role to advise a16z.  “This firm is a believer in the long-term benefits of the technology,” Quintenz said of a16z, which occupies a rare position as a major crypto investor that says it has no exposure to the disastrous crypto giant FTX. Still, a16z has reportedly suffered major losses in its crypto flagship fund this year and has slowed down the pace of its investments.  “Regulators need to do a better job of providing clarity to the space so that entrepreneurs and innovators and technologists have clear rules that they can follow,” Quintenz said. “Right now those rules are not clear.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/06/a16z-elevates-former-us-cftc-commissioner-quintenz-to-policy-chief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc78c4de0c7a07b27ee6a6d5ccfa80b1cb697f1a-2640x1980.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency, however, seemed to have entered a price correction phase, losing 5.1% of its value over the last 24 hours. AVAX lost some of its weekly gains which is now at 8.5% Various technical indicators suggest the crypto asset is in an overbought position A decline all the way to the $12 territory remains a big possibility within the next few days At the time of this writing, according to data from Coingecko, the altcoin is trading at $13.53. Although it experienced a decline, it is still sitting on weekly uptick of 8.5%. Moreover, during the past two weeks, the altcoin has managed to go up by 14.1%. Although Avalanche performed relatively well last week, traders and investors might have to brace themselves as some of its technical indicators point at a potential bearish momentum during the next few days. Metrics Show Possible Roadblocks For AVAX At the moment, it would appear that bears are currently in control with the digital asset’s price trajectory, evidenced by its 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) was settling just below the 55-day EMA.

Source: TradingView Moreover, although the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is displaying a bullish crossover right now, AVAX’s Money Flow Index (MFI) was driven into the overbought territory, indicating that there is a high chance of a price decline. Finally, the crypto’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates that at this point in time, Avalanche is overbought and that spells bad news for holders of the cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Coincodex seems to support the bearish thesis for the crypto as the platform predicts that by December 12, the altcoin will have a spot trading price that is 22% lower than its current value.

42388506,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRHJO5,1670316967,Bitcoin's Stagnant Crypto Dominance Points to Investor Exodus After FTX Bankruptcy,"There is plenty of fear in the crypto market since Sam Bankman Fried's digital-assets exchange, FTX, went bust, so much so that digital assets have decoupled from the risk revival in traditional markets.  Yet bitcoin's (BTC) dominance rate or the top cryptocurrency's share in the total crypto market has held steady at around 40%, contradicting its record of rising sharply during times of stress.  According to observers, the stagnant dominance rate represents several developments, including an exodus of investors from the market.  ""BTC has not outperformed the downside in recent months, so investors no longer view it as a safe haven,"" Wes Hansen, director of trading and operations at crypto fund Arca, said in an email.  ""More broadly, the events of November 2022 have shaken the confidence of a lot of investors in this space. In prior cycles, investors would move into BTC to protect the downside when the market fell off. But because of the size of this year's scandals and their far-reaching impacts, a lot of investors aren't moving to BTC because they're just leaving the space entirely,"" Hansen added.  The collapse of FTX, which had its tentacles in every nook and corner of the crypto market, has been the biggest in a string of big crypto-related failures this year and brought down several firms, including crypto lender BlockFi.  Bitcoin has the most liquidity and is the least volatile of all cryptocurrencies, except for stablecoins. Therefore, crypto investors have tended to move money into BTC when they feel less confident about the overall market condition.  Investors sought shelter in bitcoin in the first half of this year as the Federal Reserve's hawkish turn and Terra's implosion led to a crash in the broader crypto market. The safe-haven bid for bitcoin lifted its dominance rate from 39% to 48%. A similar bump was seen during the market swoon of May and June 2021 as well as during the 2018 bear market.  That's not happening this time, however, as traders are moving to cash. According to Hansen, registered investment advisors have been the largest group of defectors from the crypto market.  Crypto market is maturing  Holding stablecoins – cryptocurrencies with values pegged to an external reference like the U.S. dollar – is a better option for investors, according to Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR.  ""There are many risks, including from macro markets and the risk perceived in holding crypto on an exchange, post-FTX. Moving to stablecoins is a most defensive posture, vs. moving into BTC, which is still a volatile asset in the end,"" Rosenblum told CoinDesk when asked if stablecoins have replaced BTC as crypto market safe havens.  Rosenblum, however, cautioned against reading too much into the dominance rate, as people leaving the market amid a prolonged price swoon is normal and doesn't necessarily imply the end of the world for crypto.  ""It is an oversimplification to look at dominance in itself as a metric. It had more meaning in 2017 or 2018. Now there are a lot more components, both in crypto and how other asset classes and events impact the space,"" he said.  Bitcoin no longer represents a major chunk of development happening in the crypto industry as it did in 2018 and before. Exactly four years ago, during the peak of the 2018 bear market, bitcoin's share in the total crypto market was 59.4%, compared with 40% at press time.  Noelle Acheson, author of the popular ""Crypto Is Macro Now"" newsletter, voiced a similar opinion in a note sent to subscribers over the weekend.  ""It's possible that BTC has not outperformed other crypto assets because, rather than rotate into relative safety, investors have largely left the market,"" Acheson said.  Acheson added that the strange behavior of the bitcoin's dominance rate during the market downturn indicates that the market composition has changed for the good.  ""Bitcoin is still the anchor asset, by a widest margin, but the volatility of its protagonism is weakening. This is a sign of maturing asset class. That this should become apparent during one of the darkest times is cause for hope,"" Acheson noted.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/06/bitcoins-stagnant-crypto-dominance-points-to-investor-exodus-in-the-wake-of-ftxs-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca3dcbd9d79751f329d82084a06e44615e4f0712-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At the time of writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, the digital asset is changing hands at $8.79 and has managed to increase its value by more than 33% within the previous seven days. Here’s a quick glance: AXS has gone up by almost 40% within the last two weeks Axie Infinity nears the $9 marker Token is poised for a surge of more than 30% to reclaim the $10 territory With its current momentum, the crypto has also surged by 39.2% over the last two weeks and has trimmed its monthly loss to just 16.3%. After being in a steady downfall for six months, Axie Infinity finally found some relief and is poised to make further push to breach the psychological $10 marker. Technical Indicators Suggest Axie Buyers In Control Among the various analysis points for the crypto asset, its Relative Strength Index is the most promising one as it shows a significant increase in buying momentum – a situation that usually heralds bullish growth. Related Reading: Quant Shows Potential For Surge Beyond $150 – Can QNT Hit Its Target? Source: TradingView In addition, the AXS 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) confirms the thesis for a potential continued surge given the altcoin’s volatility remains at “medium.” With the current price action, it is most likely that traders will be interested in the asset’s attempt to retest the breached resistance during the next trading sessions which might trigger an increase of as high as 35.8%. If that happens, Axie Infinity will change hands at $11.8, the lower zone of the set point of resistance for the crypto (the highest of which is $15.4). However, in the event that the earlier mentioned scenarios don’t unfold, the cryptocurrency might have to revisit its supports levels standing at between $8.3 and $7.5. Rising NFT Sales Volume Fuels AXS Rally Cryptoslamp, an NFT industry data aggregator recently shared some information regarding the positive development of the digital asset class’s sales volume going up by almost 10% within the last 24 hours. During the same time, NFT-focused virtual coins such as ApeCoin (APE), Sandbox (SAND) and Flow (FLOW) witnessed a major uptick in their respective prices. In addition, it would appear that Axie Infinity has also benefited from a social media post indicating that more than 600 members of the AXS community has gathered to share ideas on how to help shape a good future for the project.

The investment will support the company’s expansion of bitcoin mines across African markets. In its first year, Gridless started five projects in rural Kenya with African hydroelectric energy company HydroBox, three of which are operational. The company plans to expand to other East African regions in the near future.  Gridless designs, builds and operates bitcoin mining sites alongside small-scale renewable energy producers in rural Africa where excess energy is unused. Gridless serves as the anchor tenant, financing the construction and managing the operation of data centers in rural communities where traditional industrial or commercial customers are unavailable.  Gridless brings “a socially and environmentally conscious approach to bitcoin mining, one that provides tangible benefits by way of access to electricity for communities in rural parts of East Africa,” Alyse Killeen, managing partner at Stillmark, said in an announcment.  Thomas Templeton, bitcoin mining and wallet lead at Block, added: “Gridless represents a close strategic alignment with our vision of ensuring the bitcoin network increasingly leverages clean energy, in combination with bitcoin computational centers around the world.”  The funding comes as Africa experiences a grassroots crypto movement. It has the world's highest proportion of retail payments of less than $1,000 and more peer-to-peer transactions proportionally than any other region. Bitcoin miners, however, have been struggling to survive amid this year’s grueling market conditions, which have seen bitcoin (BTC) prices fall and energy costs surge, reducing profit margins.  In recent months, though, mining companies that have access to low-cost energy and more innovative business models have succeeded in raising capital.  In August, a new solar-powered bitcoin miner, Aspen Creek Digital Corp., raised $8 million in a Series A funding round, and Vespene Energy, a company that converts methane gas released from landfills into power for bitcoin mining, closed a $4.3 million funding round.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/06/east-african-bitcoin-miner-gridless-raises-2m-seed-round,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19ba255d125bb83de17c2047c4e10adae17206af-6455x4841.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

5205143,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511251,1670308136,Quant Shows Potential For Surge Beyond $150 – Can QNT Hit Its Target?,"Quant (QNT), a cryptocurrency with a total market cap of $1.88 billion, is outperforming some of the more popular altcoins out there, going up by 10% during the last seven days. According to latest tracking from Coingecko, at the time of this writing, the altcoin is changing hands at $129.88 and is in the midst of a 22.5% increase over the previous two weeks. At a glance: Quant has established important support zones of $111.5 and $100 QNT may soon test the $157 resistance territory The altcoin is enjoying a weekly gain of 10% Prior to the crypto market woes that were brought about by the collapse of the FTX exchange platform, the digital asset was enjoying a good run above the $160 region. After the exchange imploded, QNT was hit very hard, diving all the way down to $95.28 on November 14. Since then, the digital coin has done a great job of bouncing back to reclaim and sustain the $100 territory. Over the last few days, Quant’s price action formed an ascending triangle pattern which indicates more bullish activity from the 30th largest cryptocurrency in terms of overall valuation. A Possible Push Beyond $150 Zone For QNT With its Relative Strength Index (RSI) positioned above the neutral zone, there is indeed a positive outlook for the trajectory of Quant price. Related Reading: Why Chiliz Is Losing Heat Despite World Cup Pomp; CHZ Down Over 30% Source: TradingView On three different occasions, QNT has already tested its support and resistance trendlines of $128-$125, indicating that traders have active participation for the asset’s technical set-up. The asset, on December 2, made a decisive push beyond the set resistance neckline of $128, triggering the bullish run that comes with its current price action pattern. Combining with the definitive increase in QNT trading volume, this momentum is expected to kickstart a strong surge of 18.5% to catapult the asset all the way up to the $155 resistance region. Traders and those who are considering buying right now, however, need to keep a close eye on the altcoin as the bullish thesis will be nullified in the event of a price dump that pulls Quant below its support zones of $111.5 and $100. Worst Case Scenario For Quant Should the digital coin fail to capitalize on its current momentum and do fall below the crucial support territory, Coincodex predicts a sharp decline for its trading price. If this unfolds, within the next five days, Quant will most likely decrease its value by almost 27% to change hands at $95.77. Meanwhile, after such price dump, the asset is seen to once again mount a recovery to trim its losses. The online crypto information provider predicts that during the next 30 days, QNT will possess a trading price of $101.58 Related Reading: Litecoin Continues To Surge As Hash Rate Records New ATH – How About LTC Price?

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Has a Sinking Feeling  By James Rubin  Crypto markets didn't like the sound of good economic news, sending prices downward on Monday.  Bitcoin was recently trading down 1.1% over the past 24 hours, although it clung above its $17,000 support of the last six days. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has seemingly recovered from a mid-November swoon following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, although it remains subject to more minor winds that have had it dipping and rising in smallish increments on larger macroeconomic events.  On Monday, the Institute of Supply Management's unexpectedly strong November services index fueled fears anew that the U.S. economy would require the U.S. Federal Reserve to administer a longer-term dosage of harsh interest rate hikes than had been hoped in mid-November when the Consumer Price Index fell. The ISM services report came just three days after a hot jobs report raised concerns that the economy was not contracting enough and that inflation would remain problematic. In recent months, inflationary worries have often dictated the performance of asset markets.  ""Bitcoin’s earlier gains evaporated after a hot ISM services report fueled bets that the Fed could tighten much more than markets are currently pricing,"" wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda.  Ether was recently changing hands above $1,260, down more than 2% from Sunday, same time. Other major cryptos spent much of the day in the red with CRO, the token of the Crypto.com exchange off more than 4% and DOT, the cryptocurrency of blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot, sinking more than 3%. AXS, the token of gaming platform Axie Infinity, was up nearly 20% to trade at more than $8.40.  Crypto prices largely tracked equity markets, which sank amid interest rate concerns fueled by the ISM report. The tech heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, dropped 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively. The Wall Street Journal reported that food and beverage giant PepsiCo would be laying off hundreds of workers in North America amid company worries about shrinking volume.  Meanwhile, the recent decline in U.S. consumer savings rates to their second lowest level in 60 years suggest that crypto markets are likely to remain calm for at least the near future, wrote CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams on Monday. ""As retail investors comprise a sizable portion of crypto investors, the continued erosion of buying power will likely weigh upon bitcoin and ether prices.,"" Williams wrote. ""We face a cocktail of higher interest rates, decreased buying power and increased levels of debt.""  And Katie Talati, head of research at crypto investment firm Arca, noted with cautious optimism on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that crypto prices have likely bottomed out. ""I don't make price predictions, but I think we probably saw the bottom in terms of market prices and sentiment in the last few weeks,"" Talati said.

But in IPOing its VR business, the company might be making a mistake it made years ago with its electric scooter arm called Gogoro. There are plenty of parallels between the two: What began as a niche product suddenly became more mainstream – and the market didn’t appreciate this. Fundamental questions have also arisen about the future of the metaverse.  VR, an HTC bright spot  Virtual reality has been a bright spot for HTC, a company that has otherwise seen its balance sheet effectively dissolve during the last decade. At the start of the Obama administration in the U.S., HTC was a mobile phone giant, helping pioneer the Android ecosystem, peaking at a market share of 10% in 2011 and overtaking Nokia in market value, which at the time benefited from financial backing and a partnership with Microsoft.  But it has been in free fall since, hitting 2% of the smartphone market share in 2015, and now it is too small to have its shipments tracked by research houses including IDC and Statcounter.  Looking to turn the company around, HTC launched the Vive VR headset in 2016 to mixed reviews. It was still a medium in development, with the hardware and software technology languishing behind consumer expectations.  Facebook, which acquired Vive-rival Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion, was in a similar conundrum. CNBC said in 2017 that its bet on VR was one of Mark “Zuckerberg’s rare mistakes.” This wasn’t going anywhere as “nobody wants to be social in VR” and there was no compelling game for it.  Meanwhile, HTC’s balance sheet was still a sinking ship, and in 2017, Google came to the rescue with a $1.1 billion investment in HTC’s mobile phone manufacturing division so that Google would have a manufacturing partner for its Pixel phones.  VR continued to languish for the next few years. Reviewers still saw it as a niche product, with obvious enterprise and commercial applications, but no “killer app” for gamers and retail users that would make a headset a must-have.  “The VR revolution is alive and well, it’s just not ready for you,” Gizmodo’s Sam Rutherford wrote in 2019. “It’s [going] to take a bit longer to become mainstream than people initially thought. Be patient, your VR dreams are still alive and well.”  Mobile headsets and metaverse  VR got its first boost in consumer interest with the release of the stand-alone Oculus Quest headset in 2019, as analysts pointed to the lower price point and its untethered nature as piquing the interests of consumers.  As standalone devices powered by the same chips that went into smartphones, they couldn’t push out realistic graphics like PC-tethered headsets, but they were cheap and fun with games finally arriving, which is what consumers wanted.  By mid-2021 there was a mini-boom in standalone headsets like the Oculus Quest 2 and Vive Focus. HTC was still a money-losing entity, but its balance sheet was improving.  And then came Facebook’s headfirst dive into the metaverse and VR.  Quality concerns about Facebook’s VR and metaverse platforms aside, at first, investors were intrigued.  In Taiwan, HTC’s stock became a proxy for the metaverse, gaining nearly 130% during the last quarter of 2021. VR headset shipments were growing at a rate not seen since 2016, but HTC faced a competitive market from its rivals.  Even as the metaverse bubble popped, and Meta’s stock, along with the metaverse major tokens began their year-long plunge, HTC hasn’t performed that badly.  While HTC (2498) has underperformed Taiwan’s TAIEX index year to date, losing 28.6% versus 19%, it has bettered Meta, which is down 63% and Sandbox, which is off 53%.  There still is a lot of value to the company, the market has determined, despite the wheels coming off all things metaverse.  Parallels to Gogoro  Scooters dominate the road in Taipei, and many belch out exhaust via their two-stroke engines.  In 2015, two former HTC executives launched a solution: Gogoro. While electric scooters aren’t a new technology, a network of battery-swapping stations is. The company raised a round of $150 million led by HTC founder Cher Wang, and incubated some of its early tech in its facilities. But it passed on the opportunity to make it a full subsidiary.  While Gogoro had its initial skeptics, in the years since it has managed to grab a 9% market share. In April 2022, the company went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC but investors weren’t that impressed.  Year to date, the company has posted losses of 62%, compared to HTC’s 30%. While Gogoro does have solid cash flow and licensing agreements for its battery-swapping technology, it isn’t profitable, only posting net income during the last quarter because of a favorable charge on warrants on the books.  Certainly, if Vive were to be spun off into an initial public offering there would be similar results. We don’t know how much Vive accounts for revenue at HTC, as it is bundled together with smartphones and other electronic equipment. But it's likely not profitable.  Gogoro was pushed early into an initial public offering because its backers, like HTC’s Cher Wang, needed a quick buck (HTC is a money-losing entity, after all). Wang probably regrets not buying a more significant stake of Gogoro as an investor and bringing it closer into the HTC fold, as it would undoubtedly be a success story for the company – and a more proven product than VR.  Despite the advancements of the last four years, VR still needs more time for incubation. Vive’s performance on the stock market will be predictable, and likely just track the ups and downs of Meta. But HTC needs the cash infusion, and there’s no obvious private buyer available.  The company is hoping the metaverse finds a firm foothold.

BTC corrected gains, but it remains well supported above the $16,800 support. Bitcoin extended its upward move above $17,100 and $17,300 resistance levels. The price is trading near $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $17,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair must stay above the $16,800 support to start a fresh increase. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price settled above the $17,000 resistance zone and extended its increase. BTC was able to clear the $17,100 and $17,200 resistance levels. The price even spiked above $17,400 and traded close to the $17,500 resistance zone. However, the bears were active near the $17,500 resistance zone. A high was formed near $17,440 and the price started a downside correction. Bitcoin price declined below the $17,200 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $17,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The price traded as low as $16,888 and is currently rising. It is trading near $17,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $17,440 swing high to $16,888 low. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,165 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $17,440 swing high to $16,888 low. The first major resistance is near the $17,250 zone, above which the price may perhaps start another steady increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $17,500 resistance. The next major resistance is near $17,650, above which the price rise towards the $18,000 zone in the near term. More Losses in BTC? If bitcoin fails to start a fresh increase above the $17,165 resistance, there could be more downsides. An immediate support on the downside is near the $16,850 level. The next major support is near the $16,800 zone. A downside break below the $16,800 support might call for a move towards $16,500. Any more losses might call for a test of the key $16,000 support zone in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now just below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $16,800, followed by $16,500.

42413511,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9XfW,1670292004,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Drops by Most Since July 2021 as Crypto Winter Cuts Profitability,"The difficulty of mining a bitcoin block fell by 7.32%, with miners powering off machines as a brutal bear market eats into profit.  The adjustment at block height 766,080 is the biggest downward change since July 2021, data from mining pool BTC.com shows. That was when hordes of miners dropped off the network following China’s ban on the industry. At the time, the country was the world’s biggest bitcoin mining hub.  The mining difficulty automatically adjusts according to the hashrate, or computing power, that’s online in order to keep the time it takes to mine a bitcoin block roughly stable: The more miners are working, the higher the difficulty becomes.  In the past several months, bitcoin miners have been caught between a stubbornly low price of bitcoin that decreases their revenue and high electricity rates that increase costs. Major producers including Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) are dealing with liquidity crunches, while Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  The situation has been exacerbated by new, more efficient machines being delivered and more miners coming online as projects started months ago reached fruition, driving the hashrate higher. Between early August and the last upward adjustment on Nov. 21, the hashrate and difficulty both increased by about one-third.  The reality of crypto winter now seems to have caught up with the industry, and bitcoin miners are turning off their machines. The hashrate started dropping around mid-November as profitability took a hit. It is, however, still well above the levels seen after China’s crackdown on the industry.  The profitability of mining has dropped by about 20% in the past month, according to Luxor’s hashprice indicator.  ​​At these “depressed profitability levels, even miners using energy-efficient machines like the Antminer S19j Pro need access to electricity priced lower than [8 U.S. cents] per kWh,” said Jaran Mellerud, an analyst at Luxor. Even though the average energy price on the network is about 5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), many miners are paying about 7 cents to 8 cents per kWh, Mellerud said.  On top of that, energy prices have increased in the last few days, along with the price of natural gas. “Miners buying spot electricity and already operating close to breakeven may have seen their electricity prices rise just enough to flip their operations into cash-flow-negative territory,” Mellerud said.  This latest lower hashrate and difficulty doesn’t leave the network more vulnerable to attack. The computing power is spread among five big mining pools and another 12 smaller ones, data from BTC.com shows.

42413512,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9XgS,1670289182,Ether Turns Inflationary as Network Usage Slows,"Ether's (ETH) deflationary narrative has ended, at least temporarily.  Data from ultrasound.money shows ether’s net issuance – the annualized inflation rate – has risen to 0.07% – after previously dropping below zero amid market volatility linked to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. A consequent rise in Ethereum network usage had led to millions of dollars in crypto moving on-chain.  But the current positive inflation rate indicates that the volume of ether being minted now outpaces the amount that is being burned. Supply has increased 0.14% at an annual rate over the past seven days, according to ultrasound.money.  Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital-asset management firm Arca, attributed ETH’s deflationary flip to a lack of network activity that led to reduced demand.  “Immediately post-FTX, there was tons of demand to swap on both centralized and decentralized exchanges due to volatility,” Hotz told CoinDesk. “In the weeks since, that has faded and now there is very little demand to use neither centralized nor decentralized exchanges.”  Crypto market watchers widely expected that Ethereum’s Merge, which shifted the platform’s protocol from proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol on Sept. 15 would turn ether deflationary. The upgrade in theory eliminated mining and staking rewards totaling about 1,600 ETH per day – a 90% drop in new issuance.  But ether’s inflation rate also depends on a separate mechanism known as the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, where fees paid for transactions on the network are “burned,” or eliminated from circulation. The EIP-1559 is essentially tied to the amount of ether burned with network usage: The more transactions on the blockchain led to more ETH being burnt.  According to data from Etherscan, the amount of ETH burnt has spiked as much as 5,000 ETH in a day after FTX’s implosion triggered market jitters. Now the burn rate has slowed to around 1,200 ETH daily.  Hotz believes that the mechanism is neither net inflationary nor net deflationary, but rather, it creates “a credible and steady supply of ETH” and sees “more adoption of Ethereum through layer 2 activities.”  “It's a lot like what the Federal Reserve does with the U.S. economy: It reduces the supply of money when the economy is hot, and vice versa,” he added. “That’s what EIP-1559 does. That’s kind of the idea, especially after the Merge.”  At the time of publication, ETH was trading around $1,265, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/06/ether-turns-inflationary-as-network-usage-slows,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31a927a4f809f4450a77904e0f3f3632a4d34845-1084x574.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

But that’s like calling a butterfly a caterpillar or a chicken an egg.  Since Hayes’ days as a banker he’s lived a thousand lives. He founded the first bitcoin derivatives exchange in 2014, invented the perpetual swap, became crypto’s first African American billionaire, lost vast portions of his wealth and made it back in at least two crypto crashes, allegedly “ran the stops” on his users (his users said, without much evidence), traveled the world speaking on crypto’s conference circuit, once joked on stage about bribing a Seychelles financial regulator “with a coconut,” was said to have run the stops some more, was accused of facilitating money laundering by U.S. federal regulators, was sued by investors, was sued by customers, may have been in Singapore, surrendered to authorities in Hawaii, was put under house arrest and has now – somehow, inexplicably – rebuilt his reputation as a crypto sage by writing multi-thousand-word blog posts.  Read More: Presenting CoinDesk's Most Influential 2022  Arthur Hayes has been many things to crypto over the years: a builder, a showman and a criminal. This year, as the industry collapsed around users, he’s been a wise commentator able to bring people through complex topics in the markets and business in a series of blog posts. He’s like Virgil leading pilgrims through the layers of Hell as each new month brings a fresh calamity.  In this sense, Hayes is also living proof of something in crypto called the “redemption arc,” where former villains become heroes. For better or worse, crypto has embraced more than its fair share of convicted felons and fraudsters. Not everyone will welcome back FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried or Three Arrows Capital co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu (who at least appear to be avoiding regulators, a bit like how Hayes was perceived at first). But even convicted fraudsters can earn a seat at the table if they know how to make money.  Hayes, for instance, was invited to deliver the farewell keynote at CoinDesk’s inaugural I.D.E.A.S. conference. He had pleaded guilty along with BitMEX co-founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in February and is still under two years’ probation. Despite the conditions, Hayes said crypto is still generating new visions and isn’t done innovating, even if it takes time to build back from the bear market.  He didn’t say a word about the banking system.

The FTX collapse has extended the crypto winter and will significantly reduce institutional participation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Regulatory blowback is highly likely just as some US states look likely to start restricting Bitcoin mining on environmental grounds. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bears would be too hasty to decry the death of Bitcoin on the back of the FTX (FTT-USD) disaster but the collapse of the third largest cryptocurrency exchange will be a material setback for the 13-year-old cryptocurrency. FTX had a truly impressive cap table with some of the most prestigious institutional investors from Sequoia Capital to Singapore's Temasek. Hence, I believe the collapse of FTX is set to form a significant setback for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies and the growth of the industry. Why wouldn't it? 2021 was Bitcoin's time in the sun. Its price had exploded to $64,000, there were over a dozen Bitcoin-related IPOs or deSPAC transactions, and the level of institutional interest and money flowing into the ecosystem was at record levels. Some of Riot Blockchain's ( RIOT ) peers are now currently under material financial stress. This includes North America's largest Bitcoin miner Core Scientific ( CORZ ) which has indicated that it might initiate chapter 11 proceedings, Argo Blockchain ( ARBK ), and Iris Energy ( IREN ). Whilst some bulls might flag this as a potential future opportunity for Riot Blockchain as it's a disruption of competing miners and could open the spectre of asset acquisitions at distressed prices, the underlying point remains that the Bitcoin ecosystem is collapsing in on itself as contagion from the FTX debacle continues to claim new victims. This year has already seen BlockFi, Three Arrows Capital, Alameda Research, and Voyager Digital (VYGVQ) all collapse. I believe these all point to a bleak future for the Colorado-based Bitcoin mining company. Blockchain.com Riot Blockchain is essentially an arbitrage play on the cost of the electricity needed to run thousands of Antminer ASICs and the price of Bitcoin. Whilst the process to start mining for gold involves prospect ing, obtaining the necessary permits, and then excavating the land, Bitcoin mining describes the running of specialized hardware and software to solve extremely complicated math problems to verify transactions on the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with new Bitcoin for their efforts. Mining Difficulty And Electricity Up As Price Trends Down Riot Blockchain faces intense headwinds as mining difficulty rises against the backdrop of Bitcoin prices that have fallen 64% year-to-date. This has come as the energy crisis from the discombobulation of the global energy markets by Russia's war in Ukraine temporarily drives an increase in the cost of electricity. That said, Riot Blockchain's Bitcoin mining facilities, Rockdale and Corsicana, are both located in Texas which has some of the lowest rates in the US. Bulls would also be right to counter that the company has long-term power agreements with ERCOT which include the ability to sell power back at spot prices for credits when the power use is curtailed. Texas Electricity Ratings These credits are essentially a type of energy trading instrument used to incentiv ize energy conservation and demand response . Corsicana is set to be a 1 GW facility when completed whilst Rockdale has a total capacity of 750 MW but with 450 megawatts currently developed and the remaining capacity under development. Riot Blockchain The company last reported earnings for its fiscal 2022 third quarter saw revenue come in at $46.3 million , a 28.5% decline over the year-ago quarter and a miss by $9.23 million on consensus estimates on the back of lower Bitcoin prices. Riot Blockchain produced 1,042 bitcoins during the period, down from 1,292 in the year-ago comps as there was a curtailment in mining activity. This was partially offset by $13.1 million in power curtailment credits. Data by YCharts The company was unprofitable with a net loss during the quarter of $36.6 million, up from a loss of $15.3 million in the year-ago period. Negative free cash flow at $41 million was driven by continued CapEx on the expansion of Rockdale and the Corsicana buildout. Rolling Headwinds Ahead The company does have a well-capitalized balance sheet which held cash and equivalents of $257 million as of the end of the third quarter but this has been built on the back of the material dilution of common shareholders. Data by YCharts There is more coming with a Form 8-K recently filed with the SEC confirming that stockholders had approved an amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of common shares to 340 million shares from 167 million currently. This comes on the back of a currently ongoing $500 million at-the-market offering that commenced earlier this year in March. The intense dilution made sense when Bitcoin prices were low and RIOT was trading at a premium to its underlying value, but with a depressed stock price, a prolonged crypto winter, and the coming Bitcoin halving in May 2024, Riot Blockchain faces intense headwinds. The New York Bitcoin mining ban on operations primarily powered by fossil fuels also adds to the coming regulatory quagmire facing the industry as other states are likely to mimic this. While there is a very low probability that this is mirrored by Texas, the move by New York will add to the debate concerning what the regulatory response to the FTX debacle should be. Greater demands for environmental sustainability could form part of the base for future regulation that hampers access to Bitcoin for the broader public and institutions. Fundamentally, Riot Blockchain's future performance like other commodity miners will depend on factors out of its hands. I believe Bitcoin's crypto winter will be extended by what's likely to be reduced institutional participation as the FTX issue evolves. Common shareholders are being diluted to own a company set to mine net losses for the foreseeable future as Bitcoin prices continue to oscillate down. I rate Riot Blockchain a sell with no near-term respite for Bitcoin coming.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4562488-riot-blockchain-mining-net-losses?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/5194435.jpeg

5194487,https://newsbtc.com/?p=511160,1670284806,"Bitcoin Now Undervalued For 170 Days, How Does This Compare With Previous Bears?","On-chain data shows Bitcoin has been undervalued for 170 days now, here’s how this figure compares with that during the previous bear markets. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Been Stuck Under ‘1’ Since 170 Days Ago As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the lowest point that the MVRV ratio has gone in this bear so far is 0.74. The “MVRV ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between Bitcoin’s market cap and its realized cap. Here, the “realized cap” is a BTC capitalization model where each circulating coin’s value is taken as the price at which it was last moved/sold. All these values are then summed up for the entire supply to get the worth of BTC. This is unlike the normal market cap, where all the coins are given the same value as the current Bitcoin price. The usefulness of the realized cap is that it acts as a sort of “real value” for the crypto as it takes into account the cost-basis of each holder in the market. Thus, a comparison between the two caps (which is what the MVRV ratio is) can tell us whether the current BTC price is undervalued or overvalued right now. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the last several years: The value of the metric seems to have been below one in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has been under a value of 1 during the last few months, which means the market cap has been below the realized cap. Historically, the region below 1 is where bear bottoms in the price of the crypto have been observed. On the other hand, the ratio being greater than 3.7 is when tops have been seen. Related Reading: Russian Miners Buy More Bitcoin Mining Rigs In Q4: Report In the 2014-15 bear market, the indicator assumed values lower than 1 for 300 days, and went down to as low as 0.6 during this streak. The 2018-19 bear saw a shorter cycle, however, as it was in this zone for only 134 days. Its lowest point, 0.69, was also not as deep as in 2014-15. In the current Bitcoin cycle, the metric has spent 170 days in this region so far, registering a low of 0.74. The MVRV ratio has therefore now been longer in this region than during the last cycle, but it’s still not near the length seen in 2014-15.
