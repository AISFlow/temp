42398347,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTJIm,1431376316,Bitcoin Researcher Ed Felten Named White House Tech Officer,"Princeton University professor of computer science and public affairs Ed Felten has joined the White House Office of Science and Technology where he will advise President Barack Obama on policy decisions related to technology and innovation.  The appointment is notable for the digital currency industry given Felten's longstanding interest in bitcoin and the digital currency's public ledger, the blockchain.  In addition to writing on the subject, Felten also attended the New York BitLicense hearings held in January 2014 where he presented a moderate view of the technology that stood in contrast to the more aggressive criticism levied by Boston University professor Mark T Williams.  Though his appointment is the sum of his professional accomplishments, Felton may nonetheless play a role as the White House begins to craft policy on financial technologies such as bitcoin.  Felten's appointment as deputy chief technology officer follows a stint with the US Federal Trade Commission that began in 2011.

The MyBus 2.0 smartphone app, a timetable and route planner connected to the Australian capital's bus network, removed the bitcoin payment option in January.  Zakaria Bouguettaya, director at QPay, the company behind the application, told the Brisbane Times the app had only processed 23 bitcoin payments in nine months.  During the same period, he said, the number of non-bitcoin transactions amounted to 3,226.  Speaking to CoinDesk, the director spoke of the transport network's incapability to deal with digital top ups, noting how they took up to five business days to clear.  He said:  ""Our objective in adding bitcoin was to make a real-world use of the currency. In hindsight, using bitcoin on a system where the transaction takes three to five business days to reflect was a poor choice to highlight what bitcoin is all about.""  Having realised the impracticalities of the system, Bouguettaya said that his team tried to find a way of ""hacking"" the MyWay card, so that consumers could store their bitcoin balance – or wallet address – on it. However, the ACT Government, the local authority running the top-up scheme advised them that proceeding in such a way would be illegal.  ""They [the ACT Government] told us that a third party contractor actually owns the cards, meaning they couldn't make changes we suggested without their approval,"" said the director.  He added: ""We spoke to the third party, and they made it quite clear they were not interested.""  Bitcoin in Australia  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) suggested it was against regulating digital currencies in April this year.  However, it is not all bad news for bitcoiners in the country. In February, Coin Loft, an Australian exchange, said it had been officially exempt from charing Goods and Services Tax (GST) on local bitcoin sales.  A day later, Webjet became the first Australian online travel agency to accept bitcoin payments following a partnership with Sydney-based bitcoin startup BitPOS, enabling customers to complete digital currency transactions through its Webjet Exclusives website.

42398346,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbTJHn,1431340056,Nasdaq Becomes Latest Firm to Trial Blockchain Technology,"Nasdaq OMX Group Inc is reportedly exploring how a blockchain-based solution could change the way shares are transferred and sold manually.  The company will trial the technology in Nasdaq Private Market, a capital marketplace launched in January 2014, which sets out to connect private companies and global investors, allowing the latter to purchase shares which may eventually go public before they do so.  Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld told The Wall Street Journal:  ""Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities.""  He added that the technology held the potential to ""benefit not only our clients, but the broader capital markets"".  The company has appointed Fredrik Voss, vice president and deputy head of commodities, as its new blockchain technology lead.  Blockchain tech exploration  Nasdaq OMX Group  , which owns and operates the Nasdaq stock exchange, is the latest to explore the cryptocurrency space.        Swiss investment bank UBS announced the opening of a London-based blockchain technology research lab to explore the application in the financial services industry just last month.  Bankers from traditional finance have also previously praised blockchain technology, highlighting its potential to transform the industry.  Ex-JP Morgan Chase & Co executive Blythe Masters joined bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings LLC as chief executive in March.
