What makes dapp different is that even though they offer a similar layout and functionality to a standard phone and web application, they do not run on corporate servers. Instead, dapps run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network. Thus, no single company or user is controlling them as they are community-driven. With no central authority running the dapps, this platform is independent of interference by corporations, governments, and individuals. Moreover, decentralized applications eliminate the downtime, meaning if a server shuts down, another network takes up the load and keeps the dapp working. Therefore, the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem is majorly dependent on dapps these days. They have been a game-changer for the Blockchain world. BNBMatrix For Yield Farming Every day a new dapp offers new earning opportunities and numerous benefits to crypto investors. Now, with multiple dapps out there, one stands out as the best, i.e., BNBMatrix.io - a yield farming smart contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

42411146,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj7kV4,1637416880,Music Marketplace Nina Wants to Be a Bandcamp for Web 3.0,"For years, crypto believers have been trying to put music ‚Äúon the blockchain.‚Äù And while startups and investors say there‚Äôs potential, many artists ‚Äì at least so far ‚Äì remain unconvinced. Some services have taken a shot, but most are geared toward artists already immersed in blockchain tech. What about musicians who are put off by crypto, who just want to get paid for their work?  Enter Nina, a new digital marketplace for music in the vein of Bandcamp and Discogs. Spearheaded by Mike Pollard, formerly of Arbor Records, along with Jack Callahan and Eric Farber, it launched yesterday on Solana, an energy-efficient alternative to the Ethereum blockchain.  When a musician uploads their album to Nina, they‚Äôre making it available to stream for free, as with Soundcloud or YouTube. But they‚Äôre also issuing a limited set of tokens, which aren‚Äôt platform specific. Buying an album‚Äôs token doesn‚Äôt get you a digital copy of the music, but it might entitle you to special perks down the line.  ‚ÄúYou can think of the tokens as being a kind of modular loyalty program, potentially,‚Äù said Pollard. ‚ÄúIf an artist wants to say, ‚ÄòTicket sales go on 30 minutes before to people who have this token,‚Äô [they could], or you could do a token-gated discord. There‚Äôs a kind of value that we‚Äôre not necessarily going to prescribe.‚Äù  Read more: What Hic et Nunc‚Äôs Resurrection Says About Decentralized Infrastructure  It‚Äôs up to the artists to create that value, and to choose whether to offer special perks to collectors. Nina plans to offer music from Ryley Walker, Aaron Dilloway, C. Spencer Yeh, Georgia, Cloud Nothings, Bergsonist, Horse Lords, Jeff Witscher and more.  A quirk is that Nina only allows for purchases in USDC (US dollar coin) ‚Äì a popular ‚Äústablecoin‚Äù that‚Äôs pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. It‚Äôs still crypto, but it‚Äôs much less volatile than ETH or SOL, the native token of the Solana blockchain.  It‚Äôs an approach meant to tackle one of the fundamental problems with crypto, and the nascent cultural sphere known as Web 3: accessibility. For many artists, crypto (and especially the culture around non-fungible tokens, or NFTs) remains a punchline. And navigating unfamiliar crypto exchanges, unhosted wallets and token swaps can feel daunting.  Pollard, who comes from the music world, is acutely aware of all this. He‚Äôs spent time in tech, as a developer for a Silicon Valley startup (and as a freelancer for the company that became Mediachain Labs, the startup co-founded by crypto investors Jesse Walden and Denis Nazarov), but with Nina, he‚Äôs attempting to reach a broader audience. ‚ÄúI think that to get people who don‚Äôt care about crypto in, you have to really baby-step that kind of stuff,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúRight now, education around blockchain stuff [involves] too many words that people don‚Äôt know. And you have to feel like you‚Äôre making some kind of ideological shift. But I think that the benefits of blockchain can be delivered without having to fully drink the Kool-Aid.‚Äù  ‚Äú$5 USDC‚Äù is somehow friendlier than ‚Äú.00023ETH.‚Äù And you won‚Äôt find the initialism ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù anywhere on Nina‚Äôs website, either. ‚ÄúMusicians make music, they don‚Äôt make NFTs,‚Äù said Pollard.  The choice of Solana over Ethereum clears up some other potential issues, namely the cost-prohibitive fee system (minting a ‚Äúfree‚Äù NFT can still cost around $200 in fees, depending on the time of day) and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which incurs a significant environmental cost.  In the way that the online marketplace Discogs handles sales of used physical CDs, LPs and cassettes, Nina operates a secondary marketplace for its tokens. If you buy a token for an album or song and at some point you‚Äôre through with it, you can just sell it to someone else. The musician gets a cut of each of those sales, too.  John Elliott, who records as Imaginary Softwoods (he used to be in the band Emeralds), is among the first artists to upload music exclusively to Nina. His new track, ‚ÄúThe Hi-Lonesome Conifers (edit),‚Äù was made available yesterday in an edition of 25 tokens. Within a few hours, it had sold out.  ‚ÄúI really like the idea that I can actually get so much residual sales from the used market, if people actually purchase the thing and like it,‚Äù he said.  Where Bandcamp collects a fee on each purchase, Nina charges a single fee upfront to upload a song, and then mostly backs off. When you buy an artist‚Äôs token, the artist is getting all of your money, minus a nominal transaction fee. Nina then takes a fee on secondary sales, which comes from users‚Äô pockets rather than musicians‚Äô.  Nina is still clearly in its infancy, and there remain kinks to be worked out. Because these tokens have inherent financial properties, there‚Äôs always the chance that speculators could come in and drive up prices ‚Äì like ticket scalping, but for tokens on the blockchain. This already happens on Discogs, where collectors of rare records flip albums like stocks, buying low and selling high. Another issue is that there‚Äôs currently not much you can actually do with your token after you‚Äôve purchased it, beyond reselling it.  For now, though, the platform is a bid to get musicians to try something new. Streaming has been great for the music business and less great for most musicians. It‚Äôs tough to make money on Soundcloud. And Bandcamp, while great at funneling money to artists, only drops the fees on special occasionshttps://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-fridays-2021. Pollard is betting that Nina can ascribe value to digital music in an entirely new way.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs groundswells happening, of artists that aren‚Äôt afraid of the word ‚ÄòWeb 3.0,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think some people see that this is going to be a really exciting way for them to get out of the platform dependencies that suck a lot of fun out of music.‚Äù",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/11/20/music-marketplace-nina-wants-to-be-a-bandcamp-for-web-30,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4a00c915c80dd86c241ac59bf52a423e3e71b3c-3854x2520.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Associated Press and other publications reported that the cancellation followed the arrest earlier Thursday of Israeli crypto mogul Moshe Hogeg on fraud involving cryptocurrencies and assault charges. The publications also reported that Hogeg has ties to Ownix, which operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Hogeg lists the company in the Interests section of his LinkedIn profile.  ‚ÄúIn light of information received today that goes against the Club‚Äôs values, FC Barcelona hereby communicate the cancellation of the contract to create and market NFT digital assets with Ownix with immediate effect,‚Äù the club said in a statement on its website.  At the time of publication, the club had not responded to CoinDesk requests for comment.  Announced just 15 days ago, the FC Barcelona NFT auction based on photos and videos from the club‚Äôs 122-year history is slated to take place on Nov. 24, according to a countdown timer on the Ownix website. The launch will feature remarks from Joan Laporta, who took over as FC Barcelona president earlier this year and other ‚Äúkey members‚Äù of the club, an email from an FC Barcelona representative to CoinDesk said.

42420831,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYlGH,1637374810,Kleiman v. Wright: Defense‚Äôs Autism Expert Explains His Diagnosis of Craig Wright,"MIAMI ‚Äì On Friday, the federal civil trial pitting Craig Wright against Ira Kleiman continued, with the day dominated by testimony of an autism expert. Dr. Ami Klin testified that Wright is autistic and has had trouble relating to people throughout his life.  Today marked the end of the third week of the trial. Wright claims to have invented Bitcoin by himself. Kleiman, the personal representative of the estate of his late brother Dave Kleiman, alleges that Dave helped invent the cryptocurrency in what amounted to partnership with Wright and, thus, the estate is entitled to any assets they developed jointly ‚Äì including bitcoin worth some $66 billion and intellectual property. Wright maintains Dave Kleiman was his friend but not his business partner, and that their interactions regarding bitcoin were minimal.  The civil suit is founded on the assumption by both parties that Craig Wright is the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, a claim that he has pushed for the past 5.5 years but which has been met with great skepticism and never actually been proven. Similarly, the ownership of many of the bitcoin addresses and coins at issue is also somewhat murky.  Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?  Bitcoin and taxes  The morning began with the continuation of testimony by David Kuharcik, an accountant who prepared Dave Kleiman‚Äôs federal tax returns as well as returns for a business, Computer Forensics LLC, that Kleiman created with two partners.  Defense attorney Amanda McGovern led the accountant through a review of tax returns, pointing out that there had never been a mention of bitcoin.  On cross-examination, plaintiffs‚Äô counsel Kyle Roche got Kuharcik to acknowledge that ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt until 2014 that the [Internal Revenue Service] issued formal guidance as to how bitcoin mining and bitcoin gains be reported on tax returns.‚Äù Dave Kleiman died in 2013.  ‚ÄòA lifelong pattern of becoming obsessed‚Äô  Then the defense called Dr. Ami Klin, director of the Marcus Autism Center at Children‚Äôs Healthcare of Atlanta and Chief of the Division of Autism and Related Disorders at Emory University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics. Klin has also worked with autistic adults.  Klin testified that Wright was a classic ‚Äúperson with autism and high intellect.‚Äù Such people may be proficient with languages and obsess over certain topics and facts. They may ‚Äúspeak sometimes with supreme confidence,‚Äù Klin said. Thus, their words may come across as disrespectful. They often do not pick up on sarcasm, metaphor or humor, nor do they realize they are being judged in social settings.  Klin said Wright has had ‚Äúvery few friends because not many people share his interests.‚Äù This is something very characteristic of people with autism, he said. ‚ÄúDr. Wright has a lifelong pattern of becoming obsessed about specific areas of interest as a coping style.‚Äù Growing up, conversations could be ‚Äúvery one-sided. He ended up alienating his peers and he was mercilessly bullied, ridiculed and ostracized.‚Äù  In Wright‚Äôs adulthood, his ‚Äúconversations turn to a lecture about his interests. He‚Äôs not thinking about what may be of interest to others.‚Äù People on the autism spectrum can be ‚Äúperfect prey, perfect victims because they cannot judge others‚Äô intentions,‚Äù Klin said.  ‚ÄúThey focus on irrelevant details and miss the whole,‚Äù Klin said of autistic people. He noted they often have rigid ways of being. ‚ÄúDr. Wright cannot deal with any change,‚Äù Klin said. Wright‚Äôs mother reported he sometimes had ‚Äúadult tantrums.‚Äù  Klin described one of his clients who was pulled over by police for speeding. The cop gave his speed. The client corrected the cop ‚Äì he‚Äôd been speeding but at a different speed. That illustrated a tendency to be truthful and precise. ‚ÄúThey have a tendency to self-incriminate,‚Äù Klin said.  A $32,000 diagnosis over 4 days  Plaintiff‚Äôs attorney Andrew Scott Brenner pressed about the circumstances under which Klin had evaluated Wright. When Wright‚Äôs legal team had first engaged Klin, a document shows, they asked him to determine whether Wright met the criteria for autism spectrum disorder, and how this diagnosis would ‚Äúimpact his presentation in legal proceedings such as depositions and court appearances.‚Äù  Once hired, Klin said he googled Wright and watched a few minutes‚Äô video of him at a conference. He thought Wright ‚Äúlooked like Steve Jobs and sounded like a visionary.‚Äù  He did not look at Wright‚Äôs prior medical records, mental health records, military records or school records.  Klin said he spent hours reviewing Wright‚Äôs court depositions. He performed an evaluation and did a direct interview with Wright over video; those actions took 2.5 hours. His colleague conducted interviews with Wright‚Äôs wife, sister, uncle and mother; Klin reviewed those and compiled a report.  ‚ÄúIn four days and $32,000 later is when you issued your report that Dr. Wright was autistic, right?‚Äù Brenner asked. Klin insisted he‚Äôd followed protocols.  Klin is expected to continue testifying Monday, and Wright is expected to return to the stand Monday or Tuesday. Attorneys for both sides said they hope to get to closing arguments by Tuesday. There will be no proceedings Wednesday or the rest of next week due to the Thanksgiving holiday.
