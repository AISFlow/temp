42398755,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXY5,1445367984,Australian Government to Review Bitcoin Regulation Powers,"The Australian government has committed to reviewing how the country's central bank and top securities regulator oversee bitcoin and other emerging payment systems.      Earlier today the Australian government released its response to the Murray Review, otherwise known as the Financial System Inquiry, a wide-ranging report published last December as part of an effort by the government to make changes to the country's financial system.    The Murray Review's name is derived from the committee chairman of the panel that drafted it, David Murray, who acted as chief executive of Commonwealth Bank of Australia between 1992 and 2005. According to the report's introduction, the effort was aimed at ""examining how the financial system could be positioned to best meet Australia’s evolving needs and support Australia’s economic growth"".  As part of a range of policy commitments related to innovation in the financial system, the government said in its response that it would look at the regulatory capacities of both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in an effort to create a ""graduated"" rulemaking process for emerging payments systems, including bitcoin.  The government said:  ""We will clarify powers held by ASIC and the RBA to ensure that regulators have the power to regulate new payment systems in a graduated way, such as digital currencies (e.g. bitcoin) and other payment systems as they emerge.""  Though it's the only part of the report that explicitly mentions bitcoin or digital currencies, other measures set to be taken could impact the country's bitcoin ecosystem. These include the creation of a public-private sector ""collaborative committee"" aimed at strengthening engagement between government regulators and startups and a broad commitment to keep national legislation ""technology neutral"".  ""Technology-specific regulation can impede innovation and competition by preventing the adoption of the best technology or the most innovative business models,"" the government said, going on to state that it would ""consult with the financial sector on priority areas of existing legislation and regulation"" as it looks to draft new proposals.  The policy response comes amid a crackdown on bitcoin businesses by some of Australia's largest banks. An investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) into the closure of startup bank accounts is currently underway.  The Australian Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42398773,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXpn,1445356617,5 Facts from the Q3 2015 State of Bitcoin Report,"Last week saw the release of CoinDesk's latest State of Bitcoin report, which gives a quarterly snapshot of the digital currency ecosystem.  Q3 was marked by a shift towards bitcoin technology's use in non-financial applications, for example settlement. Both startups – with products like itBit's bankchain – and large financial institutions – who are now investing in blockchain companies – drove this rhetoric.  Here, we've collected a few interesting tidbits you might have missed from the report – which weighs in at 87 slides.  You can view the report in full or check out CoinDesk's previous State of Bitcoin reports.  1. Trading and volatility are back up  Last quarter, bitcoin experienced an uncharacteristic period of calm, with a peak-to-trough percentage of 20%. This zen didn't last, however, as Q3 saw this figure rise by 13% (Side 12).  While it's still on the lower end of the volatility spectrum (Q2 2014 recorded a peak-to-trough percentage of 84%), the quarter did see a boost in trading (Slide 13).  In the latter part of Q2, monthly trading volume had been between 5 and 6 million bitcoins. In August, it exceeded 10 million bitcoins – the first time since April.  2. But investment is down  While traders were putting more cash on the line in Q3, investor interest actually fell.  VC investment in bitcoin companies dropped 41% from $145m to $85m – the lowest total of the last four quarters (Slide 30).  Despite large rounds from Chain ($30m) and BitFury ($20m), the average deal size also fell from $10m in Q2 to $6m in Q3.  This could be a seasonal slump, following a larger VC trend that slowed 5% in Q3.  However, the 2015 year to date total ($462m) is more than double that for 2014 (Slide 26), while the total invested in bitcoin startups ($921m) nears the billion dollar mark (Slide 27).  3. Despite the hype, no $ for emerging markets  Though emerging markets have been touted as the most likely places bitcoin could succeed, they have been the biggest losers VC-wise.  The Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI), which tracks factors such as technology penetration and financial repression (Slide 54), ranks Argentina, Venezuela and Zimbabwe in the top spots.  In fact, 40% of markets in the BMPI's top 10 are in Sub-Saharan Africa, while 20% are in Latin America.  However, the State of Bitcoin shows there was no VC investment in African, Latin American or Middle Eastern startups in Q3 or Q2 (Slide 32).  It's no surprise that the US and Canada come top for VC investment, receiving 75% of all money in Q3 – nearly triple the rest of the world combined.  In addition, North America and Europe (which comes second in Q3's VC funding) are the destinations with the most bitcoin-accepting businesses (Slide 53).  4. Merchant interest slumps, again  While transactions (Slide 44) and wallet numbers (Slide 45) continue to rise, they don't paint the whole picture.    The two biggest merchant processors, BitPay and Coinbase, saw growth among new merchants halve in Q2 (Slide 48).      It appears last quarter's boost of 12,000 merchants may have been an anomaly, with numbers now plateauing at 6,000 per quarter – the same for Q1 and Q2.      BitPay announced it would cut staff in an effort to ""reduce costs"" and ""better align with the pace of growth"" in the industry (Slide 47). It is no longer offering its free tiered product.      Revenues are slowing too, at $190bn they are only up $2bn from June 2015, Q2. Companies, such as Expedia (Slide 49), say purchases taper off after time.      Those who appear to be holding fast during the slump are best geared to bitcoin's Millenial demographic.    5. New York's Bitlicense divided opinion    Q3 also saw the official deadline for bitcoin companies applying for New York's Bitlicense, in order to serve customers in the state.      The regulations, which had been on the boil since 2013, proved divisive for the community.      By today's count, some 22 companies applied for the license – with Circle the first to get it – while 15 others ceased operations in the state.      Many who left cited the large legal costs involved, $100,000 by Bitstamp's estimates, while others framed their withdrawal as a political statement, a backlash against what they termed 'overly invasive' guidelines.

42398769,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgXlr,1445340532,Spanish Tax Authorities Issue Bitcoin-Related Probe for Information,"The Spanish Tax Authority has probed at least one bitcoin-friendly business in the country for information on the way it handles payments received in the digital currency.  La Agencia Tributaria Española sent an information request to Madrid-based, bitcoin-accepting law firm Abanlex, asking it to provide its bitcoin-related accounts. Abanlex received the request on 8th October and published it online.  A loosely translated version reads:  ""[We request] to know whether your business accepts bitcoin as a payment method for services offered or goods delivered. If so, we request to know the volume of bitcoin payments received to date as well as information and accounting documents for all bitcoin activity.""  It continues: ""We also request information about the exchange of bitcoin into euro and vice-versa; including the exchange platform used, timings of the exchange and, in particular, information about your bitcoin wallet, if you have one, or if you automatically exchange bitcoin into euros upon receipt.""  The request outlined that the bitcoin accepting business should reply within 10 working days, noting that failure to do so would result in further investigations and possible sanctions.  In his response to the agency's request, Pablo Fernández Burgueño, partner at Abanlex, said the firm had not yet received any payments in bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies.  Although they declined to comment on specifics, a spokesperson for the Spanish Tax Authority said they hoped to find out more about bitcoin to determine whether it could be used for illicit purposes.  No surprise  A spokesperson for Spanish travel agency Destinia – which integrated bitcoin payments in early 2014 – said they had not received an information request.  The spokesperson added: ""Information requests are part of the Agencia Tributaria's normal procedure, they are issued for various different reasons. It is an understandable exercise within the Agency's framework and should not come as a surprise.""  A. Gómez de la Cruz, lawyer at Law and Bitcoin noted that the questions put forward by the agency evidenced its ""perfect"" understanding of bitcoin and the digital currency's inner workings.  The information probe comes after the Spanish Tax Office clarified earlier this year that bitcoin was exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country.  The European Court of Justice is expected to decide this Thursday whether bitcoin exchanges in the continent will be required to pay VAT on trades.
