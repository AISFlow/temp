42378842,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mEur,1475521926,EU Parliament Paper Explores Bitcoin-Powered Elections,"A think tank run by the European Parliament recently released a discussion paper on the use of bitcoin and blockchain technology in elections, analyzing the topic through the broader lens of electronic voting.  Published on 29th September, the paper was authored by Phillip Nicholas Boucher, a researcher for the European Union Think Tank. Boucher wrote that adoption would represent a major shift in how trust is managed within the voting process, moving that kind of control ""away from central actors"", leading to ""tech-enabled community consensus"".  The question, as the paper presents it, is whether the technology could be leveraged to provide either piecemeal or wholesale changes to existing voting systems, including those already operating via digital means.  Boucher wrote:  ""Many experts agree that e-voting would require revolutionary developments in security systems. The debate is whether blockchain will represent a transformative or merely incremental development, and what its implications could be for the future of democracy.""  The European Parliament isn't alone in weighed the concept.  It's an application that has been pursued in various forms in both the public and private sectors, with the idea being that a blockchain can allow users with software clients to signal preferences in distributed governance decisions.  The nature of bitcoin's proof-of-work was even described in the original white paper as a kind of ""vote"" for what constitutes the longest chain of transactions.  The bitcoin option  The paper goes on to speculate about what form a blockchain-based voting system might look like, suggesting that the bitcoin blockchain could be preferable over something entirely new and untested.  ""One way of developing BEV systems for e-voting is to create a new, bespoke system, designed to reflect the specific characteristics of the election and electorate,"" Boucher wrote. ""A second approach that may be cheaper and easier is to 'piggyback', running the election on a more established blockchain, such as that used by the virtual currency, bitcoin.""  There are risks, according to Boucher. Perhaps most notable is the need to maintain voter anonymity – what he called ""a crucial element of democratic participation"".  That kind of individual privacy, he wrote, could become complicated in a wholly digitized environment, particularly within one that is at least somewhat managed by a third party.  Boucher concludes by pointing to efforts in e-voting throughout Europe. More effort, however, would be needed before widespread blockchain voting ever became possible.  He wrote:  ""...proposals to use blockchain in national elections would have to comply with several other areas of European law, including privacy and data protection for voters, and accessibility for all citizens.""

42378848,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF3f,1475512976,Hyperledger Launches Blockchain Working Group for Healthcare,"Hyperledger today announced the formation of a new working group focused on blockchain applications in the healthcare space.  Unveiled at the Distributed: Health blockchain conference in Tennessee, the working group is composed of healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente; tech giant IBM; professional services firm Accenture; and startups Gem and Hashed Health.  As a starting point, according to Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf, the group will turn to a collection of over 70 proposals submitted to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of a recent competition organized by the government agency.  Behlendorf told CoinDesk:  ""The point of the working group is to take the list of use cases from the HHS essay contest, which is where we might usefully put a blockchain into the healthcare system, or use it to support healthcare use cases.""  Specific applications up for discussion include decentralized registries, interoperable networks and associated identities, smart contracts and process automation, among others.  Ultimately, according to members of the new working group, the goal is to hone in on a single project on which Hyperledger can focus its software writing efforts.  Looking ahead  Gem will spearhead the group's recruiting efforts, according to Behlendorf, adding that companies wishing to join don't need to be a member of the Hyperledger project.  With the HHS entries as a basis, the working group will seek to identify a use case that will serve as the open-source organization’s minimum viable product for blockchain and healthcare.  Behlendorf calls what they’re looking for the “first delta” upon which other healthcare industry professionals can build.  In addition to expanding its focus into the healthcare industry, Behlendorf says the working group reflects the overall project's push beyond finance.  Behlendorf concluded:  ""It’s always been a part of the vision of the Hyperledger project that we’re building foundational technologies for blockchain that are never necessarily tied to financial use cases. This is as foundational as an operating system, a database, a programming language.""  Correction: An earlier draft of this article based on information provided by Hyperledger mistakenly included Digital Asset as one of the founding members of the healthcare group.

The company said today that its first CEO, Austin Hill, is formally stepping aside, with current president Adam Back being appointed to the role.  As part of Hill's exit from the firm, he has also stepped down from the board. Blockstream said that Hill was leaving the company to ""pursue other opportunities"".  Back, a noted cryptographer who is one of the startup's founders, said in a statement:  ""I am honored to take on the CEO position at this important phase in the company’s growth and am excited about leading Blockstream to its full potential. We have a world­class team dedicated to building the foundation that will underpin the transformation of finance for years to come.""  It’s been a busy year for Blockstream, which announced $55m in new funding in February. To date, the startup has raised more than $70m in venture capital in order to support its efforts to develop bitcoin-focused initiatives such as sidechains and the Lightning network.  Hill’s exit comes as the startup has moved to bolster its developer ranks. Earlier this summer, Blockstream acquired bitcoin wallet startup GreenAddress, which further boosted its employee base.

42378857,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF9x,1475502619,JP Morgan is Quietly Developing a Private Ethereum Blockchain,"Wall Street mega-bank JP Morgan has co-developed a private, permissioned version of the ethereum network.  The project, presented during a meeting of the Hyperledger technical steering committee last month, was recently demonstrated during the Sibos convention in Geneva. But while the bank avoided the headline-grabbing announcements of its peers like Bank of America and UBS last week, this doesn't mean it is shying away from discussing its work.  Called Quorum, the platform was developed in partnership with ethereum startup EthLab, and it is one of the first projects to come out of a working group within the bank known as the Blockchain Center of Excellence.  Amber Baldet, program lead for the division, explained that JP Morgan is now looking to open source its blockchain technology work in order to get more developers involved.  Baldet told CoinDesk:  ""One of our goals in working with an open-source platform and contributing our work back is to encourage collaboration and innovation. The more people that get involved, the faster we will see adoption challenges addressed and the more robust the system will become.""  In tandem with the development of Quorum, Baldet said JP Morgan created a software development kit (SDK) aimed at encouraging developers to create applications.  Baldet went on to describe the project as ""an additional choice"" in the company's toolkit of software offerings aimed at solving business problems.  Notably, Quorum is the second major blockchain-inspired offering to come out of the JP Morgan's technology labs. Earlier this year, the bank showcased Juno, a project it called a ""distributed crypto-ledger"" that was designed to enable quick value transfers between network parties.  The developers behind Juno departed the bank earlier this year to form their own startup, Quartz reported in July.  Inside Quorum  According to JP Morgan, the project was developed following discussions during the first ethereum developer conference (Devcon1) in 2015.  ""While speaking with Jeff Wilcke of EthLab there, we recognized that there was a potential overlap between his goal to build a voting-based consensus mechanism to replace proof-of-work, and our goal to build a high-speed, permissioned ledger,"" Baldet explained.  According to Wilcke, the system itself has several elements, involving teams on both the JP Morgan and EthLab side.  EthLab manages development on the consensus rules and core changes to the code itself, whereas JP Morgan acts to sign the private messages broadcast across the network.  Wilcke explained:  ""The JP Morgan chain requires special rules that will allow private transactions, ie there's a separation between public and private contracts. [Public transactions] can be seen by anyone and [private transactions] can only be seen by parties that have access to a key belonging to that particular party.”  Wilcke suggested that the work could have some impact on the future of the ethereum network – potentially foreshadowing the intersection of public and private chains – but indicated stopped short of any broad predictions.  ""Time will tell,"" he added.  Next steps  From here, the project will see further iteration following feedback from both participants and industry stakeholders.  Baldet said that JP Morgan has no plans to monetize the work, but rather intends for the project to act as a vehicle for connecting with developers in the open-source community.  ""While our current applications using Quorum function within JP Morgan, releasing the software is an important stepping stone to launching projects with other organizations,"" Baldet said.  Baldet also went on to suggest that the project could serve as a first step toward building a system that could connect private institutions via distributed networks.  She concluded:  ""While we expect some convergence around a few key 'enterprise-grade' platforms, interoperability will be next year’s buzzword.""

42378854,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mF8h,1475494723,Why Broadridge is Investing Millions in Blockchain Voting,"Financial services firm Broadridge recently had a coming out party as a leading blockchain investor.  While the New York investing tech provider had previously voiced an interest in blockchain, it wasn't until recently it invested $95m in a deal that will find it acquiring new technology assets as part of a bid to develop client-focused distributed ledger services. Later that same week, it hosted a blockchain-focused breakfast with 50 of its clients and technology partners including Credit Suisse and UBS.  Broadridge's more aggressive moves in the blockchain space were preceded by internal testing and, more notably, investments in industry startups. Earlier this year, the firm participated in a $60m investment in New York-based startup Digital Asset Holdings alongside BNP Paribas, ICAP and the DTCC, among others.  But the investment hasn't just been in other companies. The firm has devoted 30 employees to develop multiple proofs-of-concept for its clients, focused on areas such as business communications and trade processing.  After moderating a panel at a breakfast last month, Broadridge global head of strategy and blockchain lead, Vijay Mayadas, told CoinDesk that strong demand on the client side led the firm to begin devoting significant resources to start capturing some of that interest.  Mayadas said:  ""In terms of accelerating the adoption of blockchain, we already have the industry connectivity, we already have the platform, and we have the clients. So we feel we’re uniquely positioned to take blockchain, figure out how to really solve some of the pain points and bring solutions to market very quickly.""  Fuel for the fire  In some ways, the $95m acquisition of technology assets from Inveshare can be looked at as a key driver for bridging blockchain with some of the services that Broadridge offers, including mechanisms for proxy voting, or processes by which other parties are brought into the corporate voting process.  The deal, announced last month, finds Broadridge agreeing to pay $95m for the assets, with an additional $40m due on delivery of the blockchain applications.  Broadridge plans to use the assets it acquired to develop blockchain applications that let stockholders vote at investor meetings in which they were unable to attend, as well as other services connected to its proxy business.  Broadridge explained that the Inveshare technology would be used to accelerate the development of blockchain-based proxy applications by increasing the transparency of vote confirmation and reducing the complexity of the current reconciliation process.  The firm is not sharing its development timeline, other than saying it intends to be the ""first to market with a complete proxy blockchain solution"".  In a statement, Broadridge president and CEO Richard Daly confirmed that applications to its proxy voting services are a major focus moving forward.  ""Integrating blockchain technology into the proxy process has the potential to drive significant benefits for all participants,” he said.  Looking ahead  Ultimately, both the firm and those attending its breakfast said that the goal is to shave operating costs – and maybe make a little bit of money on the way.  Speaking at the event, Chris Church, chief business development officer for Digital Asset, argued this point.  He said that should the technology take off those money-saving mechanisms could turn into money generators.  Church, who previously worked as the CEO of SWIFT, told attendees:  ""It may take 10 years to get widespread adoption. But the people in this room, the people Broadridge invited, need to be building now.""
