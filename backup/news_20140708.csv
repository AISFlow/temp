42377437,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yhX,1404861030,Polish Finance Ministry: Bitcoin Can Be Used as Financial Instrument,"Poland’s deputy finance minister Wojciech Kowalczyk has released a document confirming that under the country’s existing financial regulations, bitcoin can be considered a financial instrument.  The statement follows a previous inquiry from Michal Pacholski, an opposition member of Parliament for the liberal Twoj Ruch (Your Movement) party. At the time, Pacholski asked Poland's Ministry of Finance to explain the legal status of bitcoin transactions. Specifically, his query focused on whether or not ""options and futures contracts can be considered as a financial instrument"" if they are denominated in a digital currency.  The Finance Ministry replied that bitcoin fits within that legal framework, stating:  “Options or futures contracts which are based on [bitcoin] as a base instrument can be considered as derivative instruments, and as such, they can be considered as financial instruments, according to the bill on financial instruments.”  Bitcoin's legal status clarified  In the notice, Kowalczyk confirmed that bitcoin is not an officially recognized currency in Poland. He said in the policy document:  “An analysis of national regulations allows to conclude that bitcoin … is not a legally defined and universally accepted currency, because it cannot be classified as either a national currency … or a foreign currency.”  Previously, Pacholski had pressed the Finance Ministry on the possibility of issuing options and futures contracts in the form of derivatives based on bitcoin market indexes. These issuances, he said, would be similar to the derivatives which are based on stock market indexes.  Kowalczyk's document confirms that these instruments may be made available to Polish investors. This, the Finance Ministry said, is in accordance with the country's banking services regulations.  Regulators accept bitcoin usage  Ultimately, the Polish government statement on bitcoin's use in derivatives markets suggests the continued evolution of government policy toward digital currencies in Poland. While bitcoin can be used as a medium of exchange and financial tool, it remains unrecognized as a legal currency by regulators.  This policy stance has been stated by Poland's financial regulators in the past, including officials from the Finance Ministry.  Speaking at a seminar held at the Warsaw School of Economics (SGH) in December, Szymon Wozniak, a Finance Ministry representative, said that the ministry does not consider bitcoin to be illegal, but it does not consider it to be a legal currency either. He remarked:  “What is not forbidden is permitted. However, we certainly cannot consider bitcoin to be a legal currency.”  Warsaw image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jaroslaw Adamowski,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/08/polish-finance-ministry-bitcoin-can-be-used-as-financial-instrument,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71716739a2180a777c3cbb8af9f1d2d88ef0b909-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377447,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ynp,1404856223,Michigan Attorney General: Bitcoin Poses 'Real-Life Risk' for Investors,"Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette’s office has released a broad advisory on digital currencies, stating they carry “real-life risk” and urging consumers to learn more about bitcoin and other currencies before purchasing or using them.  The advisory echoes similar releases by other state agencies, many of which have been published in the last six months. Warnings cover price volatility, tax considerations and the broader digital risks that consumers face when spending on the Internet.  In a statement, Schuette suggested that digital currencies need to be treated carefully by the uninformed, stressing that education is a key step for any investor or consumer wishing to get involved with bitcoin.  He said:  ""Virtual currency does not have the same safeguards as hard currency. I advise all Michigan citizens to educate themselves prior to putting their hard-earned dollars into a virtual wallet.""  Treat ‘as an investment’  The notice states that, in the eyes of the Michigan attorney general’s office, bitcoin is not a “real currency”, and as such, buyers and sellers should treat digital currencies as a type of investment.  Part of this, the advisory explains, means taking the proper steps to protect digital currency holdings owing to the risk of malware that can lead to loss and theft. As well, the attorney general’s office said that consumers should not purchase more than they are willing to lose owing to the risk of price volatility.  The notice warns:  “Before purchasing any virtual currency or otherwise jumping on the virtual currency bandwagon, educate yourself so you can make an informed decision about what you are getting into. Virtual currency carries a significant amount of real-life risk.”  Stance mirrors prior US government warnings  In the past few months, regulators on the state and federal level in the US have issued warnings on bitcoin. The release from the Michigan attorney general’s office reflects many of the same concerns previously voiced, further confirming the near-term approach the US government is taking in regards to digital currencies.  In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors that quick price movements and a lack of centralized consumer protections puts digital currency users at risk. At the time, the agency said that like all technological innovations still in their relative infancy, bitcoin has “the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities”.  While mirroring past statements, the Michigan report also reflects on where US government policy in regards to digital currencies is heading in the long-term.  Last month, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) asked a series of federal regulators to take a more active approach toward bitcoin and other digital currencies. Specifically, the GAO requested that more interagency cooperation on digital currencies be conducted. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau later responded by saying that such efforts were underway and that future advisories on bitcoin would be developed in conjunction with other parts of the federal government.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/08/michigan-attorney-general-bitcoin-poses-real-life-risk-for-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc228c8d1227a577e8155d3cc0bdc6b58e21ecd0-939x505.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377435,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ydl,1404846936,"Mt. Gox CEO to Auction Bitcoins.com, Share Proceeds with Creditors","The domain name Bitcoins.com, owned by Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, is set to be sold off through US-based auction house Heritage Auctions on 24th July.  The sale of the domain name is part of Heritage’s 2014 Domain Names Signature Auction and is expected to garner at least $750,000, owing to what the auction house calls the high-value of the domain name. The auction will begin with an opening bid of $185,000.  It is perhaps the highest-profile auction of a bitcoin-related web address to date. In the past year, several domain names have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, including BitcoinWallet.com for $250,000.  In a statement, Karpeles stated that some of the proceeds from the auction would be used to provide relief to those who lost money in the collapse of Mt. Gox:  ""We are hoping, with the sale of Bitcoins.com, to provide some relief to the people impacted by the Mt. Gox bankruptcy and will be putting at least half of the sale amount toward that purpose.”  The news follows recent revelations that Karpeles' company Tibanne K.K., which currently owns the Bitcoins.com domain name, billed Mt. Gox for roughly $200,000 in fees. In the past, Karpeles has indicated that he was planning to auction off Bitcoins.com, as well as other domain names owned by Tibanne.  Pitched as investment opportunity  Mirroring past demand for bitcoin-related domain names, Heritage’s auction frames Bitcoins.com as a prime investment opportunity.  The company suggests on the official auction page that, in the future, a prospective investor or investors could sell the domain name to a prominent business in the ecosystem. Conversely, bitcoin businesses stand to benefit from owning an easy-to-share domain name that enables greater visibility.  Heritage founder and director of intellectual property Aron Meystedt cited past domain name sales when suggesting that Bitcoins.com is a rare buy.  He said in a press statement:  “Bitcoins.com is absolutely the best remaining, and available name for this new market. Bitcoin.com, the singular version, is owned and used by Blockchain.info, the world's most popular bitcoin wallet, and Bitcoinwallet.com itself is also already tied up. For the right investor this is a golden opportunity.”  Auction could fetch high price  The auction of Bitcoins.com could fetch a high price, given the broad exposure to a global market that Heritage provides. Heritage is the third-largest auction house in the world, with annual sales exceeding $900m per year and more than 850,000 bidders in its network.  Given the history of past domain name auctions, Bitcoins.com could be sold for as much as $1m at the Heritage auction. This is also suggested by the prominence of bitcoin-related domain names and the value for potential investors.  Last month, CoinDesk spoke with entrepreneur Niko Younts, who originally owned the BitcoinWallet.com domain name. He now owns a broad portfolio of domain names that includes national site addresses for dozens of countries.  Other easily recognizable domain names, including BTC.com, are also currently for sale by various investors.

42377450,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70yqL,1404838808,"5,000 Terminals Across Ukraine Now Offer Bitcoin for Cash","A nationwide network of more than 4,900 payment terminals in the Ukraine now allows customers to easily buy bitcoin for cash.  The network, which is operated by the country's National Credit Bank, allows customers to buy vouchers for bitcoin from a new company called BTCU.  After depositing cash in a terminal, purchasers receive a voucher containing an activation code either on a printed receipt or via an SMS message to their phones. They can then go to BTCU's website to enter the activation code and claim their bitcoin.  The machines, known as BNK-24 terminals, also allow users to pay utility bills and purchase mobile phone credit, among other functions.  BTCU launched the service this month, according to a co-founder of the company who wanted to be known only as Stanislav. He said:  ""Our aim is to give Ukrainian people the possibility to join the bitcoin ecosystem.""  Bank confirms bitcoin service  The National Credit Bank executive in charge of its payment terminal business, Evgeniy Dumchev, confirmed that the machines now allow users to buy bitcoin.  According to BTCU's Stanislav, there is pent-up demand in Ukraine for a cheaper, more convenient payment system to settle overseas e-commerce transactions.  ""Young Ukrainians are used to buying goods from [online] shops abroad, for example, in China. If someone needs to pay $100 for a buggy for his child, he needs to pay about $40 for SWIFT payments and spend half the day at the bank. We've opened a window to the world to help people survive,"" he said.  Stanislav would not give details on BTCU's transaction data from from the BNK-24 terminals. He did confirm, though, that BTCU's rates – which are about 3.5% – are at a slight premium to those asked by Bitstamp. He said that a popular reddit post that described using a terminal to buy bitcoin, and claiming that there was a markup of 10-15%, for the service, was inaccurate.  Murky legal status  The Ukrainian government issued legal guidance for bitcoin businesses in February, stating that firms have to register with the government in order to operate.  Nevertheless, companies in the bitcoin space say the guidelines are not definitive, and continue to operate with a degree of vagueness. The National Credit Bank's Dumchev, for example, said:  ""The process is quite grey according to Ukrainian legislation.""  Stanislav echoed a similar sentiment, saying that there is no law in Ukraine explicitly prohibiting the use of bitcoin and that the Ukrainian government's actions spurred him to promote the use of bitcoin as a ""tool for common people"", in the face of government control.  ""For us, bitcoin is more than a way of transferring money. It is an ideology of free people. [A government's] attitude to bitcoin is a litmus test, it shows the true face of the government. That's why we support bitcoin,"" he said.  Kiev image via Shutterstock.

Announced today, the startup's second Series A-1 funding round took $20m in total. Spearheaded by Index Ventures and Greylock Partners, the round also included Emergence Capital Partners, venture capitalist Yuri Milner, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin and former Yahoo! CEO Jerry Yang.  Back in March, Xapo's initial round was led by Benchmark Capital, Fortress Investment Group (FIG) and Ribbit Capital. At the time, it was the second-biggest funding round in the bitcoin space.  The wider ecosystem  In a blog post, the company stated that the record-breaking sum was good news ""for the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole"", rather than Xapo itself.  Wences Casares, Xapo's CEO and founder, also used the opportunity to announce two new board appointments: Reid Hoffman and Mike Volpi. The pair will join Matt Cohler as Xapo’s board observers.    .@Xapo Raises $20M, Led by Greylock and Index - Reid Hoffman and Mike Volpi joins board... http://t.co/hFx1DYTBdU pic.twitter.com/3b2kOHBANv      — Xapo (@xapo) July 8, 2014      Casares noted that Hoffman and Volpi have a “proven history of recognizing emerging technologies before they reach the masses,” having both helped to usher in disruptive digital innovations (Facebook, Paypal, SoundCloud) in the past.  The CEO said Xapo will remain committed to bolstering the ecosystem, with the aim to bring bitcoin's technology to a much wider audience.  “Looking ahead, we will continue to invest the funds in building our team and our suite of services. We are committed to developing the framework that allow bitcoins to be used by consumers in their everyday lives while also continuing to offer highly secure bitcoin storage for Wall Street funds, exchanges, and financial institutions handling bitcoins,” he said.  The VC perspective  Both of the VC firms who lead the round, Index Ventures and Greylock Partners, issued their own comments on the investment.  In a company blog post, Greylock Partners stated that bitcoin holds disruptive potential on three levels: as an asset, as a currency and as a platform for the creation of alternative financial applications. However, the firm believes bitcoin needs security to succeed:  “Unfortunately, it is both costly and risky for consumers to build their own technology infrastructure, process and physical infrastructure to secure their bitcoins. Xapo has created a system where average consumers can be comfortable and secure with holding and using bitcoins.”  Index Ventures also praised Xapo’s emphasis on security. However, the investor group stated that bitcoin still has a long way to go, describing it as a “baby in the financial markets”. It added:  “Bitcoin will never replace the US dollar or the euro, and that’s not its main goal. The more appropriate analogy for bitcoin is gold – a value system that doesn’t have a political affiliation, yet plays a part in overall monetary policy.”  The firm says it plans to focus its investment strategy on alternative payment systems like BitPay, currency exchange services such as Oanda and bitcoin storage services like Xapo.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/08/xapo-sets-40-million-fundraising-record-for-bitcoin-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8c330ee4f74e3f97b24d732a7e4ab0ecda1ca31-1288x660.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377451,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX70ysr,1404818757,How One Law Firm is Helping Bitcoin Startups Find Success,"Compared to other types of startups, entrepreneurs planning to form a bitcoin company, and make a success of it, face a unique set of obstacles.  While social media or data analytics startups may be able to forgo consulting legal advice at the outset, those forming virtual currency-related ventures need to think about putting a legal strategy in place very early on.  One of the most prominent law firms representing businesses in the bitcoin space is Perkins Coie. Amid the many areas of law it practices in, one of its specialties is helping bitcoin companies get up and running with virtual currency legal consultation and advice.  Perkins Coie currently represents between 40-50 bitcoin companies, a number driven by the firm’s relatively long experience and network of contacts in Silicon Valley.  Lowell Ness  , partner at the firm and former corporate lawyer, now spends his time in the firm’s Companies and Venture Capital Group assisting cryptocurrency startups.  He represented Andreessen Horowitz during its investment in Coinbase late last year, when the company, along with a group of other investors, provided a Series-B round of $25m – the largest bitcoin investment so far at the time.  Ness told CoinDesk that Perkins Coie’s experience in this area have made them the go-to lawyers for bitcoin startups:  “We really were the first guys doing this. We’ve been probably doing this for three years. Everybody’s our client.”  Legal representation  Ness said that venture capitalists will always require some sort of compliance-related framework before investing their money in bitcoin startups:  “[It’s] almost impossible to get funding without having some kind of stamp of approval from a law firm saying there’s some regulatory strategy in place.”  Perkins Coie often serves these new businesses in an angel-type of role, he explained, spending time reviewing a startup’s business concept and offering legal advice, before introducing the founders to potential investors.  For this work, the firm takes a small stake in these early-stage ventures. “I would say we’re an investor and that’s part of the reason why we look for equity in the companies,” said Ness.  So, instead of asking for fees, which new startups may not be able afford, Perkins Coie takes a piece of the pie in the hopes the fledgling company will succeed – a similar strategy to that taken by VC investors.  Additionally, because there are so few successful exits in the bitcoin space, Perkins Coie has adopted a policy of going for startups in volume.  “That’s the game in Silicon Valley, it’s a numbers game. You ultimately have to bring in lots and lots of clients to make the numbers work,” Ness explained.  Finding bitcoin startups  Perkins Coie spends a lot of time at events in search of bitcoin startups to represent. The law firm even sponsored the Bitcoin Fair in San Francisco a few months back, and hosted the Stanford Bitcoin Meetup recently.  “We go to a lot of conferences,” Ness said. “It’s amazing how difficult it is to attend all of the conferences. Some of them are happening on the same day.”  Jacob Farber, senior counsel at Perkins Coie, often represents the firm at conferences, speaking on panels regarding bitcoin regulation. He has also provided his time to the Plug and Play incubator as an expert mentor for bitcoin-related startups.  Startup accelerators are another way that Perkins Coie finds new clients, often helping with the legal work involved in setting up an investment fund for early backing.  Ness says that the growth in accelerators accepting bitcoin companies is a positive sign:  “It’s good. It’s healthy. This is what happens every time when something gets hot. I think it was big data just before bitcoin.”  When Perkins Coie and venture capitalists are looking at startups, talent trumps the idea, every time, he indicates. A solid team of founders is what investors are looking for, and so those are the businesses the law firm wants to represent.  “If you can find guys that are really smart, whether the idea has merit or not, those are the guys likely to figure it out,” explained Ness.  Heavy investment  The pace of venture investment in bitcoin-related companies has risen by an impressive amount in 2014 – up 30% over last year at this point.  There is a network effect involved here: investors not yet on the bitcoin bandwagon see companies receive funding and experience success, which draws more investment money into the space.  “I think it’s going to be healthy for the whole bitcoin community to start to see some of these guys that are really going to be successful. We’re starting to see a lot of top-shelf VCs getting interested,” said Ness.  Venture capitalist Tim Draper’s recent investment in the entire lot of seized Silk Road bitcoin auctioned off by the US government has also brought bitcoin into the limelight.  And funding rounds for companies such as BlockScore and BitFury of late show that investors are willing to make bets on less conventional cryptocurrency business ideas, such as identity verification and mining.  Banking and regulation  Despite a positive mood in investment circles, Ness believes uncertainty over the regulation of bitcoin companies will continue to bring unpredictability to the industry:  “Even with a lot of deal flow around bitcoin companies, I think that regulatory uncertainty is the thing that is going to be most difficult for early companies to deal with.”  In terms of regulatory ambiguity, Ness says that there are divergent issues to be considered legally between, say, a bitcoin accounting startup and bitcoin exchanges. “There’s definitely a difference,” he said. ""[Exchanges] really are displacing banks and need to fulfil a role banks play in the money system.""  The big problem right now, especially for exchanges (and some wallet providers) that might be considered money transmitters, is there are 50 different US states, which may have different laws and licensing requirements, and there are therefore a multitude of regulatory issues to deal with. And that comes at a cost.  Ness estimates that startups which need to go through getting licensed in each US state would have spend two years and at least $1m to make that a reality.  That’s time and money startups simply do not have. And it’s likely that this issue is conflicting for the banking industry as well. Banks are not yet embracing virtual currency businesses, possibly due to reluctance to work with inexperienced firms, which creates further hurdles for bitcoin startups.  Ness pointed out:  “What it really boils to the fact that bitcoin companies are novices. Banks have all sorts of really stringent requirements. And they just can’t trust a startup company to do things the way they need them to do.”  Even in the face of such challenges, Perkins Coie has been helping bitcoin startups navigate uncharted waters for several years already – a long time in the world of cryptocurrencies.  In the future, the firm sees promise in cryptographic systems that track ownership and proof in distributed form. ""The technology is solid, and the opportunity is vast. It’s really a new paradigm for the way to do a lot of different things,” said Ness, adding:  ""The promise is really great, down the road.""

According to a post on its blog, the company also announced it is replacing its founding CEO Rich Teo with Charles Cascarilla, a founding partner in itBit's investor Liberty City Ventures.  The announcement is somewhat surprising, since Singapore is often seen as a world financial and banking hub on par with Switzerland, and an easier place in which to conduct bitcoin business than the regulation-heavy world of the US.  New York City, though, is still the world center of trading activity. Cascarilla wrote:  ""We planted roots in bitcoin-friendly Singapore with Rich Teo leading the charge, building the company, the service, and partnerships around the world. He established our presence in Asia, and brought our vision to reality as we opened up the service to customers for the first time seven months ago.""  ""In the meantime, bitcoin prices have skyrocketed, the concept of bitcoin has become mainstream, the volume of bitcoin trading has grown exponentially, and the majority of bitcoin trading now takes place in the US,"" he continued.  ""Regulators are getting clearer about their policies, and we’re hopeful that we will be able to serve US investors soon.""  Also staying  ItBit  , however, is not leaving Asia completely and will retain a significant presence in Singapore. Former CEO Rich Teo will also remain at the company as CEO of the Singapore office to oversee further development of the business from there.  Andrew Chang, another founding partner at Liberty Ventures, will also join the company as its new COO.  A company spokesperson said the move was a united decision, and that staff numbers in each location would be roughly equal:  ""The company's management team and board made this decision together and are excited about the future [...] Currently the company headcount is at 19, about half in each office. The company is continuing to grow in both regions and is actively hiring in both locations.""  Getting in first  The move is an attempt to gain an early-mover advantage for itBit in the lucrative US market, as New York State and financial services regulator Benjamin Lawsky approach the final stages of defining how bitcoin businesses will be regulated.  In this sense, an eventual move to NYC has always been likely, perhaps – itBit were simply waiting for the local regulators to get their act together. The company's home page has always featured a hint of such aims with its prominent picture of Wall Street.  The move should be a confidence builder to other exchanges and digital currency startups, previously intimidated by uncertainty and the prospect of dealing with regulators in 48-50 different states.  Compliance  ItBit has always promoted itself as a compliance-friendly and technologically advanced exchange, aimed at higher-volume traders more used to dealing on traditional currency and stock exchanges.  Like other exchanges, it has trialled several techniques to attract those investors, covering bank transfer fees for international clients and slashing its own trading fees.  It secured $3.25m in funding back in November 2013, making a total of $5.5m at the time, from Canaan Partners and RRE Ventures, along with Liberty City Ventures and other individual angel investors.  In May, it hired former PayPal senior manager Erik Wilgenhof Plante and trader Bobby Cho from SecondMarket, in a move the company admitted was part of its campaign to build credibility in the existing financial world.
