42402180,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3boM,1542058211,Michigan Secretary of State Nixes Crypto for Political Donations,"The Michigan Secretary of State has formally barred cryptocurrencies from being used as donations to political campaigns, according to a letter published last Thursday.  Michigan state legislature candidate William Baker, who lost his race in the Nov. 6 election, asked how cryptocurrencies' value may be recorded for political donations, as well as how they may be used. He also asked whether cryptocurrency exchanges qualify as valid secondary depositories for storing digital assets.  In its response, the department disagreed with Baker's premise that ""it is 'self-evident' that digital currency is a valid way to receive political contributions,"" writing that ""the law does not authorize such a vehicle, and the Department has never determined that digital currencies are a valid way to receive political contributions.""  The letter explained that the Michigan Campaign Finance Act defines contributions as a ""donation of money or anything of ascertainable monetary value,"" emphasizing that the value of any donation must be ""exact, precise and certain or can be determined with certainty.""  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are too volatile to qualify for such donations, the Secretary of State's office continued, writing:  ""Cryptocurrency is not a mere transfer of controlled funds deposited or withdrawn through a financial institution, but rather is traded anonymously through an electronic platform. As with stocks and commodities, Bitcoin's worth fluctuates daily, there is no way to ascertain the precise monetary value of one Bitcoin on any particular day. Further the Act requires that committees deposit funds in an account in a financial institution, which is not an option for cryptocurrency.""  Michigan isn't the only state to bar cryptocurrencies from political donations: California announced in September that it would also prohibit digital assets from being used.  However, Stephen Middlebrook, a fintech attorney with Womble Bond Dickinson, noted that campaigns are already allowed to accept ""nonmonetary and in-kind contributions,"" which are typically valued at ""the fair market value of the goods when received.""  As such, he added, ""it's unclear why that rule wouldn't work for virtual currency contributions. The fact that the value of cryptocurrency or other goods donated to a campaign may fluctuate over time doesn't sound like an insurmountable obstacle.""  By contrast, the Federal Election Commission ruled in May 2014 that Political Action Committees (PACs) could accept small dollar amounts of cryptocurrency. The PAC accepting the donation would be required to collect information on the donor and value the contribution based on market value.  Middlebrook added that ""the federal rule is certainly more flexible and I think sets a better model for states to follow.""  ""One solution would simply be to require campaigns to sell crypto for dollars within 24 hours of receipt,"" he added.  The fact that some investors can donate cryptocurrencies anonymously is another issue cited by Michigan officials, as anonymous donations are also forbidden under the act.  Middlebrook questioned this aspect of the document as well, saying that this should not be an issue if campaigns take steps to verify donor identities.  ""Campaigns can accept donations of doughnuts and coffee, both of which are anonymous, without violating the law,"" he said. ""They just need to know who brought in the pastries.""  Given that cryptocurrencies under the office's interpretation cannot be used in political donations, the Michigan letter declined to respond to the question about crypto exchanges.  When reached for comment, Baker said he hoped that more politicians who better understand cryptocurrencies would be elected before passing laws regulating the space.  ""However, at this time, this is not to be, as the Michigan Bureau of Elections notes that absent further direction from the Legislature, they cannot allow donations of Bitcoin or other digital assets,"" he said.  He did note that the elections bureau would accept public comments on the matter until Nov. 16, according to an email he received.

42402149,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZoO,1542049204,Combined Class-Action Lawsuit Against Ripple Moves to Federal Court,"An ongoing legal battle between XRP investors and payments startup Ripple is entering its next phase.  Attorneys for Ripple Labs and its affiliated defendants filed to move a consolidated class-action lawsuit from its previous venue at the San Mateo Superior Court to the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, according to court documents published Wednesday.  The defendants argued that the consolidated suit matches the requirements for a case to be brought before the higher, federal court.  In addition to the request to change the venue, Ripple's attorneys hinted at the company's defense against the suit, which alleges that the XRP token is a security issued by Ripple. As part of the removal process, they wrote:  ""Plaintiffs do not allege that they lacked information about the nature of these transactions. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs claim that they were somehow injured because the Defendants were allegedly required to register XRP as a 'security' with the Securities & Exchange Commission ('SEC') but failed to do so.""  The consolidated class action combines previous class-action lawsuits filed by plaintiffs Avner Greenwald, David Oconer and Vladi Zakinov, according to the document. A fourth suit filed by Ryan Coffey was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff in August, though Ripple's attorneys later filed to have it related to Zakinov's suit.  The defendants now include Ripple Labs and its subsidiary XRP II, as well as Bradley Garlinghouse, Christian Larsen, Ron Will, Antoinette O'Gorman, Eric van Miltenburg, Susan Athey, Zoe Cruz, Ken Kurson, Ben Lawsky, Anja Manuel and Takashi Okita.  Why the move?  Ripple's attorneys argue that, under the U.S. Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), the case can now be shifted to federal court. Specifically, they cite the fact that there are more than 100 members of the suing class, at least one plaintiff is a citizen of a different state than the defendants and the total amount being sued for exceeds $5 million.  One of the lawsuits, originally brought by Israeli resident Avner Greenwald, states that there are ""thousands"" of individuals who lost money after buying XRP. The plaintiffs are also asking for Ripple to pay $167.7 million in damages.  Simply the act of seeking to move the case to district court means the case is now before that federal court, said Stephen Palley, a partner at the D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill.  Palley told CoinDesk that plaintiffs can try to move the case back before a state-level court by filing a motion to remand. And indeed, a subsequent filing entered on Thursday indicates that the plaintiffs will file a motion to remand the case back to the San Mateo Superior Court.  As such, the next deadline for Ripple to respond to the complaint itself will either be two weeks from the date the motion to remand is denied (if it is denied) or two weeks from when the San Mateo court receives the case (if the motion to remand is approved).  Speaking about class-action lawsuits in general, Palley explained that ""the conventional wisdom is that state court juries and judges tend to be more sympathetic to plaintiffs,"" possibly in part because state-level courts will draw from a more local jury pool.  ""There's also a perception that sometimes a state court judge ... may be more political,"" he said, noting that some state-level judges are elected.  ""Defendants, on the other hand, have a perception that they'll get a more fair shake in federal court.""

42402161,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZzD,1542042948,Hash Power Favors Craig Wright Camp in Looming Bitcoin Cash Fork,"Ready for a hash war?  Bitcoin cash's upcoming network update (or hard fork) is coming on Nov. 15, but a fractious divide between competing stakeholders has raised the specter that the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap – which broke off from bitcoin in the heat of the scaling debate last year – could split into two.  In the run-up to the event, pre-fork trading of bitcoin cash continues apace on Poloniex, and while trading preference is tilting toward Bitcoin ABC, a majority of the hash power currently on the network appears to be in favor of another implementation known as Bitcoin SV.  Data sourced from Coin Dance indicates that Bitcoin SV – the implementation advanced by cryptocurrency firm nChain and its controversial chief scientist Craig Wright – has accrued the most hashing power ahead of the fork date. Coin Dance estimates ""at least 63 [percent]"" of BCH miners are supporting SV, compared to ""at least 18 [percent]"" for ABC.  Those figures aside, the hash power support levels remain estimates. The data itself is based on which mining pools have indicated support for each of the resulting coins after bitcoin cash hard forks on Nov. 15.  Based on public statements, CoinGeek, SVPool, BMG Pool, okminer and mempool – which have all indicated support for Bitcoin SV – control a total of at least 73 percent of the network hash rate as it exists at press time, according to Coin Dance.  Craig Wright has already implied  that he would support killing the Bitcoin ABC implementation by mining empty blocks on the network after the coin splits – if Bitcoin SV miners maintain more than 51 percent of the current network's existing hash power.  That being said, Peter Rizun, chief scientist at Bitcoin Unlimited – currently the second-most popular bitcoin cash implementation – told CoinDesk on Nov. 5 that he does not believe this will happen.  He said:  ""It is possible for one chain to mine malicious blocks ... [the] SV alliance has said they will attack [the] BCH chain if ABC rules get implemented. I think that's a bluff, and they don't have [the] technical capacity to make it happen. If it does, it could hurt BCH.""  Pre-fork markets  While miners may be indicating support for SV, traders still appear more bullish on ABC.  Last week, as previously reported, Poloniex introduced what are essentially theoretical markets corresponding to the coins that could emerge following the fork. According to data from pre-fork trading on Poloniex, BCHABC is trading at about $415 (priced in the USDC stablecoin), roughly four times the price of BCHSV, which is trading at $115.  Still, it's worth noting that the volume figures on Poloniex are comparatively small – 818,375 USDC for ABC and 1,233,921 USDC for SV.  In contrast, bitcoin cash itself is trading at roughly $524 as of 14:40 UTC Monday.  The numbers reported on Monday correspond to those early results from last week when a preference for ABC appeared to emerge once Poloniex activated the markets.  Twelve hours after trading began, BCHABC was trading at four times the price, though this later spiked to 10 times BCHSV's price, according to data from Poloniex.

42402148,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZnP,1542028518,Accenture Puts Software License Management on a Blockchain Platform,"Global professional services giant Accenture has rolled out a new software license management application built with tech from distributed ledger startup Digital Asset.  Accenture announced in a press release Monday that the blockchain-based application uses Digital Asset's smart contract language, DAML, and is aimed to simplify how its software licenses are tracked.  An Accenture representative told CoinDesk that the product is ""one of the first blockchain solutions built by Accenture and the first to go into production within the Accenture Operations group.""  With the company managing a large portfolio of software licenses across different businesses and clients internationally, it had developed the need for a technology to support policies and procedures, said Melanie Cutlan, Accenture's senior principal and lead for blockchain operations, in the release.  ""While software asset tracking and management tools have evolved, it can still be a daunting task for any large organization to manage,"" she added.  The new blockchain-based application is expected to help Accenture improve the management lifecycle for its software assets, as well as simplify tracking and auditing, the release states.  Cutlan explained:  ""The power of DLT will simplify the traceability of these licenses, and, therefore, the auditing function so all can see where each license is assigned. This has the potential to save organizations millions of dollars per year in the management of their software license portfolios.""  The new application, which Accenture said is patent-pending, will effectively allow organizations to reduce the risk of using unlicensed software or failure to comply with license use terms. It is also expected to ensure better transparency regarding the distribution and utilization of licenses, according to the release.  ""This new software asset management application shows that DAML and DLT can deliver significant operational efficiencies to use cases beyond financial services,"" according to Chris Church, chief business development officer at Digital Asset.

Tokio Marine & Nichido said in a press release Wednesday that its blockchain proof-of-concept (PoC) had seen participation from eight overseas claims-settling agents and surveyors located in Europe, America and Asia.  The key goal of the project was to achieve faster insurance payouts by providing a system to collect and share the required information ""promptly and accurately"" with involved parties located internationally.  Currently, the process of filing a marine cargo insurance claim is carried out manually, involving agents collecting the required documents, including damage reports, invoices and insurance policies, in paper form or PDF files. The documentation is then shared with surveyors via email.  Aiming to revamp this slow and inefficient process, the two firms said the trial allowed them to quickly share all the information required for a claim – including larger files like photographs of damage to cargo – with the agents and surveyors.  The blockchain system ultimately allowed insurance payout period to be reduced from over a month to ""one week at most,"" while performance and operational efficiency was improved, the release states, adding:  ""We have confirmed the effectiveness of blockchain technology in marine cargo insurance claims procedures through this PoC.""  The two companies first announced the project in October last year and carried out the trial from November 2017 to August 2018.  The firms said they expect to continue to work on platform going forward, and aim to achieve the ""practical use"" of the technology in financial year 2019.

42402164,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3a2A,1542020406,Bitcoin Teases Bull Move After Defense of Key Price Support,"Bitcoin could be in for a recovery rally, having defended a key support level over the weekend.  The leading cryptocurrency has been looking bearish over the last week. It suffered an ascending channel breakdown on Nov. 7, suggesting a temporary top had been created at $6,540, while the moving averages rolled over in favor of the bears a day later.  As a result, BTC looked likely to drop below the support of the trendline connecting the Oct. 11 and Oct. 31 lows, and move toward $6,200 over the weekend.  Instead, though, it carved out a higher low (bullish pattern) at $6,270 yesterday. More importantly, the bears failed to secure a sustained break below that rising trendline.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,360 on Coinbase, while the ascending trendline support is located at $6,300.  While the rebound from the ascending trendline is encouraging, a bullish reversal would only be confirmed if prices move above $6,540 to set a higher high.  1-hour chart  As can be seen above, BTC charted a second higher low along the rising trendline yesterday, saving the day for the bulls.  BTC is also currently creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders bullish reversal pattern. A break above the neckline resistance of $6,390, if confirmed, would pave way for a move to $6,510 (target as per the measured height method).  The major exponential moving averages (EMAs) – 50, 100 and 200 – have shed bearish bias (are flatlined) too. So, a bull breakout could happen in the next few hours as the prices have bounced nicely off the trendline support.  4-hour chart  Over on the 4-hour chart, the bullish divergence of the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram is indicating that the sell-off from the last week's high of $6,540 has likely run its course and a recovery could soon unfold.  A bullish divergence is confirmed when an asset records a lower price low and the MACD records a higher low.  View  The immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized.  Recent highs above $6,500 could be put to the test if prices pass the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline hurdle of $6,390  Acceptance below the trendline support on the hourly chart would signal a resumption of the sell-off from $6,540 and could yield a test of major psychological support at $6,000.

According to a press release issued Friday by the CFTC, the trader, Arizona resident Joseph Kim, admitted to defrauding investors of hundreds of thousands of dollars after misappropriating more than $600,000 of his previous employer's funds.  Between September and November 2017, Kim transferred bitcoin and litecoin from his employer, a Chicago-based trading firm, to his own personal accounts, causing the firm losses of $601,000, according to the release.  When the firm questioned Kim about missing tokens, he falsely stated that security issues with the crypto exchange required transfers into other accounts. Upon discovering Kim's theft in November of that year, the firm immediately fired him.  But Kim didn't stop there. He then started soliciting funds from individual customers, apparently to continue trading in crypto with the hope of making profits to repay his ex-employer. As a result, he fraudulently obtained approximately $545,000 from at least five customers between December and March 2018.  Kim reportedly lied to customers that he had voluntarily left his employer to start his own trading company. He also falsley claimed he would invest funds in a low-risk arbitrage strategy, when in fact, he made high-risk trades with the cryptocurrency and lost all $545,000 of his customers' funds.  In addition to a fine of $1,146,000, the CFTC has also permanently banned Kim from trading, including in cryptocurrencies, and sentenced him to 15 months in jail, according to the release.

42402163,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3a0C,1542013240,Airdrops Are a Marketing Ploy (And That's OK),"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk's advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      In February 2014, when growing interest in bitcoin spawned the first wave of ""altcoins,"" the tiny country of Iceland played host to a new idea for achieving mass adoption.  A developer using the pseudonym Baldur Friggjar Odinsson, vowing to help his 330,000 countrymen escape six years of post-crisis capital controls, created auroracoin and promised to distribute 31.8 of them to each person on Iceland's national registry of citizens.  The idea of the ""airdrop"" was born.  It was a success. Briefly. Then it was a flop.  The initial buzz drove the price of auroracoin up more than 1000% in the first few weeks after its launch, making it briefly the third-most valuable cryptocurrency. But by mid-spring, after early recipients had quickly cashed out their winnings, the coin's price collapsed.  Halfway through 2014, it was worthless and the project abandoned. The question lingered: Was auroracoin an earnest but failed effort to provide something of lasting use to the public, or an elaborate pump and dump?  Fast forward to 2018 and airdrops are all the rage. There's even a site outlining all the offerings out there.  The idea was thrust into attention by last week's news of a $125 million distribution by wallet provider Blockchain of Stellar lumens (XLM). Predictably, that giant giveaway is stirring heated debate on whether airdrops are constructive ways to promote usage or duplicitous self-enrichment schemes.  It's a debate that hinges on the unavoidable role that community development plays in any cryptocurrency project, on who pays for that development, and on how much they stand to gain from it.  Network enhancement or pump and dump?  Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, lauding the Stellar network for being ""built for scalability"" with ""an active and growing ecosystem,"" said the lumen airdrop would put ""users first"" so they can ""test, try, trade, and transact with new, trusted cryptoassets in a safe and easy way.""  Meanwhile, Stellar Development Foundation co-founder Jed McCaleb touted the instant network effects from expanding Stellar as a tool for communities to issue assets and design new models of value exchange. Leveraging Blockchain's almost 30 million wallets, he said, ""we will increase the network's utility by many orders of magnitude.""  Critics in the cryptocurrency community weren't buying it. Many saw this as a scammy way for Blockchain to expand wallet usage and complained that users would have to submit to the company's know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, creating a big, marketable data pool of personalized information for the company.  Bitcoin Advisory founder Pierre Rochard was particularly brutal:  I'm not going to take sides here but I think the debate could be better served by, first, viewing airdrops as a marketing expense in the service of promoting community adoption and, second, recognizing that, one way or another, adoption requires some level of marketing.  A currency is nothing if it is not widely used. And that can't be achieved unless people make some cost-incurring effort to encourage widespread usage.  All currencies – even fiat currencies, I would posit – have a brand. And the success of that brand hinges on how well those with an interest in its success promote its value as a medium of exchange or store of value.  For fiat currencies, governments carry out an indirect, complex marketing process by promoting the strength and effectiveness of their economies, thus encouraging both citizens and non-citizens to use their currencies to exchange and store value.  We might even think of welfare distributions as airdrops with intent to promote economic activity and therefore widen currency adoption. If these policies succeed, benefits flow to the government, directly, in the form of seigniorage, and indirectly via the satisfaction that their voting constituents derive from saving and spending a widely used, and therefore valuable, currency.  With cryptocurrencies, which eschew a government authority and instead defer monetary policy to open-sourced, decentralized software protocols, the promotional responsibility shifts to members of the community. But that can't be viewed as an egalitarian process, either. It always entails vested interests and asymmetric costs and outcomes.  In bitcoin, for example, early adopters knew they would benefit from enticing in second-, third- and fourth-round adopters. So they were willing to pay a price in foregone coins, freely distributing them to newcomers via ""bitcoin faucets"" and tens of thousands of one-off individual donations.  Similarly, the development of a passionate, engaged bitcoin community – which was integral to the cryptocurrency's success – depended on a variety of marketing exercises, all of which incurred costs in resources, effort or money. These ranged from more organic undertakings, such as the unremunerated creative work of artists who did renderings of the Bitcoin ""B"" logo, to the corporate-driven, such as when payment processor BitPay bought the rights to label the 2014 St. Petersburg college football playoff the St. Petersburg Bitcoin Bowl.  Individual participation in all this tends to be viewed favorably. What gets up people's noses is the presence of for-profit corporate interests, which is really why Blockchain is coming in for flak.  But the truth is that vested interests exist whether it's an individual or a company. Perhaps what matters is the size of that interest.  One can imagine that if people had known the identity of pseudonymous bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, they might have looked suspiciously upon his or her large early adopter's financial stake in the promotion of bitcoin.  Consider, also, the constant refrain from crypto's critics within the traditional economics fraternity that large-holding ""whales"" stand to gain from pumping bitcoin. They would view early adopter maximalists like Rochard as hypocrites. Do they have a point? Maybe.  Nuance needed  My argument, of course, is not that crypto enthusiasts shouldn't promote the coins they own. It's that if you level charges of a scam, it isn't enough to just point out asymmetric payoffs, which are simply the reality of the adoption curve.  Neither am I saying that we shouldn't be wary of pump-and-dump schemes by early adopters. What I'm saying is that assessing these things requires nuance.  Unfortunately, crypo utopianism tends to work against nuance. Prioritizing the dispassionate applications of mathematics and the supposedly unbiased, decentralized development of open-source protocols, many hardcore believers view all marketing and promotion with suspicion. What should drive success, they say, is not shilling and blather, but the power of the idea itself, the indisputable usefulness of the product.  It's an understandably attractive viewpoint, one conveyed in Tuur Demeester's critique of Blockchain's lumen airdrop.  The problem with this view is that a currency is quintessentially a network product. More than anything else, its ""utility"" is a direct function of the size of its network. And while that network will surely fail if the product's functionality isn't maintained and reinforced on an ongoing basis, the critical mass that's needed to achieve real network effects is dependent on mass communication of the idea.  There's a reason why corporate marketing budgets exist. The expense is incurred in an attempt to achieve mass, favorable awareness of a particular product or service. Those costs can be thought of in terms of the traditional advertising but also in the revenue that's foregone in free giveaways, as in the ""freemium"" model with which hugely successful apps like Nintendo's Pokémon Go get into the hands of hundreds of millions of users.  I'm as wary as the next person of corporate centralization and of the danger that scams could set back the societal progress that cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications offer in fostering low-friction, peer-to-peer economic opportunity.  I would simply caution against quickly jumping to condemn particular community development undertakings, including airdrops. These are not cut-and-dry issues.

42402154,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ZsK,1541998828,IBM Says Blockchain Can Power 'Open Scientific Research' in New Patent Filing,"A patent application published Thursday claims the process of conducting scientific research can benefit from the blockchain.  Led by a team at IBM's Watson Research Center, the patent application presents a vision for dynamic collaboration – one where researchers can track their work across institutional borders. It's another non-financial application of the distributed-ledger technology, which IBM has championed in recent months.  This latest patent can be thought of as an elaborate software changelog, but for science. Or, as the filing puts it, a system that provides ""a tamper resistant log of scientific research.""  From the filing:  ""The blockchain system can form a blockchain representing a research project, wherein the blockchain comprises a first block of research data and a second block of analysis data representing a log of an analysis performed on the research data. Summary blocks and correction blocks can also be added to the blockchain representing the post analysis of the research results.""  The application – titled ""Blockchain for Open Scientific Research"" – was first filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in December 2017. IBM researchers Jae-wook Ahn, Maria Chang, Patrick Watson and Ravindranath Kokku are listed as inventors.  According to the patent, ""currently, there are limited platforms that allow for sharing information about scientific research and showing transparent data collection and analysis steps. Platforms that do exist, lack the requisite controls and mechanisms to allow for trustworthy data, as there are few options for ensuring that data will be resistant to modification.""  IBM isn't the only group working to apply distributed ledger technology to the scientific realm. A Berlin-based think tank, Blockchain for Science, held its first international conference earlier this week.  The blockchain-flavored patent is one of many for Big Blue. According to data published in September, IBM was behind only Chinese internet giant Alibaba in the number of blockchain-related patent filings.
