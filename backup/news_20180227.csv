42428619,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9P5h,1519773931,Bill Gates' 'Nonsense' Crypto Comments Draw Twitter Ire,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates took aim at cryptocurrencies during a Reddit ""Ask Me Anything"" session Tuesday – much to the ire of some social-media commentators.  Responding to a question about cryptocurrencies, the world's second-richest man said the ability of governments to track money laundering or terrorist funds “is a good thing.”  Gates continued, saying:  “Right now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and cryptocurrencies is super risky for those who go long.”  Naturally, the crypto world was not impressed by this answer.  Reactions on Twitter immediately began dissecting the response on both semantic and technical grounds.  Venture capitalist Anthony Pompliano pointed out that cryptocurrencies are not strictly anonymous, and said the same concerns Gates stated could be applied to traditional fiat currencies.  ""He spewed the normal nonsense about funding terrorism & money laundering,"" Pompliano said of Gates.  Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer agreed, saying “cryptocurrencies didn’t cause deaths in a ‘fairly direct way’ any more than cash did.”  A moderator of the /r/bitcoin subreddit provided a more detailed response, pointing out that “the main feature of cryptocurrencies is their immutability and their ability to support trustless transactions,” rather than anonymity.  Know-your-client and anti-money laundering laws also make it difficult for users to anonymously cash out their cryptocurrency holdings, which should discourage the purchase of illegal goods, the user said.  Other users simply laughed. Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s head of communications, joked that Gates was a “broke nocoiner,” while @WhalePanda said the billionaire had joined the “old man yells at bitcoin” list.  User @DanDarkPill identified a positive use case for bitcoin, telling Gates that he had bought a banana.  Not every response was as harsh. One Twitter user said it was understandable that someone as rich as Gates would not bother to thoroughly research ""some internet money scheme.""  This is not the first time Gates has criticized cryptocurrencies for lacking transparency.  During another AMA in 2014, he commented that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was working on a digital form of money but ""unlike bitcoin, it would not be anonymous.""  However, at the time he was far more optimistic about bitcoin, saying that ""bitcoin is better than currency in that you don't have to physically be in the same place, and of course for large transactions currency can get pretty inconvenient.""  He was more cautious in 2015, saying that while he saw the potential for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to make a huge impact, he did not think bitcoin specifically would become a payment system of the future.

42428601,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9OTh,1519769732,Trump Administration Working on 'Comprehensive Strategy' for Crypto,"The deputy attorney general of the U.S. said Tuesday that the government is working on a ""comprehensive strategy"" around cryptocurrencies.  Rod Rosenstein spoke at the Financial Services Roundtable's spring conference this week and, during a question-and-answer session, he was asked about his views on cryptocurrency and cybercrime. Amid his remarks, he referred to a new cybercrime task force unveiled last week by the Justice Department that will develop a strategy around crimes involving the tech.  ""A lot of these schemes involve bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which do not flow through the traditional financial system,"" he remarked. ""What we're working on now with our cybercrime task force is a working on a comprehensive strategy to deal with that.""  The task force features representatives from a range of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Agency, among others.  Rosenstein also notably dispelled the idea that cryptocurrencies are fully anonymous – they are, rather, pseudonymous – and remarked that the laundering process leaves clues for federal investigators to follow to the source.  Rosenstein said at the event:  ""We all know there are ways to trace criminal activity. Generally speaking, it's not just about cyberactivity, there will be other ways that people will leave trails. Ultimately, even when dealing with cybercurrency, they're going to want to convert, launder it into physical currency, and so there are ways to trace these operations.""  A key element of the Justice Department's efforts, he said, is educating federal officials on how the technology works and the strategies for following such digital trails.  ""One of the challenges we have in law enforcement is making sure our employees are fully skilled, so that's one of our challenges, to make sure we have the agents and the prosecutors with the skills and the expertise,"" he explained, going on to conclude:  ""Because the criminals will always be one step ahead.""

42428606,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Obh,1519765217,Goldman Sachs Exec: Central Bank Cryptos Could Be 'Incredibly Useful',"A senior executive for Goldman Sachs believes that cryptocurrencies – at least those that might one day be created by central banks – could be ""incredibly useful.""  Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for Goldman's Private Wealth Management unit, spoke with Business Insider in an interview published Tuesday. During the conversation, Rahmani notably remarked that ""we think cryptocurrencies in their current format, meaning that in the current incarnation, are in a bubble.""  ""The bitcoin prices are astronomical. Then we compare that to ether, and ether is even more astronomical,"" she went on to say. ""So clearly, these valuations don't make sense to us.""  Yet on the topic of a central bank-backed cryptocurrency, Mossavar-Rahmani struck a more positive tone – even going as far to say that those prospective currencies would be more useful than the coins in existence today.  ""Is there room for a digital currency, maybe sponsored by one of the major central banks like the Federal Reserve? Yes. Could it be incredibly useful? Could it reduce transaction costs? Yes. But not these ones,"" she said.  Mossavar-Rahmani went on to speculate about the impact – which she characterized as small – of a potential downturn in the cryptocurrency market on the wider economy. She explained this is the case because cryptocurrencies make up less than 1 percent of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  ""So in terms of the impact, it’ll have some impact,"" she said. ""There are a lot of people who have set up various exchanges, infrastructure, hedge funds in that space, so obviously, they will get hurt. But it’s a very, very small part of global GDP.""

42428621,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9P3h,1519761602,The Telegram ICO: What We Know (And Don't) About 2018's Biggest Token Sale,"An outsider continues to steal the crypto spotlight.  So far in 2018, Telegram's rumored initial coin offering (ICO) has been the talk of the industry – a remarkable feat given the global messaging platform's executives have yet to utter those three letters together or confirm the company is, in fact, raising money via a sale of tokens called ""grams.""  Yet, the story's popularity stems not only from Telegram's tight-lipped CEO Pavel Durov, but also from the billions of dollars his team reportedly plans to raise through the sale.  Despite the company's efforts and strict non-disclosure agreements, which are keeping most news about the largest crowdsale in history under wraps, things have leaked here and there.  We've outlined what's been learned thus far below.  December  Looking back, it seems obvious what CEO Pavel Durov really meant when he told Bloomberg that he was planning ""something big"" in the new year for Telegram.  Perhaps he has something else in the works, but it's hard to imagine Telegram doing anything bigger than this token sale this year.  January  Investors started telling CoinDesk in late December that Telegram was looking at doing some kind of ICO.  Then, the first mainstream report about its plans came out, describing its unbelievably broad technical ambitions for the Telegram Open Network (TON). It included services that we've already seen from prominent companies in crypto like Orchid, Blockstack and Filecoin.  All that on top of promising super fast payments and micropayments using mobile devices, with negligible transaction fees.  CoinDesk then reported on the large amount of money the company would raise. At the time, investors told us to look for a $600 million private sale and another $600 million public sale. The company would create 500 billion tokens called grams that would serve as the payment system throughout TON.  With these announcements, fake sites quickly popped up claiming to be the place to buy grams. Confirming that one was fake in a tweet proved to be the closest Durov has come to a public confirmation of the crowdsale.  Once CoinDesk got access to the full technical white paper, we were able to report on its token economics. The paper's appendix described an unusual formula where it delineated a minimum sale price for all 500 billion tokens, where each subsequent token's price went up by a fraction of the price of the last token sold.  Working out the math, we found that if every single gram were sold under the specified formula, the TON would raise $14.7 billion over the course of its lifetime.  By mid-month, the idea that Telegram might raise its fundraising round even higher was reported by Bloomberg.  Amidst all this, early-stage investor Alok Vasudev tweeted a thoughtful thread about Telegram, describing the offering as pitting traditional tech investors (which seem to like the crowdsale) against the crypto influencers (who, by and large, have sat it out).  Early February  On Valentine's Day, we learned that investors were fickle lovers of the grams tokens. Quartz reported that investors had been selling their distributions at something like double the per gram price they purchased them for.  All the grams have been sold under a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT). The tokens themselves come with a long lockup period after distribution, and distribution itself is dependent on Telegram completing its made from scratch blockchain (actually, one master chain with millions of additional blockchains, according to its white paper).  They come up with a lockup period that releases tokens after four waiting periods, the longest one last 18 months.  Two days later, Techcrunch found Telegram's Form D, which revealed the company was 25 percent oversubscribed from the $600 million its offering circular had targeted for the private sale. It raised $850 million.  Since rumors and unnamed sources are all anyone has had to go on at this point, and Telegram has yet to respond to any reporters request for comment (including CoinDesk), the rumors have started to accelerate (which doesn't mean they are unfounded).  Late February  Despite all the attention on Telegram, the only document from the company that's been directly released into the public domain is its Form D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  That hasn't stopped the tech press from continuing to chase the story, and there's been a flurry of reporting here at the end of the month.  First, we heard that Telegram was conducting a secret pre-ICO that would raise nearly as much as the round filed with the SEC, according to the Verge. That report projected the total would rise to $1.6 billion, which would mean the second round was about $750 million. It also acknowledges that the final number seems to be an open question.  Next, Quartz reported that the company had a clear target for the second round of $1.15 billion, which would bring its total to $2 billion. It cited a per token price of $1.45, significantly up from the prior round, whose offering circular cited a per token price of roughly $0.30. That price ultimately rose to $0.38, due to the larger size of the initial round.  Quartz's numbers square with those shown to CoinDesk by sources with knowledge of the deal.  Finally, Telegram has apparently offered investors some kind of refund provision if it fails to deliver the TON platform by the end of October 2019, Business Insider reported.  It also cited a total crowdsale that could go as high as $2.55 billion.

It's not clear at this time when the cryptocurrency will be launched, according to a report from TechCrunch. Still, the firm intends to eventually make Rakuten Coin available for use within all of its businesses, which in addition to its global marketplace includes a travel company, an on-demand video service and mobile messaging service Viber, among others.  It also hopes to use the cryptocurrency to attract more international customers by positioning it as a ""borderless"" payment method that could mitigate exchange rate fees. The company has said that it already sees international demand on this front.  Rakuten – often compared to Amazon – has long been associated with cryptocurrencies, dating back to 2015 when it moved to accept bitcoin through payment processor Bitnet. It subsequently invested in Bitnet and then tapped two of the startup's former employees to create a Belfast-based blockchain lab following a 2016 acqui-hire.  With the Rakuten-branded cryptocurrency, the e-commerce company is taking some of that work and advancing it to its global customer base.  The idea is to mobilize the interest around cryptocurrencies in a bid to attract new customers to its loyalty program, which has awarded more than $9 billion worth of points since it first debuted in 2003, TechCrunch reports.

Bits of Gold, which launched its services in 2013, was on the cusp of having its Bank Leumi account cut off on account of its business model, according to a report from The Marker. The issue dates back to last fall when banking officials there reportedly began scrutinizing the accounts held by cryptocurrency users and businesses more closely.  But the Feb. 26 ruling from the Supreme Court – a temporary injunction following an appeal by Bits of Gold – has put off the potential closure until a formal review of the issue can be conducted. In the order, the judge wrote that the concerns expressed by Bank Leumi are merely speculative and that Bits of Gold ""acted transparently and did not violate any provision of law"" during its years of operation.  The temporary injunction doesn't necessarily mean that Bits of Gold will keep its banking access, however, and the ruling states that the bank still has the right to scrutinize specific activities related to the account. That said, the outcome and the nature of the ruling itself has given the startup cause for celebration amidst the uncertainty.

42428614,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Oth,1519741809,A Ray of Hope for Utility Tokens,"Lewis Cohen is a partner at Hogan Lovells, Caitlin Long is a co-founder of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, Rich Slater is an attorney and registered agent in Cheyenne, and Andrea Tinianow is the chief innovation officer for Global Kompass Strategies.  The views here are those of the authors. This article is not legal or investment advice.      On February 19, Wyoming's House of Representatives became the world’s first elected body to exempt certain blockchain-based tokens from money transmission and securities laws, provided they have a clearly defined ""utility"" and are not marketed as investments.  News of Wyoming’s progress prompted debate within the blockchain community about just how meaningful the action may be if the bill becomes law – especially in light of the recent statement by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton that ""I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.""  We believe Wyoming’s utility token bill, if it becomes law, is likely to be highly significant and to have influence beyond state borders because it provides a model that other states may follow and a standard for the federal government to consider.  Skeptics argue that federal securities law would preempt Wyoming’s law and render it moot. But, even if skeptics are eventually proven correct, that does not mean Wyoming’s law has no value.  Federal law often looks to the states — the living laboratory — for guidance on federal questions with far reaching impact, as is the case here. And, until there is clear authority from the federal government regarding the sale of utility tokens, isn’t it better to have clear state guidelines to enable predictability, compliance and a fair marketplace?  Further, since property law is generally a state law matter, it may be well within Wyoming’s right to develop state legislation regarding what it deems a new form of property.  The legal status of digital tokens that have a functional utility is unsettled at the national level and Wyoming’s action is the first step toward clarifying a critical gray area of the law – one which could take years to resolve, and may very well require Congressional action or litigation before a nationwide position is reached.  Wyoming’s H.B. 70 passed the House unanimously, 60-0, on Feb. 19, then passed the Senate committee on Feb. 23, and moved to the Senate floor this week.  H.B. 70 is one of five blockchain-friendly bills moving through the Wyoming legislature during its 20-day session. Indications are that Governor Matt Mead will sign the blockchain bills if they reach his desk, since he praised the blockchain efforts during his recent State of the State speech.  An important distinction  The very “utility” of a true utility token, when specifically designed to be exchanged for goods and services, is a potentially critical differentiating characteristic that distinguishes it from debt, equity or other securities. These types of traditional securities do not serve such a “utility” purpose.  The use of a utility token in a blockchain network poses a number of interesting challenges for the SEC. For example, securities custody arrangements for investment funds are not designed to allow securities to be used outside of the trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure of Wall Street. But it won’t be long before an SEC-regulated mutual fund wants to buy a utility token and confronts this crucial “plumbing” distinction.  And it’s useful to think about this distinction from the perspective of a utility token user, who may not have a securities brokerage account.  Take the proposed KODAKCoin blockchain as an example. If the SEC were to find that the utility token itself is a security, and a photographer wants to sell a photograph on the KODAKCoin blockchain, would the SEC really require the photographer to open a brokerage account (at Schwab, for example) just so she can upload her photograph to the blockchain? This strikes us as extreme and likely to push such networks offshore or into decentralized versions, which are even more difficult to regulate.  Utility tokens create a plethora of regulatory gray areas that will take years for regulators, issuers, litigators and legal scholars to sort through definitively, and this is even true if all utility tokens were to be deemed securities by the SEC. It would be most unfortunate if the SEC were to require all token sales to be structured as legally compliant sales of securities and such securities “plumbing” complications caused the projects to be unable to operate in the U.S.  Best- and worst-case outcomes  So what does this mean for Wyoming, the first state to clarify that a utility token is a unique asset class under state law?  In the best-case scenario for the blockchain sector, other states would similarly regulate utility tokens as digital assets (a new type of property) and utility tokens would be exempted from state securities and money transmission laws. (Note that this approach would still allow state securities regulators to protect investors who are sold utility tokens under a sales arrangement that constitutes an “investment contract”.)  In the worst-case scenario for the blockchain sector, the SEC would follow through on Chairman Clayton’s statements and fail to develop a more nuanced interpretive position that recognizes certain digital tokens are not themselves “securities” and should not be regulated as such.  Under this scenario, functional utility tokens get conflated with the investment schemes that many companies have been using recently to sell digital tokens on an unregulated basis, and the benefits of utility tokens would be lost.  This would likely lead to two consequences.  First, litigation would likely ensue regarding whether federal securities laws will preempt state utility token laws. It is worth noting that many blockchain companies have the financial resources to finance such litigation and many advocacy groups would likely lend their support, but the outcome may not be known for years.  Second, Wyoming-based issuers could restrict the sale of their utility tokens to Wyoming buyers only. In practice, this isn’t as restrictive as it sounds.  Crypto Valley, USA?  For example, Wyoming buyers could be either Wyoming residents or Wyoming-registered LLCs owned by non-Wyoming residents. In fact, many crypto owners already hold their crypto assets via LLCs to mitigate potential liability exposure, and Wyoming-registered LLCs are consistently favored by wealth advisors due to Wyoming’s strict privacy laws.  Non-residents of Wyoming could form Wyoming LLCs, which, when properly established, may make them eligible to purchase utility tokens as a “Wyoming buyer” despite not residing in the State.  Wyoming invented the LLC in 1977, and the State has made setting up LLCs easy, quick and cheap. And if the bill to authorize a type of LLC known as series LLCs in Wyoming (H.B. 126) also passes, Wyoming LLCs may be even more attractive for issuers to manage myriad token purchasers, or owners to manage their myriad coins.  Many blockchain entrepreneurs have already demonstrated their interest in Wyoming by visiting the legislature in Cheyenne, so perhaps it won’t be long before a U.S. version of Switzerland’s Crypto Valley forms in the Rockies.  In any event, the early clarity provided by Wyoming's H.B. 70, if it becomes law, would be extremely helpful to the dialogue defining the boundaries of compliant actions in the exciting new token economy.

According to Sankei Shimbun, the Financial Service Agency is considering the revision of relevant laws and regulations in an effort to regulate ICOs in Japan, amid the growing popularity of token sale activities within the territory.  The report indicates that Japan currently has no clear regulations covering ICOs specifically, while the existing bitcoin payment law that went into effect last April is not sufficient to define the legal status of some ICO activities.  ""There is an increasing demand for amendment of the law, and the FSA is planning to consider suspension of inappropriate ICOs,"" the report reads.  The FSA has already started monitoring ICOs that target Japanese investors and are deemed suspicious by the agency.  As reported, the FSA has issued multiple warnings to a Macau-based cryptocurrency firm that solicits interests from residents in Japan and published a formal statement on its website to order a halt to the firm's operation in the country.  The move towards a potential regulation is also a follow-up to the FSA's statement in October last year, in which the agency stressed several risk factors of token sales activities with a fund-raising purpose.  Other nations have recently moved to more clearly define ICO tokens, both to protect investors and to bring clarity to the industry.  Just four days ago, Austria announced plans to draw up ICO and cryptocurrency regulations, using existing rules for the trading of gold and derivatives as a model.  And on Feb. 22, Germany's financial markets regulator issued new guidance on how it will classify ICO tokens, including those it will consider securities.

As of writing, the world's fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is changing hands at $1,281, having appreciated by over 8 percent in the last 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.  With trading volumes up by 38 percent, the recovery from the Sunday's low of $1,143 looks sustainable. However, BCH is still down 22 percent from its Feb. 18 high of $1,641, and it's too early to say whether the cryptocurrency has resumed the uptrend from the Feb. 6 low of $764.  Price chart analysis also indicates BCH is stuck in a bearish falling-channel pattern characterized by lower highs and lower lows.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  The recovery from the Feb. 6 low of $758 ran into offers around the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance (former support) 10 days ago. The subsequent sell-off to $1,129 on Saturday reinforced the bearish view.  The 50-day moving average (MA) and 100-day MA bearish crossover (short-term average cuts long-term average from above) also favors the bears.  View  A daily close (as per UTC) above the falling channel resistance (currently seen at $1,520) would signal the rally from the Feb. 6 low has resumed. BCH could then revisit $2,000 (psychological resistance) and $2,110 (Jan. 20 high).  On the downside, a daily close (as per UTC) below $1,129 (Saturday's low) would establish lower highs and lower lows pattern inside a bigger falling channel, and would shift attention to $1,000.

According to a document received and reviewed by CoinDesk, the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) issued a new cease-and-desist order on Feb. 26 to a Panama-based cryptocurrency firm named LeadInvest.net.  The state regulator said it considers the firm's cryptocurrency mining and trading programs to be unregistered security offerings and, furthermore, that LeadInvest is also using fake stock images to portray its team members.  The TSSB details that the firm's website and promotions have allegedly been making deceptive and misleading statements when soliciting Texas residents – promising 20 to 100 percent returns on investments within one to three months through the firm's cryptocurrency mining and trading services.  The regulator further states that the web profile images of the company's staff are either stock photographs of models that can be found at image vendors or are images of other individuals with no connection with the company.  The TSSB alleges in the document that, as of Feb. 26, the firm has collected over $177 million from over 190,000 accounts.  The new cease-and-desist order is yet another indication of the efforts the TSSB is putting into in scrutinizing cryptocurrency-related investment programs that solicit interests from Texas-based investors.  Within February alone, the board has already filed cease-and-desist orders to two other firms – an overseas initial coin offering and a cryptocurrency lending project.

Bitcoin Eyes $11K After Upside Break,"As bullish indicators strengthen, bitcoin now looks set to extend gains to $11,000 or higher, chart analysis indicates.  Having defended $9,300 over the weekend amid low volumes, the cryptocurrency picked up bids and rose to a high of $10,443 yesterday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The uptick was backed by a 28 percent rise in trading volumes, as per CoinMarketCap.  A high volume break above key psychological resistance indicates strong hands are at play, so it's not surprising that the price is on the up. As of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $10,707, having clocked a session high of $10,714.47 earlier today.  Activity in the individual markets reveals that investors continue to use tether to accumulate bitcoins. Trading volume in BTC/USDT (bitcoin-tether exchange rate) on OKEx has gone up by 6.96 percent in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, U.S. dollar trading volume on Bitfinex (BTC/USD) has increased by 6.61 percent.  The cryptocurrency is up 14 percent from the lows seen over the weekend and has gained almost 12 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  Looking ahead, the cryptocurrency looks set to extend gains to the 10-week moving average (MA) of $11,385 in the next 24 hours.  1-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Bullish continuation pattern: the upside break of the sideways channel signals continuation of the rally from the low of $9,280 seen over the weekend. Further, the upside break is backed by an uptick in volumes. So, BTC could extend the rally to $11,000, according to measured height method.  The relative strength index (RSI) shows overbought conditions, thus BTC may consolidate over the next couple of hours before extending the rally.  Daily chart  View  Bitcoin looks set to test $11,000 today and could extend gains to $11,385 (weekly 10-MA). A violation there would shift attention to key resistance levels: the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the descending trendline.  A daily close above the descending trendline would allow for a stronger rally to $17,400 (inverse head and shoulders breakout target as per the measured height method).  Bearish scenario: Rejection at the weekly 10-MA, followed by a quick drop below $9,280 (Feb. 25 low) would add credence to the bearish weekly RSI and trigger a sell-off to $8,000–$7,800.

Silvergate Bank, however, offered bank accounts to bitcoin startups, even while others shied away from bitcoin-related clients due to risk concerns.

42428610,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Onh,1519722052,Making Peace with a Crypto Axis of Evil,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      If Venezuela's oil-backed cryptocurrency succeeds – and that's still a big if – it could portend a whole new use case for the technology: fundraising for rogue states.  The world may just have to live with that.  One of the defining aspects of cryptocurrency is neutrality. Bitcoin, ethereum and the like are open networks. They don't discriminate.  A public blockchain doesn't care if you're a Boy Scout or a convicted ax murderer. As long as you control the private keys to a bitcoin wallet, you control the funds in it, no passport required. (Setting up an account at a crypto exchange is a different matter.)  That is financial inclusion, in the truest sense, though it's not exactly what policy wonks have in mind when they use the term.  Similarly, as long as you know how to code, you can contribute or build applications on top of bitcoin or ethereum, no Ivy League degree needed.  That is permissionless innovation. It's what allowed Sir Tim Berners-Lee to create the world wide web and Satoshi Nakamoto to invent bitcoin.  And now it may allow Venezuela's strongman president, Nicolas Maduro, to eat many more empanadas at his desk, and do who knows what else, as his nation reels from an economic crisis.  A nebulous plan  Stepping back, last week Maduro's government claimed it had raised $735 million on the first day of a pre-sale of its cryptographic token, known as the petro, and revealed a number of other details about the project. Much remains unclear, including which network the coin will run on top of – some public documents say it's NEM, others say ethereum.  The coins are ostensibly backed by the country's oil reserves, with their value somehow pegged to the previous day's price per barrel in bolivars (so much for real-time). They'll be legal tender and accepted for tax payments in Venezuela, according to the government, so in theory there's a use case for local residents.  Still, it's hard to see any value proposition for outside investors in a token that's controlled by a dictatorship. You could even argue that such a centralized set-up disqualifies the petro from being called a cryptocurrency in the first place.  But, imagine for a moment that this scheme works. It could be an encouraging sign for other authoritarian regimes that have been cut off from the global financial system by economic sanctions. Already, Venezuelan officials have met with their Russian counterparts to discuss the petro, and, late last week, Iran revealed its own cryptocurrency plans.  Now, it's one thing for individuals or small business owners to use cryptocurrency to circumvent international sanctions. In such cases, it's easy to root for the underdog, even when members of the Washington foreign policy establishment clutch their pearls. God forbid an Iranian shoemaker should be able to sell handmade footwear on the internet! Who’s in charge of this ""bitcoin"" anyway? Don’t they know financial intermediaries have a Responsibility to Society to make sure the shoemaker’s children starve? Why, for all we know, that merchant could be funding terrorism ... one pair of wingtips at a time!  The recent sanctions-skirting crypto projects, however, would enrich, not the citizens of these countries, but the repressive governments responsible for their pariah status. Which, as crypto critic Preston Byrne wryly noted on Twitter, doesn’t match up with the tech’s early libertarian rhetoric.    Thoughts on Ethereum and the Petro pic.twitter.com/qLnpPODye3        — Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) February 21, 2018      That's the thing about open-source technology and permissionless networks, though. Not only can the tools fall into the wrong hands – the very idea of ""wrong hands"" is foreign.  Choke points  For an illustration, let's take a quick detour to the U.S., where the latest mass shooting has made firearms a hot-button political issue. In a recent op-ed in the New York Times, Andrew Ross Sorkin argues that if Washington won't put stricter controls on gun sellers, the nation's financial institutions should do so, for instance by refusing to do business with retailers that sell assault weapons.  This paternalistic idea would set a dangerous precedent, as my former colleague, American Banker editor-in-chief Rob Blackwell, warned in a response to Sorkin. But it's also a helpful reminder of what sets apart cryptocurrency from the legacy financial system.  Bitcoin doesn't know or care what the purpose of a transaction is. Nodes and miners, blind to the identities behind alphanumeric addresses, can't be shamed by the Andrew Ross Sorkins of the world into trying to control human behavior. That's one of the main reasons bitcoin has value.  Is this good or bad? You tell me, is fire good or bad? This much is clear: if banks took Sorkin's advice and tried to choke off gun sales, bitcoin would probably rally.  Then there's the alleged ""Nazi problem."" You’ve probably read about how extremist platforms like the Daily Stormer, shunned by mainstream payment processors, have turned to cryptocurrency as an alternative means to accept donations, and apparently got rich in the recent run-up.  It goes without saying that these organizations' words and ideas are despicable. But as long as they're just words and ideas, not violent or criminal actions, what purpose did it serve to cut off their access to credit card payments?  As free-speech advocates will tell you, the antidote to bad speech is not suppression, but more speech. Blackballing speakers you or I find offensive from financial services opens the door for banking to be weaponized against others that you or I may support.  Fortunately, the existence of cryptocurrency blunts this weapon. Today it's the neo-Nazis taking advantage of bitcoin's neutrality, but tomorrow it may be [insert a publisher dear to your heart] who needs it. You'll thank Satoshi when that happens.  Returning to Venezuela, western governments could try to thwart the petro, or its Russian or Iranian equivalents, by, say, forbidding licensed exchanges to list the tokens or by blacklisting ethereum ERC-20 addresses that receive the tokens. (No airdrops, please!) But to the extent these projects really do function like cryptocurrencies, shutting them down may be impossible.  That's the hyperconnected world we live in today.

The positive, yet cautious remarks were part of the firm's Global Weekly Commentary published on Monday by global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill.  ""We see cryptocurrencies potentially becoming more widely used in the future as the market matures,"" the commentary reads. ""Yet for now we believe they should only be considered by those who can stomach potentially complete losses. Similarly, blockchain needs to overcome significant hurdles to reach its promising future.""  Though cryptocurrencies have promise, they remain too volatile, unregulated and risky to be integrated into mainstream investment portfolios right now, Turnhill wrote, explaining:  ""The volatility of the cryptocurrencies makes the gyrations in the U.S. equity market during the global financial crisis almost look placid.""  Likewise, the commentary acknowledged blockchain's ""disruptive potential"" for industries ""from logistics and pharmaceuticals to financial service,"" but said its adoption would not be seamless and must involve regulators and central bankers.  ""Take the financial industry,"" Turnill explained, noting that ""a blockchain-based, single shared financial database could eliminate inefficiencies and risks associated with human processes, but adoption at scale would require a massive shift in software development and a well-constructed maintenance model.""  This is not the first time BlackRock or Turnill have chimed in on the crypto conversation.  Turnill previously called cryptocurrency markets ""scary"" and a bubble, and argued that there is no way to assess a ""fair value"" for bitcoin or any other coins.  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a different tone last fall, however, and endorsed the potential of cryptocurrencies, calling himself ""a big believer"" in their prospects.  BlackRock's commentary suggests it is unlikely to move on cryptocurrency soon, and it has already previously dismissed the idea of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

42428617,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Ovh,1519704003,China's Crypto Exchanges Didn't Just Survive – They're Thriving,"It began like this: In January 2017, officials from the People's Bank of China stepped into the offices of the largest crypto exchanges in the country and sat down with their executives.  From the financial regulator's Shanghai and Beijing bureaus, the officials told the exchanges at the time they were interested in identifying whether anti-money laundering and capital control mandates were being met.  But according to Robin Zhu, chief operating officer at Huobi, the regulators had an ulterior motive that January day.  “The regulator wanted to grab a big picture of how significant cryptocurrency trading was in China – how does bitcoin work; where does the money come from; where does it go to; how do people make and lose money?” Zhu said.  The PBoC also requested information on the exchange's trading volume and user numbers. In addition to the platform's data, Huobi had been regularly submitting information and reports about worldwide government policy in an effort to help the PBoC understand the industry.  Zhu definitely thought something was up. To him, it seemed like the PBoC was gathering information in an order to create a framework for regulating the industry, something many exchanges wouldn't have necessarily been worried about.  But then September came and with it the announcement that the PBoC was banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) and shutting down domestic fiat-to-crypto order book trading.  It seems the inquiries paved the way for the ultimate clampdown, one that severely affected cryptocurrency exchanges in the country.  In a previous interview with CoinDesk, Huobi's founder and CEO Leo Li reported trading volumes followed suit. On November 1, 2017, these figures were just 5 percent of what they were on Sept. 15, the last day before the close of order-book trading.  Yet, not to be deterred, exchanges such as Huobi have continued to thrive, finding new ways to grow their business.  Zhu told CoinDesk:  “Whatever the policy may be, we will comply with the rules and are here to say. The [bitcoin] trend is irresistible.”  Westward and eastward expansion  In fact, two of China's largest exchanges at the time, Huobi and OKCoin, already have offerings that again rank within the top 10 in the world by trading volume – Huobi Pro and OKEx, two platforms that now trade cryptocurrencies only.  And Zhu told CoinDesk that Huobi Group has more than doubled its staff to over 400 since September, signaling a strong commitment even facing a tightened regulatory landscape.  “The shift to over-the-counter trading is an unexpected pivot to us. We had never anticipated that to be one of our business strategies,” said Zhu.  But until some of the pressure is lifted, Huobi is proceeding with an aggressive expansion plan.  Over the past few months, the exchange has opened offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and the U.S.  Through partnerships with Japan’s SBI Group and an unnamed partner in South Korea, Huobi is expecting its new exchanges in those countries to be running by March of this year. And in San Francisco, the company's new office is focusing on research and fostering blockchain startups, but Huobi has also employed compliance experts there as well, hinting at a possible crypto service launch in the U.S. too.  “Once we have fully understood the legal issue in the U.S., opening a new exchange remains to be the next phase of the plan,” Zhu said.  While Zhu claimed that opening up operations overseas has always been a part of Huobi’s long-term strategy, the PBoC’s actions undoubtedly forced the platform to expedite its pivot.  All in all, the pivot has been good to Huobi, which is already seeing a more diverse user base, according to Zhu. For instance, Huobi Pro currently has about 3 million users and less than half of them are from mainland China today.  Loyalty, and revenue, token  Yet, Huobi is still focused on adding services for its existing user base.  Toward that goal, Huobi even launched its own token, HT, which runs on the ethereum blockchain, as a way to create user loyalty (and bring in some additional revenue).  Instead of following the ICO model that most startups do, whereby tokens are sold to interested investors, Huobi is giving the tokens away as a free gift to users that purchase service fee packages on its platform.  Over the course of 14 days, the announcement of the HT tokens resulted in investors rushing to buy some $300 million as pre-paid service fees, which Huobi Pro is able to collect in advance.  Following the launch of its own token, Huobi Pro announced a new exchange named HADAX, which allows investors to vote with HT on which new cryptocurrency assets they want listed for trading on the platform.  “We can’t evaluate every new cryptocurrency because there are simply too many of them,"" Zhu explained. ""HADAX gives investors the choice to vote for tokens they believe are worth trading.""  According to Huobi’s data, as of Feb. 24, the HADAX platform has collected 8.5 million HT from 104,308 users who have cast a total of 85 million votes for 75 different crypto assets.  And with this, Zhu said:  “In the long term, we think crypto-to-crypto trading has more potential than fiat currencies because of the large number of trading choices that can be available.""  The rise of Binance  But the PBoC's ruling didn't only add hurdles, it also seemed to lift up a new crypto exchange which has a significant connection to the country.  Binance was launched in July of last year (just two months prior to the PBoC's ruling) by former top executives from OKCoin, Zhao Changpeng and He Yi. At the time, Binance also disclosed that its first round of funding came from two Chinese venture capital firms – Blackhole and Funcity.  Yet, because its base was outside of mainland China, Binance was in the right place at the right time. When uncertainty prevailed in the domestic market, Chinese investors began withdrawing crypto assets and shifting them onto overseas platforms, according to Zhu.  He said:  “The timing was perfect for Binance.""  Six months after its launch, Binance has now grown into one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges, having seen $2 billion in trading activity in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.  ""Although Huobi already launched Huobi Pro at the time, we didn’t have as many tokens available for trading as Binance did,"" Zhu said, adding that the service is now recording more than $1 billion in daily trading volume.  And even though Binance has previously announced it would limit the access for users from inside China, Zhu said, “One can always surf the internet ‘scientifically'"" – referring to the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which mask user's IP addresses.  Zhu continued:  “If you have assets in an exchange and now you are prohibited from accessing it through a normal process, you definitely will rack your brain to get in there.""
