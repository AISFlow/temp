42397323,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZjj,1387483726,BitGo Safe Aims to Secure Bitcoin Wallets With Multi-Signature Transactions,"What do Jeremy Howells and several BIPS customers have in common? They each lost a lot of bitcoins because of the way they were stored. But BitGo, a company offering a new multi-signature wallet service, says that it doesn’t have to be that way.  Howells lost £4m in bitcoins after he threw out his hard drive, while payment processor and online wallet service BIPS saw over $1m stolen in a wallet hack. They both suffered from the same problem: a single point of failure.  BitGo’s founder Mike Belshe says that relying on a single device to store your bitcoins is a bad idea. Web wallets are outside the user’s control, while their own devices are prone to attack, hardware failure, or simple user error. “You wouldn’t want to use pure web, but you wouldn’t want to use pure client-side either - at least not for most mortals,” he said. ""Client-side software is a bear.""  Two out of three  Instead, his wallet service, called BitGo Safe, uses a little-acknowledged feature within the bitcoin protocol that makes it possible to better protect money in a bitcoin address. Called Pay to Script Hash (P2SH), it is a specification outlined in an update to the bitcoin protocol called BIPS 16. It enables multisignature transactions, and the benefit of those is that they enable bitcoin transactions that must be authorized by more than one public key.  Conventional bitcoin transactions are non-reversible, meaning that once a bitcoin transaction has happened, it is impossible to retrieve the funds. If Bob wants to send Alice some bitcoins in exchange for a product, then one of them has to make the first move, and trust that the other will follow through. Bob may send his bitcoins, only for Alice to keep the product. Conversely, Alice may send the product and Bob may never pay her.  But if Jen, our third party, acts as an arbiter, then she can hold the funds in escrow until both Bob and Alice confirm that they received their goods. All the parties can do this manually, but that would enable Jen to run off with the bitcoins, or for her bitcoin wallet to be compromised, leaving her responsible for Alice and Bob's outstanding transaction. This is what happened with black market web sites such as Sheep Market, whose customers saw thousands of bitcoins stolen.  Instead, multi-signature transactions are encoded in the protocol to make it more efficient, and secure. In BIPS 16, any number of signatures can be required to complete a transaction, but generally, people describe them as ‘two out of three’ transactions, requiring two of three digital signatures to execute.  A multi-signature scenario  In a multi-signature scenario, Bob would send his bitcoins to a bitcoin address that he controls jointly with Alice and Jen. If Alice and Bob both agree that the goods have arrived and the transaction is complete, then Alice can confirm Bob's transaction, unlocking the money, and Jen’s involvement isn’t needed. But if either party disputes the transaction, they’ll end up trying to perform the opposite of each other: Bob will try to return the bitcoins to his own address, while, Alice will try to extract the bitcoins to her address. They can then call Jen in to investigate. She’ll make a decision, and then use her signature either to back Bob’s or Alice’s transaction. The neat thing about this is that Jen can’t send the coins to her own address, and no one else can steal the coins without stealing two of the three signatures involved.  In addition to stopping online scams, it’s also useful for stopping theft. Belshe, a software engineer who has worked at Netscape and Google, has developed a wallet that uses multi-signature support not for escrow purposes, but for wallet security.  BitGo Safe  His wallet uses three keys. One is stored on Bit2Go’s server. Another is the user’s “hot” key, used in transactions, while the third is a backup key that can be held in any form by the user, say on a USB stick or a paper wallet. Money can be sent to the wallet’s address as usual, but when the user wants to withdraw it, the “hot” key must be combined with another key in a two out of three transaction.  Typically, that will be the server-side key. But if the server disappears, they can still withdraw money from their wallet using their own two keys. And if their hard drive dies, they accidentally throw it in the landfill, or a hacker compromises it, then they can use the backup key with the server-side key to retrieve their coins.  “Using the two of three system has a really nice property, which is that there’s always a backup key available,” says Belshe, who raised the issue of P2SH wallets on the Bitcoin Talk forum in November.  However, multisignatures alone are not enough, points out Mike Hearn, one of the core bitcoin developers. “For the web wallet service to do something useful it needs some way to authenticate the user that doesn't rely just on passwords (otherwise it's no different to wallet encryption),” he points out.  Bit2Go solves that problem by introducing another feature: out-of-band two factor authentication. When a transaction occurs, it sends a message with a one-time password to the user’s phone so that they can confirm the transaction.  “Now, in order for you to be compromised, they really have to attack three different devices,” Belshe says.  Providers of traditional web wallets like the idea. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, which just scored $25m in funding, was positive.  “Coinbase is excited and interested in any solutions like this which would help secure bitcoin wallets,” Armstrong said. “For example, we offer the ability to create paper wallets today (which are offline, private, and a physical storage of bitcoin). Using two of three could be a nice addition to this.”  BitGo also offers several other services, including a person-to-person exchange designed to connect friends who want to buy and sell bitcoins, and a bitcoin gifting service. The latter enables people to give bitcoins to friends by setting up a multisignature BitGo address.  It would be easy to see how it could begin packaging this as an API service to other bitcoin businesses. Belshe is staying tight-lipped, but he's promising more announcements from the company soon.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/19/bitgo-safe-aims-to-secure-bitcoin-wallets-with-multi-signature-transactions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6883c619585bc82bf8d5001580d7c5ac9a4e007-1008x749.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397320,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZgm,1387466408,"Coinbase Passes 650,000 Users in Less Than a Year","Coinbase announced this week that its user base had crossed the 650,000 mark.  It seems the young company is on a roll, as it recently managed to secure $25m in a round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz.  Coinbase  has grown more than 20-fold over the past nine months. The service started back in 2013 with just 30,000 accounts but by August it had gained over 200,000.  The number of Coinbase transactions is growing even faster – up more than twenty-fold since January.  User demographics  The company also shared some interesting data on its demographics. The vast majority of Coinbase users are aged 25 to 34.  They account for 49.7% of all Coinbase users, while the 35- to 44-year-olds rank second with a 16.9% share. Meanwhile, the 18 to 24 age range is going strong with a 15.8% share.  Older age groups are in single-digit territory, with 17.6% of all Coinbase users being over the age of 45.  The vast majority of Coinbase users are male. As of November, only 12.5% are women, while 87.5% are men. Still, the situation is improving, as women accounted for only 5.8% back in October.  Future expansion  Following Andreessen Horowitz's announcement last week, Coinbase said it would use the funding to solidify its position as the fastest-growing bitcoin service in the US.  It will also expand its referral programme and continue to promote the mainstream adoption of bitcoin.  Coinbase is averaging about 10,000 new user sign-ups per day, so at this rate it could hit the one million user mark by February. However, with the holiday season setting in, the company's next milestone might roll over into March.  Want to find out more about Coinbase?

42397321,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZhl,1387461330,IBM Files Patent to Track Value of Digital Currencies,"Another patent application by a major corporation is raising eyebrows this week. This time, IBM’s application for an “E-Currency Validation and Authorization Services Platform” proposes a system to “track the life cycle of any individual e-currency token” both to detect its use in illegal activities and allow for a more accurate estimation of the e-currency’s value.  The application, made public recently after being filed in June 2012, says: “The ability to validate and authenticate digital tokens across the lifetime of any particular token will bolster trust and viability, allowing e-currencies to operate across disparate economic systems, fostering easier participating alongside sovereign currencies and other non-standard currencies.”  It drew almost instant comparison to Coin Validation, Matt Mellon’s proposed system of whitelisting “clean” bitcoins that had never been involved in illegal activity in order to make it more palatable to established financial institutions and regulators. The reaction from the bitcoin community to that plan has been almost universally negative, with accusations it would permanently “taint” coins and render them unacceptable for use even after changing owners numerous times.  Motives  So what is IBM up to? Is it applying to patent its own answer to Coin Validation? Posters in the Bitcoin Talk forum were initially concerned the company might also pose a threat to bitcoin fungibility.  Writing for Let’s Talk Bitcoin, Brian Cohen thinks it’s not as bad as that, though it definitely doesn’t reassure with lines like:  “When a user desires to verify a particular e-currency token, the e-currency Validation and Authorization Services Platform 100 may retrieve all transaction data, transactor data, grading data, etc. related to the e-currency token.”  And:  “The algorithm results may then indicate whether the particular e-currency token is fraudulent or involved in a fraudulent transaction.”  Cohen said IBM is interested in tracking digital currency tokens for broader reasons, such as the value estimation one. The company may instead be inventing a way for all kinds of different digital currencies, from bitcoin to X-Box Live Points to Zynga Credits, to have a common reference to validate their correct market values against national currencies, enabling their use far more broadly than their initial intended ones or for accounting and taxation purposes.  The platform would do this through tracking by determining an “average estimated value” for each currency. Proprietary digital currencies could thus break free of their “walled gardens” and be seamlessly transacted with each other. Users may better understand how accurate quoted market values indeed were, and verify whether the token being offered actually exists.  The application does seem to focus more on uniting information across various currencies rather than tracking individual tokens of one in particular, with identification of fraud as a by-product of analyzing patterns in the spending data. It’s important to remember it was filed in 2012, long before bitcoin started receiving mainstream attention and refers to several other systems without bitcoin’s characteristic public block chain for validating each coin’s existence.  IBM's interest in the future of finance  Cohen notes also that IBM, though a technology and consulting firm, has a keen interest in banking and finance. Richard Brown, executive architect of industry innovation for banking and financial markets at IBM UK, is particularly interested in bitcoin and said in the year’s most watched interview on Finextra:  “I believe cryptocurrencies — and bitcoin is the first example — are going to change the world. But probably not in the way we expect,” Brown said, adding that people “haven’t thought through” the important effects that some of the technologies underpinning cryptocurrencies will have in future years.  He noted that bitcoin is not completely fungible anyway given its public transaction ledger, and wonders if the technology is better suited to being primarily an asset register than a supposedly anonymous currency for daily use.

Gox has decided to celebrate the holidays and the fact that it recently reached one million customers by offering special fee discounts. The company also announced a partnership with Mayzus Financial Services.  Mt. Gox  says it now has over a million customers and it is still growing. To mark the occasion, Mt. Gox will be applying a 25% fee discount to all transactions made between 20th December and 20th January next year.  “The Special Holiday Discount of 25% will be applied for any trade issued from December 20th 2013 (00h00 GMT) to January 20th 2014 (23h59 GMT).”  The second part of the announcement is a bit more interesting, as it has long-term implications. Mt. Gox is partnering with Mayzus Financial Services and the deal will enable customers outside the United States to make quicker deposits by cutting processing times.  “Now that we are working with Mayzus, a leading financial company that is in-tune with the future of bitcoin, anyone with a verified account will be able to quickly send money to their Mt. Gox account via 126 global currencies,” Mt. Gox said in a statement.  Mayzus provides a wide range of electronic payment methods and the full list is available on its website.  However, the service has not been fully deployed yet. In phase one, MtGox will enable deposits via Mayzus, while phase two will bring deeper integrations and support for withdrawals as well. Users in the US will also benefit from the service, as it will improve the withdrawal process.  To get started, users need to have a verified Mayzus account. They will then be able to make deposits using Mayzus simply by choosing it in the Funding Options menu. Of course, additional information is available on Mt. Gox, but the process sounds very simple even without it.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/19/mt-gox-celebrates-its-millionth-customer-with-25-holiday-discount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a766b1ff32fc336713b28da6dc034ac47aa43ce-1000x688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397313,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZXv,1387450850,Bitcoin Crowdfunding Comes to South America,"Idea.me, a regional crowdfunding platform in South America, has embraced bitcoin payments.  Although the platform uses a Montenegrin domain, it's an Argentinean outfit currently available in seven South American countries.  In fact, Idea.me is the only regional crowdfunding platform in South America, according to TechCrunch.  So far, the company has managed to raise $750,000 and it hopes to raise a further $2.4m in Series A funding next March. To date, the platform has funded over 450 projects using an estimated $2m.  Idea.me recently added bitcoin as an alternative to more traditional payment methods like credit cards and PayPal. Chief Operating Office Pia Giudice claimed Idea.me is currently the only crowdfunding platform in the Americas to include bitcoin support. She said:  “Our business unit is unique in the world: Idea.me is the only platform that executes campaigns with multinational companies to fund specific projects.”  To make it all happen Idea.ma uses BitPay, which allows it to convert bitcoins to dollars automatically. In other words, although the pledger pays in bitcoin, the project receiving the funding gets the contribution in dollars.  This helps protect all parties involved in the process from bitcoin volatility and wild price swings. In essence, bitcoin is used as a money transfer vehicle in this process.  According to the Idea.me blog, the company's decision to embrace the virtual currency was a direct result of bitcoin’s recent surge in popularity.  Idea.me hopes its bitcoin support will allow more backers to join the platform as bitcoin payments are available for all projects listed on the platform.  It is worth pointing out that major crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter do not support bitcoin donations at this time.  However, they do support various bitcoin-related projects, such as Nio Card, a bitcoin payment card, open-source ASIC mining rigs and various bitcoin related start-ups.

42397311,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapZZt,1387447259,FinCEN Sends Warning Letters to Unregistered Bitcoin Businesses,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has sent out warning letters to bitcoin-related businesses notifying them that they must comply with federal money transmission laws, according to reports.  FinCEN  , a unit of the US Treasury Department, has sent out “industry outreach” letters regarding anti-money laundering practices. Around a dozen letters have been delivered to bitcoin businesses so far.  Back in November, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the head of FinCEN, suggested at a Senate hearing that virtual currency exchanges and administrators should do three things: register with FinCEN, put in place anti-money laundering procedures and maintain their records.  Mike Caldwell, the proprietor of Casascius Coins, minted physical units of bitcoin with private keys embedded within. He received a letter from FinCEN, and subsequently posted this notice on his website:  “I have suspended accepting new orders, pending resolution of some concerns I have as to regulatory issues.”  The letter Caldwell received indicated that his enterprise was considered a money transmitter business.  The Verge reported that only 35 bitcoin-related companies have registered with FinCEN as money transmitter businesses. It’s clear from these letters that FinCEN believes more companies need to file paperwork in order to be compliant.  Perhaps the most noteworthy bitcoin business to fall foul of US law has been the Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox. The company had $2.9m seized when it failed to inform its US bank that it was in the business of transmitting money.  Government regulators have been interested in learning more about virtual currencies. With the exception of Mt. Gox and money laundering enterprise Liberty Reserve, regulators have simply been on a mission to gather information.  State regulation  In August, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) issued 22 subpoenas to bitcoin companies as it tried to understand what type of policy to enact in the state where US financial activities are headquartered.  The DFS has also considered issuing so-called “BitLicenses” to virtual currency businesses.  48 US states  currently require money transmission businesses to register with a local regulatory commission, South Carolina and New Mexico are the only two exceptions.  A number of countries have made statements regarding bitcoin policy within their jurisdiction recently.  The Chinese government has just placed restrictions on bitcoin as a method of payment, causing the price of the currency to spiral downward.  In contrast, Denmark's financial authority has stated that cryptocurrencies are not subject to financial regulation there. Additionally, Norway’s director general of taxation has said that bitcoins “don’t fall under the usual definition of money or currency,” which makes for an interesting tax situation within the scandinavian country.
