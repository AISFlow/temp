42381505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9mykJ,1549564212,Blockchain Analysis Links Hamas Fundraising to Coinbase Bitcoin Account,"The Palestinian military-political group Hamas, which the U.S. government deems a terrorist organization, may be using the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange for fundraising.  Earlier this week, the Israeli blockchain analytics firm Whitestream identified several bitcoin wallet addresses referred to on official Hamas digital media channels in public requests for donations. One such appeal for bitcoin donations to support “the resistance” was issued on January 31, via a Telegram channel run by Abu Obeida, a spokesman for Hamas’ military wing.  As the Israeli newspaper Globes reported, those wallets included a Coinbase account.  Although Coinbase declined to comment on the address in question, Whitestream told CoinDesk that the account continued to receive transactions even 48 hours after it was identified and reported in the media.  ""Based on shared inputs, we can tell that Hamas blockchain transactions were signed by addresses that are operating on Coinbase company wallets,"" Itsik Levy, the firm's founder and CEO, told CoinDesk.  Adding this account’s sum to two other bitcoin addresses Whitestream also identified as recipients of the Hamas fundraising campaign, the Islamic organization appears to have garnered less than $4,000 in bitcoin.  ""[Hamas] is struggling with getting funds from the Israeli government and Qatar,"" Levy continued. ""We've heard of other Islamic extremist organizations doing the same thing over the past few years...now Hamas tries the same thing.""  ""It's still an active campaign,"" he added. ""It just started.""  Even if this is a case of terrorist financing solicited by the Hamas military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Coinbase is hardly the sole company involved with this week's activity.  Whitestream also reportedly identified this Hamas-operated Coinbase account potentially sending bitcoin to a Binance account and a CoinPayments account, the latter of which is a wallet provider legally incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Binance and CoinPayments did not immediately reply to requests for comment on these transactions.  Fringe activity  Several studies – including a 2018 report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance – have asserted cryptocurrency usage among jihadists is still an extremely “fringe” activity.  Whitestream co-founder Itsik Levy told Globes “only 2 percent” of the bitcoin transactions his firm analyzed were connected to “terrorist or criminal activity.”  Furthermore, compared to a CoinDesk report from 2018, even the monthly volume of a single bitcoin dealer serving dozens of Gaza-based retail investors would dwarf the sum collected so far in these Hamas-affiliated accounts.  The Hamas spokesperson has not posted in the Telegram group since the last request for bitcoin donations on February 2, CoinDesk found. On that same day, this bitcoin address was tweeted by the Brigades’ global outreach account.  This may be inspired by the way the Islamic State’s Gaza wing, a fierce rival of Hamas, reportedly raised $8,000 worth of bitcoin donations by March 2018. However, there appears to be confusion among these supporters about the transparent nature of blockchain data.  On January 30, Palestinian journalist Hussam Al-Dajany said during an interview on Hamas-owned Al-Aqsa TV that: “People who donate using this currency cannot be identified by any security agency.”  Hamas image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/02/07/blockchain-analysis-links-hamas-fundraising-to-coinbase-bitcoin-account,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3667626d599be98b4006b58dbd9ed95354e89aec-1500x1047.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421065,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXCFzh,1549555226,Someone Is Impersonating Bitcoin Futures Platform Bakkt to Raise Money,"Someone is poorly impersonating the highly anticipated bitcoin futures trading platform Bakkt in an apparent attempt to bilk people out of their bitcoin.  On Wednesday night, the CoinDesk news team received an email (subject line: ""Bakkt News!"") claiming that the platform was set to launch on March 12. The email, sent from a gmail address and written in broken English, further stated that Bakkt would be seeking to raise $50 million in a second financing round and directed readers to a website, bakktplatform.io.  There, prospective investors are invited to register by entering their name and email address. After going through this process, visitors are presented with a bitcoin address to send their money and asked to provide their own address to receive their ""profits"" from the investment.  As of Thursday morning, no funds had been sent to the wallet.  The site (registered just a week ago through WhoisGuard, a domain owner-obscuring service in Panama, according to a WHOIS lookup) is a fake.  A spokesperson for Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), Bakkt's parent company, told CoinDesk: ""that is not a Bakkt website and we wouldn’t have communicated in that way.""  Further, the email's claims about Bakkt are dubious at best.  No launch date  For starters, Bakkt has no official launch date right now.  The platform is still waiting on regulatory approval to begin listing its futures product, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is nowhere near such an approval.  Indeed, the CFTC has not even published Bakkt's self-warehousing proposal for comment. Once that proposal is released, the general public will have 30 days to respond. After the comment period ends, the CFTC's commissioners will likely take a few days to review the feedback before voting to approve or deny the proposal.  In that light, a March 12 launch date would be an aggressive target – and just to be clear, Bakkt has made no such commitment.  Caveat emptor  Even more implausible, however, is the email's announcement of a ""Second Financing Round.""  First, Bakkt just raised $182.5 million at the close of 2018, less than two months ago. And it strains credulity to imagine that a regulated institutional platform would solicit funds from the general public through a website, require just a name and email address to invest (though ""company"" and ""industry"" are optional fields on the registration form) and accept bitcoin only.  ""We are at the stage of completing the testing of Blockchain on our platform, our tests have shown high results of efficiency and manufacturability using Blockchain technology in contrast to Fiat,"" the bogus Bakkt website explains (sorta). ""Тhe near future we plan to create the first regulated exchange of the institutional class in a developing industry and much more [sic].""  If that pitch isn't persuasive enough, the site promises investors a return within three days of the platform's launch (so by March 15, presumably). Perhaps appealing to FOMO, it says the platform will conclude its fundraising effort on Feb. 25, unless it hits the target before that date.  In all seriousness, please don't send funds to this platform. Investors who do are unlikely to see their bitcoin again.

Announced today, Robert Thrash joined the company as chief operating officer from Barclays, where he spent more than 11 years in various leadership positions. Most recently, he was the global bank's managing director of agency derivatives services, a business that encompasses over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing, futures execution and clearing and foreign exchange prime brokerage.  Explaining his interest in the cryptocurrency markets, Thrash told CoinDesk:  ""Crypto sits at the intersection of technology, finance and regulation. Regulation will continue to evolve and impact this space bringing transparency to the market, which in turn should lead to increasingly active participation by traditional financial intermediaries. As these intermediaries provide market access to new market participants, a whole host of trading technology, crypto-based products and financing solutions will need to be created.""  Meanwhile, ErisX hired Arnold Connell to be its head of infrastructure. Connell hails from YouTube, where he was a senior technical program manager with a focus on the YouTubeTV streaming service. Before that, he spent a decade at YouTube's parent Google in various roles.  Finally, John Denza left his job as a head of U.S. sales at Pico Quantitative Trading to become ErisX's business development executive. Prior to Pico, he worked at BATS Global Markets (eventually acquired by Cboe Global Markets) as director of U.S. sales for equities and derivatives.  Gearing up  The hirings come as ErisX is getting ready to launch spot trading for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin in the second quarter, and futures trading for those assets in the second half of the year. The company is working on obtaining a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  ""We are leveraging our industry relationships to secure talent and build the most robust, secure and regulated platform for digital assets,"" Thomas Chippas, ErisX CEO, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. ""This is the beginning of a new asset class. The leaders in this space are still being developed as are the biggest players still being built.""  In December, ErisX hired Matthew Trudeau, former president of the blockchain startup Tradewind and head of product for IEX (and one of the heroes of Michael Lewis’ bestseller about high-frequency trading, “Flash Boys”) as chief strategy officer.  The same month, the firm raised $27,5 million in a funding round involving Bitmain, ConsenSys, Fidelity Investments, Nasdaq Ventures and Monex Group.

42381507,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9mymp,1549544407,Crypto Broker Led by Uber and E*Trade Alums Is Going Public,"Voyager, a cryptocurrency brokerage startup founded by veterans of Uber and E*Trade, is going public on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange through a reverse merger valued at $60 million.  A reverse merger occurs when a privately held company acquires the majority of shares in a publicly traded one and the two firms are combined. In this case, New York-based Voyager Digital Holdings acquired UC Resources Ltd., the shell of a mineral exploration company that ceased operations in 2015, in an all-stock deal finalized earlier this week.  Announced Thursday, the merged entity, renamed Voyager Digital (Canada) Ltd., will begin trading on Feb. 11 on the TSX, a subsidiary of TMX Group, the parent of the Toronto Stock Exchange.  Stephen Ehrlich, co-founder and CEO of Voyager, told CoinDesk that the ability to issue publicly traded shares will give his company a currency (in the figurative sense) with which to make acquisitions to build its nascent business.  ""We’re actively looking for parts of the crypto ecosystem that fit with us, that fit with our mission and our culture,"" said Ehrlich, who oversaw eight acquisitions as CEO of the online stock brokerage Lightspeed Financial and earlier ran the professional trading business of E*Trade. ""Having cash plus a public currency will make us more efficient and give us more opportunities.”  Voyager, which first revealed its plan to enable zero-commission crypto trading for U.S. retail investors last summer, quietly raised about $7 million from undisclosed investors in a series of private rounds beginning in May, said chief marketing officer Steve Capone. The last round valued the company at $60 million (in U.S. dollars), according to Ehrlich, so that is the cost of the stock it paid for the shell company.  Aside from securities veteran Ehrlich, the company's founders include Oscar Salazar, the founding architect and CTO of Uber.  Beyond dry powder for M&A, Ehrlich said being a listed company will help Voyager build trust with clients since it will have to make quarterly and annual disclosures of its financials and answer to Canadian securities regulators. He added:  ""That brings a lot of credibility and transparency to the customer that they can trust us.""  It won't be the first crypto firm to go public through a reverse merger on the TSX, however. Most prominently, Galaxy Digital Holdings, the crypto fund started by Michael Novogratz, did so last year through the takeover of a listed pharmaceutical company.  Launching this month  The idea behind Voyager is to allow retail and institutional investors to buy and sell crypto across multiple exchanges using a single account on a mobile app, with a smart order routing system ensuring they get the best prices available.  Instead of charging commissions for this service, Voyager will make a spread, but only when it executes orders at levels ""better than quoted at time of order submission, resulting in price improvement for the customer and revenue for Voyager"" said Capone. ""Price improvement is not a customer guarantee, but zero-commission is.""  Currently, the platform is in beta testing with ""more than a handful"" of users, and a public launch slated for later this month, Ehrlich said (slightly behind schedule, as the original plan was to go live in Q4https://www.investvoyager.com/pressreleases/voyager-app-announcement). The number of people on the waiting list is in ""the six figures,"" he said.  To entice retail customers, Voyager is offering $15 worth of bitcoin to those who sign up early. It will be competing for this business with consumer-facing platforms such as Robinhood and Circle (neither of which charge commissions), as well as industry juggernaut Coinbase.  Meanwhile, about half a dozen institutional broker-dealers and trading platforms have signed up to use Voyager's APIs to ""deliver crypto trading to their customer base,"" according to Ehrlich. In August the company hired Glenn Barber, a veteran of Deutsche Bank and Barclays, to expand this part of the business.  On the other side of the proverbial table, Voyager has signed up 10 exchanges and market makers for the platform and is in conversations with twice that number, executives said.  The company has obtained money transmission licenses in 10 U.S. states, with applications pending in another 30 or so.

42381504,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myj3,1549541125,Korean Central Bank Study: Issuing Digital Currency Poses Financial Risk,"Researchers from South Korea’s central bank say issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could have negative ramifications for the economy.  The Bank of Korea (BoK) published a study on Thursday, which modeled how a CBDC issuance might affect on liquidity at commercial banks.  It found that if the public could access the theoretical digital currency directly, commercial banks' demand deposits, or reserves, could be reduced – leaving them with a cash shortfall. That could eventually force them to compensate by raising interest rates on loans, the central bank explained.  “This has negative effects on financial stability, which increases the likelihood of bank panic in which commercial banks are short of cash reserves to pay out to depositors,” the report states.  According to CoinDesk Korea, report co-author Kwon Oh-Ik said that, if a CBDC is issued, “supplementary measures should be taken so that they do not adversely affect financial stability.""  In June 2018, the BoK said that issuing a CBDC could pose a “moral hazard” by adversely affecting monetary policy and destabilizing the economy.  The Bank of International Settlements (BIS), known as the central bank of central banks, also warned last spring that if any country’s central bank is looking to develop and launch a CBDC, it should “carefully weigh” the implications of doing so, especially as they relate to monetary policy and overall economic stability.  On the other hand, Christine Lagarde, managing director and chairwoman of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has encouraged the “exploration” of CBDCs in the light of decreasing demand for cash and rising preference for digital money.  A November research report from IBM found that most polled central banks believe they should issue a wholesale CBDC, although they were uncertain if blockchain can provide sufficient cost and efficiency benefits.

42381515,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myuN,1549537218,Little Relief in Sight as Bitcoin Price Closes at 7.5-Week Low,"View  Bitcoin suffered its lowest UTC close in over seven weeks on Wednesday, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the rejection at the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 6-hour chart yesterday. The close at multi-week lows also dashed hopes of a falling wedge breakout.  The cryptocurrency also created a bearish outside reversal candle on the daily chart yesterday, opening the doors for a drop to falling channel support at $3,230.  A strong move above the 50-candle moving average on the 6-hour chart, currently at $3,434 will likely weaken bearish pressures and yield a corrective bounce to the resistance near $3,650.  With bitcoin (BTC) closing yesterday at the lowest level in 7.5 weeks, the gradual sell-off is showing no signs of abating.  On Wednesday, the leading cryptocurrency by market value ended the session (as per UTC) at $3,328 – the weakest daily close since Dec. 16 – according to Bitstamp data, dashing hopes of an upside break of the falling wedge pattern carved out over the last six weeks.  Further, BTC created a bearish lower high at the crucial resistance of the 50-candle moving average (MA) on the 6-hour chart. That average line has thwarted several fledgling rallies over the last three weeks, as discussed yesterday.  As a result, the slow drip sell-off from December highs above $4,200 witnessed over the last six weeks is likely to continue. BTC could soon challenge recent lows near $3,300 and may extend the decline toward the low of $3,100 seen in December.  At press time, BTC is trading largely unchanged on the day at $3,380.  Daily chart  As seen above, yesterday’s high and low engulfed Tuesday’s price action as indicated by a bearish outside candle. Effectively, the day began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note, meaning the ""sell-on-rise"" mentality is still strong.  Hence, the cryptocurrency risks falling to the descending channel support, currently at $3,230.  Supporting that bearish case are the 14-day relative strength index of 38 and downward sloping 20-day moving average (MA).  6-hour chart  On the 6-hour chart, the 50-candle MA has proved a tough nut to crack for close to three weeks. A convincing break above that average, currently at $3,434, might lead to a stronger rally toward resistance at $3,658 (high of the bearish gravestone doji created Jan. 26).

42381496,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9mybV,1549533635,Indian Hospital Releases Details About QuadrigaCX CEO's Death,"Fortis Escorts, a private hospital in the Indian city of Jaipur, has released details about the death of Gerald Cotten, CEO of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX.  In a statement shared with CoinDesk on Thursday, Fortis Escorts said that Cotten was admitted to the hospital on Dec. 8, 2018 at 9:45 p.m. IST (16:15 UTC) and died of cardiac arrest at around 7:26 p.m. IST (13:56 UTC) on Dec. 9, 2018.  Two separate documents released previously – a statement of death issued from J.A. Snow Funeral Home and a death certificate issued from the Government of Rajasthan’s Directorate of Economics and Statistics – also state that Cotten died on Dec. 9, 2018 in Jaipur, the state capital of Rajasthan.  Cotten was brought to the hospital in a “critical condition” with “pre-existing Crohn's disease and was on monoclonal antibody therapy every 8th week,” the statement from Fortis Escorts reads. At the time of admission, Cotten was diagnosed to be suffering from septic shock and other serious issues relating to his exacerbated condition.  “On 9th December, 2018, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest but was revived by CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation]. The patient heart condition continued to deteriorate and the patient suffered a second cardiac arrest at 6:30 p.m. [13:00 UTC],” the statement from the hospital reads.  It continues:  “Despite the best efforts of our clinicians the patient could not be revived and was declared dead approximately at 7:26 pm. All standard medical procedures and guidelines were followed to treat the patient. The information of his death was communicated to the relevant authorities.”  Cotten's death is at the center of the concerns and rumors surrounding the QuadrigaCX exchange, which went offline last week owing millions to its thousands of customers because the CEO had died apparently without leaving a way for staff to access the computer storing its funds.  In a sworn affidavit filed Jan. 31 with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Jennifer Robertson, identified as the widow of QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten, said the exchange owes its customers roughly 250 million CAD (US$190 million) in both cryptocurrency and fiat.  The exchange has since sought creditor protection in the court. On Tuesday, a Supreme Court judge granted the exchange its application, giving it a 30-day stay of proceedings to try and recover any cryptocurrencies, as well as find other avenues for reimbursing customers.

42381499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9mye1,1549530008,Swiss Stock Exchange SIX Plans Blockchain Platform in H2,"Switzerland's top stock exchange, SIX, aims to roll out a blockchain platform to speed up trading later this year.  Reuters reported Feb. 6 that SIX chairman Romeo Lacher said the planned new SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) will initially operate alongside the existing SIX platform.  Currently, a trade takes several steps to complete, which can take days. However, using a distributed ledger knocks out two of the stages and can reduce the trade lifecycle to fractions of a second, Reuters added.  The report cites officials as having said that SDX will launch offering trading in certain stocks, with a wider range of stocks and bonds to follow. Exchange-traded funds could ultimately be on offer too, and possibly even tokenized physical assets such as art.  Lacher told the news source that the SIX supervisory board will ""probably"" make the final decision late in the summer, as it is still working out legal and regulatory issues with Switzerland's financial markets regulator, FINMA.  SIX first announced the new DLT-based platform last July, with CEO Jos Dijsselhof saying at the time: “This is the beginning of a new era for capital markets infrastructures. For us it is abundantly clear that much of what is going on in the digital space is here to stay and will define the future of our industry.""  Once the new platform is live, SIX plans to use it itself to raise funds later in the year, according to Reuters.  “We want to start with our own security token offering,” Lacher said.  Last November, SIX announced it would launch the first ever exchange-traded product (ETP) tracking multiple cryptocurrencies.

42381494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9myaF,1549527616,Ethereum Foundation and Others Weigh $15 Million Bid to Build 'Randomness' Tech,"At the cutting edge of blockchain research is a potential $15 million dollar venture by the Ethereum Foundation centered around a technology called Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs).  Acting as a source of computer-generated randomness that is unpredictable and unbias-able, VDFs are envisioned for use in a highly-anticipated “proof-of-stake”(PoS) system called Serenity which the ethereum network will migrate to in the next few years.  What's more, the ability to generate secure randomized numbers – if implemented in Serenity – would be a feature that can be leveraged by all decentralized applications (dapps) on the platform once integrated into the ethereum codebase.  Speaking to current viability studies on VDF technology, Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake told CoinDesk:  “We’re basically doing all this groundwork to make an informed go, no-go decision on the bigger project. The bigger project is 15 million dollars on that order of magnitude. So we want to make sure that if we do go ahead it’s going to be successful.”  And in terms of making the final decision on the technology, Drake stressed that the process of decision-making would be multi-layered.  “To an extent we need the buy-in from the wider ethereum community that this is a good idea and that the foundation should be spending this money,"" said Drake. ""This is something where we can reach rough consensus on public calls.""  For now, Drake told CoinDesk that a number of essential tests will be carried out by ethereum developers before a final “go, no-go decision” is made on the incorporation of the technology into Serenity.  One of these tests, called the RSA ceremony, will require hundreds of randomized individuals spread out across the globe to participate in an experiment which tests the security of random number generation by a VDF.  Outside of the RSA ceremony, there will also be a worldwide circuit competition requiring participants to test and create specialized firmware also called ASICs to run VDF computations.  As Drake elaborated:  “In the VDF, we basically need an ASIC which is very low latency, that is very fast. The so-called circuit – the way transistors connect in the ASIC – needs to follow a clever algorithm … We don't need it to be the fastest in the world, just fast enough.”  ‘A fundamental new primitive’  And it’s not just the Ethereum Foundation looking at hosting circuit competitions to build VDF technology.  To this end, the decentralized app network Chia completed their first-ever VDF open circuit competition, awarding a total of $100,000 to relevant participants. The company is said to be gearing up for a second round of competition by ""incorporating the solutions from this first round,"" as highlighted in a press release.  ""If we don't do a great job of optimizing performance ... there are likely to be sudden jumps in performance of the best VDF that anyone has out there post-launch, which could result in significant network instability,"" Bram Cohen, Chia's co-founder, told CoinDesk.  Outside of Chia, there are a total of 11 other blockchain companies exploring VDF technology – each with unique plans of their own.  As Revealed to CoinDesk in interview, the ethereum sidechain POA Network plans to host ""a public bounty"" for a VDF implementation using the ethereum open-source collaboration platform Gitcoin.  Other than Chia and POA Network, some of the notable crypto projects researching VDF include file storage system Filecoin, smart contract platform Tezos, decentralized app network NEAR protocol and ThunderCore.  The imperative for increased collaboration between all these companies, according to Drake, is all the more needed given that VDFs are “like a fundamental new primitive.”  “It’s quite generic in that sense … It would be nice if the industry standardizes around a single VDF, partly because that would make the various blockchain projects more compatible with each other but it also means that we [wouldn’t] have to reinvent the wheel and [would collectively] pay less,” said Drake.  And while at least one company was previously reported to be in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation on VDFs, Drake highlights that for now, the foundation is working independently.  Potential for partnership  Unveiled last November, Filecoin had tentatively agreed to split costs for a VDF viability study and reevaluate at a later date whether or not to move forward with the necessary firmware development to bring VDF ideas to life.  A protocol researcher from Filecoin, who wished to remain unnamed, told CoinDesk:  “We're enjoying the collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation, but at this point it's not certain that Filecoin needs a VDF. It could simplify things, but it's one of a number of options we're exploring.""  The representative also affirmed that, at present, Filecoin is moving ahead ""separately"" from the Ethereum Foundation but may ""potentially co-fund third party proposals for exploratory VDF research with the Ethereum Foundation"" in the months ahead.  As such, Drake highlights that, for now, “the Ethereum Foundation has moved on its own ... [funding] various researchers, generally small grants to the order of 10 and 25 thousand dollars.”  But moving forward, Drake estimated that the foundation could come to a decision about whether or not to use the technology in as little as four months time.  “So the various studies that we’ve just kicked off should take four to six months but I think that in about four months we’ll be able to make an informed go, no-go decision,"" Drake said.
