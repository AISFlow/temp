42413632,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA8Wu,1669072535,"The Metaverse: More Women Are ‘Power Users,’ but Women Have Less Power","Real-world issues like gender inequality are beginning to present themselves in the metaverse, according to a report by consulting firm McKinsey published Monday.  The report, which examines how “gender dynamics are playing out in the early-stage metaverse,” conducted a survey on metaverse habits in April in Western Europe and Northern Asia. Of the 1,928 respondents, 41% of women surveyed had used a “primary metaverse platform or participated in a digital world” for over a year, compared with only about 34% of men.  These women also reported spending longer periods of time on these platforms, with 35% of them logging more than three hours per week – a categorization the report calls “power users.” In contrast, only 29% of men devoted the same amount of time to metaverse usage.  In addition, more women appear to be spearheading metaverse initiatives than their male counterparts. In a survey of 448 female executives conducted by McKinsey across continents in April, 60% of women reported putting more than two metaverse initiatives into action compared to 50% of their male counterparts.  While more women are meaningfully interacting with these platforms, men in the industry continue to pull the strings.  Of metaverse companies that received higher shares of funding over the past five years, 90% were led by men, the report said. Of the $112 billion put towards funding metaverse companies within the same time frame, 95% of that money was put towards funding companies led by men.  “We found an already discernible gender gap in the metaverse, similar to the gap that exists in Fortune 500 companies and startups, where less than 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women,” the report’s authors, Mina Alaghband and Lareina Yee, write.  While the Web3 pillars of transparency, accessibility and equality have been applied across many metaverse projects, the foundations of these projects appear to be disproportionately built by men.  “The metaverse has the potential to bring profound change to the global economy, as well as to create new and more equitable opportunities for all who use it – which is why it is imperative for all key stakeholders to understand the dynamics at play,” Alaghband and Yee write. “To do so, industry stakeholders will need to engage a range of different voices and infuse diverse leadership into the companies and coalitions shaping the metaverse today.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/21/the-metaverse-more-women-are-power-users-but-women-have-less-power,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ed51b653344ac6f5f7ef486a0be1a5c04666b03-2206x1298.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411680,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfF2R,1669072106,How Do Hardware Wallets Keep Crypto Safe?,"After crypto exchange FTX’s sudden collapse in November 2022, sales for a particular piece of hardware blew up: hardware wallets that let owners hold and move crypto without being constantly connected to the internet. Sales for Ledger, one popular manufacturer of these wallets, hit an all-time high on Nov. 13, capping off the best week ever, then peaked again the next day. The rush of new activity signaled a renewed interest in the technology. But what exactly is a hardware wallet, and do you need one to protect your crypto?  What is a hardware wallet?  Taking a step back, cryptocurrency wallets are like the financial email addresses of the crypto-verse. Just as email accounts can blast out text messages to other account holders, those with the keys to a crypto wallet can send or receive cryptocurrencies from any other wallet on a blockchain. The public key is like your email address; anyone can send to it. The private key is like the password to your email, and only you should know it. To access the crypto inside a wallet, you’ll have to know this password or private key. To recover access or set up the wallet on a new device or browser, you’ll need a 12- to 24-word “seed phrase” that reinstates access to the wallet.  Read More: Private vs Public Keys in Crypto  Most wallets live inside browser extensions or web apps. These are called “hot wallets” because they live directly on the Internet and are based on your computer or mobile phone. You don’t need to enter your private key every time you need to use one of these wallets; enter it just once and you’re good to go. They’re very convenient and almost always free. But if someone steals or hacks your computer or phone, they might be able to access your crypto.  That security risk led to the invention of the hardware wallet – a cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet at all times. Instead, keys to the crypto wallet are stored on a tiny device about the size of a USB stick. This plugs into the computer each time you need to send crypto or interact with a decentralized finance protocol.  Learn More: Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets  There are two main brands, Ledger and Trezor, and both offer similar services. A Ledger Nano S Plus wallet costs about $79, while Trezor's Model One is about $50. The differences between the models sold by hardware companies cover the number of cryptocurrencies they support, the security architecture itself, and the screens, buttons or battery life of the device.  When you plug your device into your computer, you connect to the hardware wallet’s proprietary desktop application. Ledger’s is called Ledger Live and Trezor’s is called Trezor Suite. From there you can interact with a handful of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or send crypto. These applications do not work without the hardware wallet. When you need to interact with the blockchain, you’ll have to confirm the transaction directly from the wallet.  Hardware wallets can be a bit of a pain to use. The most popular model from Ledger, for instance, only has two buttons, and it takes a lot of tedious button-pressing to enter the four-digit numeric passcode that protects the wallet. But these wallets’ safety make them popular with HODLers who’d rather not keep the bulk of their crypto on an exchange or in a hot wallet.  Are hardware wallets safe?  These wallets are only as safe as the user. Consider them the crypto equivalent of stuffing cash under the mattress. If someone steals your Ledger and knows your passcode, they can take funds from your wallet. The most important thing is the seed phrase that the wallet generates – something these companies encourage users to store in a safe place. If that is stolen or lost, your holdings are toast.  The companies that create hardware wallets cannot reverse blockchain transactions, so there’s no margin for error. Consider the case of one Redditor, a “very technical person,” who kept their wallet in a fireproof case, then woke up one day having lost their life savings. Their mistake? “I have just realized that I did take the screenshot of 24 seeds and stored on google drive. The seeds were kind of encrypted and Words were swapped but it seems hacker managed to figure it out.”  Still, lots of traders consider it better to take the risk with a hardware wallet than to hold funds on a centralized crypto exchange or hot wallet. There’s no way of knowing, definitively, how a crypto exchange invests your funds, and it’s harder to prevent a hot wallet from being hacked. If you want to keep your funds in a hardware wallet, make sure not to let anyone know the seed phrases, and certainly don’t make digital copies; that’s a recipe for disaster.

4604952,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509574,1669071625,Here’s Why Ethereum Is Not Out Of The Woods Yet,"Ethereum has been seeing some significant downside coming out of the weekend. This was triggered by the FTX hacker, who currently holds hundreds of thousands of ETH, dumping some of those coins for Bitcoin over the weekend. After dumping around 10,000 ETH, the digital asset had dumped more than 7%, as a large number of investors continue tracking the wallet. More Pain To Come For ETH Looking at the impact of the FTX hacker selling ETH for BTC had on the market, and seeing the balances of the address, it is no secret that Ethereum is not completely out of the woods yet. There are a lot of eyes on the hacker’s wallet, which contains more than 180,000 ETH, coming out to over $200 million. Related Reading: Tim Draper Stands By $250,000 Bitcoin Prediction, Here’s Why Even now, the hacker continues to dump more ETH, putting more sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. On Monday, the hacker dumped another 15,000 ETH which was converted to BTC according to on-chain data. Given the pattern of selling, it looks like the hacker is trying to convert the stolen crypto to BTC, likely running it through a mixer later on. Continuous selling on the part of the hacker who is now one of the largest ETH whales could cause further damage to Ethereum’s price. Over the last 24 hours, ETH’s price is already down more than 7%, making triple-digit price ranges an increasing possibility for ETH.

Ethereum bulls continue to fight the selling pressure being created by the FTX hacker dumping coins but there is only so much they can do.

If the FTX hacker were to dump all 180,000 remaining tokens on the market, then there is not enough demand to soak it up at this time. The support at $1,000 is already weakened and would make for easy pickings for bears as well. Alternatively, the hacker could stop selling coins to wait for a price recovery which would give the market some time to actually find its footing.

The possible bankruptcy also underscores how FTX's collapse has sent shockwaves through the wider crypto ecosystem that don't appear to be abating. Genesis was said to have spent the past few days trying to raise at least $1B in new capital from potential investors amid its liquidity crunch. Binance was included in such talks, the people told Bloomberg, though funding has yet to come to fruition. “We have no plans to file bankruptcy imminently,” a representative for Genesistold Bloomberg. “Our goal is to resolve the current situation consensually without the need for any bankruptcy filing.

Marathon is doing a great job ramping up production and maintaining liquidity. Signs are pointing to a lengthy crypto bear market which could present some serious risks in the short to medium-term. Like most Bitcoin miners, Marathon Digital ( MARA ) has been facing significant headwinds due to the prolonged selloff in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies. Elevated energy prices and grid disruptions have also provided another dimension of challenges for Bitcoin minors. Marathon has long been one of my favorite Bitcoin mining opportunities, but the recent guidance from the Federal Reserve and the general lack of interest in cryptocurrencies have started to seriously threaten even the best mining companies. (I have covered Marathon multiple times in the past. Check out my crypto cheat sheet and commentar y here ) The Bitcoin Issue For some time, some investors in the cryptocurrency in the mining space have been posing the question of whether it is better to buy the Bitcoin mining companies or the cryptocurrency that they produce. Bitcoin miners have seen the token fall precipitously to what, for most, represents an unprofitable level, as most mining companies have direct costs in the $10,000-$15,000 range and total cost per token somewhere close to $30,000. Data by YCharts Historically the price of mining companies closely follows the price of the underlying cryptocurrency in an upswing, but there is usually some negative deviation on prolonged downturns. Data by YCharts We can see in the chart above that Bitcoin has actually been a more stable investment during this downturn than just about every popular miner. When you think about it, this actually makes a lot of sense. Bitcoin is a token and doesn't have ongoing operating costs, nor is it beholden to fluctuating energy prices or depreciation on its mining fleet. We have also seen some prominent miners like Core Scientific ( CORZ ) take steps to restructure debt to preserve cash. With all the uncertainty in the space, it's easy to see why the remaining Bitcoin bulls would rather commit capital to the token rather than the mining companies. I would argue that Marathon Digital is probably one of the best-run companies in this space. Still, it is not immune to the widespread uncertainty gripping the sector, which was arguably capped by the recent Chapter 11 filing by FTX . Marathon's production In October, Marathon produced a record 615 Bitcoin and increased its total holdings to 11,285 Bitcoin, worth roughly $231 million at the time of the release. This is welcome news as the company has faced production disruptions in the past, so it's good to see things are turning in a favorable direction operationally. The company has produced 3197 Bitcoin year to date, which is 27% more than the year prior, with a useful $51.2 million of unrestricted cash on hand. Their fleet comprised roughly 69,000 active units, good for roughly 7 EH/s. In the past, the sensational moves by Bitcoin made evaluating a Bitcoin mining company's progress fairly straightforward. It was more of an arms race to see who could grow their fleet quickly and produce the highest network hash rate. With signs of a prolonged Bitcoin downturn on the horizon, cash balances, forced selling, and operational costs are more heavily scrutinized as the focus has shifted from maximum production in a wildly profitable environment to weathering a downturn. This is where Marathon excels. The company has managed to maintain a good treasury without burning excessive amounts of cash in production, which puts it in a good place to cope with a short to medium-term unfavorable market. It's important to emphasize that Bitcoin mining companies tend to produce only one product. If the price of that product remains at disadvantageous levels for extended periods of time, they will all likely go out of business eventually. Nevertheless, Marathon is turning the corner on production. We can see that the three-month average has improved significantly from the three months prior, and production figures are trending upward. Company October September August July June May April March 3 Month Average Marathon Digital 615 360 184 72 140.1 268 299 436.1 386 Source: Marathon Digital Forward-Looking Commentary It is difficult to see a way forward for Marathon until Bitcoin prices begin to recover. The Federal Reserve has suggested that interest rates will stay higher for longer, and the recent market turmoil has shown that the idea of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge may be flawed and that the tokens fortunes are more directly tied to the fate of the broader technology sector making the token somewhat susceptible to the business cycle. Data by YCharts We can see from the charts above that as inflation rates swelled, Bitcoin fell apart, similarly to the NASDAQ. Ironically, it was pitched to many investors as a way to avoid the inflation and dollar devaluation that would come from excessive monetary and fiscal support by the Federal Reserve and government. But the good news is that the NASDAQ is one of the oldest and most successful baskets of companies in the history of the world. As interest rates eventually come down to earth, there is a tendency for recovery in the technology sector. This portion of the relationship has not yet been proven adequately for Bitcoin, but the heavy correlation so far is encouraging. The issue is all signs are pointing to a longer recession than previously anticipated due to the stickiness of inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive approach to remediating the problem they created. It's easy to see elevated rates trending upward or flat for the next six months, and this will likely disturb some of the smaller Bitcoin mining companies that may not be as well capitalized. Marathon Digital would likely be able to weather a year-long storm, but that only means that the company will likely exist on the other side of a recession. There is, however, no great reason to buy the stock at its current levels. The Takeaway Marathon has one of the best management teams in the Bitcoin mining space, but they are facing a problem they did not create and one that they do not have the power to fix. Bitcoin will likely have a tough start to 2023, and we will likely see more headlines from poorly capitalized Bitcoin miners, which will, of course, soften the outlook across the board. I believe Marathon will make it to the other side of a recession but what that looks like for these companies is extremely uncertain. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin prices will return to the elevated levels we have seen in the past, and we have no reliable way of predicting how low prices will go and how long they could stay there. Bitcoin mining companies tend to have a good track record of liquidity since their main product is a marketable token. Still, we could see forced selling from firms that evolves into a flat-out race to liquidate at some point. The risks are elevated, and I see no great reason to purchase a mining company until the situation becomes clearer. It would appear that Bitcoin bulls are better off parking their cash in the actual token for now or sitting on the sidelines until conditions improve. Marathon is an avoid for now. But I will revisit the stock once conditions improve.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | MINING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4559643-marathon-digital-prepare-for-longer-crypto-winter?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4603199.jpeg

4601943,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509622,1669068977,Polygon Faces Decision Time As Price Sits On Key Support; Will $0.7 Hold Sell-off?,"MATIC’s price lost its demand zone as the price struggled to hold above $0.7. MATIC’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. MATIC’s price looks weak as the price struggles to hold above $0.7, with the possibility of reclaiming the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) remaining bleak. The price action displayed by Polygon (MATIC) has continued to look disheartening, with the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet in leading to the price of many altcoins, including Polygon (MATIC), battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of MATIC perform well. Most altcoins have lost their key support and have traded with over 90% loss, with many hoping for a crypto revival. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: XRP Holds Gains While Crypto Market Plummets Badly Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. FTX and now Genesis news has hugely impacted the price of MATIC, sending the price into a spiral movement to a region of $0.8 as the price struggles to stay at $0.7. After the price of MATIC closed below the weekly high of $1, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of MATIC looking more bearish with the weekly open. Weekly resistance for the price of MATIC – $1. Weekly support for the price of MATIC – $0.7. Price Analysis Of MATIC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of MATIC remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades below the $1 resistance after bouncing off from the region of $0.8 on several instances. Rumor building of a likely bankruptcy of Genesis could affect the price of MATIC and other smaller assets, with the price facing a possibility of losing the region of $0.7. If the price of MATIC breaks below $0.7, we could see more sell-off as this has been an area of interest to hold off bears. Daily resistance for the MATIC price – $0.9-$1. Daily support for the MATIC price – $0.7-$0.6. Related Reading: FTX Hacker Mobilizes Ethereum Again, Lock And Loaded For The Dump?

42413629,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA8Ym,1669068252,Market Wrap: Crypto Markets Nervous as the FTX Collapse Dents Institutional Confidence,"Crypto markets wobbled on Monday, with major assets feeling continuing nervousness over the potential for further market contagion following the collapse of the FTX exchange.  In a story reported by Omkar Godbole, bonds issued by crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and by business-intelligence company MicroStrategy (MSTR) have slumped as investor confidence dropped due to the FTX collapse.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Coinbase's bond due 2031 has dropped 15% in value this month to 50 U.S. cents on the dollar, according to data source Finra-Morningstar, sending the yield – which moves in the opposite direction to price – to a record high of 13.5%.  MicroStrategy followed a similar trend: On Friday, the yield on the company's 2028 notes, issued last year to finance bitcoin accumulation, climbed to 13.35% as the price dropped to a record 72.5 cents on the dollar.  The companies' bonds carry a premium of around 1,000 basis points – or 10 percentage points – to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield, as of Friday. In traditional markets, a premium of that level is taken to represent credit stress. The 10-year Treasury was yielding 3.83% at press time.  Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder of digital assets investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, said that high bond yields are “reflective of sharply higher rates” but also of “genuine skepticism about the long-term viability of crypto amongst institutional investors” following the contagion fallout from a list of crypto firms this year.  Coinbase's shares dropped to $40.62 Monday, hitting an all-time low since it went public in April 2021, CoinDesk's Helene Braun reported.  Some investors believe bonds tied to Coinbase and MicroStrategy are a safer way to bet on a crypto bull revival. According to Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR noted that while bonds are a safer route, the upside is also ""far more muted.""  Other News  Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to the $15,500 level, nearing a two-year low, amid a gloomy market climate following the FTX collapse. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading as low as $15,591, close to the 52-week low of $15,554. Bitcoin had settled back to around $15,800 as of press time, down roughly 5% in the past 24 hours. “If the $15,500 level breaks for bitcoin, there is not much support until the $13,500 level, followed by the psychological $10,000 level,” Edward Moya, Oanda senior market analyst for the Americas, wrote in a Monday note.  Ether (ETH) slid further to the $1,080 level, down 8%. A CoinShares report Monday said short-ether investment products – those that bet on a price decline – saw the largest inflows on record, with net inflows of $14 million in the seven days ended Nov. 18. The negative sentiments around ether could attribute to the uncertainty over the upcoming Shanghai update and the hacked FTX ETH assets, which sum to around $280 million, according to CoinShares.

42413631,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA8ae,1669068113,FTX Blowup Helped Enrich the Ethereum Validators Who Run the Blockchain,"This month’s collapse of FTX drove a dramatic increase in the profitability of running the Ethereum network as the crypto industry ran into the nearly immutable law that when markets get chaotic, the best place to be is at the heart of the action.  Ethereum validators – who, following the Merge in September, are responsible for running the blockchain – saw profits from MEV (maximal extractable value) spike as FTX faltered, according to data from Flashbots.  MEV is a cornerstone of how crypto trades, with some parallels to things like arbitrage in conventional markets, but with big differences. It measures the amount of additional income that validators can earn by tinkering with and optimizing the order in which blockchain transactions are recorded. Detractors argue it’s an unfair tax on the ecosystem.  One of the tools that Ethereum validators can use to circumvent some controversial MEV practices is MEV-Boost, a middleware component created by Flashbots, that allows validators to request blocks from a network of builders. Validators connect to MEV-Boost through relays, like the one that Flashbots runs, to earn MEV.  Users of Flashbots’ MEV-Boost platform raked in a peak of 3,203 ETH in rewards on Nov. 9.  Since MEV-Boost is the primary tool, and Flashbots currently dominates about 79% of blocks relayed, most of the data reflecting MEV activity is reflected their datasets.  When gigantic news roils any financial market, prices often move fast, up or down. And that can cause major price dislocations, creating profit opportunities for people – be they market makers in stocks or validators running Ethereum – standing in the middle.  “Volatility is MEV fuel,” said Chris Piatt, the co-founder of Eden Network, which runs a relay. “Any big news like this [the FTX implosion] that moves markets correlates with strong builder/searcher performance.”  The spike in MEV happened as perceptions about FTX’s health worsened, prompting larger exchange rival Binance to swoop in with a bailout – only to back out the following day, on Nov. 9. Panic spread throughout crypto.  People rushed to yank money out of FTX. That movement of crypto also meant that there were more transactions eligible for MEV-ing, which may also help explain the surge in MEV profits, particularly over the period of Nov. 8 to Nov. 12.  “The more action on the market, no matter if up- or downwards, the more MEV [is available],"" said Toni Wahrstatter, an Ethereum researcher who has created his own MEV-Boost monitoring dashboard. “Theoretically, if there is no one trading, then there is also no MEV.”  Read more: What’s Going On With Ethereum’s MEV-Boost?",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/21/ftx-blowup-helped-enrich-the-ethereum-validators-who-run-the-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a9a350e1dd60f98824a030f23261f99ccee8fe3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin, both of whom were 37-year-old residents of Tallinn, Estonia, allegedly defrauded hundreds of thousands of victims through a series of crypto-related schemes. The indictment indicated that Potapenko and Turogin allegedly laundered proceeds of their schemes through shell companies and used investor funds to purchase luxury cars and real estate in Estonia. They also ""induced victims to enter into fraudulent equipment rental contracts with the defendants’ cryptocurrency mining service called HashFlare,"" the prosecutors said. Specifically, HashFlare, started in May 2015, was portrayed as a huge crypto mining business, offering contracts to let customers rent a percentage of the company's mining operations in exchange for the virtual currency mined by their portion of the operation. Between 2015 and 2019, prosecutors said customers from across the globe entered into over $550M worth of HashFlare contracts HashFlare, however, was accused of mining less than 1% of all the computing power sold to its customers, according to the indictment, which was returned by a grand jury on October 27 and unsealed Monday. And when investors asked to withdraw their mining proceeds, Potapenko and Turogi resisted making the payments, or paid off the investors using crypto from the open market instead of tokens that were apparently mined at the company. The charges brought against Potapenko and Turogi included conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 16 counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, the indictment said. If they're found guilt, they each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The news highlighted how law enforcement has become more focused on cracking down on illicit crypto activity in an effort to safeguard consumers.

The letter to SoFi expressed concerns about the company expanding its crypto business, how it holds customers' cryptos and its listing of dogecoin (DOGE), which a blog post on the company's website cited as an example of a ""pump and dump"" coin.  The lawmakers asked SoFi to explain how it lists cryptocurrencies for sale, how it addresses customer complaints and how it determines ""the appropriate credit, market and operational risk capital requirements for digital asset exposures.""  The letter to the company also asked if SoFi lists any cryptocurrencies that are securities, and, if so, whether it's licensed to offer securities.  A separate letter addressed to Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Acting Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair Martin Gruenberg and Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu said SoFi ""committed not to 'expand [its] impermissible activities'"" but that the company ""has apparently expanded its digital asset retail operations.""  ""SoFi’s digital asset activities pose significant risks to both individual investors and safety and soundness. As we saw with the crypto meltdown this summer, where crypto-assets lost over $1 trillion in value in a matter of weeks, contagion in the banking system was limited because of regulatory guardrails,"" the letter said. ""In the event of crypto-related exposures at SoFi Digital Assets ultimately require its parent company, bank holding company, or affiliated national bank to seek emergency liquidity or other financial assistance from the Federal Reserve or FDIC, taxpayers may be on the hook.""  In a statement, a SoFi spokesperson said the company allows its members to buy and sell cryptocurrencies but does not provide any other type of crypto-related financing activity.  ""SoFi takes our regulatory and compliance commitments seriously, including our non-bank operations within the digital assets space,"" the spokesperson said. ""We believe we have been fully compliant with the mandates of our bank license and all applicable laws. Additionally, we maintain consistent, constructive dialogue with each of our regulators.

42420880,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZHh,1669061910,Crypto Market Analysis:  Bitcoin and Ether Approaching Oversold Levels,"Bitcoin and ether prices, down 4% and 12% over the last seven days, are approaching traditionally oversold levels, when using the RSI as a tool of measurement. The question is whether that even matters.  RSI, or the relative strength index, is a commonly used tool in technical analysis. I personally use it frequently, with the caveat being that I tend to use a 10-day RSI as opposed to the conventionally used 14-day RSI.  Part of the RSI’s popularity is driven by its relatively straightforward set of “rules.” While not ironclad, they allow novices as well as seasoned professionals to quickly evaluate an asset’s price level and determine where it falls in the range of cheap vs. expensive.  In general, an RSI reading of 70 or more indicates that an asset is “overbought,” while a reading of 30 or less implies that an asset is “oversold.” The RSI levels for BTC and ETH are about 32 and 34, respectively.  Traders using RSI in isolation may be looking to soon establish long positions, with the rationale that the sell-off has gone too far. But how would this have worked historically?  Looking back at pricing data from January 2015 for BTC and November 2017 for ETH shows the following: (Note the mismatch in the start date results from availability of ETH pricing data.)  RSI for BTC has fallen below 30, 106 times. The average one-day, seven-day and 30-day returns following a sub-30 reading have been 1.3%, 3.8% and 7.2% respectively.  RSI for ETH has fallen below 30, 118 times, implying that ETH has been an undersold asset more often than BTC, despite the shorter date range. The average one-day, seven-day and 30-day returns following a sub-30 reading have been 0%, -1.8% and 13.5%.  So where does that leave us? Given current RSI levels, not too bad off actually. Applying an RSI range of greater than 32 and less than 35 shows 79 and 67 occurrences over our data set for both BTC and ETH.  Both were essentially flat over the one- and seven-day periods, but we saw average returns of 4.6% and 5.5% for BTC and ETH over the next 30 days.  This data shows that in the past investors have seen gains, buying BTC and ETH at the current RSI levels. They have done better, however, when buying when RSI fell below 30.  Ultimately, this depends on past relationships continuing into the future. That is certainly not guaranteed, especially given the backdrop of contagion risks in the crypto sector and macroeconomic fears.  But examining what has and hasn't mattered to date may give investors an opening framework.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/21/crypto-market-analysis-bitcoin-and-ether-approaching-oversold-levels,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f2f425a76d4b0b02345b27d31ee931ff7a68b102-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bearish price action also comes in the wake of risk-off trading in the stock market. The digital token, known for its exceptional volatility, slid 4.5% to $15.77K as of 3:15 p.m. ET, compared with its November 2021 peak of $68.9K. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), the world's largest altcoin, tanked 6.4% to $1.10K, and other major cryptos like binance coin ( BNB-USD ) -6.7% , cardano ( ADA-USD ) -6.6% , dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) -10% and polkadot ( DOT-USD ) -6.2% changed hands in a sea of red as well. The global crypto market cap, which was as high as $3T in November 2021, only stood at $790.3B at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . Amid the fallout of FTX, cryptos have taken a much harder hit than equities, which also dipped intraday, with all three major U.S. stock indices trading in negative territory. With increased downward pressure in cryptos, liquidity on centralized exchanges appeared to have also taken a nosedive. For example, ""liquidity on Gemini remains very poor since the FTX/Alameda collapse,"" Kaiko Director of Research Clara Medalie wrote in a Twitter post . ""Average spreads for its #BTC-USD pair increased from 2bps to more than 6."" ""There was a sharp drop in liquidity on most cryptocurrency exchanges in the aftermath of FTX and Alameda's collapse,"" Medalie told Seeking Alpha. Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried's trading firm that played a key role in the demise of his crypto empire, ""was a big market maker for crypto assets, and a lot of other market makers got funds trapped on FTX, so there has been a visible impact on overall liquidity."" Meanwhile, she noted ""there has been a slight improvement in liquidity over the past week as market makers slowly re-deploy capital across exchanges."" Recall crypto broker Gemini's lending business halted redemptions and new loan originations last week as the FTX downfall resulted in ""abnormal withdrawal requests which have exceeded our current liquidity."" Elsewhere, the $10.5B Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC-USD), down 2.4% , has seen its discount relative to the underlying price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) widen to a record 45% on Friday, Bloomberg reported, indicating that market participants have seen a worse slump in GBTC than BTC itself. Indeed, GBTC shares dropped 77% in the past year, while BTC plunged 65% . Check out Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos's assessment on why GBTC's discount to BTC has only increased. Unsurprisingly, crypto-related stocks sold off during the session: Marathon Digital ( MARA ) -16% , Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ) -9.5% , MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) -8.9% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ) -9.7% , Bit Digital ( BTBT ) -13% and Bitfarms ( BITF ) -14.3% .

The token saw an inter-week surge of up to 14.2% from $0.345 to $0.394. While it has dropped from that high, it still holds up to 2.08%. However, it trades dangerously close to its floor price for this week and might lose all its gains soon. Its daily chart is already trending in the red zone. As of writing, XRP is down over 5% but looks on a rebounding path. The entire crypto market has faced a challenging time this week. Almost every token in the top ten market cap list was trading in the red zone. Only XRP managed to keep its gains from last week. However, its trading volume has increased in the last 24 hours, meaning traders have been active. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Selling At Large Losses, Is Final Capitulation Here? XRP Looks To Expand Beyond The United States It appears that Ripple [XRP] was more interested in making progress than continuing its legal spat with the US SEC. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s general counsel, disclosed that most of the company’s income is no longer derived from the United States. Alderoty made the statement in an interview with CNBC on November 18. The majority of the blockchain payment company’s profits, according to Alderoty, have come from operations outside of the United States. He also acknowledged that Ripple was actively seeking an Irish Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license. Regardless of the status of the SEC case, Alderoty stated, Effectively, Ripple is operating outside of the U.S. It is seeking a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Irish central bank so that it can ‘passport’ its services throughout the European Union via an entity based there. XRP, however, was unable to maintain positive dominance after the disclosure. At the time of publication, CoinMarketCap statistics showed that it had lost 0.76% of its previous 24-hour value. A review of the network’s performance also revealed a sharp decline. Data from the analytics website Santiment showed that XRP’s network growth has decreased to 4,264. This is far from its peak of 9,827 on November 13th. At this point, it signalled that XRP was having trouble luring fresh addresses to the network. XRP Price Analysis The price of XRP is now $0.353, with a $2 billion 24-hour trading volume. XRP has decreased by more than 6% during the past 24 hours. With a live market cap of less than $18 billion, CoinMarketCap now ranks XRP seventh. Over the past several days, there has been a lot of pressure on the price of XRP. The coin encountered heavy opposition around $0.3951, where it created a triple-top pattern, which increased this pressure. Additionally, it has deviated from the 25-day and 50-day moving averages, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved nearly into oversold territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Only Temporary As All Roads Lead To $15,000 Therefore, it is possible that the price of Ripple will keep dropping as sellers aim for a crucial support level of around $0.3100.

42413623,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA8QM,1669060280,Two Estonian Citizens Charged With Running a Series of Crypto Scams Totaling $575M,"Federal prosecutors in Washington state have charged two Estonian citizens with running a series of crypto scams that allegedly defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors around the world of a combined $575 million.  According to the indictment released Monday, Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin – both 37-year-old residents of Tallinn, Estonia – were partners in a series of interconnected fraudulent schemes using cryptocurrency. The two defendants allegedly used a variety of shell companies to launder the proceeds of their schemes, and spent investor funds on luxury cars and real estate in Estonia.  Their first company, HashCoins, which launched in December 2013, purported to be a manufacturer of crypto mining equipment, and took orders (and payment in full) from customers who wanted to purchase miners. However, according to the indictment, HashCoins never manufactured anything – instead, it re-sold mining equipment purchased on the open market and found reasons to delay the shipment of the majority of its sales.  In May 2015, facing a growing number of angry customers, Potapenko and Turogin allegedly started a second company, HashFlare. According to prosecutors, they told their clientele that orders for mining equipment would be converted to “remote mining services” and – instead of the physical equipment they were promised – those sending funds would receive a share of the service’s profits.  Prosecutors, though, say Potapenko and Turogin ran HashFlare more like a Ponzi scheme than a mining operation, and accused them of actually mining less than 1% of all the mining hashrate sold to customers.  HashFlare’s customers were allegedly shown statements with fraudulent crypto balances. When customers tried to cash out, prosecutors say Potapenko and Turogin attempted to give them the run-around, coming up with reasons why they could not pay out and making them jump through legal hoops, such as fulfilling know-your-customer (KYC) requirements before they could be paid.  While HashFlare continued to operate, Potapenko and Turogin allegedly started another venture, Polybius Bank, which was marketed as a crypto bank based in Estonia. According to the indictment, the pair advertised an initial coin offering (ICO) for the project in June 2017, which raised $25 million from investors around the world. The project fizzled shortly thereafter.  In 2018, HashFlare announced that it was shutting down, citing rising energy costs and claiming that bitcoin mining was no longer profitable even as prosecutors say Potapenko and Turogin continued mining for themselves, using miners that they’d purchased with stolen customer funds.  By the time HashFlare officially shuttered in August 2019, prosecutors say it had raised a total of $550 million.  Potapenko and Turogin are both charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 16 counts each of wire fraud, one count each of conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Both Potapenko and Turogin were arrested in Tallinn on Nov. 20. A jury trial has been demanded in the Western District of Washington.

The company recorded healthy revenue growth for its last reported earnings quarter and announced the acquisition of Apex Crypto. Net losses exploded upwards on the back of material non-cash impairments, as the crypto winter stands to persist deep into the new year. The direct fallout to Bakkt ( BKKT ) from the collapse of FTX ( FTT-USD ) will likely be extremely limited as confirmed by its CEO Gavin Michael in a recently released statement . But FTX, the third largest crypto exchange in the world by volume, was one of the most prominent and visible crypto companies from an institutional perspective. Its collapse played out quickly, just over a week, and will come to define a watershed moment for an industry still under siege and reeling from a year that saw the failure of the Terra/Luna currency ( LUNC-USD ), the bankruptcy of Voyager Digital Ltd. ( OTCPK:VYGVQ ) and BlockFi, the liquidation of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows, and the implosion of market maker Alameda Research. More pain is to come as retail investors rush to pull their crypto from centralized exchanges, sparking what many crypto analysts say will quickly become a series of cascading bank-style runs. 2022 was when crypto dreams died and Bakkt will likely suffer second-order effects. Core Scientific ( CORZ ), the largest Bitcoin miner in North America, has indicated that it might file for chapter 11 bankruptcy after running into financial difficulties and institutional crypto lender Genesis is teetering on the brink. A material consolidation of an ecosystem that has been in development for over a decade now looks like the most likely outcome as the tide goes out and crypto firms swimming naked get found out. The current conditions have already induced a material level of stasis with firms rushing to audit and then mitigate their exposure to peers. Crypto Adoption From An Institutional And Retail Perspective Will Take A Hit Bakkt is trusted by several financial services firms to deliver crypto capabilities to their customers. Its solutions need mainstream retail consumers to actually use Bitcoin and its crypto peers as a tangible medium for transactions. Indeed, the company's Crypto Solution business integrates crypto seamlessly into banking apps and as a payment solution or rewards program. The growth of these solutions hinges on the mainstream adoption of crypto beyond just being a speculative tool kit to get wealthy. Bakkt Bakkt bears would be right to question how healthy the company's business model is beyond the price oscillations of crypto. When the company last reported earnings for its fiscal 2022 third quarter, revenue came in at $12.9 million , up 41% over the year-ago quarter with transaction revenue from loyalty redemption driving most of this growth. Transacting accounts increased by 21% year-over-year to reach 678,000 with digital asset conversion volume reaching $182 million. This was a 73% year-over-year increase on the back of loyalty redemptions from the post-pandemic travel boom. Bakkt The company recorded operating expenses excluding impairment of $60 million, an increase from expenses of $39 million in the year-ago period. However, broader operating expenses including impairments rose to $1.61 billion due to a partial non-cash impairment charge on goodwill and other intangible assets on their balance sheet. Management during their earnings call stated the impairment charge came from a decline in their market capitalization and the impact of elongated timing for crypto product activations. The company also closed a $200 million deal to acquire Apex Crypto . $55 million of this will be paid in cash with the remainder being contingent on the business achieving certain financial targets. Bakkt expects the deal to be accretive to revenue and EPS in the first full year following its closure. Synergies of between $20 million to $25 million are being chased through headcount and technology efficiencies. The Crypto Winter Just Added Another Year With an adjusted EBITDA loss of $30.7 million, up from a loss of $24.1 million in the year-ago quarter, the company will see its seemingly large cash and equivalents position get continually whittled down as the crypto winter proves persistent. Current revenue growth has to be commended, but subscription revenue is down over its year-ago period and the large increase in transaction revenue broadly came on the back of a year-ago comp that was still disrupted by pandemic-era travel restrictions. Is Bakkt undervalued with an enterprise value that's declined to $376 million? The 17% short interest in the company does not think so. Investor confidence in the entire crypto industry will suffer structural damage as a result of the FTX debacle and Bakkt will likely see new partnerships slow on the back of this. Further, with general consumer activity in the space tied at the hips to crypto winters and springs, the elongation of the current winter far into 2023 will render uncertain Bakkt's future revenue trajectory. 2021 saw large-scale institutional crypto adoption as Bitcoin and its peers exploded to record highs and firms rushed to capitalize on the upside. The opposite now stands to happen following the fall of FTX. A large number of retail investors look set to only recover cents on the dollar of their FTX trading accounts with total losses for other institutional firms. The impact will be fear and retrenchment. Not just from a scramble to mitigate counterparty exposure but from the potential regulatory response. Bakkt's 6.58x enterprise value to forward sales multiple leaves little room for execution failure and comes at a more than 117% premium to its sector average.

Short investment products, which bet on the price of an asset to drop, accounted for 75% of all inflows, a report by digital asset investment and trading group CoinShares found. Inflows for bitcoin (BTC) totaled $14 million, but considering the popularity of short-term investment vehicles, net flows added up to a negative $4.3 million.  Inflows into short-ether (ETH) investment products also hit a new high of $14 million, while the blockchain-based token only saw minor outflows, the report showed.  The data shows that investors are deeply scared by FTX’s collapse, which was once regarded as one of the most trusted crypto exchanges but turned into possibly the biggest fraud in crypto history.  “On aggregate sentiment was deeply negative for the asset class, likely being a direct result of the ongoing fallout from the FTX collapse,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares said.

Related Reading: FTX Hacker Mobilizes Ethereum Again, Lock And Loaded For The Dump? As of this writing, the Bitcoin price is seeing massive selling pressure. The cryptocurrency trades at $15,900 with a 4% and 2% loss in low and higher timeframes. BTC has been more stable than other assets in the crypto top 10 by market cap. In contrast, Ethereum (ETH) recorded a 10% loss over the previous week, while Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) recorded a 9% and 14% loss, respectively, over the same period. Other cryptocurrencies follow this trend except for XRP, which still maintains some profits. Low Volume Week Could Be An Obstacle For The Bitcoin Price The general sentiment in the market seems biased toward another flash crash. However, the U.S. market might become less active in the coming days. The country will begin its Christmas-related holidays this week when its citizen celebrates Thanksgiving Day. Thus, the market might see low trading volumes. According to an analyst from Material Indicators, the long holiday week might extend the losses in the Bitcoin price and the crypto market, especially these days of heavy pessimist sentiment and negative news in the nascent asset class: Note, it’s a holiday week in the U.S. so volume may be light. Could see some Q4 tax loss harvesting in TradFi contributing to the downward momentum in Crypto fueled by FTXscam contagion related FUD. The analyst shared the image below and showed crypto exchange Binance’s orderbook. On this trading venue, the bid (buy) side seems thicker. At the time of writing and on higher timeframes, many more buying orders could operate as support for the Bitcoin price. In that sense, Material Indicators and others believe the crypto market is bound for sideways price action. This theory could be invalidated if there is new negative news related to FTX’s collapse or the contagion wrecking-havoc across the industry. According to rumors circulating across social media platforms, there is a high risk of a major crypto company filing for bankruptcy in the coming days.

Schmidt told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program that in the case of FTX, the red flags that VCs missed may have in part been due to the “byproduct of the funding environment,” which made it easier for crypto startups to receive early-stage funding with ""extremely low interests,"" as ""tons of capital"" flooded into the VC market.  “Naturally, when you have so many more bidders than opportunities, that moves the price up and [it] shortens diligence time [and] the amount of negotiation and leverage that VCs have in those conversations,” Schmidt said.

42394104,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXXEd,1669057839,Taking Crypto Back to Nature,"Before the arrival of European and majority white influence, the greater Americas (North, Central and South) consisted of thriving Indigenous civil societies. These communities possessed their own unique governance structures, had their own property rights, spiritual sciences and cross-community forms of communication.  To some degree, Indigenous societies resemble the type of “decentralized exchange grids” or dexgrids, emerging within the world of crypto. These are cultural-economic systems that use internal incentives to spur large-scale productivity and trade.  Steven McKie is the co-founder of Amentum Capital. A version of this article was first published on Amentum's blog.  Tightly knit Indigenous communities also had localized supply chains for manufacturing; bolstering local access to a broader array of nutrient diversity. Their bonds were held together by centuries of spiritual beliefs derived from direct interactions with the local flora and fauna.  Effectively, these were some of the most organically “biomimetic” (ability to mimic aspects of naturally occurring topologies in nature) systems in history. As these societies were so embedded with their environmental surroundings by the very nature of existing, they developed sound best practices for maintaining the local ecology, regional plant diversity and the cleanliness of local fresh water supplies.  Through time, these locally created economies and traditional belief systems would be held in spiritual bondage, as new federal laws were enacted that slowly stripped these Indigenous, prosperous nations from the very land and customs upon which they’d formulated their economies and belief systems.  Fast forward to the present moment, and we stand at an impasse globally thanks to these never-ending colonistic practices. Local ecologies burn, and the transplants who’ve subsisted on these stolen Indigenous lands are left without a clue as to how to care for them sustainably.  Now, federal and local governments are forced to depend on laws and legislation to protect their crumbling natural resources with the help of scientists — instead of simply utilizing the assistance of local indigenous knowledge that has been buried under bureaucracy and planned socio-economic entrapment.  Thankfully, crypto-economic systems provide us a way out. A means by which to stymie ecological and natural destruction, by replicating digital communities and tribes that can sustainably source and retain the local environmental knowledge – when creatively deployed and utilized. Enough to right our wrongs, and ensure the survival of our progeny for generations to come, at least.  Forward crypto-economic deployments  The creation of public blockchain systems and the deployment of crypto-economic game mechanisms in the form of novel smart contracts has resulted in a massive explosion of economic experiments in coordinating humanity.  As we’ve naturally progressed in the evolution of our collective industry research on complex systems, we’ve seemingly come to consensus that biomimicry is the right way forward. Life, as it turns out, has had an incredible head-start on getting the biological makeup and topologies of natural systems just right. So, to not pretend like we know better, we also have to give credit to the social engineers of our physical systems in the past. Then we may more creatively blend these new technologies with cultures of old, creating something vastly more unique. We can potentially even bring beauty back to our mechanistic ways by embracing nature in its entirety.  Re-watering our roots  There is a mirror effect that can be found when comparing our need for natural sustainability processes and the financial primitives enabling programmable scarcity in crypto.  Our challenge is just identifying the opportunities amongst what we already have available in the industry and intelligibly constructing the right combinations of tools to deploy based on the governance and coordination needs of areas in need of incentive alignment.  High availability and fault tolerance  Now, because we’re constructing and deploying these tools with the aid of digitally distributed systems of incentives (public blockchains and other derivative protocols), we’re aware of the need for fault tolerance and liveness (high availability). If we are working to deploy systems that are redundant and resilient by nature, we have to ensure that they can remain active, online and accessible by the participants utilizing them. Nature is always readily available for us as a species, and our digital systems should seek to retain that same level of natural reliability.  A fault-tolerant system and environment works to ensure no service interruptions, but has a higher cost of operation (i.e., proof-of-work/proof-of-stake). Meanwhile, a highly available system would have minimal service interruption; essentially this is the “liveness” of the channels, ensuring they are being provisioned with valuable goods.  When we intermix the passive earnings that can be accrued from staking and bonding assets or digital resources to these systems with real-world participants, something very interesting happens.  We find that we can create a feedback system wherein local participants are earning digital value for their contributions to public blockchain systems and adjacent crypto platforms, allowing for more home plant asset investment; in-turn enabling people to be more nutritionally self-sufficient as they learn the best produce and soil management practices for their local region.  With the creative ability to digitize the rights to share-cropping and create call options for future produce production, the ideas are seemingly infinite on how to inject value and future value into more hard-to-reach areas of socioeconomic dismay.  As these newfound systems are established, labor overtime will be automated and more easily analyzable, now with the added benefits of locally available nutrients becoming self-sustaining – also naturally leading to the containment of pests and bacterial disease.  By mobilizing and harnessing indigenous knowledge as well, cultural heritages can be sustained. From heirloom seeds, to proper irrigation and harvesting techniques that protect soil integrity, we can cherish this knowledge like never before.  The non-universal cities of tomorrow  Imagine a future where all manufactured goods, local produce and commodity value have digital twin representations on publicly verifiable cryptographic systems. At a glance, we can see where in the world action needs to be taken to protect and maintain local sovereignty. There are efforts such as Mattereum, which is leading the way for legally defensible non-fungible circular economies, and DexGrid, which is doing the same for green energy production and micro-grids. There will not be one winner in this new economy, but many substitutable and complementary winners.  With the power of non-universal architectures that leverage many different fault tolerant digital and physical systems, we get:  New public blockchains that have a richer set of potential expressions  Utility focused assets can bridge easily with other utility focused chains to create generalized use cases that are not asset dependent and allows substitute protocols (goods). Natural modularity emerging from technical interoperability is organically the best path forward  Liquidity routing and capital lockups aid in capital efficiency and enable more experimentation in the provisioning of value and aid in areas it may be needed the most (i.e., as with Connext)  When we apply the “whole systems” approach from permaculture at the intersection of Indigenous knowledge, we formulate a holistic template for us to start utilizing today. We, as a society, will not have food security without addressing local water supply and quality. We will not have food democracy and the elimination of food deserts if we do not address the social injustice issues that strip people from the very land they’re most adept at maintaining.  The Indigenous communities of yesterday and today (of which I am honored to be a part of) were all about the art of engineering beneficial cross-community relationships. Ironically, too, they adhered to the most utopian ideals currently discussed with supply chains when seeking a benchmark on modular and self-sustaining systems.  We know that incentives matter. Now we just need to do the work of weaving a basket of biology and nature-loving protocols together. Composable becoming compostable, degenerate liquidity farmers becoming local irrigation experts of digital and physical value. This is the future we need for a proper regenerative resurgence.

Bitcoin 7-Day MA aSOPR Has Sharply Gone Down Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC market participants may be coming close to surrendering. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder is moving their coins at a profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator having values less than the threshold suggests the market as a whole is realizing some amount of loss at the moment. Naturally, the SOPR having values exactly equal to 1 implies the investors are just breaking-even on their selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Below $16k As Older Whales Show Signs Of Dumping The “Adjusted SOPR” (aSOPR) is a modified version of this metric that doesn’t take into account movement of all those coins that were sold within an hour of being bought. This helps remove noise from the data that won’t have any significant impacts on the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average Bitcoin aSOPR over the last several years: Looks like the 7-day MA value of the metric has declined in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the 7-day MA Bitcoin aSOPR has taken a deep dive below the 1 mark recently. This means that investors are now selling at some big losses. The current levels of the indicator are the same as those observed back during the 2018-19 bear market bottom, as well as during the COVID crash. Related Reading: Traders Union experts published a Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction The reason such deep capitulations have usually coincided with major bottoms in the price of the crypto is that they signify an exhaustion of selling pressure as the weak holders give up and dump their holdings at a loss. Stronger hands then buy these coins up and accumulate at cheap prices, leading to a more positive outcome in the long term. If the current capitulation really is the final one, then a bottom may be in sight for Bitcoin. However, bullish trend wouldn’t immediately follow the coin; the short term outcome is likely to still be bearish.

And the minimum state net operating loss carryforward was said to be $715M, according to the document from advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal North America, who said FTX failed to keep reliable books and records. Of note, earlier filings indicated those losses could somewhat offset tax liabilities, Bloomberg added. But some positive developments seem to be taking hold in the midst of the widening FTX debacle. For instance, the exchange's Japanese arm is aiming to resume customer withdrawals by the end of 2022, according to a report by NHK, citing an unidentified FTX Japan executive in an interview. Withdrawals can't be resumed now, though, since FTX Japan shares the same (currently suspended) payment system as FTX.

42421429,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDJF,1669054409,Decentralized Social Media – Has the Moment Come?,"On crypto-based predictions market Polymarket, users are seemingly giving Twitter’s new and seemingly unwilling owner Elon Musk the benefit of the doubt. According to a bet expiring Dec. 15, only 36% of bettors think “Twitter reports any outages” by that date.  Prediction markets, of course, are not infallible. But they do provide an interesting data point for people looking to become informed actors. By putting “skin in the game,” or money down that could conceivably be lost, betting markets give incentive to users to wager only on likely outcomes – deemphasizing their own preferences and other biases.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The poll is all the more interesting considering the fierce headwinds Musk’s Twitter faces. According to recent reporting, Twitter has lost half its workforce, a number of advertisers are pausing or scaling back ad placements and users are seemingly abandoning ship. Some are saying this is the end times for the blue app.  All of this is good news for decentralized social media experiments that have historically struggled to match the growth of Silicon Valley incumbents. A number of apps, notably the non-blockchain-based platform Mastodon, and a few crypto-powered alternatives are seeing a jump in usage. While it’s still unknown what will happen to Twitter, a more diverse social media landscape should benefit users in the end.  Mastodon, the open-source microblogging network modeled on Twitter, is looking like the main beneficiary from the ongoing Twitter shakeup. The platform, founded in 2017 by now 29-year-old Eugen Rochko and developed primarily by a Germany-based nonprofit, has gained well over half a million users in recent weeks.  Many of these users say Mastodon feels like a friendlier but stripped-down version of Twitter. Mastodon is a “federated” network, meaning its servers are hosted by a diverse cast of users, rather than a single corporate entity. Mastodon users choose a server they want to join, and trust that whoever operates those computers will not manipulate their data (a bit like how Facebook or Twitter users have to trust those companies).  The benefit of Mastodon’s method is that the costs of running the program are spread out, and there are fewer incentives to monetize (read: exploit) users' data. People can also join different servers that set different content moderation standards – perhaps preferring a free-speech free-for-all or a more curated feed. They can still be blocked by server operators, but are theoretically allowed to port their “social graph” to another group within the federation.  At the same time, several new Mastodon users have reported finding the decentralized server system to be needlessly confusing, slower than Twitter and buggy. Not all servers are running the latest version of Mastodon, and many users seem to miss certain features and tools – like verified accounts and the ability to “retweet” other users.  As Bloomberg’s Vlad Savov put it in a recent review of the platform: “[T]he world prefers running Windows and macOS over the much more flexible and customizable Linux operating systems. We choose convenience even when it comes at the cost of capability. We want things done for us. And, most importantly, we take a lot for granted with free services like Twitter.”  Savov isn’t wrong, but he ain’t right. Many of Mastodon’s supposed defects are actually its primary benefits. But this whole situation may help explain why crypto-based social media platforms haven’t seen the same level of uptick even as many users actively search out alternatives. Almost no one, for instance, is talking about Bitclout.  Lens Protocol, the social media project incubated by decentralized finance blue chip Aave, is supposedly seeing more users. Aave’s director of developer relations, Nader Dabit, tweeted the protocol saw one million transactions last week – a notable number for the social network that uses non-fungible tokens to create user profiles and posts.  Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin was one of Lens’ new users, tweeting out that he’s “eagerly” experimenting with alternatives. This includes Farcaster, which bills itself as a “sufficiently decentralized social network,” co-founded by ex-Coinbase staffer Dan Romero. In a recent interview, Romero noted Farcster is storing as little information on-chain as possible and has spent a lot of effort “attracting” “quality” “early adopters.”  In the end, a social media platform is only as good as its user base. These platforms tend towards monopolization because users want to be where other people are. Minds, the Ethereum-based Facebook alternative that incentivizes use with token rewards, has had a multiyear leg up on many newer social media alternatives.  See also: Web 3 Is Where the Young People Are | Opinion  Minds is illustrative of the tendency for people to treat alternative platforms as fail-safes – a place to cross-post their thoughts in case something happens to their primary channels. Its white paper specifically notes the encrypted, open source program is resistant to “surveillance, algorithm manipulation, and censorship” – language that might attract a particular user base.  That, too, is not a bad thing – the platform boasted about 360,000 unique visitors from the U.S. in September. Further, this is not to suggest that Web3 innovations need to be sequestered off from the web as it's known. Meta's Facebook and Instagram are exploring NFTs, for instance, while Reddit's ""digital collectibles"" have been a surprising success.  See also: Reddit Users Open 2.5 Million Crypto Wallets  Musk is hot-and-cold on crypto, but does think many of the industry' core values, like data persistence and portability as well as verifiable and open algorithms, are worth striving for. Actually having viable competitors that do just that could push Musk to implement these changes sooner. (Though it seems like he's already suspended work on a crypto wallet, while Twitter's crypto division's lead, Tess Rinearson, quit during the recent shakeup.)  It seems unlikely that crypto networks will grow to the size of their corporate-owned competitors anytime soon.

COIN dropped to $40.62 on Monday, down 10% on the day and 39% in November as investors retreated from digital assets, in part thanks to the fallout from the bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX.  Coinbase's shares traded at slightly over $400 last year on the day the company went public on the Nasdaq, which turned out to be their highest point. (At the time at least one expert warned investors should “buckle up their seatbelts and expect a wild ride.”)  The bitcoin (BTC) price rose to a record high near $69,000 in November 2021, but crypto markets have been falling ever since, as have Coinbase's shares. The stock has lost more than 80% of its value this year, underperforming most cryptocurrencies.  “Coinbase shares can't catch a break,” Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya said. “The major cryptocurrency exchange has yet to convince investors that its share price will stabilize like some of the other top cryptos as investor skepticism about trading on exchanges grows.""  Bonds issued by Coinbase also dipped in November as investors’ appetite for crypto tanked after FTX’s bankruptcy triggered industry-wide contagion. Coinbase’s bonds dropped 15% in value this month and are trading at 50 cents on the dollar, according to data firm Finra-Morningstar.  “Coinbase has a small exposure to FTX, but most of the recent weakness is stemming from concerns many crypto traders might be opting for cold storage instead of keeping money on exchanges,” Moya said. “Coinbase has a tough road ahead until investors have further clarity on the company's reserves and exposure to other crypto assets.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/21/coinbase-shares-hit-all-time-low,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e014b34b16347af75d51fd61b573875de35e01b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the continued trend above $16,000, it is starting to look like the digital asset is finally on a path to recovery but this is not the case. The recovery only shows a temporary stoppage in what is a continuous bleed as momentum continues to drop across the space. This Is Not The Bitcoin Bottom The bitcoin bottom is still highly debated even now. When the digital asset had hit its previous cycle low of $17,600 and then ranged above $20,000 for a long time, there were speculations that the bottom was finally in but historical data said otherwise, which turned out to be true. Related Reading: Is Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao To Blame For FTX Collapse? Now, bitcoin has already reached a new cycle low of $15,500. However, going by the same historical data, it is unlikely that the bitcoin bottom has been marked. Instead, it is more likely for the digital asset to see $15,000 going forward than another recovery above $20,000. This is because of the developments that are still coming out of the space. BTC price at $16,090 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com By now, it is no longer a secret that the FTX collapse had rubbed off on a lot of big players. Where the collapse of the likes of Terra and Celsius had been bad, FTX’s decline carries worse implications for the crypto market. Add in the fact that the crypto exchange was hacked for more than $300 million and the hacker is now dumping the tokens, and there is no way that BTC has seen its bottom yet. There is also little to no support at $16,000 for the digital asset even at this time. It remains a seller’s market, which means that the bears remain in control. There is also significant resistance at the $16,500 level, and with the low momentum in the market, a test of this area is unlikely.

Extreme customer deposit concentration. Questions on loan quality. Silvergate ( SI ) has some serious red flags that should be addressed. The company has lost at least $1 billion (8.1%) of deposits from the end of Q3 2022 to their November 15 update. Further, there is an extremely high percentage of deposits from Digital banking clients and an absurd concentration of deposits from the top 10 customers. On the asset side, a lot of attention is given to the $205 million SEN leverage loan made to MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), but little attention is given to the other loans the company made and the creditworthiness of their borrowers. Deposit Liabilities At the end of Q3 2022, SI had $13.2 billion of total deposits, of which $11.9 billion were held by digital asset customer base. In a press release dated Nov. 11th, SI disclosed that FTX represented less than 10% of deposits as of Q3 2022, which implies that non-digital deposits are $1.4 billion as of Q3 2022. SI disclosed that AVERAGE quarter-to-date deposits totaled $9.8 billion. Assuming that non-FTX Digital deposits are $9.8 billion on November 15, 2022 and non-Digital deposits and FTX have not changed since Q3 2022, that would imply that total deposits have fallen by at least $1 billion, or 8.1%, which is a large outflow in half a quarter. (all numbers are in $ thousands) Estimated Deposits as of Nov. 15 2022 (Company Filings; Press Releases, and Author Estimates) Further, it is suspect that SI released the figures as AVERAGE instead of ending deposits. Market volatility has been particularly pronounced in crypto since early November and I believe it's likely that deposits are much lower today than presented by using an average. Another major red flag is that the top 10 customers represent 47.9% of TOTAL DEPOSITS as of Sept. 30, 2022. That is $6.3 billion. While it's not known who these 10 customers are - 8 customers are on the SEN Exchange network - FTX (FTT-USD); Coinbase (COIN); Paxos; Cypto.com; Gemini; Kraken; Bitstamp; and Cycle. In the week ending November 14, 2022 alone, users yanked $3.7 billion worth of Bitcoin and $2.5 billion worth of Ether. If SI is the bank of choice where is that money ultimately going to go out of? One of the downsides of having a banking monopoly on crypto infrastructure built on assets that in my view are worthless (another discussion) is that this ecosystem becomes vulnerable to complete collapse. Assets When exchanges face withdrawals, they send cash back to customers. The exchanges withdraw deposits from Silvergate to do so and Silvergate needs to sell assets to provide this liquidity. Looking at the balance sheet from the recent Call Report and company filings, the assets look pretty good at first blush - the company has $13.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and securities. ($ in Thousands, except where noted) SI Immediate Liquidity (Call Report Dated 09/30/2022; Company Filings; Author Estimates) However, SI would likely take realized losses to sell securities to cover withdrawals. There have been many articles mentioning that SI holds AA+ securities. But I think, in practice, if SI gets hit with say $6 billion of withdrawals, they would have to immediately sell at least $4 billion of securities on demand, and many of the securities they traffic in don't have that kind of volume. Non-Agency CMBS has $1 billion ADV; ABS has $2.1 billion ADV. Further, the increase in yields had decreased the price for even the highest-rated bonds. In the following example, Total Consolidated Assets are reduced by $3.12 billion, which is a 20% haircut to Average Total Consolidated Assets. I'm assuming that SI would have to take $1 billion of realized loss when selling securities to cover withdrawals. In this instance, Tier 1 capital will be reduced to 5.1%, compared to 12.1% for the entire banking industry. Hypothetical Tier 1 Capital Ratio (Call Report; Author Estimates) The loan book also has concerns: notably sensitivity to interest rates and credit quality of the borrowers. A large portion of their loan book is marked as held for sale. These loans are likely to have incurred significant losses since mortgage rates have almost doubled. Per the Call Report, 27.5% of the residential loans are adjustable mortgages, meaning that 72.5% of the loans are fixed rate loans. Who are these mortgages made to? If Silvergate is the digital currency bank, then it would be safe to assume that most of these mortgages are being made to customers that earn income and wealth from digital currencies, which have plummeted in value. SI should disclose the credit scores and delinquencies of their loan book. Finally, the SEN Leverage loan made to MicroStrategy gets a lot of attention. This loan is $205 million and is secured against 30,051 Bitcoin, or a loan per Bitcoin of $6,822. In a scenario where Bitcoin fell to $1,000 per coin, the loan will have a recovery value of approximately $30 million. Under the terms of the loan agreement, MicroStrategy needs to keep the LTV of this loan at 50% or needs to keep $410 million worth of Bitcoin posted as collateral. At a price of $1,000 Bitcoin, MicroStrategy would need to deposit 380,000 Bitcoins additional Bitcoin to Silvergate. Unfortunately for Silvergate, MicroStrategy owns 130,000 Bitcoins, of which 115,110 are held by MicroStrategy, LLC, the borrower of the SEN Loan. I think a drop of Bitcoin below $3,561 per coin would likely cause MicroStrategy to file for bankruptcy. Below is the potential liquidation value of the loan book. This analysis assumes that there is a bank run and SI needs to sell assets at current prices. ($ in Thousands, except where noted) Loans Receivable (Call Report; Author Estimates) Note: I'm not a bank analyst just a curious crypto skeptic. I could be completely wrong, and in theory, SI could withstand significant withdrawals without writing down tier 1 capital.

42421418,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoD7t,1669049089,The Machine Learning Powering Generative Art NFTs,"Artificial intelligence (AI) in the non-fungible token (NFT) space is becoming increasingly relevant. Generative art (that is, art that has been created by an autonomous system) has quickly emerged into one of the main categories of the NFT market, driving innovative projects and astonishing collections. From the works of AI art legends such as Refik Anadol or Sofia Crespo to Tyler Hobbs’s new QQL project, NFTs have become one of the main vehicles to access AI-powered art.  Generative art has been one of the quintessential machine-learning use cases, but only recently has the space achieved mainstream prominence. The leap has been mostly powered by computational gains and a new generation of techniques that can help models learn without requiring a lot of labeled datasets, which are incredibly limited and expensive to build. Even though the gap between the generative art community and AI research has been closing in the last few years, many of the new generative art techniques still haven’t been widely adopted by prominent artists, as it takes a while to experiment with these new methods.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  The generative art catalyzers  The rise of generative AI has come as a surprise even to many of the early AI pioneers who mostly saw this discipline as a relatively obscure area of machine learning. The impressive progress in generative AI can be traced back to three main factors:  Multimodal AI: In the last five years, we have seen an explosion of AI methods that can operate across different domains such as language, image, video or sound. This has enabled the creation of models like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion, which generate images or videos from natural language.  Pretrained language models: The emergence of multimodal AI has been accompanied by remarkable progress in language models with methods like GPT-3. This has enabled the use of language as an input mechanism to produce artistic outputs such as images, sounds or videos. Language has played a paramount role in this new phase of generative AI as it has lowered the barrier for people to interact with generative AI models.  Diffusion methods: Most of the photo-realistic art produced by AI methods that we see today is based on a technique called diffusion models. Prior to diffusion models coming onto the scene, the generative AI space was dominated by methods such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) or variational auto-encoders (VAE), which have trouble scaling and suffer from lack of diversity of generated outputs. Diffusion models address those limitations by following an unconventional approach of destroying the training data images until they are complete noise and reconstructing them back. The reasoning is that if a model is able to reconstruct an image from something that is, theoretically, noise, then it should be able to do it from pretty much any representation, including other domains like language. Not surprisingly, diffusion methods have become the foundation of text-to-image generation models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.  The influence of these methods in generative art has coincided with the emergence of another technology trend: NFTs, which have unlocked incredibly important capabilities for digital art such as digital ownership, programmable incentives and more democratized distribution models.  See also: Why NFT Artists Shouldn't Expect 'Royalties' | Opinion  The methods powering generative art in NFTs  Text to image: Text-to-image (TTI) synthesis has been the most popular area of generative AI within the NFT community. The TTI space has produced some AI models that are literally transcending into pop culture. OpenAI’s DALL-E has arguably become the best-known example of TTI used to generate artistic images. GLIDE is another TTI model created by OpenAI, which has been adopted in many generative art settings. Google has been dabbling into the generative art space, experimenting with different approaches such as Imagen, which is based on diffusion models, or Parti, which is based on a different technique called autoregressive models. Meta has also been cultivating the generative art community with models like Make-A-Scene. AI startups are making inroads in the TTI space as well with models like Midjourney gaining a vibrant community via its Discord distribution and Stability AI shocking the AI community by open sourcing Stable Diffusion.  From an NFT perspective, TTI models have seen the widest adoption because a disproportionate percentage of digital art collectibles today are represented as static images.  Text-to-video: Text-to-video(TTV) is a more challenging aspect of generative art but one in which we are seeing major progress. Meta and Google recently published TTV models such as Make-A-Video and Imagen Video, which can generate high-frame-fidelity video clips based on natural language. Video is one of the most active areas of research for generative art, and we should expect most image generation models to have video equivalents. Videos are still not as prominent in the NFT space as images, but this is likely to change as TTV models become more widely adopted by generative artists. Video is one of the areas that differentiates digital art from traditional art.  Read more: NFTs Can and Will Be So Much More | Opinion  Image-to-image: Image generation via textual inputs feels almost natural but has limitations when it comes to capturing aspects such as positions between different objects, orientation or even very specific details of scenery. Sketches or other images are a better mechanism to convey this information. Several of the top diffusion models such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion and Imagen all incorporate mechanisms for generating images from sketchers. Similarly, these models incorporate techniques such as in-painting or out-painting, which allow for extending images within or beyond their original borders.  Most of the best-established generative art practices focus on creating images from other images. Not surprisingly, several popular generative art NFT collections are based on variations of image-to-image methods.  Music generation: Automatic music generation has been another common use case in generative AI that has gained prominence over the last few years. OpenAI has also been at the forefront of this revolution with models including MuseNet and, more prominently, Jukebox, which is able to generate music in various styles and genres. Recently, Google entered the space with AudioLM, a model that creates realistic speech and piano music simply by listening to sound snippets. Stability AI-backed Harmonai started pushing the boundaries of the AI music generation space with the release of Dance Diffusion, a set of algorithms and tools that can generate original clips of music.  AI-generated music is one of the biggest areas in which NFTs can deliver unique value. Different from other art forms, music is distributed in digital form. Generative AI can evolve into a natural complement for music producers, and NFTs offer creators unique ways to express ownership in music clips or songs.  An enviable match: NFTs and generative art  Throughout the history of technology there have been several instances in which relatively different trends are able to influence each other to gain incredible market share. The most recent example is the social-mobile-cloud revolution in which each one of those trends expanded the market of the other two. Generative AI and NFTs are starting to exhibit a similar dynamic.

42413619,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlA8OU,1669048258,Bernstein Says Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Is Protected From Fallout at Sibling Company Genesis Global,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is drawing market attention after sister company Genesis Global Capital said its lending unit would halt customer withdrawals as a result of fallout from the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto empire, Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  The situation at Genesis, however, does not directly affect GBTC, the report said. Even if Genesis is unable to raise liquidity for its lending book and files for bankruptcy, creditors would have no claim on GBTC assets.  Grayscale Investments, which manages GBTC, and Genesis are both owned by Digital Currency Group (DCG), as is CoinDesk.  “GBTC’s trust structure protects its holders and remains ring-fenced from failures within DCG or DCG group entities,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  The market is concerned that Grayscale could be “considered for strategic options in case of catastrophe,” the note said. But DCG, even in the most adverse scenario, would prefer to hold onto Grayscale over Genesis, it said. Greyscale is DCG’s “flagship business and its cash cow,” generating around $300 million a year in fees, according to Bernstein.  GBTC currently trades at a massive 45% discount to the price of the underlying bitcoin (BTC), the note said, meaning investors are trapped in an investment vehicle they can exit only after a six-month lock-in period and with a significant discount.  GBTC is the largest bitcoin investment vehicle and holds more than $10.5 billion of BTC. DCG and its affiliates own about 10% of GBTC, the note added.

The bill would also require investors to inform the Capital Markets Authority – the government's financial regulator – on the details of their crypto ownership.  According to a report from the United Nations, roughly 8.5% of the Kenyan population, or 4.25 million people in that country, own cryptocurrencies.

Being hit with new selling pressure, the world’s second-largest crypto asset has plummeted by over 8%. Despite its recent pressure, the whales have become more intense on ETH. The crypto market is still red, with most crypto assets declining. The bearish trend from the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange is getting more intense. Most of the prominent crypto tokens have seen a drop in their performance. Notably, the broader crypto market is passing through some corrections. The cumulative market cap has plummeted by almost 5% over the past day. Related Reading: Assessing the Top-Performing Layer-1 Blockchain Protocols Whales Accumulate As Ethereum Drops According to data from Whale Alert, crypto whales are attracted by Ethereum’s new price drop. As a result, they are aggressively accumulating Ether. The report indicated that the whales had moved almost 400K ETH from several crypto exchanges. This figure shows that over $445 million has been transferred to many unknown wallets despite the price dip. The whales moved about 300K ETH worth almost $333 million from Upbit to several wallets. The whale tracker pointed out the most significant transaction involving the addition of a $129.1 million price of Ether from Upbit. Additionally, the tracker noted a whale accumulation of 99.99K ETH from the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The recorded transaction is worth about $12.4 million. The recent whale attention and accumulation are coming as Ethereum recorded a massive drop in its price. At the time of writing, ETH is hovering around $1,132, indicating a 1% drop within the past 24 hours. Also, the token has suffered a massive drop of more than 12% in its value over the past seven days. Its market cap is now at $137.57 billion. Ethereum’s trading volume has skyrocketed to over $11.9 billion in the last 24 hours. It indicated a more than 103% increase in a single day. ETH Liquidation Hits Almost $40 Million Records on liquidation over the past day are pretty on the higher side. As per Coinglass data, about 66,704 traders liquidated over $180 million of their positions in the crypto market within the past 24 hours. Ethereum seems to take a more considerable liquidated value from the overall amount. The data highlighted that the traders liquidated almost $40 million from Ethereum. About 85% of the liquidated value is from long positions.

Bitcoin Exchange Inflow CDD Has Spiked Up In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a large amount of dormant coins seem to have moved recently. The relevant indicator here is “Coin Days Destroyed” (CDD). A coin day is the amount that 1 BTC accumulates after staying still in a single address for 1 day. Whenever a coin that’s carrying some number of coin days finally shows movement, the coin day counter for it resets back to zero, and the coin days are said to be “destroyed.” The CDD metric measures the total number of these coin days being destroyed across the entire supply at any given time. Related Reading: Why Developing Nations Are Adopting Bitcoin as a Legal Tender A modified version of this indicator is the “exchange inflow CDD,” which tells us about the number of coin days being reset specifically because of transactions going into exchanges. Here is a chart showing the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the last few years: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in the last few days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD has spiked up to some pretty high values recently. This means that investors have been sending in a large number of coins to exchanges, particularly coins that had previously been sitting dormant since a long while. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Is Not At Risk Of Knocking $10,000 If Grayscale Increases Selling Pressure Also, it’s apparent from the graph that the latest levels of the indicator are the highest they have been since the spike back in July 2021, which occurred shortly before the bottom of the May-July mini-bear that year. Large exchange inflows can have bearish effects on the price as investors may be depositing to these platforms for selling purposes. Inflows from the long-term holders especially, who hold onto their coins for long periods and accumulate large number of coin days, could have noticeable consequences on the market since they are the cohort that’s least likely to sell at any point. Following this recent spike in Bitcoin exchange inflow CDD, the crypto’s price has observed a decline below the $16k level, suggesting that it may be the selling from these whales holding old coins that’s behind the dip. BTC Price At the the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16k, down 4% in the last week.

The problem Coinbase has is that its model doesn’t work. There doesn’t have to be fraud for you to lose money as a Coinbase shareholder. I think the Coinbase depositor is probably in OK shape. But again, there’s no deposit insurance here, although it’s in the United States. If Coinbase does something that they shouldn’t, depositors and people who are holding coins on the exchange would be at risk. Again, I don’t think they’re doing anything they shouldn’t, and there’s no evidence they’re doing anything they shouldn’t. Their problem is simply that they have a high cost model in a market that is about to compress their commission rates. And that’s a different story. Coinbase is still charging retail customers 1.3% of assets per trade, and so that’s a round trip of 2.7%, which means that if you make four trades a year with Coinbase that’s 10% of your capital. That’s a big, big drag. And they are charging institutions a fraction of that rate. So it’s only going to be a matter of time before Fidelity and Vanguard and everybody else who offers crypto trading is going to completely undercut Coinbase for the same basic services. They are simply an executing broker. There’s no advantage to being there versus another well respected site. So that’s number one. Number two, the bull case morphed this summer into “Don’t worry about the losses, they are going to get into a bigger institutional deal with their Blackrock deal.” And that took the stock from $50 to $100. The problem with that deal is that the institutional business is tiny, because the commission rates are so much smaller. So the vast majority of Coinbase’s revenues are still coming from retail traders, not institutions. They don’t make any money on the institutional business, and probably never will. That was fallacy number one. The funnier pivot was when the bulls told me “OK, commissions are probably going to be under pressure and costs are too high, but they’re going to stop paying their customers interest on cash balances."" Well OK, that’s fine, but how long can you get away with that, with not paying interest when everyone else — Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard — are going to be paying clients interest on their cash balances? That’s just a fundamental, basic expectation by customers. So if you have to bolster your P&L by doing that, you’ve got a problem. So Coinbase has a business model problem. It just doesn’t work.” In contrast to Chanos's views on Coinbase ( COIN ), Seeking Alpha contributor Ben Alaimo screened the stock as a Buy, saying the recent FTX implosion ""could be a Lehman Brothers opportunity."" The technical scope of Coinbase ( COIN ) stock, meanwhile, doesn't appear to be so pretty as well, coinciding with a broader market downturn that has persisted for much of the past year. What used to be a $200-$300 stock when it went public in April 2021, when digital asset prices were at their heights, is now just $41.45 at the time of writing, underscoring COIN's strong cyclicality with crypto market cycles. In May, SA's Quant system warned investors that COIN stock was at high risk of performing badly given negative EPS revisions and declining growth when compared with other financial stocks. Since that call, shares have plunged more than 33% , though bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) dropped 45% .

To date, AVAX TVL has gone up from 120.11 million to 123.7 million, an increase of approximately 3% as of press time. AVAX Daily, a Twitter account that monitors the Avalanche protocol, also posted this. An increase of 270,611,568 AVAX was reported in the latest update for TVL. The same was also supported by a chart created by DeFiLlama (chart below). It’s good that AVAX is making progress, but is it safe from external market factors that could set it back even further?

The relative strength index (RSI) and the stochastic relative strength index (Stoch RSI) values that CryptoQuant has been using indicate that AVAX is currently oversold. Investors and traders want to see these kinds of signs since they’re positive. However, there is always a dark side to every day, and no matter how bright the day may have begun, it will inevitably end in darkness. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) may be misleading investors and traders into buying AVAX too soon in hopes of a quick profit. The Bollinger band is currently exhibiting significant volatility. The current position of AVAX’s price on the lower half of the BB indicator may portend future price declines. At -0.17, Chaikin’s money flow indicator likewise demonstrates significant bearishness. This demonstrates that bears have total market control. At -87.56, the commodities channel index demonstrates strong bearishness. Strong correlations exist with the struggling crypto market leaders.

The price movement of BTC and ETH may also influence the price movement of AVAX, thus investors and traders should keep a close eye on them. Assuming Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to decline, a short position against the bear market is tempting at the current market price. But if the RSI trend reversal materializes, the $14 level will be an immediate target for bulls. Anything higher than that could result in a crunch zone in the Bollinger band, which could push the price down.

But it turns out that cryptocurrencies never actually went mainstream enough to pose a contagion risk to other asset classes. If the 2021 crypto rally had continued into this year, who knows, the asset class could have grown enough and become systemically entwined within the balance sheets of enough major players that the fall of FTX could have created a mass contagion. Originally posted on November 18, 2022 Over the past few years, we have heard a great deal about the supposed advantages of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. As all those varieties of pixelated coins inched ever closer from obscure back alleys to the wide boulevards of mainstream finance, the phrase “digital gold” was often invoked by cryptoworld’s growing legions of Silicon Valley evangelists and their A-list celebrity shills (""Digital Gold"", by the way, is also the name of an excellent book by Nathaniel Popper that traces the rise of bitcoin and the blockchain technology, written some time before the speculative mania took the jump into warp speed in 2020 - well worth reading if you want to understand the origin story). The idea that holding bitcoin or another digital currency could perform a gold-like hedge against adverse moves in the stock market took a resounding beating when the animal spirits pushing crypto and speculative tech shares to new heights both peaked around the same time - November 2021 - and went into a tandem spiral downward. Whoops. But there is a somewhat brighter corollary to the story: it turns out that, despite the best efforts of Matt Damon and Tom Brady and the like, cryptocurrencies never actually went mainstream enough to pose a contagion risk to other asset classes. Given what has happened to one of the biggest names in the sector over the past couple weeks, that really is something to give thanks for over the stuffing and cranberry sauce this year. SBF, the New JPM (Not) The recent fate of crypto exchange FTX ( FTT-USD ) and its once-illustrious founder Sam Bankman-Fried helpfully answers one question: is it possible for $32 billion to vanish into thin air in the space of two weeks? Why, yes it is! FTX was the third-largest crypto exchange in the business, and its leader, who of course was known by the cognoscenti as SBF, was not only one of the industry’s shining stars but also a prolific fundraiser and political mover and shaker (his fall from grace was very unwelcome news to a great many politicians, mostly Democrats, in Washington). FTX attracted as major investors the likes of Sequoia, one of the oldest and most respected Silicon Valley VC firms, and Temasek, the Singapore wealth management fund. Earlier this summer, when FTX intervened to bail out a handful of failing crypto players, there was talk comparing Bankman-Fried to the legendary financier J.P. Morgan, the founder of the eponymous bank who was a one-man Committee to Save the World during the Panic of 1907. That ended abruptly just one week ago, when a run on FTX by customers stampeding for the exit revealed that the exchange had liabilities of over $9 billion against assets of just $1 billion (and the money trail chicanery is way, way more complicated than that one simple asset-liability mismatch). It turned out that when SBF was running around trying to shore up other crypto exchanges, he was most likely doing this not out of some grand altruistic impulse but in a desperate effort to paper over his own financial black hole. In the end, he wound up looking less like J.P. Morgan and more like the Knickerbocker Trust Company, the overextended lender whose troubles started that whole Panic of 1907. Now For the Good News Over the past several years, we have grown increasingly concerned about the aggressive attempts by its main backers to push cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. This is not because we think the entire idea of digital currencies is worthless - far from it. The original bitcoin manifesto of Satoshi Nakamoto (who may or may not be an actual person and who may or may not be alive on the planet in the year 2022) and, even more so, the underlying blockchain technology do have some interesting aspects. The technology, in particular, can potentially perform certain financial operations in a more secure, less expensive and less intermediated manner than through traditional financial channels. And we do think that digital currencies - most likely through a mechanism operated by national central banks - will play an increasing role in the financial system in years to come. That being said, we never saw a compelling use case for bitcoin and its ilk to convince us that it was an appropriate asset class for the long-term investment portfolios under our stewardship as asset managers. Our view was increasingly challenged as more and more mainstream voices joined the chorus of crypto fandom. New vehicles emerged offering ever-easier ways to obtain exposure. Here’s one: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), the world’s largest crypto fund with a value (still!) of $10.5 billion. Greyscale Bitcoin Trust Yield - Last 3 Years (Author) Not a great look, as they say. Now, if the 2021 crypto rally had continued into this year, who knows, the asset class could have grown enough and become systemically entwined within the balance sheets of enough major players that the fall of FTX could have created a mass contagion. Within the crypto industry, the FTX debacle is being called crypto’s “Lehman moment.” When Lehman Brothers fell in 2008, it nearly brought down the entire financial system - because of all those overleveraged exposures on the balance sheets of so many major financial institutions. But the collateral damage from FTX is limited to the likes of Grayscale - bad news for those who drank Matt Damon’s Kool-Aid about investing in crypto being a feat equivalent to climbing Mount Everest or inventing the internal combustion engine, but not much more than another head-shaking tale of greed and gullibility for the rest of us.

ETH’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. ETH’s price looks weak as the price struggles to hold above $1,100, with the possibility of reclaiming the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) remaining bleak. The price action displayed by Ethereum (ETH) has remained disheartening, with the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weaker with each passing day, indicating that the bottom has not yet been reached, resulting in the price of many altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), battling for survival. The domino effect of the FTX saga and other large investors has brought the market to a halt, as the market has yet to make a significant move after the price of ETH performed well in previous weeks. Most altcoins have lost key support and have traded at a loss of more than 90%, with many hoping for a crypto revival. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Assessing the Top-Performing Layer-1 Blockchain Protocols Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The crypto space has seen a lot of turbulence in the last few days, with many altcoins struggling to show strength after losing key support that was holding off price declines. The current market uncertainty has caused traders and investors to be hesitant to purchase altcoins, as there is no guarantee that they will rise in value any time soon. The news of FTX and now Genesis has had a significant impact on the price of ETH, sending it into a spiral movement to a region of $1,150 as the price struggles to stay at $1,000. After the price of ETH closed below the weekly high of $1,200, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of ETH looking more bearish with the weekly open. Weekly resistance for the price of ETH – $1,300. Weekly support for the price of ETH – $1,000. Price Analysis Of ETH On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ETH remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades below the $1,200 resistance after bouncing off from the region of $1,100. With rumor building of a likely bankruptcy of Genesis, this could affect the price of ETH and other smaller assets, with the price facing a possibility of losing the region of $1,000. If the price of ETH breaks above $1,000, we could see more sell-off as this has been a temporary region to hold bears. Daily resistance for the ETH price – $1,200. Daily support for the ETH price – $1,000.

As a result, more of FTX’s investors and partners record massive losses with no potential recovery system. FTX filed for bankruptcy last week, but shocking revelations are now creeping out following its bankruptcy filing. A deeper examination of the crypto exchange disclosed that FTX operations have more than the eye could see with many coatings. Related Reading: MATIC Backpedals Into Bearish Track Despite Its Social Dominance FTX Inappropriate Governance Structures An examination of the FTX’s 30-page filing report indicates that the crypto exchange has inappropriate governance structures. A majority of the entities under the FTX Group, especially those in the Bahamas and Antigua, lack the right organizational lines in operation. For example, most of the branches do not have board members. Hence, they never held any board meetings. Also, the company has no comprehensive and proper record of its staff. There were no apparent records of the working period and responsibility for its contractors and employees. All attempts to compile a list of all the staff were futile since some couldn’t be contacted or located. No Proper Record for Customers’ Deposits Further discovery from FTX’s filing is that firm has no records of its users’ deposited tokens on its balance sheet. Hence, upon its insolvency, there’s no presentation of a balance for the deposited assets on the platform. Additionally, FTX Group firms use an unsecured group email account to store private keys to customers’ assets. The company has been using software to mask the inappropriate use of customers’ funds. Also, the firm’s digital assets have been under the control of the founders, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and Gary Wang. Approves Expenses Using Online Chats Further examination indicated that FTX has no proper disbursement control system. Instead, the firm’s staff uses online chats to submit expense requests and the managers and supervisors approve such using personalized emojis. Lots of the organizational decisions were conveyed through chats. Also, SBF, co-founder and former CEO of the company, encouraged the staff to communicate with apps where messages were auto-deleted after a while. So, the firm has no permanent records of all decisions made. Also, the crypto exchange has no cash management system. As a result, it is impossible to ascertain the amount of cash at hand at any point in time. FTX has no accurate record of its bank accounts and signatories without a centralised cash control system. As a result, the firm felt less concerned over the creditworthiness of its banking partners.

Part of the shocking discovery on FTX is that the executives have been misappropriating customers’ funds. They acquired homes and other personal properties for top executives without proper documentation. They made the purchases of such properties under the employees’ names.

The slide in Bitcoin has put pressure on ETFs tied to the cryptocurrency space. Here are a few individual names being impacted: Bitcoin Strategy ETFs: Bitcoin Strategy funds such as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( NYSEARCA: BITO ), Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( NASDAQ: BTF ) and the VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( XBTF ) have trended lower on Monday as all three funds use Bitcoin futures contracts to price the underlying ETF.

The agreement will allow Celo to make use of ConsenSys’ Infura infrastructure. Celo developers will be able to build with Infura, which will help make the blockchain more scalable. Developers will also be able to deploy Ethereum-based decentralized applications (dapps) built with Truffle. Truffle is a development environment where Ethereum smart contracts can be tested.  “Developers can use Infura’s trusted and complementary tooling to seamlessly communicate with the Celo blockchain for rapid deployment and scaling” said Xochitl Cazador, Celo's head of ecosystem growth. The integration will also allow for developers to transact between Celo and other DeFi platforms and dapps.  In addition, the partnership is intended to kick off Celo’s compatibility with MetaMask, a popular Ethereum-based wallet. Celo will also join the Ethereum Climate Platform that ConsenSys launched last week.  Last year, ConsenSys announced that over 350,000 builders were using the Infura Infrastructure. In 2021, Polygon, an Ethereum scaling project, also started supporting Infura tooling.  Celo in January introduced cREAL, a stablecoin pegged to Brazil's local currency, the real.  “This partnership supports the Celo ecosystem’s mission by providing reliable, easy-to-use tooling for developers to build and scale their dapps on the Celo blockchain,” Cazador told CoinDesk. “We are one step closer to mainstream adoption of web3 and realizing its full potential to transform lives by regenerating global ecologies and empowering local economies.”  Read more: Mobile-First Blockchain Celo Launches Stablecoin Tied to Brazilian Real  CORRECTION (Nov. 21, 14:39 UTC): Celo's cREAL was introduced in January 2022.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/21/mobile-focused-blockchain-celo-partners-with-ethereum-software-firm-consensys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db44f4d0375161c4a71f5e0334c7b1b1ea730406-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Despite widespread doom and gloom, Polkadot native coin, DOT, has become the most discussed cryptocurrency in the community. Still, that’s not the end of the good news. A recent tweet by @PolkadotInsider explained how Polkadot has more active developers than Ethereum. This demonstrates the ecosystem’s widespread appeal within the cryptocurrency sector as Polkadot is able to secure the top top spot in terms of development activity this month. However, the question of whether or not DOT is a solid buy in the present needs to be addressed. In the meantime, with this decent achievement – is it a good time to go long on the crypto?

All expectation of a DOT-beneficial relief rally in the near future has been dashed. DOT’s value has decreased significantly over all time frames, but it has lost 23.7% in the past two weeks, as measured by CoinGecko. Image: TradingView As of right now, the token is selling for $5.15, which is a loss. Correlations with Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, show that its price is tracking the market as a whole. This could result in a catastrophe for DOT. If its association with BTC and ETH continues to decline, it will be dragged down with them. As of the time of writing, the correlation between DOT and both ETH and BTC is 0.96, indicating that it will definitely move in the same direction as ETH and BTC. RSI readings are also declining, with the indicator moving into the oversold region. The fact that the token’s price has never risen above the 50s portends a bleak outlook for its immediate future. DOT is a DON’T Purchase, For Now The downtrend is backed by lower lows and lower highs, as well as a widening Bollinger band, which indicates increased market volatility in the immediate future. In the following days, the EMA ribbon provides a convincing signal for short positions as the price continues to decline. As prices decline, short positions would be the most profitable strategy for investors and traders in this bear market. As the price approaches the 161.80 Fibonacci retracement level, investors and traders with a buy-low, sell-high mentality should be cautious, as a near-term rally is unlikely. Even with the good development activity and social activity of the ecosystem, these will not be sufficient if the market as a whole is in recession.

4582946,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509521,1669037852,Billionaire Bill Ackman Touts Altcoins Helium (HNT) And DIMO – Why?,"Another billionaire shilling another shitcoin or a good advice on a legitimate crypto project with strong fundamentals? This is the question crypto investors are likely to ask about a recent thread about Helium (HNT) and DIMO by billionaire Bill Ackman. Ackman is an American billionaire, investor and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management who has been rather critical of cryptocurrencies in the past. In his new Twitter thread, however, he does an about-face. “The telephone, the internet, and crypto share one thing in common. Each technology improves on the next in terms of its ability to facilitate fraud,” Ackman said, and continued: I was initially a crypto skeptic, but after studying some of the more interesting crypto projects, I have come to believe that crypto can enable the formation of useful businesses and technologies. The telephone, the internet, and crypto share one thing in common. Each technology improves on the next in terms of its ability to facilitate fraud. As such, I was initially a crypto skeptic, but after studying some of the more interesting crypto projects, I have come to — Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) November 20, 2022 Helium And DIMO, Not Bitcoin And Ethereum To support his thesis, however, Ackman did not necessarily pick the most popular and well-known cryptocurrencies. Not Bitcoin or Ethereum, but Helium and DIMO are his dubious picks. According to him, the two examples show that cryptocurrencies can have “intrinsic value” and are not a version of a “modern version of tulip mania.” Related Reading: Ethereum Founder Buterin Says ‘Something Important Is About To Happen’ In Cryptic Tweet Helium, Ackam says, is creating a global Wi-Fi network that “will be used by Lime and others to track devices around the world, as well as for other purposes that benefit from access to global Wi-Fi networks.” Ackman also points out that the Helium network already comprises 974,000 hotspots set up by individuals to mine the HNT token. On the intrinsic value of the HNT token, Ackam writes that it comes from its usage. Customers of the network need to buy and burn HNT, he says, creating “a two-sided market for HNT” in which miners buy hotspots and deploy them around the world to earn tokens. Users, in turn, buy HNT tokens to use the network. The more demand for the network, the more demand for HNT. Given HNT’s ultimately finite supply, the balance between supply and demand yields a market price . As such, HNT becomes a valued commodity whose price is determined by supply and demand. The choice of Helium is more than shady, as the crypto project recently flaunted fake partnerships. Both the partnership with Lime (as cited by Ackman) and a partnership with Salesforce were merely made up by the Helium team, who placed their logos under the partnerships section on its website. Remarkably, that claim has been denied by both companies. DIMO is an even lesser-known altcoin than Helium’s HNT. Ackman describes the crypto project as a pioneer in the automotive space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles As More Bearish Signs Appear; Can Bulls Defend $15,500? “DIMO collects valuable automotive data from data ports in cars. It allows car owners to mint tokens by collecting data from their own cars. The data is valuable to the car owner as well as car manufacturers, suppliers, insurers, municipalities, etc.,” Ackman wrote. The billionaire revealed that he is a small investor in DIMO, but not in Helium. Overall, his crypto investments account for less than 2% of his assets. Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor was quick to question Ackman’s choice and suggested that the killer app for crypto is money as the best engineered network is Bitcoin. Ackman, for his part, has not answered Saylor what he thinks about BTC. The killer app for crypto is money, and the best engineered crypto network to serve as money is #Bitcoin. It is economically, technically, & ethically superior to everything else, so I suggest you study Satoshi's protocol & Bitcoin's provenance before making major commitments. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) November 20, 2022",POSITIVE,BTC | HNT,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | HNT,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/crypto/billionaire-bill-ackman-touts-altcoins-helium-hnt-and-dimo-why/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/4582946.jpeg

The fraudster has converted his ETH stash to Bitcoin. In his operations last week, The attacker converted all his stolen stablecoins to Ethereum, leading to a whopping amount of ETH worth $288 million. With data from Etherscan, Colin Wu, a crypto journalist, reported on the hacker. Wu stated that the FTX hacker with address (0x59…d32b) is converting a massive ETH holding to BTC. As of Sunday, the hacker exchanged about 30,000 ETH into RenBTC. Subsequently, he later transferred 1,070 BTC to the Bitcoin network. Ethereum Price Decline Following the recent selling pressure on Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency has now dropped in performance. Some experts think continuing the trend could push the price of Ether below the $1K level. The broader crypto market is experiencing a correction as its dips by over 5% in a single day. Subsequently, the cumulative market cap has moved below the $800 billion region. At the time of writing, the value is $793.82 billion.

4580175,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509524,1669033217,Assessing the Top-Performing Layer-1 Blockchain Protocols,"Crypto technology has made incredible advancements over the past few years, and now the blockchain protocol industry is extremely competitive. As gains have been made with speed, scaling, and power consumption, the promise of Web3 and the growth of a blockchain-based internet are beginning to redefine possibilities in tech. With Bitcoin, blockchain technology was first introduced as a financial tool for creating and managing cryptocurrency. It quickly evolved into programmable money and smart contracts after the launch of Ethereum. Now blockchain aims to counter the centralization of all databases, storage, and computation to support innovative new dapps and services. As the industry matures from a predominant focus on financial products to become a revolutionary decentralized technology stack for Web3, a handful of key metrics are useful for comparing and assessing layer-1 competitors: transaction throughput, finality, transaction cost, energy efficiency, and on-chain storage cost. This article presents a review of those metrics from leading protocols sourced from public datasets and real-time dashboards to give a clear and comparative picture of the level at which these chains currently operate. Transaction Throughput In order for blockchain networks to attract users, they must be able to provide an experience that meets the expectations of today’s web users and do so in a scalable manner. This means delivering speedy website and application screen loads (read operations) and moderately fast data writes. Most blockchains perform well enough on read operations, but layer-1 protocols can struggle to scale their data writes such that they can accommodate millions of users and still provide a good user experience. Throughput is a measure that captures the scalability of a network — the ability of a blockchain to write data and update state for millions and billions of web users and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In order to provide a satisfactory user experience for mainstream internet users, a blockchain needs to be able to process thousands of transactions per second. Only Solana and the Internet Computer demonstrate actual transaction speeds that accomplish this feat, though most of Solana’s transactions are vote transactions by validators. Vote transactions don’t exist on other chains; the SolanaFM explorer puts Solana’s true TPS at about 381. Other chains either haven’t generated the traffic required to demonstrate high throughput or are technically incapable of achieving high throughput. Finality Finality refers to the average amount of time that passes between the proposal of a new valid block containing transactions until the block has been finalized and its content is guaranteed to not be reversed or modified. (For some blockchains, like Bitcoin, determining the moment of finality can only be probabilistic.) This metric also affects the user experience, as users are unlikely to use applications that require more than a few seconds to complete an operation. Transaction Costs Blockchain has its roots as a financial product that can provide much lower transaction costs than traditional finance, and that can execute transactions faster. High transaction costs have shaped the way we use the internet and monetize content. Due to these costs, content creators and applications tend to prefer larger transaction value models, such as subscriptions or bulk purchases of content. Transaction costs are typically correlated in some way to the value of their associated network tokens, so the following values are current as of writing during the week of Nov. 14, 2022. Cheaper transaction costs can support the development of new revenue models for websites and applications, such as micro-transaction models like tipping. For these types of models to emerge, the transaction costs of the blockchain must be a fraction of the expected average transaction value. Energy Efficiency Industries around the world are working on becoming more sustainable in the face of climate change. Energy efficiency has also become a major area of focus within the crypto sector, where it can also be viewed as a measure of a blockchain’s ability to execute and, by extension, scale. Improving the efficiency of a blockchain not only decreases the carbon footprint of the technology stack, but also reduces the energy costs associated with the protocol. Networks that are more energy efficient, and the applications that are built on top of them, will have an advantage in an increasingly competitive market. On-Chain Storage Cost On-chain storage has been a persistent challenge for blockchains, which generally have difficulty scaling to meet the demands of consumer-facing applications that require substantial data hosting. This has forced many developers to rely on Web2 intermediaries for storage and frontends, compromising security, resilience, and decentralization. The Internet Computer was found to have the lowest and most stable cost for on-chain data storage among top-performing L1’s. “Gas” takes the form of “cycles,” with 1 trillion cycles pegged to 1 XDR (equivalent to $1.31 at time of writing). Developers convert ICP into cycles to pay for data usage, with 1 GB per month requiring 329B cycles equaling $0.423 — equating to $5.07 per GB per year. The cost of data storage on L1 protocols typically fluctuates with the value of their associated network token, with the expense going up along with the token’s value and vice versa. Solana’s rent per byte-year is 0.00000348 SOL at time of writing, which comes to 3,477.69 SOL rent per GB per year. At SOL’s current price of $13.99, this equals a rate of $48,652. Cardano cannot currently store non-financial data such as media files, and stores all transactions permanently. For simplicity, we skip the computational cost associated with processing the transaction. At a price of $0.32 at time of writing, the cost of storing 1GB of transactions depends on the size of each transaction, with 2 million transactions of 500 bytes each resulting in 354,708 ADA ($113,506.56), and 62,500 transactions of 16 KB each equaling 53,236.08 ADA ($17,035.54) representing the lowest fee-per-byte. Avalanche has a gas price of about 25 NanoAVAX, with 32 bytes fetching roughly 0.0005 AVAX. For simplicity, we skip the gas costs of smart contract code execution and of allocating the storage and instead only consider the bare minimum cost of SSTORE operations. This makes storing 1GB of data cost about 15,625 AVAX. AVAX is $13.24 at time of writing, which comes to $206,875. Ethereum’s congestion and high cost has inspired the push toward on-chain efficiency, and it still sets the expense bar. For simplicity, we skip the gas costs of smart contract code execution and of allocating the storage and instead only consider the bare minimum cost of SSTORE operations. The network consumes 20K gas units to perform SSTORE operation on 32 bytes of data. By extension, it costs 625B gas units for 1 GB of data. With the average gas cost of 20.23 Gwei at the time of writing, that comes to 12.64375T Gwei, or 12,643.75 ETH. With ETH at $1,225.46 at the time of writing, this equals $15,494,409. Conclusion As the blockchain industry evolves into a next-generation technology stack capable of reopening the consumer internet, only a handful of platforms have the technical specifications necessary to provide the user experiences expected from the majority of the internet’s users. Top-performing layer-1 networks will enable the development of applications and services that are not possible, including revolutionary functionality in the areas of security, micro-transactions, and decentralized ownership of data and applications.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://newsbtc.com/all/assessing-the-top-performing-layer-1-blockchain-protocols/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

4579162,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509505,1669031562,Curve Finance Sheds 31% Of Value In Last 30 Days – Are Things Really Bad For CRV?,"The price of Curve Finance’s native token, CRV, has been falling precipitously in recent weeks as the bears have pounced. The present bear market has been relentless in its assault on traders and investors. As the FTX crisis continues to weigh on the cryptocurrency market as a whole, prominent cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to continue to feel the pain. Given the strong relationship between CRV and ETH, the latter is likely to suffer further declines in the near future. Related Reading: MATIC Backpedals Into Bearish Track Despite Its Social Dominance Latest Numbers: Steady Drop In Value According to CoinGecko’s numbers, the coin’s value has been steadily decreasing over the past few months, with the monthly time frame showing the most dramatic drop of 43 percent since January. In the last month, CRV has lost 31% of its value. The on-chain analysis tool provided by CoinMarketCap is also showing red, suggesting that a powerful bear is currently controlling the token’s market circumstances. Chart: TradingView In addition, CRV is trading at a loss of $0.5048 right now. According to the technical indicators, widespread pessimism about the state of the market has set hold. Since CRV’s near $1 breakout, the RSI has not gone above 55. The token’s negative price trend can also be explained by its close relationship with ETH. Both cryptocurrencies are highly correlated at 0.94 at this time. This implies that CRV’s price would fall in tandem with ETH’s if the latter’s fortunes worsened. Will Curve Recover In The Coming Days? The expansion of the Bollinger band indicates a significant increase in price volatility. This is a strong indicator on its own, but when combined with other variables, it may portend a further price decline in the coming days. This is supported by the trendline and multiple candles indicating a strong downward swing for CRV. Triple EMA numbers on the 20- and 30-day timeframes also indicate bearish strength. However, the situation reverses on longer durations. This could be an indication that CRV will be fine in the long run. However, this is extremely unlikely because not only has the price of CRV decreased, but so has the TVL of the protocol. According to DeFiLlama, the TVL decreased from $6.49 billion on November 7, prior to the FTX collapse, to $3.98 billion today. This is accompanied by a trading volume peaking at approximately $3.52 billion. Curve will narrowly escape the current bear market crisis, if that is any consolation. However, investors and traders who anticipate enormous gains in the near future from this cryptocurrency should abandon such expectations. A short position at the current market price would balance the price action and generate some extra income.

Sam Bankman-Fried's multibillion-dollar crypto enterprise filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. on Nov. 11 after a liquidity crunch set off by a CoinDesk article led to its collapse.  On Monday, Cunliffe said that crypto needs to be regulated in the U.K. to protect consumers and investors, ensure financial stability and enable innovation. Cunliffe has previously called for existing financial regulations to be extended to cover crypto.  Legislation now being considered in Parliament would set up regulations for crypto as financial instruments and give U.K. regulators – including the BoE – more control over the sector. If the bill becomes law, the BoE would regulate firms that issue stablecoins, which are digital tokens whose value is pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar.  The central bank will kick off a consultation on stablecoins next year that will look at ""the requirements for corporate structure, governance, accountability and transparency necessary"" to meet the standards expected in other parts of the financial system, Cunliffe said on Monday.  ""The FTX example underlines how important these aspects are,"" he said.  The BoE has also been exploring issuing a digital pound. Its work on a ""digitally native pound"" is driven by trends in payments, Cunliffe said, ""including the reducing role of cash, and more generally in the increasing digitalization of daily life.""  ""Our approach as regulators should be open – by which I mean we should be prepared to explore whether and if so how the necessary level of assurance equal to that in conventional finance could be attained. But we should also be firm that where it cannot, we are not prepared to see innovation at the cost of higher risk,"" Cunliffe said.

Referring to rumors of a possible bankruptcy of Genesis Trading and its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), Buterin wrote that “I’m hearing through the grapevine that something important is about to happen.” Buterin did not go into further detail, going on to say, “please recognize the fact that my elite social connections to people who are early to know things make me cool, and please help me validate my self-image of coolness.” I'm hearing through the grapevine that something important is about to happen. Please recognize the fact that my elite social connections to people who are early to know things make me cool, and please help me validate my self-image of coolness. — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 21, 2022 Is Ethereum Founder Buterin Just Trolling? At first glance, Buterin caused a lot of confusion with his tweet. But, calm down! Buterin is not the next FUD spreader warning of a collapse of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) in the wake of the Genesis / DCG rumors. The probability that Buterin indeed wanted to ring the alarm bell with this tweet seems rather low. Apparently, Buterin is just trolling Paul Graham, who in turn was scattering rumors, citing a supposed source. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Dives 8%, Why ETH Might Soon Test $1K Graham, who sold his company Viaweb to Yahoo in 1998 and then got richer by investing the money in other startups through his company Y Combinator, tweeted about a trusted source. The anonymous source said he is convinced that the cryptocurrency industry will experience “systemic risk” in the near future. Graham tweeted: A person I have known for more than ten years, who I consider trustworthy, is convinced the cryptocurrency economy will shortly experience a systemic risk. I don’t know anything concrete, but if I were exposed, I would be concerned. The Last Word Is Not Yet Spoken As Bitcoinist reported today, there are currently numerous rumors circulating about a possible insolvency of Genesis Trading, which in turn could send industry giant DCG into bankruptcy. For all the doom and gloom, however, this is far from the last word. Genesis is currently looking for capital, until today (Monday). Should it not be able to raise enough cash, DCG might have to step in and sell a large part of its liquid funds and assets from its portfolio. However, only if all other efforts and options fail, DCG is likely to liquidate its golden goose, Grayscale. Related Reading: Bitcoin Struggles As More Bearish Signs Appear; Can Bulls Defend $15,500?

42413640,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADFi,1669028972,"New FTX CEO Paid $1,300 an Hour, Court Filings Show","John Ray, a seasoned expert brought in to tidy up the wreckage of collapsed crypto exchange FTX, is billing $1,300 per hour for his work, court documents filed on Sunday show.  Restructuring experts are seeking to carry on paying senior staff wages, despite a freeze on company funds and a lack of clear records about who is owed what. Legal documents filed over the weekend at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ahead of the first hearing on Tuesday shed more light on the insolvency proceedings.  FTX’s fortunes collapsed rapidly following a Nov. 2 revelation by CoinDesk that the company had blurred the lines with supposedly independent trading arm Alameda Research. The exchange may have left as many as 1 million creditors, including crypto users who have been unable to withdraw funds from their accounts.  The continued payment of salaries “is necessary for the preservation of the resources and value"" of the FTX estate, said the filing by Edgar Mosley, managing director at restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal.  Read More: Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle  “Without it, I believe that even more employees may seek alternative employment opportunities … likely, diminishing stakeholder confidence in the debtors’ ability to successfully reorganize,"" he said.  Payments made to Ray – as well as those made at a rate of $975 per hour to Chief Administrative Officer Kathryn Schultea, Chief Financial Officer Mary Cilia and Chief Information Officer Raj Perubhatla – are “critical to maintaining and administering"" what remains of the company as it tries to unwind its debts in an orderly way, Mosley said.  The filing also cites non-employee directors hired to ensure proper governance during the insolvency process. Those directors are charging a fee of $50,000 per month plus expenses.  Though eye catching, the fees may be small potatoes in the pricey world of corporate restructuring. In the low millions per year, Ray’s salary would represent just a fraction of the $3.1 billion FTX owes to its principal creditors, the $2 billion it cost to unwind Lehman Brothers, as reported in 2010, or the $21 billion that Ray’s predecessor Sam Bankman-Fried could at one time claim as his personal fortune.  Mosley also recommends continuing to pay as much as $17.5 million to critical contractors. Without the contractors, the company could see crypto assets hacked or stolen. The assets, then, could end up being beyond the reach of the bankruptcy court.  But determining who are the key suppliers is complicated because of FTX’s cavalier attitude to record-keeping. Ray has criticized the exchange's records as the worst he’s ever seen in his 40-year restructuring career, including for the failed energy company Enron.  FTX is still having trouble identifying who was on its payroll, complicating efforts to pay as much as $1 million in back pay. Ray has also criticized practices such as FTX purchasing Bahamas real estate for staff using company funds.

42413650,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlADMG,1669022799,"Coinbase, MicroStrategy Bonds Tank as FTX Collapse Dents Institutional Confidence in Crypto","Bonds issued by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) and by MicroStrategy (MSTR), a business-intelligence company and investor in bitcoin, have slumped as investor confidence in the industry slid in the wake of FTX's collapse.  Coinbase's bond due 2031 has dropped 15% this month to 50 U.S. cents on the dollar, according to data source Finra-Morningstar, sending the yield – which moves in the opposite direction to price – to a record high 13.5%. The decline comes after nearly three months of consolidation and marks an extension of the bearish trend seen early this year. The yield on the company's bond due in 2026 jumped to 17%.  Bonds tied to MicroStrategy have taken a similar beating. On Friday, the yield on the company's 2028 notes, issued last year to finance bitcoin (BTC) accumulation, climbed to 13.35% as the price dropped to a record 72.5 cents on the dollar. MicroStrategy holds about 130,000 BTC worth approximately $2.08 billion on its balance sheet.  The companies' bonds carry a premium of around 1,000 basis points – or 10 percentage points – to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield, as of Friday. In traditional markets, a premium of that level is taken to represent credit stress. The 10-year Treasury was yielding 3.80% at press time.  ""High bond yields are reflective of sharply higher rates but also of genuine skepticism about the long-term viability of crypto amongst institutional investors after the high profile collapses of Terra/LUNA, Celsius [Network], 3AC [Three Arrows Capital], Voyager [Digital], BlockFi and FTX,"" Mike Alfred, a value investor and founder of digital assets investment platform Eaglebrook Advisors, said.  Rich Rosenblum, co-founder of crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, said the uptick in bond yields represents heightened credit risk.  ""Especially for Coinbase, there is an argument that it benefits from FTX’s demise, solidifying their position in the U.S. So the narrative is improving on a micro level, whereas the crypto credit environment has deteriorated,"" Rosenblum told CoinDesk.  The Sam Bankman-Fried-founded digital assets exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, triggering concern of a market-wide contagion. Prominent venture capital firm Multicoin, one of the many exposed to FTX, told investors its net performance had dropped 55% this month and said FTX's collapse would wipe out many firms in the coming weeks, according to CNBC.  ""Those bond yields were actually the first sign of weakness in the space. It was the canary in the coal mine, a sign of stress in the crypto space even before all the blowups this year,"" Darius Sit, founder and chief investment officer at crypto options trading firm QCP Capital, said. Sit said his firm would monitor the yields as a ""possible leading sign of recovery.""  While Coinbase may be insulated from direct fallout of the FTX collapse, its vulnerability to other adverse effects, such as reduced trading levels, may make investing in Coinbase bonds or stocks unappealing. That's certainly what many in the investor community seem to be thinking.  Last week, Goldman Sachs maintained a sell rating on Coinbase shares and slashed its 12-month price target to $41 from $49, saying that once FTX-induced volatility subsides, the lower level of crypto prices and the potential for reduced investor confidence will weigh on trading volumes. Shares in Coinbase have dropped 31% this month, ending Friday at $45.26.  ""If you have capital at Coinbase – do your counterparty risk assessment now,"" Lawrence McDonald, the author of the popular Bear Traps report, tweeted on Sunday after noting the spike in bond yields and the share-price decline.  Some investors believe bonds tied to Coinbase and MicroStrategy are a safer way to bet on a crypto bull revival. While that's true, bonds are likely to underperform spot bitcoin.  ""Bonds are a safer route since usually there is some recovery, even in the event of bankruptcy. But the upside is also far more muted,"" GSR's Rosenblum noted.  UPDATE (Nov. 21, 9:54 UTC): Adds FTX collapse, investor comments, Goldman Sachs report on Coinbase below chart.

BTC’s price continues to look bearish with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. BTC’s price looks weak as the price struggles to hold above $16,000, with the possibility of reclaiming the daily 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) remaining bleak. The price action displayed by Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to look disheartening, with the FTX effect affecting small crypto projects like Genesis as the market continues to look weak on each passing day signifying the bottom is not yet in leading to the price of many altcoins, including Bitcoin (BTC), battling for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market has yet to make a major move after previous weeks saw the price of Bitcoin (BTC) perform well. Most altcoins have lost their key support and have traded with over 90% loss, with many hoping for a crypto revival. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Ethereum Price Dives 8%, Why ETH Might Soon Test $1K Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. FTX and now Genesis news has had a huge impact on the price of BTC, sending the price into a spiral movement to a region of $15,500 as the price bounced off this region with what looked like a temporary demand zone to hold off a big sell-off. After the price of BTC closed below the weekly high of $17,000, there are high chances of the market going lower, with the prices of BTC looking more bearish with the weekly open. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $17,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $15,500. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BTC remains considerably weak in the daily timeframe as the price trades below the $16,500 resistance after bouncing off from the region of $15,500. With rumor building of a likely bankruptcy of Genesis, this could affect the price of BTC and other smaller assets, with the price facing a possibility of losing the region of $15,500. If the price of BTC breaks above $15,500, we could see more sell-off as this has been a temporary region to hold bears. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $17,500.

Celsius' motion, approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York last week, requires customers to submit proofs of claim on or before Jan. 3, 2023. Any person or entity – including individuals, partnerships, corporations, joint ventures and trusts – are free to file a claim via mail, by hand or through the claims agent Stretto's website.  Read more: Celsius' Crypto Customers Face Big Obstacle in Trying to Claw Back Their Deposits  Following a liquidity crunch that rattled the industry earlier this year, crypto lending platform Celsius Network filed for bankruptcy in July, just weeks after freezing customer withdrawals. The lender filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy which allows it to reorganize while continuing operations.  Earlier this month, Celsius requested the New York-based court to extend its deadline for submitting the platform's reorganization plan.  Customers of the bankrupt lender do not need to submit a proof of claim if it falls into a number of categories listed in the legal document, including if any claims had already been paid by what remains of the company and if a similar form had already been filed with the clerk of the bankruptcy court in New York.  Celsius shared further instructions on how to file a claim on its official Twitter account on Sunday, and said its next hearing is scheduled for Dec. 5.

Polygon bears are in control and might aim more losses towards $0.70 in the near term. MATIC price started a major decline from well above $0.95 against the US dollar. The price is trading below $0.85 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.821 on the 4-hours chart of the MATIC/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to decline towards the $0.70 support zone in the near term. Polygon’s MATIC Price Dives Earlier this month, polygon’s price made an attempt to gain pace above the $1.0 resistance zone. However, MATIC struggled to gain bullish momentum for a move above $1.0. A high was formed near $0.972 before the price started a fresh decline. There was a steady decline, similar to bitcoin and ethereum. The bears were able to push the price below the $0.90 support zone and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Finally, the price broke a major support at $0.840 and traded as low as $0.7748. It is now consolidating losses near the $0.800 level. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.8210 zone. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.821 on the 4-hours chart of the MATIC/USD pair. The trend line is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.972 swing high to $0.7748 low. The first major resistance is forming near the $0.875 zone. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.972 swing high to $0.7748 low. Source: MATICUSD on TradingView.com The main resistance is now forming near the $1.00 level. If there is an upside break above the $0.90 and $1.00 resistance levels, the price could start another strong increase. In the stated case, the price could rise steadily towards the $1.20 level. More Losses? If MATIC price rise above the $0.82 and $0.87 resistance levels, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $0.780 level. The main support is near the $0.750 level. A downside break below the $0.750 level could open the doors for a fresh decline towards $0.70. The next major support is near the $0.665 level.

In a tweet thread, Bill Ackman said he likes Helium, a decentralized Wi-Fi mesh network. Helium has been accused of using fraudulent endorsements from tech giants like Salesforce and mobility company Lime to give its network legitimacy, while also reportedly exaggerating its relationship with DISH Network, which it claimed would grant it access to its 5G spectrum.  As for Helium’s tokenomics, reporting from Forbes shows that the network has a checkered history of favoring its founders and insiders, while also using fake clients to increase its payout of tokens.  In September, the Helium community voted by a large margin to replace its blockchain with Solana, and promising to integrate Helium onto the SOL phone. Despite Solana's downtrend, Helium's founder has pledged to stick with Solana.  “Despite crypto’s ability to facilitate fraud, with the benefit of sensible regulation and oversight, crypto technology’s potential for beneficent societal impact may eventually compare with the impact of the telephone and internet on the economy and society,” Ackman tweeted.  After examining a number of “interesting crypto projects,” Ackman said that he began to “understand how a token could build intrinsic value over time” and evolve past the speculative nature of a modern-day “tulip mania.”  “Over time, a two-sided market for HNT [Helium’s token] develops in which miners buy hotspots and deploy them around the globe to earn tokens. Users, in turn, purchase HNT tokens in order to use the network. The more demand for the network, the more demand for HNT,” Ackman tweeted.  Except, HNT is down nearly 95% during the last year, according to CoinGecko data. The token now trades for $2.23.  Average daily earnings per hotspot are now at 0.06 HNT, or 13 cents, according to HeliumTracker.io with hotspots ranging in price from $200-$400.  Helium Board, another HNT tracker, shows that top earners on the platform are bringing in 2.4-2.6 HNT a day, or less than $6. Eager Orchid Whale, one of the top earners according to Helium Board, has a network of 155 hotspots that power his daily earnings of 2.48 HNT ($5.48).  Aside from endorsing Helium, Ackman said he owns a stake in ORIGYN Foundation, a relatively unknown project that makes vague references to non-fungible tokens (NFT) on its site and says it “unites industry leaders from art, luxury, media, entertainment, sports and more with token holders.”  He also said he has a position in Goldfinch Finance, a lending platform that says it pays 17% on USDC deposits, with nearly $100 million in active loan value despite only $100,000 in monthly protocol revenue.  “Goldfinch yields come from real-world lending, and investments are collateralized off-chain, which makes them distinctly different from the highly volatile [decentralized finance] lending you might be familiar with,” the site reads.

The price is now trading below $1,150 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could correct losses, but there is a risk of more downsides towards $1,000. Ethereum Price Takes Hit Ethereum price attempted an upside break above the $1,250 resistance, similar to bitcoin. ETH struggled to gain momentum and reacted to the downside below $1,200. There was a break below the $1,180 and $1,170 support levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,210 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The price gained bearish momentum and declined below the $1,150 level. Finally, there was a spike below the $1,120 level and the price traded as low was $1,108. Ether price is now trading below $1,150 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.

The language has been modified accordingly.  Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin slumped nearly 3%, but held well above its recent $16K support; other major cryptos dive more deeply.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Cryptos Take a Late Weekend Plunge  By James Rubin  Four days before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, crypto markets decided they didn't have much for which to be thankful.  Bitcoin was recently down 2.8% over the past 24 hours (UTC), although it managed to hold snugly above its most recent $16,000 support for a 12th consecutive day. Last week, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization weathered the cascade of misadventures tied to crypto exchange FTX's collapse, although Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk that investors should gird themselves for a rocky week ahead.  ""The last week saw bitcoin trading in a very tight range, unable to breach $17K conclusively,"" DiPasquale wrote. ""However, given the sideways action, we can expect volatility in the coming week.""  Ether was recently trading below its most recent $1,200 support and was down over 6% from Saturday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value has plummeted almost 10% from its high of $1,275 last week. Other major cryptos dove deeply into the red with sports fan coin CHZ plunging more than 14%. CHZ and fan tokens for national soccer teams had been on an upswing recently amid euphoria for the World Cup, which kicked off Sunday with Ecuador defeating the host nation Qatar.  Popular meme coin DOGE, and Crypto.com's CRO token, were recently trading down more than 10%.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was down 0.4% and about where it stood a week ago. The Fear and Greed index, a measure of market sentiment about crypto, remained in extreme fear territory – its standing throughout much of the growing FTX crisis.  Crypto prices veered from equity markets, an increasing occurrence in recent weeks as the major indexes each closed slightly higher on Friday two days after the Commerce Department's monthly retail report showed surprisingly resilient consumer spending. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.01%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbed 0.48% and 0.59%, respectively.  Traditional markets have also been unaffected by FTX's spectacular flameout and now daily revelations about its mismanagement. On Sunday, CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa (a regular contributor to this newsletter) wrote that whoever was behind the $600 million exploit of FTX on Nov. 11 had started exchanging millions of dollars worth of ether to ren bitcoin (renBTC), a token that represents bitcoin on other blockchains.  Earlier in the week, Malwa reported that funds stolen from FTX were steadily converted to ether over the past week, making the exploiter one of the largest holders of the token.  BitBull's DiPasquale said that bulls will be looking for ongoing support above bitcoin's brief low at about $15,500 earlier this month as FTX's severe liquidity problems became apparent. ""Once that range is evident, consolidation around that low could see the price shooting toward $18k in the near term,"" he wrote.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Dogecoin DOGE −9.6% Currency Polygon MATIC −8.8% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP −8.6% Currency  Insights  Would Crypto Thrive Again Through Subtraction?  By Sam Reynolds  In a year, we might look back at the spectacular fraud-filled collapse of FTX as a good thing.  Its demise has confirmed many people’s worst fears about the digital assets industry: that it's an unregulated free-for-all, established behind elaborate corporate structures in jurisdictions that are conveniently out of reach of Western courts.  For the most part, this is correct (see: the leviathan of legal entities that is FTX).  There’s also the question that’s being answered in real time about how much of crypto is “funny money,” a concocted entity without worth based on an unsustainable structure, and not “sound money,” a fundamental store of value.  Right now, we can watch this all come apart. Here are two examples.  1. GBTC’s current discount  Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)’s shares are now trading at a discount of 45% below the net asset value.  (CoinDesk is an independent subsidiary of Digital Currency Group [DCG], which also owns Grayscale.)  A total of $10.53 billion in capital is right now handicapped because it holds shares in something that trades less than the value of the asset it holds. And there’s no way to redeem these shares for bitcoin.  Data on a 13F form (a quarterly form filled out by fund managers) shows that institutions have been dropping GBTC during the last few quarters thanks to DCG’s buyback programs. This has made DCG the largest shareholder of the Trust.  The end goal for GBTC is to transform it into an exchange-traded fund, but the Securities and Exchange Commission blocks that with every chance it gets.  So why not wind down the trust? Sure, many of the large holders will take a loss, but there are billions of dollars of impaired capital that should have a better home.  2. Ethereum killers' struggles  Speaking of impaired capital, many would-be Ethereum killers have been struggling mightily.  Solana began the year with a total value locked of over $6 billion and may end the year with under $200 million if current trends continue. When compared to its peak value of $10 billion at the height of the bull market, there’s just over 2.8% of its locked-in value currently left. Many of the protocols that operate on Solana have been totally wiped out, according to data from DeFiLlama.  Surely, some of the venture capitalists that backed Solana and encouraged retail investors to ape-in during the ""Solana Summer"" took profit during the early days. But any exposure remaining on the balance sheets must be an anchor.  Just like the investors who apparently did their due diligence on FTX and missed the glaring holes the new CEO found in a week, how could these investors miss the problems with Solana? Did their due diligence not reveal that a good majority of the ecosystem was effectively a Russian nesting doll of fakery, as CoinDesk reported a few months ago? Or did they just want to put the pump on the coin?  But for as much as we talk about Solana that could be a distraction from larger would-be ethereum killers lurking beneath the surface.
