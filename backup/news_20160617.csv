42378735,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhPn,1466198905,How to Sue The DAO Hacker,"Stephen D Palley is a lawyer in private practice in Washington, DC, where he focuses on construction, insurance and software development, including blockchain and smart contracts.  The opinions in this article are Palley’s alone, are not intended to be legal advice, and may not be shared by past, present or future clients or any firm with which he is associated.  I woke this morning to the sound of dozens of message notifications in rapid succession. The DAO had been attacked. More than $50 million worth of ether had already been drained. At least one technical solution had already been proposed.  Some people like it, some don't. In addition to the technical remedies, some have asked about legal remedies that might be available against The DAO hacker.  Could they be criminally or civilly liable? Could they be sued? If so, how? And if so, by whom? Some thoughts on this topic follow, below.  Criminal law  State and federal criminal statutes are potentially at issue.  There are plenty. One might start with something like theft and iterate. A variety of federal laws may also apply broadly to unauthorized access to computer systems or access that exceeds authorization. In addition to fines, penalties and imprisonment, criminal laws can also make whole remedies for injured parties, and provide damages for losses.  Whether this is on the radar of law enforcement is a separate question. I am simply pointing out that, yes, criminal laws may have been broken.  Are any potential defenses available to the hacker? Could they just give the ether back? As one commenter noted on Twitter, giving the ether back may be appreciated as an act of contrition or mitigation, but it doesn't necessarily serve as a defense to criminal liability.  Others have suggested that the hacker can't be liable as they only did what the contract allowed. It's an interesting argument but, simply stated, code vulnerability doesn't equal consent.  As a defense, it’s pretty weak tea. Theft is theft, off chain or on.  Exploiting a known vulnerability in ATM card code doesn’t give you the right to take money that isn’t yours from a bank.  Civil law  Second, what about civil liability? Can the hacker be sued for damages or injunctive relief? Yes, they can be.  That they may be anonymous or pseudonymonous isn't necessarily a problem at the outset. Whether they can ultimately be located behind the contract address may be something that is soon tested. But as a procedural matter, you don't necessarily have to know who or where someone is to sue them, necessarily.  In the US, a John Doe defendant can be used in an initial complaint (depending on jurisdiction) and serve as a mechanism to start the process of trying to locate the hacker. With a suit on file, you do get subpoena power, among other things.  Who might actually sue the plaintiff? Someone damaged by the theft could potentially sue on their own behalf. They might also be able to file on a class action basis as a representative of other token holders. The DAO or a DAO probably wouldn’t be the plaintiff.  A suit by the DAO qua DAO would mean that the DAO had some sort of legal personalty and the ability to make decisions off chain, about litigation (and to hire a lawyer). It's unclear that ""The DAO"" could actually be a client. It’s code, right?  A simpler (though admittedly imperfect) approach might be for private plaintiffs to sue as putative class representatives on behalf of all token holders similarly situated.  Tort law  What claims could be asserted against the attacker? There are many. From a tort law standpoint, conversion comes to mind.  It's a tort remedy available when someone takes property that's not theirs.  One wrinkle is that conversion may not be available for cash or currency: depending on the jurisdiction that remedy may only be available for tangible property. (Is ether tangible property? This may also depends on jurisdiction).  Plenty of other tort theories are available though. Civil theft, fraud, trespass are a couple of other examples. Implied contract claims might be available too.  Did the hacker breach an implied agreement, or an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing? Equitable claims such as unjust enrichment might also be available. Injunctive relief might be sought, too. These are just examples, and this isn't intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive analysis.  What about damages? This requires some speculation. Loss of token value might be one measure of damages. Other damages theories might arise. For example, consider a case where if market manipulation was a motive.  The attacker might have anticipated that a significant theft would cause the price of ether to decrease, and bet on the market accordingly. If so, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains might also be a potential remedy.  Bottom line: If you think the hacker is a bad guy, legal and equitable remedies may well be available, and damages too.

42378748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhhP,1466197124,Tumultuous Week Fuels 30% Gain in Bitcoin and Ether Prices,"Bitcoin and ether both surged this week, the former hitting a 28-month high and the latter surpassing $20 for the first time. The combined rally of these two digital currencies from 10th June to 17th June helped shed further light on their relationship, a matter that has frequently drawn the attention of market analysts.  To date, the price of bitcoin and ether have correlated positively at some points and negatively at others. Since the two both surged in value in the week ending at 12:00 UTC on 17th June, their correlation was positive during the period, though on closer inspection this relationship is more inconclusive.  This situation contrasts significantly with the times when bitcoin and ether moved in different directions, which prompted some analysts to portray them as competitors. Sometimes, this negative correlation coincided with market observers highlighting bitcoin's challenges and ether's perceived flexibility.  But recently, the two have pushed higher in tandem, experiencing a positive correlation at a time when several developments have been grabbing the attention of market observers.  The upcoming halving on the bitcoin network and economic uncertainty in China all came up as factors that helped influence bitcoin markets.  Bitcoin climbed 33% during the seven-day period, opening at $576.45 on 10th June and closing at $767.45 on 16th June, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals. This sharp rally took place amid modest trading volume, as market participants traded 12.8m BTC in the week ending 17:00 UTC on 17th June, according to Bitcoinity figures.  Ether rose even more, enjoying a 42.6% week-over-week gain, Poloniex data shows. This climb took place amid highly erratic transaction activity, as daily trading volume ranged from as little as $11.3m on 10th June to as much as $64.4m on 14th June, according to CoinMarketCap figures.  This higher figure came very close to the all-time daily high of $65.3m that ether reached in March.  Growth begets volatility  Overall, the two digital currencies experienced sharp fluctuations during the week, as bitcoin started climbing sharply higher at 22:30 UTC on 11th June, resulting in the digital currency rising roughly 25% to $719.85 at 14:45 UTC on 13th June, BPI data shows.  After climbing to this high, bitcoin fell more than 8% to $661.60 at 14:45 UTC on 14th June. These losses were quickly recouped, as bitcoin rose to a closing value of $767.45 on 16th June.  Ether experienced even sharper gyrations, surging more than 30% from its opening price of $14.38 to $18.94 at 11:20 UTC on 14th June, Poloniex figures show.  The currency then fell by roughly 20% to $15.18 by 16:55 on 14th June, before surging to an all-time high of $21.10 at 19:15 UTC on 16th June.  Before the week ended, ether dipped slightly to open 17th June at $20.51, and later in the day, its price would decline sharply on negative news stemming from ongoing issues at one of its signature projects.  Uncertainty ahead  Going forward, developments such as the halving, economic uncertainty in China and the latest news surrounding The DAO will likely help draw attention to both digital currencies.  The halving of rewards on the bitcoin network, in particular, has been prompting market experts to give their two cents on the future of the value of tokens on the network. Rik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic LLC, has forecast that bitcoin prices will enjoy a “pop” following the halving, as it will reduce the amount of new bitcoins generated daily.  ""The halving should spur more commercial blockchain applications which should spur price,” he said.  Not everyone provided a bullish point of view, as Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency investment manager EAM, told CoinDesk that he thinks ""bitcoin prices will experience some softness after the halving"".  He emphasized that bitcoin has ""more than doubled"" from when it was ""hovering below $400,"" but predicted that this upward climb will not continue.  As a result, Enneking told CoinDesk he ""would be very wary of making major long bets going forward"".  However, whether ether will be affected by this remains to be seen, and doubtless its reaction to bitcoin's halving will prove to be another important data point in understanding how these markets are correlated.

42378751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhg9,1466190924,"Bank of England Explores Blockchain, Says Digital Currency is Far Off","In a transcript of a cancelled speech released online today, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cited a ""central bank digital currency"" as a development that could result from its ongoing distributed ledger proof-of-concepts.  The remarks come as global central banks begin to experiment openly with distributed ledgers, a technology inspired by the decentralized, public ledgers used to run cryptocurrencies. But, whereas bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies perhaps sought to create wholly new financial systems, distributed ledger projects are aimed at reducing settlement times and enhancing security in traditional financial environments, a context that colored Carney's statements.  In his remarks, Carney stressed that such a transition to these new tools was unlikely to happen in the immediate future, calling a central bank-issued digital currency an ""extreme"" possibility.  Carney wrote:  ""The great promise of distributed ledgers for central banks is their potential to enhance resilience. Distributing the ledger means multiple copies of the system. It can continue to operate if parts get knocked out. That removes the single point of failure risk inherent in a centralised system.""  Given this potential, he said that the Bank of England intends to continue to explore how distributed ledgers could be applied to its own infrastructure, including its own real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system.  ""If distributed ledger technology could provide a more efficient way for private sector firms to deliver payments and settle securities, why not apply it to the core of the payments system itself?"" he asked.  Notably, this is not the first time the bank has suggested utilizing the technology in conjunction with its RTGS system.  The real-time gross settlement system currently used by the Bank of England experienced an outage lasting approximately nine to 10 hours in 2014. The incident caused ""considerable inconvenience"" to those affected, according to a review by Deloitte, which indicated 51% of housing transactions due on the day were delayed by several hours.  Hands-on approach  In the text, Carney also indicated that the Bank of England will open its own FinTech incubator, in part, to explore new concepts in development such as DLT.  He said the organization would also work on new methods for handling non-bank payment service providers, a move that could open up doors for blockchain businesses with such business models.  Still, it was perhaps his statements on the larger relationship between distributed ledger technology and the current systems used by central banks that is most noteworthy.  When it comes to a central bank-backed digital currency, Carney stated he feels that it could ""fundamentally and perhaps abruptly reshape banking” but could also increase the ""liquidity risk"" by removing friction.  In some ways, it could be argued Carney said that investors in such a system would have too much freedom, a statement that showcases the internal thinking at central banks globally on the issue.  If, for an example, the stock market were to crash, a bank run could be more likely to happen because investors would be able to quickly move their stocks into (digital) cash – cash the bank might not actually hold.  Ultimately, Carney stated that, given the considerations needed, ""[t]he prospect of a central bank digital currency for the UK [is], in my view, still some way off.""  The speech was prepared for an event at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for bankers and merchants yesterday, but Carney did not present it, instead memorializing Jo Cox MP, who was tragically murdered on Thursday.

42378737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhSJ,1466188594,"The DAO is Dead, Devs Say. But Can Anyone Decide its Fate?","The first large-scale experiment with a leaderless distributed autonomous organization (DAO) is winding down, according to at least one prominent member of the decentralized project.  Following at attack earlier today that resulted in the siphoning of over $60m worth of ether from The DAO into a new DAO set up by an unknown individual or entity, the company that wrote the original code is now saying the ""experiment"" is over.  But, it remains unclear if anyone in a leaderless organization, one meant to be driven by the votes of tens of thousands of stakeholders, actually has the authority or ability to end the organization.  In conversation with CoinDesk, the co-founder of Slock.it, which had previously been working to fix the bugs in the DAO’s open-source code, said the roughly $150m in funds are in the process of being moved to a separate account designed specifically to help bring the operation to a close.  Tual said:  ""The DAO is definitely going to close. The money moved to a child DAO is going to be put back into the contract, and it [will] only have one function, withdraw.""  But due to The DAO's governance model, encoded into a series of smart contracts, Tual said the money won’t be accessible for withdrawal for at least a week. Further, it could be as long as 27 days before investors are returned any funds, giving them at least a little breathing room to determine a course of action.  In the meantime, other possible solutions that would require changes to ethereum’s underlying code are being discussed, though it remains to be seen if developers will seek to intervene in helping to resolve the situation.  Deus ex machina  It further remains unclear if any single member of The DAO, even Tual and his fellow Slock.it founders, have the authority to stop its continued open-source development, even if they think they're acting in its best interest.  Academic Emin Gün Sirer, who called for a moratorium on DAO activity when he co-discovered issues with its code last month, told CoinDesk he's not sure if Tual is correct that The DAO is certainly closing.  Sirer, who has been in discussions with many involved in troubleshooting the vulnerability, told CoinDesk that the workflow The DAO was designed to follow is so complicated that it will be ""very difficult"" for anyone to say what will happen next.  The Cornell professor said that one possible way for The DAO to close down would be for Slock.it or another group to propose a measure to the DAO's voters that, if approved, would move all the funds to an account from which they could be withdrawn after a 14-day waiting period.  Andrew Miller, co-author of a detailed report about The DAO's vulnerabilities published yesterday, agreed with Sirer in conversation with CoinDesk.  ""It’s possible to me that the DAO could do that,"" he said ""The way I think they might be able to do this is to get everyone to accept the proposal.""  As the code is currently written though, according to Sirer, there is ""no way"" to immediately refund the value contributed to those involved.  Any effort to change the fabric of the code would undermine future faith in smart contracts which need to be ""incontrovertible and self-policing"" in order to provide any value at all.  Sirer said:  ""If the DAO were to do something untoward, something out of the system, deus ex machina, then it opens up a whole new chapter and I don’t know what the rules are at that point.""  The cost vs the benefit  For Tual’s part, he remains optimistic that an effort would be made to ensure consumers whose funds were stolen are able to see relief.  Miners of most blockchains, for instance, have the ability to “turn back time” collectively in what is called a 51% attack, but the suggestion that they do so in this instance remains controversial, as are implications that more advanced changes could be made to ethereum's code to provide relief for project donors.  But, turning back the clock on the Etherum blockchain, according to Tual, would amount to a white hat 51% attack for the good of the community.  Tual advocated that action was needed due to the fact that perception of the platform has already been negatively impacted.  Tual told CoinDesk:  ""This needs to be corrected. As long as it’s a community effort and perfectly transparent I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.""

42378747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhet,1466183443,Bank of Canada Deputy Governor: Cooperation Needed to Advance Distributed Ledgers,"Carolyn Wilkins is the senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, where she oversees the central bank’s strategic planning and economic and financial research. Wilkins also represents the bank on the Financial Stability Board.  In this op-ed, Wilkins explains how technological innovations in financial services could solve old problems and create new ones. To realize FinTech’s full benefits, she's calling for the public and private sectors to work closely together.  Technological innovation in financial services has the potential to transform the financial system. That's a good thing if it leads to better and cheaper services for people and businesses and the risks are properly managed.  It's clear that change is in the air. Customers are more demanding these days. They want financial services that mesh well with their mobile devices and online activities. Large, well-funded companies like Apple and Google are starting to offer financial services. And the combination of inefficient legacy systems of the incumbents and new technology has opened the door even wider to competition.  That's left people wondering just how much and how fast the financial landscape will change.  It's early days, so no one knows for sure. I think that, even though some of the technology may be revolutionary, its overall effect on the financial system is likely to be evolutionary.  That's because the most transformative technologies, like distributed ledger technology (DLT), still have many hurdles to clear. That gives financial institutions time to adapt as new service providers join the financial ecosystem.  In the end, those with the best business models will survive.  Change is coming  I know that some readers envision a future in which decentralized currencies will replace state currencies. It's an edgy idea, but I think this is highly unlikely, if for no other reason than they can’t outshine the competition as a store of value and a medium of exchange. And national authorities will want to continue to implement an independent monetary policy.  Applications outside of digital currencies – payments, trade finance, among others – appear more promising. In some cases, the benefits could extend beyond efficiency and cheaper processing, to reduce counterparty risk, free up capital for other uses and increase transparency.  That's why companies are investing a lot of money and effort into this type of technology. And since the Bank of Canada oversees core financial market infrastructure and participates in the payments system, the potential for change is pushing us to take a closer look.  So, we’re partnering with Payments Canada, Canadian banks and R3 to test drive an experimental application of DLT to wholesale payments. Our goal at this stage is to understand the mechanics, limits and possibilities of this technology.  I can’t think of a better way to understand this technology than to work with it.  Road to innovation  Other frameworks need to be investigated, and many hurdles need to be cleared, before a DLT system is ready for prime time. Whether they’re based on DLT or simply interesting twists on existing technologies, financial innovations could solve some old problems.  But they could also create new ones. So, while authorities like me support innovation, we also have a duty to make sure risks are properly managed.  It's a tough line to walk. It's best walked with the private sector. That's why consultations and joint projects are so important to us. Some countries, like the UK and Singapore, have regulatory sandboxes.  We also need a clear analytical framework to understand and assess the benefits and challenges of something so new. Authorities will make their assessments through many lenses, including consumer protection, financial inclusion, market integrity, competition policy and financial stability. Since FinTech is global, this regulatory effort also has to be global. A clear and consistent regulatory framework will support innovation if it’s designed properly.  For now, most of the issues don’t relate to financial stability. I do worry, though, that “too big to fail” could emerge in a new form outside the current regulatory perimeter.  Payments are a great example. Players not covered currently by relevant regulation could become important to the system even if they never take on bank-like risks, such as maturity transformation or leverage, or become big enough to be considered systemically important. The move to increased direct access means that even smaller players could create critical dependencies within the financial system, particularly if they connect directly to core payments infrastructure.  This could give rise to moral hazard. At a minimum, authorities need to put a large enough weight on operational dependencies when looking at systemic importance, particularly in light of cyber risk.  I think it's great we’re seeing more interest in fundamental research questions from academic and central bank researchers.  Looking ahead  Our own research over the past few years has focused on new payment methods, the adoption and competitiveness of digital currencies, and the essential benefits of private e-money. We’re broadening it to include other developments, like DLT and peer-to-peer lending.  We also want to understand how new financial technologies will deal with the underlying forces that created the need for financial intermediation in the first place.  Some think it's possible, at least in theory, that new technology could enable a different framework for addressing the same frictions, potentially one that does not require financial intermediaries at all.  In practice, I think it's unlikely to turn out like this. The names and faces may change, but I don’t see technology changing the need for trust, maturity transformation, loan monitoring and intermediation of borrowers and lenders.  Now’s the time for financial institutions, new entrants and policy-makers to work together. That has to be best way to create the right environment for modernizing the financial sector and sensibly managing the risks that arise.  For us at the Bank of Canada, the focus will be on preserving financial stability and maintaining the safe and sound operation of core financial market infrastructures.

42378740,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhTZ,1466176701,Will Ethereum Fork? DAO Attack Prompts Heated Debate,"Key stakeholders behind the alternative blockchain platform ethereum are debating changes to the platform's code after millions of dollars in ether were diverted from a major project by an alleged attacker.  As previously reported, The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that had raised $160m to fund ethereum projects, was exploited early this morning by way of a flaw in its code that allowed roughly 3.6m ETH, the native currency on the ethereum blockchain, to be moved from The DAO to another entity.  The incident sparked widespread discussion on what had already been a hotly debated issue in previous weeks, with both detractors and supporters of The DAO labelling the project as one whose success or failure could have implications for overall confidence in its underlying technology.  The fact that those ethers are, as of now, under the sole control of an unknown individual or entity is what's prompting a call to alter the network's course in a way that would enable either the retrieval of those coins or, at the very least, the ability to prevent them from being moved or sold.  What's being proposed now could constitute as many as two changes to the network. However, the way forward is still highly contested.  One option is a soft fork, or the addition of a new rule to the ethereum code, that would prevent ether from being withdrawn from the new entity created by the attacker. This could be then followed by a possible hard fork, or a change to a past rule, that would create a means by which DAO token holders could reacquire their ethers. A third options remains the possibility that developers take no direct action, but instead work to galvanize the community to identify and recover the funds.  Supporters of changes to ethereum's code say that such an option would prevent the attacker or attackers from being able to sell the stash of ethers, and would be the first step toward returning those coins to DAO stakeholders.  Marc Warne, founder of bitcoin and ether brokerage Bittylicious, said that he supports the move given the early stages of development in ethereum.  Warne told CoinDesk:  ""The DAO comprises a lot of people’s funds, and fundamentally [it] isn't a bad idea. In reality, excluding ideals, forking means everyone gets their ETH back with no collateral damage at all.""  However, not everyone agrees with the idea that such drastic measures should be taken to protect the project.  Alternative perspectives  The news that the ethereum development team is moving in favor of forking the ethereum blockchain sparked a wave of criticism, including assertions that The DAO had become “too big to fail” and was in need of a ""bailout"".  Such comments referenced the major financial institutions that were said to be too large and powerful to be allowed to collapse amid the 2008-2009 financial panic, statements that evoked the idea that the move was antithetical to the aims of the wider blockchain community.  Other critics blasted the move as one that would impair ethereum’s reputation, or at least raise questions about the degree to which the network is decentralized.  For some, letting the attack go unchallenged is preferred.  Preston Byrne, COO of blockchain startup Eris, said that ""there’s a lot of danger"" in forking ethereum, both in terms of public perception as well as potential regulatory repercussions that might arise.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Unilateral fixes affecting the money supply and distribution of funds could be construed by the wider market as proof that the currency is not in fact censorship-resistant ... That anyone is able to exercise this degree of effective control of the ethereum network is also problematic, from a regulatory perspective.""  Jesse Powell, CEO of digital currency exchange Kraken, among the first to list ether, said he supports the idea of forking the network but acknowledged the negative aspects of the measure.  ""It would be great to fork the network. I think it’s probably bad for ethereum to have this reversibility, but at the same time the support of enough of the community to do it, then it’s also something that exists with the protocol, and you can do that,"" he said.  For example, Powell wondered if such measures would be considered if his own company lost a similar amount of ether, a fact that he said was appealing on business grounds, if troubling philosophically.  Path forward  As for The DAO, key influencers are suggesting that the project may not continue.  Slock.it co-founder and COO Stephan Tual, one of the primary movers of the project, told CoinDesk that the organization ""is definitely going to close"", adding that work on its code would continue even if stakeholders are able to take their money out. His authority to execute this decision, however, is unclear.  The solution itself, as developed by Ethereum project members, appears to be fluid at the time of this writing.  There appears to be a lack of consensus among developers as to what shape any fork scenario might take, and a recent post on Reddit by Buterin suggests that alternative solutions are on the table.  ""Some in the dev community actually think that it may be possible to recover most or all the funds in The DAO without the subsequent state-changing hardfork, using only miner collusion,"" Buterin wrote, adding:  ""I'd be perfectly fine with this approach if it proves feasible and is what the community wants.""  The proposed fix involves getting the ethereum network’s mining ecosystem to support an effective freeze of the funds by recreating a form of the so-called stalker attack, a vulnerability identified late last month by a group of researchers who called for a moratorium on The DAO.  Tual told CoinDesk that while he sees the argument for avoiding a fork and conceding the lost ethers, he believes the situation should be addressed as it has ramifications for the broader ethereum project.  ""I see the argument. Let it fail, let everyone lose their money. But in this particular case, it’s not an attack on The DAO. It stems from a pattern in the language that is the base of all smart contracts,"" he said, adding:  “This is an attack on ethereum.”  Image via Rob Brewer for Flickr",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FORKS,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/17/will-ethereum-fork-dao-attack-prompts-heated-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6eb38ce4c132a2af3745db3d88fb0c073fb38930-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A leaderless organization  comprised of a series of smart contracts written on the ethereum codebase, The DAO has lost 3.6m ether, which is currently sitting in a separate wallet after being split off into a separate grouping dubbed a ""child DAO"".

TheDAO was launched in May using open-source code written by Slock.it, an Ethereum-focused startup based in Germany. The DAO is designed to operate like a venture capital fund empowering it members to fund ethereum projects.  To become a voting member of The DAO tokens were sold in exchange for ether during a month-long “creation phase” that resulted in $162m worth of ether being raised. A measure was built into The DAO code that allows for “child DAOs” to be formed in which members could split off for various purposes.  Earlier this week  , word of a so-called “recursive call” attack that could be used to drain some smart contract accounts emerged following a blog post by Bitcoin Foundation founder Peter Vessenes. A solution was produced by Slock.it and uploaded to GitHub.  For now, the ethers moved to the second DAO appear to be frozen. Gustav Simonsson, a member of the Ethereum Foundation that helps over see the Ethereum codebase, posted on Reddit the funds in question can't be spent until 14th July, as they are locked in that child DAO's creation phase.  Next steps include a possible two-part fork of the Ethereum blockchain, as explained in a note published by Buterin. The fork would not roll back or reverse any transactions, but instead seek to prevent the further drain of ethers from The DAO by providing a mechanism for reacquiring them.

42378749,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7lhif,1466138959,Ether Prices Pass $20 Milestone in Network First,"The price of ether, the native digital asset powering the ethereum blockchain, surpassed $20 for the first time ever yesterday, reaching a key milestone and continuing a rally it has enjoyed so far this week.  Ether hit $20 at 18:30 UTC, before pushing higher to reach a high of $21.10 at 19:15 UTC, data from the market's leading exchange, Poloniex, reveals.  Overall, ether experienced these robust gains amid strong transaction activity, as its 24-hour trading volume reached $38.5m at 23:59 UTC, CoinMarketCap figures show. This figure represented roughly 70% of the all-time high of $65.3m attained in March. It also exceeded the average daily volume of March, April and May, which was $29.34m, $16.54m and $27.88m, respectively.  Market observers have often asserted that ether displays a negative correlation with bitcoin, a more established digital currency, but the two have failed to follow this pattern in recent sessions.  Both have generated robust gains, as ether surged 47.8% in the last six sessions, opening at $18.29 on 11th June and $20.50 on 17th June, according to Poloniex figures, while bitcoin rose 32.5%, the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveals.  If these two currencies were negatively correlated, they would not have rallied simultaneously. In fact, ether’s sharp rise would have coincided with bitcoin’s decline. The two seem to be confirming a new pattern that involves the digital currencies rising at the same time.  This trend could point to bitcoin and ether enjoying an influx of new fiat money, as historically, the gains in one frequently came at the expense of depreciation in the other.  ARK Invest  analyst Chris Burniske suggested this as a possible development when speaking with CoinDesk, noting earlier this month that bitcoin has managed to stay “roughly in the .022 to .026 BTC/ETH range” since its rally began in late May.  Aside from enjoying a new influx of fiat money, these two digital currencies might benefit from fear-of-missing-out syndrome after experiencing their latest rallies.  If so, ether and bitcoin could have far more gains to look forward to in the weeks ahead.  Charles L.
