The adoption of this wallet was incentivized by the El Salvadoran government, which said that it was giving away $30 in BTC to every citizen 14 and above who downloaded the Chivo app. This announcement had come about a month before the law went into full effect and as of September 7th, El Salvador became the first sovereign nation to accept a cryptocurrency as legal tender.

It is Decentralized Storage in which all the files are distributed into smaller fragments over the global network, comprising smaller network branches. Similarly, when a user requests a file, all the tiny pieces are assembled from different networks and then securely made available for the user. Storj is one of the older blockchain projects, founded in 2014, initially envisioned as an encoded crypto storage platform, later transformed into the network model. It was originally run on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the blockchain. Now it&apos;s an open-source project, providing private, secure, highly available storage for individual or enterprise-grade projects. Storj is making strides towards the decentralized internet space by launching Storj DCS. The DCS will enable developers to leverage unsurpassed privacy and security benefits of storage. With this new multi-tenant gateway, changing storage to Storj is as simple as altering a few lines of code in their Amazon S-3 compatible applications.

Although the system offers many advantages, it also has shortcomings that have recently become too apparent to ignore. The major concern of these EHR systems is the portability, security and privacy of patient&apos;s health data. However, Patientory, a decentralized app (dApp) running on blockchain technology, offers a viable solution to the frailties of the current EHR system. The EHR system and its uses An Electronic Health Record is a digital record of a patient&apos;s visits to healthcare facilities, progress notes, demographic data, diagnosis, medication, and medical test reports. The main aim of the EHR system is to improve the quality of patient care. Also, on a lighter note, a computerized record is easier understood than a physician&apos;s handwriting. An EHR reduces the administrative burden, saves space, improves the productivity of healthcare personnel, and provides a financial benefit. Some EHR systems have a patient portal for patients to access their historical health data. Drawbacks of the EHR system The current EHR system currently creates centralized siloed walled gardens.
