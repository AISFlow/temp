42416866,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcmG,1376587187,Commonwealth Bank closes CoinJar's business and founders' personal accounts,"Commonwealth Bank in Australia has closed the personal accounts of the co-founders of bitcoin wallet CoinJar after freezing the company's business account.  On Friday (August 9th), the bank stopped processing the company's automatic payouts. Asher Tan, co-founder of CoinJar, contacted Commonwealth Bank numerous times and received ""mixed messages"", with one customer service member revealing the account was being closed, while another claimed there was simply a lock on the payout facility.  Tan tried to close the account on Wednesday, but was told this wouldn't be possible. He then found his personal account with the bank had been closed.  A spokesperson from Commonwealth Bank said: ""The Bank apologises if the customer feels they have not received an appropriate level of service. We are looking into this matter, though due to customer confidentiality, we are unable to provide further details.""  Tuur Demeester  , editor at MacroTrends, said this series of events could be seen as the stereotypical reactions of an existing company seeking to quash a new player that enters its space.  ""Take the example of the electric light bulb, back when gas lights were still dominant,"" he said. ""Thomas Edison's gas light competitors sponsored articles describing the many health hazards of electric lights (even though the new technology was actually much safer), and would even send undercover saboteurs to Edison's electric light demonstrations to make it look like the devices were unreliable.""  ""Of course, all these efforts didn't prevent general adoption of the electric light bulb. I believe the same will be true for bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies.""  However, Demeester went on to say it's important to also understand the huge amount of pressure that is exerted on banks: ""They are basically forced to act as an arm of the government, in that they can be held liable if their customers are discovered to be involved with money laundering or other illegal activities. This makes them paranoid and reluctant to build strong relationships with initiatives that operate outside of the mainstream, such as bitcoin businesses.""  He suggested bitcoin entrepreneurs should, from the start, work with more than one bank in order to manage the risk of suddenly falling out of favour with one particular bank.  CoinJar is now banking with National Australia Bank (NAB), a representative of which approached Tan at a startup event in Melbourne earlier in the week offering assistance with his company's business banking.  A post on the CoinJar blog reads:  ""We met up the following day, where we explained our business model and the lengths we have gone to decrease fraud and screen users for fishy activity. It was quick easy, and surprisingly painless. I walked out of the meeting equal parts impressed and relieved.""  Tan concludes the post by recommending other startups in Australia take their business straight to NAB: ""At this point I’ve seen enough to make a comparative analysis that your Australian startup is better served at NAB than any other big-4 bank.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/15/commonwealth-bank-closes-coinjars-business-and-founders-personal-accounts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/934cd2b3d73a05c45b967a12120a8c4e12ba063c-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416879,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcyS,1376584266,ASIC bitcoin miner arms race: the definitive CoinDesk roundup,"Why do ASIC mining hardware manufacturers give their products names like Klondike and GoldStrike? It’s because bitcoin mining is like a gold rush. People are rushing to stake a claim to a limited resource, and they need the best equipment that they can to mine it.  After GPUs and FPGAs, the rush is on to produce ASIC-based miners that are faster and more power efficient than their predecessors. The market is flooded with vendors promising the next, greatest ASIC hardware. But all that glitters is not gold. Here is a roundup of what’s on offer (and what’s actually shipping, which isn’t much).  Phase 1: Avalon, ASICMiner, and clones  Let's start with one of the first companies to ship an ASIC miner: Avalon. This firm, which began shipping in January, designed its own ASIC chip, based on a 110 nm process. First-generation units operated at around 68 GH/sec, and batch three of these units, selling for around BTC72, guarantees at least 63 GH/sec, says the company.  Avalon's  strength was also its biggest drawback: it was able to get to market early because of the relative inefficiency of its chip. Its 110 nm process node is the second largest on the market today (after ASICMiner's), and smaller process nodes lead to better performance and power consumption. However, the company has been working on a 55 nm chip, which it says will go on sale for immediate delivery in mid-October, and is already working on third and fourth generation chip designs in parallel.  The company has also said that batch three of the version 1 ASIC miner will be its last. It is working on a two-module unit for increased performance, and a 2U 17-inch deep server blade which it is calling version 2.  Avalon has also been offering its chips to OEMs, who had been making their own equipment. “For the most part, they will give the same output,"" says Jaime Gladish, a bitcoin enthusiast who keeps a constant update of FPGA and ASIC products at his site, Decentralized Hashing.  “There are a variety of companies using Avalon chips because they were the first to start selling chips, and they will not be making boxes any more on their current chip line, which opened the market. Some want to cut costs as much as possible, by skipping a case for instance.”  One of the first to try and source Avalon chips was TerraHash, which has been producing two mining boards: a 4.5 GH/sec unit with 16 chips, and a 64 chip 18 GH/sec model. The firm will sell the boards individually, but has also been offering preassembled boxes that can take either the 4.5 GH/sec boards, or the 18 GH/sec units. The DX Mini offers up to 90 GH/sec with 20 of the smaller boards. The DX Large will take up to 10 of the bigger boards, for a total of 180 GH/sec.  The problem for this company is that it is still waiting on Avalon chips, and hasn't been able to fulfillcustomer orders. That's unfortunate, because the company had changed its policy in June to begin accepting preorders – and later decided to change its refund policy, declaring all orders final. The company would not return our calls.  Avalon says that it is still waiting for its chips, 200,000 of which it says are stuck in customs. It has 800,000 orders to fill, it admits. It has also battled allegations that it was mining with its own chips.  Hopefully, Ohio-based Krater will have better luck. Like TerraHash, the company is offering its own ASIC miner, along with the option to build mining equipment for people providing their own chips. The company promises a four-module unit, offering up to 90 GH/sec, which it calls a working clone of the Avalon miner. It, too, ordered chips – 10,000 of them – from Avalon in May. Each module in its unit will contain 80 chips, giving it a total of 125 modules, by our calculation, or 31 fully loaded ASIC mining units.  When it receives its chips, this should give it a total of around 2.8 TH/sec of shippable hashing power from its first bulk chip delivery. However, as of this week, the firm is still awaiting ASIC chips, meaning that it is at the mercy of Avalon, which is in turn at the mercy of customs, and the fabricator beyond that. Significantly, Krater’s pricing has come down from BTC125 a month ago.  Another company, based in Bulgaria, is promising an Avalon-based unit. Technobit, run by Bitcointalk member Marto74, is offering to assemble either boards or full miners with Avalon chips supplied by end users. A fully assembled miner, with boards based on the same Klondike design as the TerraHash boards, will set you back €51. But don't forget, that means you have to pay for (and source) the chips yourself, which is arguably the biggest cost.  Finally, Big Picture Mining, a collective of mining enthusiasts, had designed a small USB dongle-style ASIC miner using the Avalon chips. The unit, which was publicized at around $49, was to offer around 282MH/sec, but the collective began issuing refunds after Avalon failed to ship its chips.  ASICMiner  originally sold shares in its operation, with the intention of producing its own 130 nm ASIC and mining with it in-house. The company has since sold some devices based on this chip, in the form of a 10-12 GH/sec mining board called Block Erupter Blade. It also sells a USB dongle, providing around 300 MH/sec. A second generation Block Erupter is due for launch soon, although no specifications were available at the time of writing.  The two biggest challenges for ASICMiner customers are the price, and the fact that the company is competing with its own customers. Prices vary online (ASICMiner doesn't sell directly, but instead auctions its devices on the forums, and sells through resellers). However, the old version has been advertised for BTC12.5, or around $1400 at current pricing), which costs you around $116 per Gigahash.  The other problem is that ASICMiner also uses its own chips to mine bitcoins, presumably using its own ASICMiner Rack, which is around 1,000 times more powerful than the first-generation Block Erupter Blade, and presumably benefits from economies of scale and bulk pricing. Its mining operation accounts for around 9% of the entire bitcoin network’s hash rate. Anyone who buys its hardware is competing with it. On the other hand, at the time of writing there are not many shipping alternatives for people that want in on the ASIC mining game.  Phase 2: Butterfly Labs and Bitfury  Butterfly Labs  has been among the most contentious companies in the ASIC mining space. The firm, which experienced success with an FPGA unit last year, announced its ASIC device in June 2012. The original ship date was delayed multiple times, although the firm began shipments around the start of June. It was forced to revise the specifications for its hardware after failing to achieve the original power specifications, and now advertises 4-5 watts per Gigahash – that’s 4-5 times the original power consumption - for its 65 nm ASIC design. It gave 1000 bitcoins to charity when it missed its original target.  Butterfly Labs offers four product configurations: the five GH/sec Jalapeño, the 25 GH/sec bitcoin miner, the 50 GH/sec 'Single', and the 500 GH/sec Minirig. The latter was supposed to operate at 1500 GH/sec, but was scaled back. Minirigs have been seen in operation, and the company is updating its shipments daily here.  We’re lumping BitFury into this phase, too, based on its use of a 55 nm process node chip. The firm is promising a 25 GH/sec miner starter kit. This will cost €1000 - slightly more than the equivalent 25 GH/sec product from Butterfly Labs at current exchange rates. However, it draws just 40W, compared to BFL’s 125-130 W. The rough match on pricing disappears when we move into hundreds of GH/sec, however: the 400 GH/sec miner promised for October by BitFury will cost €7500. That's around $10,000, compared to $22,484 for Butterfly Labs' 500 GH/sec Minirig. The extra 100 GH/sec is nice, but it isn’t worth $12,500 – and BitFury thinks you can overclock it to 500GH/sec anyway.  Phase 3: 28nm process node vendors  But 55 nm won't be the smallest process node available, if other ASIC mining vendors have their way. Companies like Butterfly Labs, ASICMiner, and Avalon worked hard to get to market first in what is undoubtedly an arms race to deliver an ASIC device. Others either kept their powder dry, or simply came to the party late. Their advantage is higher performance, as they work on ASIC designs that promise a higher hash rate for your money. Several are now working on 28 nm chips, designed to offer hundreds of GH/sec for lower prices and using less energy.  One of them is HashFast, which is promising the Baby Jet, an ASIC device promising 400 GH/sec, or 500 GH/sec if overclocked. This device will use the Fast Golden Nonce chip, designed with a 28 nm process node, which the firm says will consume less than one watt per Gigahash/sec. it is promising delivery of the first units between October 20-30 for $5,600 (compared to $22,484 for the 500 GH/sec Butterfly Labs Minirig).  Another 28 nm vendor is KnCMiner, a joint venture between four year-old Swedish IT consulting firm KennemarAndCole AB (KNC), and Swedish chip design and fabrication consultancy ORSOC. That firm offers three different units: the $2,000 Mercury 100 GH/sec at a maximum 250 W, the $3,795 Saturn, which offers 200 GH/sec at 500 W, and the Jupiter, which sucks up 1 kW to deliver 400 GH/sec, and costs $7,000. Shipments begin in September for the two larger models, although orders placed today will ship in October, the firm says.  Headed by a team of chip design experts, Cointerra also hopes to score big with a 28 nm design, and it also wants to beat KnCMiner on pricing. It has confirmed that it wants to price lower than KnCMiner to account for the fact that it will deliver its units later, in the second half of the fourth quarter. It is promising a 500 GH/sec ASIC chip, enabling it to deliver a device offering greater than 1 TH/sec, say the founders.  Outliers  One or two of the next generation 28 nm players have already drawn skepticism on the forums, with people claiming that it's too good to be true. That's why we have our eyes on UK-based XCrowd, but with eyebrows raised. Not much is known about this secretive firm, which forum posts suggest is promising up to five product configurations, ranging from 15 GH/sec (for $200) to 2.4 TH/sec per second (for $8,000). Posts from the firm’s Twitter account show at least two units, with one offering 1.2 TH/sec.  The firm claims to have a team spread between London, San Francisco, and Shenzen. It was reportedly already taking preorders, until its site was attacked, forcing it to take it offline for a while.  There are some mysterious elements to the XCrowd story. On one hand, it claims not to be an ASIC developer, but will instead focus on a larger bitcoin-related initiative that it calls Project Satoko – an anonymous exchange communications protocol. Bizarrely, given the development costs presumably involved, the firm will ""most likely discontinue manufacturing ASIC units after the first batch on order to focus on XCrowd”. As it hasn’t formally announced products (in spite of some forum posts), we are not including it in our accompanying table.  One of the biggest differentiators today isn’t necessarily system specification: it’s shipment date, the ability to deliver, and customer service. Customers have been angered by companies that promise units and don’t deliver, and even those companies that do begin delivering on back orders don’t always behave professionally. Representatives from Butterfly Labs posting under personal accounts have publicly insulted customers and cancelled their orders, for example.  The other thing to watch for is difficulty. If and when more ASIC miners begin to ship, they will flood the network with hashing power, and the difficulty will skyrocket. Indeed, it’s already starting to happen. Those choosing a miner will want to think carefully about projected difficulty, bitcoin value, and return on investment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/15/asic-bitcoin-miner-arms-race-the-definitive-coindesk-roundup,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bbe4c138c0f929ff462f9b01b3ded9213bb9518a-979x656.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42416861,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxce8,1376574028,Frustrated customers hit BitInstant with a class action lawsuit,"Three bitcoiners have filed a class action lawsuit against BitInstant claiming the company misled them with false representations about its services.  The class action complaint was received by BitInstant on July 8th, shortly before the company's website closed for maintenance.  Plaintiffs Leandro Icono, Deborah Collins and Ulysses McGhee are being represented by Giskan Solotaroff Anderson & Stewart LLP in their assertions that BitInstant made false claims about the speed of its service and the refund of fees.  The class action complaint states:    ""BitInstant purports to provide a means to rapidly pay funds to bitcoin exchanges far faster than other bitcoin processing services. In fact, BitInstant claims that customers can receive 'coins within an hour or two'. Those representations are disingenuous.        BitInstant also promises that it will refund its fees to customers who experience undue delays in the processing of their transactions. Those representations are also disingenuous.""    Bitcoin traders Charlie Shrem and Gareth Nelson founded the New York City-based company in 2011, but it was earlier this year that it raised $1.5 million in a seed funding round led by Winklevoss Capital – a tech investment company owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.  At the time of the investment, Cameron Winklevoss told TechCrunch: “One of the most exciting things about people who are into Bitcoin is that they’re a really passionate community, and Charlie is a passionate entrepreneur. He would be in that category of someone who lives, breathes, and sleeps Bitcoin.""  There are mixed reviews of BitInstant on bitcointalk.org and Reddit, with some users reporting long delays in transactions or missing funds, but others praising the company for the speed of their payment processing.  Last month, bitcointalk.org forum member RoadTrain said: ""They held my $300 I sent in 2 transactions for 2 weeks. Recently I got the first $200 to bitstamp. They charged fees though somewhere I heard that they don't charge fees when the payment is delayed. Now I am waiting for the remaning (sic) $100 but not getting any replies.""  Reddit user montseayo had a more positive experience: ""My cash directly to Bitcoin wallet transaction for $50 USD went through almost instantly. Had a couple of confirmations within 20 minutes.""  Charlie Shrem told CoinDesk: ""We have not had a chance to review the [class action] complaint with our lawyers, so we can't comment on its details.  ""As everyone in the bitcoin community knows, though, we're dedicated to doing right by all of our customers and are surprised to learn that any have unresolved support issues. We are committed to demonstrating that to the bitcoin community every day.""

42416855,eB3NjBN6VPjgNZ6DbOxcRw,1376565300,Securely sell online files for bitcoin with CoinLock,"CoinLock  is an online service hoping to use bitcoin as a means of distributing paid content on the web. The service allows merchants to upload files and set the price. They then get a link they are free to embed anywhere. Customers following the link can then pay and download the content.  Selling files online, whether it's software, music or imagery has always involved complicated online shopping carts. However, CoinLock is hoping to solve that by hosting your encrypted files for merchants. The act of paying for a file decrypts it and sends it to the client for download.  CoinLock's Matt Branton told us more about the service:  ""CoinLock aims to be the most friction-less way to sell digital content that has ever existed. We took a step back and rethought what it meant to sell paid content, and have created a service that is very easy to use, does not require an online storefront, a bank account, has no commitment or upfront costs, and provides strong assurances of privacy and anonymity. At the end of the day it is nobody's business what legal content you buy or sell.""  From the merchant's point of view, Branton explained, ""All a user has to do is enter an address to be paid at, the amount their content is worth, and upload a file and we take care of the rest. The link you get back can be placed directly into a blog, an existing solution, or wherever a URL can be used and people can instantly buy that content with bitcoin. A fairly powerful idea, and we hope people see the potential and help us build a strong community of users.""  Branton claims that CoinLock is pro-privacy – there are no user accounts and CoinLock personnel cannot decrypt the files stored on their servers. Branton said to us, ""If you were to ask me exactly what they [users] are selling, I would have to say I don't know unless they tell me.""  Uploaded files are encrypted on users' browsers prior to upload, with the key being generated client side too. The decryption key is then given as part of the CoinLock URL. Branton told us that it's up to the merchant how to share that link with others. You can see a test sale we created here, of a high resolution photo of the moon.  CoinLock is a self-funded startup based in Tampa, Florida.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/15/securely-sell-online-files-for-bitcoin-with-coinlock,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e8e310024e2e2d005ca0ea308e7fc2a1cd233b0-500x282.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
