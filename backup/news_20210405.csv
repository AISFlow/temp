42386401,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSqBp,1617663600,South Korean Prosecutors Sell (and Profit Off) Bitcoin Taken From Criminals,"For the first time in the country’s history, South Korean prosecutors have sold bitcoin confiscated from criminals, CoinDesk Korea reported. The sale turned a profit of around 12.3 billion won (around US$10.9 million), which has been transferred to the national treasury.      On April 1, the Suwon District Prosecutors' Office announced it had sold “191 bitcoin confiscated in April 2017 from the operator of the illegal pornography site, AVSNOOP, identified thus far as 'Ahn' (assumedly his surname) at around 64,260,000 won ($57,000) per coin.”      In South Korea, producing, selling and distributing pornography is prohibited by law.      Authorities originally confiscated 216 BTC from Ahn, but only 191 were determined to be “of criminal origin” by the Korean Supreme Court in a ruling in May 2018. It was the first time a South Korean court acknowledged cryptocurrency as “intangible assets” and gave the authorities the right to confiscate crypto acquired through, or used for, illicit activity.      While the U.S. government has been auctioning bitcoin since 2014, Korean prosecutors have held on to the confiscated bitcoin for the past four years due to legal ambiguity surrounding cryptocurrency. According to South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency, prosecutors moved to liquidate the confiscated bitcoin on March 25, the exact day when the country’s crypto legislation went into effect. The revised legislation classifies crypto as “virtual assets.”      When prosecutors confiscated Ahn’s bitcoin in April 2017, it was worth around 270 million won (around $240,000). The amount when sold on March 25 is over 45 times that.      Ahn operated AVSNOOP from May 2014 to when he was arrested in April 2017. He served 18 months behind bars and was released in October 2018. It looks like he will receive the remaining 25 BTC determined to be legit.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/05/south-korean-prosecutors-sell-and-profit-off-bitcoin-taken-from-criminals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5c94270dbeda512674bff332351c5c7f39483c7-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASYKjO,1617661650,"Coinbase and Bakkt Are Behind Paul Tudor Jones' Bitcoin Bets, SEC Documents Show","When Paul Tudor Jones bet 1% to 2% of his assets on bitcoin in May it was unclear where the billionaire had bought his crypto, or how. The industry remained uncertain if his investment was direct. After all, his hedge fund had started flirting with bitcoin futures only days before.  But in the year since, his firm, the $44.5 billion Tudor Investment Corporation, has indeed established rails for direct crypto ownership. It secured custodial ties with institutional powerhouses Coinbase and Bakkt, according to new filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Coinbase Custody Trust Company, Bakkt Trust Company and Tagomi Trading LLC (the institutional brokerage firm Coinbase bought in May 2020) all provide custodial services to Tudor Jones’ family-only hedge fund, the documents state.  The filings provide a rare glimpse into the hush-hush world of institutional crypto dealmaking, where well-heeled clients pile into an asset class bankers once deemed absurd. Many, like Tudor Jones, see bitcoin as an inflation hedge, and their ranks are swelling in the pandemic economy.  Read more: Hedge Fund Pioneer Paul Tudor Jones Says He Holds 1%-2% of Assets in Bitcoin  They’re also playing a key role in the 2020-2021 bull market. On-chain data shows whales bought over 500,000 BTC in the final months of 2020, according to Chainalysis.  Against this backdrop are service providers like Coinbase that occasionally tout their institutional clients as they race to capture yet more hedge funders’ dollars. But Coinbase, which did not comment for this article, never revealed its links to Paul Tudor Jones.  Representatives for Tudor Group and Bakkt did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.  A family affair  For now, Tudor Jones appears to be restricting direct crypto exposure to a small corner of his clients. “Tudor Family Fund II,” which is open to relatives and close associates of the macro king, was the only one of Tudor Investment Corp.’s eight hedge funds to disclose crypto custodians on the firm’s annual Form ADV, filed March 31.  Not even the $27 billion Tudor BVI Global Fund, which last year presaged Tudor Jones’ bitcoin romance when it jumped into crypto futures in early May, has any industry tie-ups, according to similar Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  The Tudor Jones family fund was worth $1 billion at last check but the chances of all that being bitcoin are slim to none. The exclusive fund maintains a vast network of partners in the custodian and prime brokerage space – names like Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Credit Suisse – that suggest broad exposure to the global markets.  See also: The Great Monetary Inflation: Paul Tudor Jones’ Complete Case for Bitcoin  But a wider swath of Tudor clients nonetheless appears poised for direct crypto exposure, according to the asset manager’s latest regulatory risk brochure. It included an entire section on the risks of investing in crypto for the first time in its four-decade history.  “Certain Clients are permitted to enter into cryptocurrency transactions as described in the relevant Offering Materials,” the document states, through “direct investment on a spot basis or indirect investment” in crypto derivatives. Notably, the firm is not holding itself to crypto futures contracts.  The document does not specify what it means by “certain clients.” However, in a section describing what investment strategies are only available to “proprietary accounts” like the family fund, it does not list cryptocurrency transactions.  Institutional service providers  Tudor Investment Corp. is not the first big-name asset manager to loudly tout its crypto bets while keeping its custody links more quiet.  Britain’s Ruffer Investment pulled a similar strategy when it bought $745 million in bitcoin last November without revealing who was holding the coins. (CoinDesk later revealed Coinbase as the custodian.)

The newly mined coins bring Marathon’s bitcoin treasury up to 5,134.2 BTC (roughly $300 million), per an announcement. Marathon’s stock jumped 7% on the news and closed at $56.56.      Also in Q1, Marathon received 10,300 top-of-the-line Bitmain s-19 Pros, which are more powerful than most other hardware on the market.      The Las Vegas-based firm will receive recurring shipments from Bitmain throughout the year with the goal of having over 100,000 ASICs online by the end of January 2022, giving Marathon’s operations an estimated hashrate of 10.3 exahashes per second (EH/s). These purchases come after the company raised hundreds of millions from stock offerings and other financing over the past year.      Marathon’s aggressive expansion is in step with the other big names in the mining industry. New machines are just now coming online after heavy demand dammed-up the ASIC supply chain, and Bitcoin’s mining difficulty recently hit an all-time high in response to the flood of hashrate. (Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is a self-correcting algorithm that makes mining bitcoin harder or easier depending on market conditions.)      Compass Mining CEO Whit Gibbs previously told CoinDesk this trend shows no signs of stopping this year.

At press time, stacks' changing hands at $2.19, up 88% in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko.  The total market capitalization of Stacks rose to around $2.4 billion.  The latest price jump of Stacks came after it was listed on South Korea-based crypto exchange Upbit with a STX/KRW pair.  There's been an increased interest in so-called alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in South Korea, after bitcoin's price topped at $61,556.59 in mid-March.  Arthur Cheong, founder and portfolio manager at DeFi-focused crypto fund DeFiance Capital, told CoinDesk that more ""unsophisticated retail"" traders, especially those in South Korea, are returning to the crypto market and looking at altcoins for their potential lucrative returns, evidenced by the spot trading volume of altcoins on South Korean crypto exchanges.  Jason Lau, chief operating officer at San Francisco-based crypto exchange OKCoin, also noticed the staking program offered at OKCoin for Stacks tokens has helped increase interest among investors in STX.  OKCoin's ""STX holders are discovering and being comfortable with stacking – locking STX in order to earn bitcoin,"" Lau said. ""With bitcoin consistently charting new all time highs, the appeal of earning yield in bitcoin is alluring to many.""  About 65% of Stacks token holders on OKCoin have locked up their STX for six months, according to Lau, a potentially bullish sign for Stacks token.

The Lightning Network – a layer atop the Bitcoin blockchain that uses its own special rules to facilitate cheaper, faster transactions – had about 5,335 public nodes in April 2020. Now that number sits at 10,348, a roughly 94% increase. This figure only includes nodes with public connections, however, and the real number is likely higher when factoring nodes with private connections.      As Bitcoin’s on-chain fees grow alongside bitcoin’s price, scaling technologies like Lightning offer users a cheaper and faster way to transact. If bitcoin will ever be used as a day-to-day currency, a scaling solution like Lightning is paramount, and avid bitcoiners even use the network today to purchase goods and services.      Consider this Iranian Lightning user who used bitcoin to buy a PlayStation Now pass that is otherwise restricted by sanctions:      With Bitcoin’s Lightning network seeing more activity than ever, the total number of payment channels on the network (the two-way payment avenues that power Lightning’s plumbing) is now over 45,000. The Lightning Network currently holds 1,185 BTC, worth some $69 million.    Lightning Network adoption    Though introduced in 2017, the past two years have been critical for Lightning’s growth.      At the end of 2020, crypto exchange Kraken announced it would support the feature. Before Kraken, the only prominent exchanges to adopt Lightning were Bitfinex and the bitcoin-only River Financial. Exchange integrations make it cheaper for their customers to deposit and withdraw bitcoin, often paying cents in fees instead of the single or double-digit dollar amounts they may pay Bitcoin’s main network.      Since Kraken’s announcement, the U.K.’s CoinCorner, Vietnam’s oldest exchange and OKCoin followed suit with their own Lightning integrations.

42386395,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSlXj,1617653943,"Grayscale ETF Announcement May Shore Up GBTC Discount, Analysts Say","Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shareholders now know they’re not going to be left behind in the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) race, and that may help alleviate the discount at which GBTC has been trading for over a month, some analysts say.      On Monday, Grayscale, which is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group, announced it would convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund when the U.S. regulatory environment warms to bitcoin ETFs.      The conversion would mean GBTC shareholders would no longer have to put up with a six-month lockup or 2% annual management fee. The news could bring GBTC more in line with the net asset value (NAV) of bitcoin, or at the very least put a limit on how steep the discount might go, said James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. (Currently, GBTC is trading at -5.64% to NAV, according to data from CoinDesk subsidiary TradeBlock.)      Some analysts suspect that announcing the ETF conversion is a way to keep the fund, with $38.8 billion assets under management (AUM), liquid by making shareholders happy, especially investors who are coming to the end of their lockup period.      “Once you go into, like, 14%, 15% discount, [there are] going to be people out there that are willing to buy the GBTC and hold it until it turns into an ETF,” Seyffart said. “At this point it’s not going to go to a 30%, 40% discount, like some people are talking about in hyperbole online.”    Read more: Grayscale Says It’s ‘100% Committed to Converting GBTC Into an ETF’    GBTC’s premium flipped to a discount around the end of February when Canadian bitcoin ETFs began to be approved by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), said Fundstrat lead digital asset strategist David Grider.      “You compare [GBTC’s 2% annual fee] to the 44 basis points [0.44%] or whatever you’d get on an ETF and there should be a discount,” Grider said. “That’s the time value of the fee. ... That’s also the market signaling it’s worried about the liquidity of GBTC, which doesn’t allow for redemptions.”      The top two verticals on which ETFs will compete in the future are fees and liquidity, Seyffart added. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said he wouldn’t make a prediction about GBTC’s liquidity at the time of conversion, but noted that it would be one of the most liquid commodity ETFs if it converted today.      “If it were an ETF today, when compared to commodity-based ETFs, GBTC would be the largest in terms of assets under management, behind the SPDR Gold Trust,” Sonnenshein said. “It would be the third-largest in terms of notional trading volume with approximately $2.6 billion per week.”      Grayscale plans to eventually convert all of its products to ETFs, Sonnenshein said. It’s unlikely the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will consider ETFs of other cryptocurrencies before 2022, Seyffart said.      Currently, GBTC “trades on par with the top decile of ETFs,” Seyffart said, and Grayscale’s ETF success will also hinge on whether the SEC approves one bitcoin ETF at a time or a wave of ETFs at once.      In addition to competing on fees and liquidity, ETFs will also compete on security, depending on how the bitcoin is stored and insurance policies for that bitcoin. Some ETF issuers may lend out the underlying bitcoin to create higher yields or they could do active trading with options or futures, Seyffart said.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/05/grayscale-etf-announcement-may-shore-up-gbtc-discount-analysts-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1af645acb77ac0d2b02cee08b534776940d6ec0e-1200x857.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A brief price pop earlier Monday came after MicroStrategy, the Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm, bought $15 million of BTC at an average price of $59,339 per coin, adding to its already substantial hoard.      The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has risen by about 36% over the past month. Oanda's Moya told CoinDesk in an interview that the bullish sentiment stemmed at least partly fueled by excitement over the much-anticipated public stock listing of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.      Now, the focus shifts back to institutional players with deep pockets, which could support the next leg higher above $60,000 in BTC.    “We’re in wait-and-see mode, in what seems to be a healthy consolidation right now for bitcoin. Market is recycling all the stories about top investment banks that already put their position on crypto,” said Moya.  Despite BTC’s struggle to break an all-time high around $61,000, Moya does not see short-term resistance as a barrier to continued upside. “Consensus is, a break above $60,000 is not a matter of if, but when. Next barrier is at $75,000.”  Institutional demand is needed to sustain the rally as retail investors have spent their stimulus dollars in other ways than just buying up BTC.  “Retail traders are probably bidding up altcoins after missing the big move in bitcoin,” said Moya.    Some altcoins have been outperforming BTC over the past month. Ether (ETH) reached an all-time high and is up about 60% since March. XRP is up about 90% over the same time period versus BTC’s gain of about 36%.

While bitcoin is trading nearly 1.5% higher on the day at $59,000 at press time, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against fiat currencies such as the euro, pound and yen, is 0.5% lower at 92.56.      Goldman Sachs on Friday recommended closing U.S. dollar short trades against a basket of currencies, including the commodity-sensitive Aussie and New Zealand dollars.      ""Although we still expect these currencies to appreciate versus the dollar over the coming quarters, firm U.S. growth and rising bond yields may keep the greenback supported over the short term,"" strategists including Zach Pandl wrote in a note titled ""tactical retreat,"" according to Bloomberg.      Goldman recommended short dollar trades on Oct. 9 when bitcoin was trading near $11,000, a far cry from the current $59,000. Bitcoin hit a record high of $61,557 last month.      Most major fiat currencies have also charted stellar gains over the past six months. Almost every asset denominated in dollar terms has rallied significantly over the past 12 months, courtesy of the Federal Reserve's open-ended liquidity-boosting program.      Betting against the dollar has been one of the most crowded trades of the last 12 months, as per Bank of America's monthly fund manager surveys.      Goldman, however, now fears that selling pressure around the dollar may weaken due to rising Treasury yields. The 10-year yield has surged by 80 basis points this year, making the greenback attractive for income-seeking investors.

42386376,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSlcl,1617649046,'Satoshi's Birthday': April 5 Is a Day to Be Thankful for Bitcoin,"My last two posts cast doubt on bitcoin’s near-term prospects as a payment system for everyday and even big-ticket purchases. Today brings a haunting reminder of why it’s valued nonetheless.      Eighty-eight years ago, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed executive order 6102, which forbade the “hoarding” of gold. If I were smarter I would have started working on this post weeks ago, dug into contemporaneous newspaper articles and interviewed some historians. But the anniversary crept up on me. Long story short: Americans were given less than a month to turn in “all but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve” or face steep fines and prison, according to Wikipedia.      Reasonable people can disagree about monetary policy questions, but the civil liberties implications of the order, which was not repealed until 1974, are unquestionably chilling.      “Less than 100 years ago, in the United States of America, it was ILLEGAL to hoard gold. it was ILLEGAL to have a shiny rock in your home. I find that fact astonishing,” the bitcoin user and educator known as 6102Bitcoin said last year on Stephan Livera’s podcast.      That this happened in the Land of the Free along with more recent abuses of civil asset forfeiture laws underscores one reason why bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, despite being “backed by nothing” and lacking “intrinsic value” (the critics’ words, not mine), are worth something: They are hard to confiscate because wallets are controlled by cryptographic private keys, not a central administrator that can be subpoenaed.    Marc Hochstein, CoinDesk's executive editor, owns some bitcoin, and if he were smarter he'd have bought more years ago. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories on the future of money and Web 3.0. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Not impossible, but hard. As I wrote nearly four years ago:      Inb4 the strawmen: I am not claiming that cryptocurrency users are “above the law.” An individual who refuses to give up his private keys under court order can still be thrown in jail.      The point is that the government has to throw that person in jail, or perhaps beat him with the proverbial rubber hose, to get him to comply. It can’t unilaterally seize his funds. ...      In this way, cryptocurrency claws back a modicum of power for the individual.      Not for nothing did Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's mysterious creator, list April 5 as his or her birthday.    Can it happen again?    This raises an interesting if unsettling question: Could Uncle Sam try to pull a 6102 on bitcoin? Ray Dalio, the hedge fund manager and (shill alert!) upcoming speaker at Consensus 2021, thinks so.      “Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand,” the billionaire said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance. “They don't want other monies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control. So I think that it would be very likely that you will have [bitcoin], under a certain set of circumstances, outlawed the way gold was outlawed.”      Dalio noted India could be moving in this direction already, and that the public ledger of transactions may allow a government to track down who is holding the asset.      To which a hardened bitcoiner might reply: Come and take it.      Here’s 6102Bitcoin, from the same podcast interview:      I don’t imagine that these regulations or attempts at seizure would be particularly effective for a number of reasons. Firstly, bitcoin can move at the speed of light (with a 10-minute lag). Regulations take time to develop and in most countries a vote would be needed to confiscate bitcoin. Before the vote even takes place most owners of bitcoin would have transferred ownership outside the country, beyond regulatory reach.      Secondly, bitcoin can be controlled by numerous parties who operate under different regulations, making such confiscation unworkable. Finally, bitcoin can be hidden in plain sight and owners can build plausible deniability into the scheme used to hold bitcoin.      For example, some hardware wallets allow creation of a “hidden account” with a second passphrase so when under duress a user could give an extortionist the primary passphrase, which can unlock only a portion of the crypto.      Perhaps fittingly, the anniversary of executive order 6102 falls just after the last night of the Jewish holiday of Passover. Even if bitcoin is never accepted at the supermarket or dry cleaners, if all it does is give individuals a bulwark against unchecked confiscation, then dayenu – that would be enough.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | WALLET,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/05/satoshis-birthday-april-5-is-a-day-to-be-thankful-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be49095198e71c11395c2bcc7b643b51443e4177-1200x818.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386383,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSlkJ,1617647344,These Black Artists Say NFTs Help Them Monetize Their Work,"On March 12, Vakseen, a 41-year-old digital artist based in California, accepted an 8 ETH bid (around $16,800 as of Monday) for the first of six editions of a digital painting featuring legendary basketball player Michael Jordan.      The exposure from the sale of the painting, which was minted as a non-fungible token (NFT), led to Vakseen being commissioned for another digital art piece. At the time of publication, the third edition of the Michael Jordan painting is priced at 9 ETH (around $18,900) and bidding is ongoing.      Vakseen’s art was also on display at a NFT exhibition featuring Black artists from around the world. The exhibition, titled “Harmony & Balance,” mimicked a digital art museum and was created to support the Black NFT artist community. It featured over 100 digital art pieces by 30 Black artists, including Vakseen. The art featured in the exhibition was worth a total of around $500,000.      “There are so many hurdles and obstacles involved with gaining any sort of recognition within the art world as a Black man, as a man of color or as any person of color. The NFT space is changing that and the exhibition is giving us an opportunity to be seen,” Vakseen told CoinDesk.      Some Black artists told CoinDesk that, in addition to helping them independently monetize their work, the recent popularity of NFTs is opening up the typically exclusive art world to artists from diverse backgrounds.      Art minted as NFTs exploded in 2021, leading to digital artist Beeple selling an NFT art piece for $69.3 million in early March. Since the sale, more artists from around the world have begun minting their work as NFTs for sale via a range of platforms including OpenSea, Rarible, Mintable and Makersplace.      A number of initiatives geared towards amplifying Black artists in the digital space have come to life in the last year, including a Black NFT art club on social media platform Clubhouse to showcase Black artists, as well as the digital art gallery ONE/OFF, currently featuring 33 Black crypto artists.      According to data provided by ONE/OFF to Cuy Sheffield, head of crypto at Visa, between January and November 2020 just 58 Black crypto artists sold “a combined 513 pieces of crypto artwork for 1,132 ETH (total market value of $736,000).”      In the first two days after launching on March 27, the “Harmony & Balance” exhibition sold around 10 art pieces, one of which was valued at $4,000.      These efforts are still small compared to the multibillion-dollar global art auction market, but Isaiah Jackson, author of ""Bitcoin Black America"" and host of ""Community Crypto"" on CoinDesk TV, believes it’s only getting started.      ""The Black NFT art space has opened up a new world where crypto and creative minds come together ... This is just the beginning, and I believe the Black creative community will be the leaders in the space for years to come,” Jackson said.    Removing gatekeepers    In 2018, artwork by Black artists accounted for just 1.2% of the global art auction market.      Even as NFTs were taking off in 2021, Seyi Awotunde, U.K.-based entrepreneur and creator of the “Harmony & Balance” NFT exhibition, felt that talented Black artists were still not getting the attention they deserve.      “First I looked at Christie's, which sold Beeple, and I thought, why can't that be a Black artist to go on? There are so many incredibly gifted Black artists in their own right. There didn’t seem to be a great platform for them right now so I thought, why not go do it ourselves,” Awotunde told CoinDesk.      Awotunde began scouting for Black NFT artists to feature in the exhibition. One artist, 28-year-old Andre OShea, minted his first NFT artworks in October as a test run but never actually advertised or sold them. He minted another in February, which took 18 days to sell. But since then, thanks in part to advertising and the new popularity of NFTs, he sold three pieces ranging from 0.07-0.3 ETH ($150- $600) within 24 hours in March.      “As a Black artist, NFTs mean leveling the playing field and taking the keys away from traditional gatekeepers in the art world. It is also a way for me to uplift my community through creativity,” OShea told CoinDesk via an email.      Awotunde also met 24-year-old Canadian-Nigerian multimedia artist Lizzy Aroloye on Clubhouse because she asked questions on information forums about how to set up her own NFT. Aroloye reached out to him a few days later saying she’d already sold her first artwork; she was invited to join the exhibition.      Vakseen, familiar with the NFT world, was first scouted by NFT platform Makersplace to mint his art back in 2018. But Aroloye was new to the space and minted a collection of her art NFTs as recently as March 5. In under 24 hours she had sold one for 2.5 ETH (now around $5,000).      “Obviously, not everyone has this experience right off the bat but it gave me this reassurance that this is our space, and if we continue to do the work that we've always been doing this can be such a game changer,” Aroloye told CoinDesk.      After the exhibition sold 10 art pieces within the first two days, Awotunde decided to extend the show until April 4.",POSITIVE,ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/04/05/these-black-artists-say-nfts-help-them-monetize-their-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6519802ca89bce87bc40a053ea6ee6a54763178c-1920x1004.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386384,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSllZ,1617643699,"Latest 'Altcoin Season' Fueled by XRP, Tron, Stellar Pushes Crypto Market Value to $2T for First Time","Price rallies for cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin (BTC) has helped push the digital-asset industry's total market capitalization to about $2 trillion, doubling in just a few months.      These ""alternative cryptocurrencies,"" also known as altcoins, include ether (ETH) along with bittorrent (BTT), xrp (XRP), tron (TRX) and stellar (XLM). They have all logged double-digit percentage growth in the past 24 hours, according to data from Messari.      Prices for bitcoin have doubled this year, for a market value of $1.1 trillion, but the rally has paused in recent weeks, allowing altcoins to seize the market leadership. Bitcoin’s market dominance, or its share of the overall industry capitalization, has slid to about 57%, from around 73% at the start of the year, according to TradingView.      Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-biggest overall, recorded an all-time high near $2,100 last week. The digital asset has benefited from speculation that the Ethereum blockchain could see growing use as the network of choice for decentralized finance, or DeFi, consisting of automated, blockchain-based software protocols that might someday replace banks and Wall Street trading firms.      Galen Moore, CoinDesk Research’s director of data and indexes, wrote in an analysis that the outstanding performance during the latest “altcoin season” has come from digital tokens belonging to so-called smart-contract platforms that could compete with Ethereum or complement it.      These alternative blockchains also have benefited from increased usage of stablecoins, which are digital tokens whose value is pegged to real-world currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.      “I feel like the real value and application of stablecoin, decentralized finance on Tron, and BitTorrent has been identified,” Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain and CEO of BitTorrent, told CoinDesk via a WeChat message.      Daily transaction counts on Tron have been consistently surpassing the transactions on Ethereum, according to data from CoinDesk and Coin Metrics. The number of tether stablecoin transactions on the Tron blockchain has also beaten Ethereum’s count, as CoinDesk reported.      Yet, for Ethereum the success has come at a cost: The network's popularity has resulted in congestion, driving up transactional rates known as ""gas fees.""      “The competition between public blockchains is a good thing,” Tron’s Sun said. “It is true that it is nearly impossible to launch new projects on Ethereum because no one want to use projects that come with hundreds of dollars of mining cost at a slow transaction speed.”      One example of the fast industry growth, according to Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, is Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a smart-contracts blockchain sponsored by the giant cryptocurrency exchange Binance.      “The narrative is that if you provide innovative products, competitive yields, then one can compete with the old-school establishment” of Ethereum, Vinokourov told CoinDesk. ""The key is cheap, fast transactions.""      The total transaction volume on Binance Smart Chain in February alone hit more than $700 billion, according to a DappRadar report dated March 11. The unique active wallets on the blockchain increased to 108,000 in February from 30,000 the prior month. Ethereum in February had 67,000 unique active wallets.      “The growth of BSC is generally good for altcoins,” Vinokourov said. It “means you can compete against ether.”      A Binance spokesperson declined CoinDesk’s request to comment on the recent altcoin rally, including Binance’s BNB token.    Early crypto adopters vs. crypto newbies    Unlike bitcoin’s impressive growth since early 2020, much of it driven by institutional investors, the altcoin rally may have been fueled by early crypto adopters and retail investors who are newly arriving to the space.      “As institutional players enter the bitcoin market more and more, they have improved stability, which then begets more stability,” Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower, said. “While this new dynamic is a welcome development for many investors, it takes away some of the shininess and 'wild wild west' mentality that many early adopter crypto traders crave.”      Similar to retail investors’ interest in so-called “meme stocks” such as GameStop in the traditional stock market, many crypto traders like altcoins with higher volatility and risk than bitcoin – for the “excitement” and increased chances of “seeing multi-bag returns,” Steinglass said.      Arthur Cheong, founder and portfolio manager at DeFi-focused crypto fund DeFiance Capital, added that the renewed interest in altcoins also came from “unsophisticated retail” traders.      Traders who “don’t perform much research are coming back to the market,” Cheong said, citing increased trading volume of altcoins in South Korea, a country that’s primarily dominated by retail crypto investors.    What does the new alt season mean for bitcoin?    Though bitcoin's market dominance has waned, analysts said the growing interest in altcoins will eventually benefit the largest cryptocurrency.      “These early adopters shifting to altcoins will both work to decrease volatility in bitcoin and also eventually help decide the winners from the losers in the alt space, which is kind of a necessary condition for any altcoin to emerge as a viable longer-term asset,” Steinglass said.      Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain data provider CryptoQuant, said the heightened capital flows could also migrate back to bitcoin as time goes by.      Bitcoin “will absorb the altcoin market cap sooner or later,” Ju said.      Recent announcements of moves into cryptocurrencies by established financial players like Visa, PayPal, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have strengthened traders' confidence the industry is seeing greater mainstream adoption.      Bitcoin's rally over the past year has been fueled by speculation the oldest and largest cryptocurrency might be useful for investors as a hedge against inflation in the wake of trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related stimulus injected into financial markets by governments and central banks.      In addition to the growing speculation over DeFi, there's been a flurry of interest recently in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which represent stakes in unique assets such as art, collectibles, even sneakers.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET,"Muyao Shen, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/05/latest-altcoin-season-fueled-by-xrp-tron-stellar-pushes-crypto-market-value-to-2t-for-first-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c2da3b4529d95d6f9bae8d1b97d17c14ff9afb7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395303,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASYKnK,1617638315,Abkhazia Bans Bitcoin Mining Shortly After Legalizing It,"Abkhazia, a Russia-supported autonomous republic north of Georgia, has been a Wild West of crypto mining in recent years. Now, the government is putting an end to it.  On Wednesday, the parliament of Abkhazia passed a package of bills introducing steep fines for illegal use of electricity and prolonged a ban on crypto mining that was originally set to expire in May. The measures are aimed at tackling ongoing power shortages. Now, all mining operations are illegal until May 2022, the online news website Kavkaz Uzel reported.  Abkhazia offers an example of how a crypto industry can bloom in the political and economic instability of a self-proclaimed state with a lack of international recognition and a struggling economy. It also shows the party can end as soon as the government gets nervous.  It’s unclear how many miners and firms the ban will affect in Abkhazia because the industry has been operating in a gray zone for a while.  Still, mining appears to be popular, even though Abkhazia routinely struggles with power shortages. The price for electricity has been extremely low for many years, which incentivized both commercial mining farms from abroad and local individual miners.  “Almost every household has some mining machines. Many people in the countryside do,” Abkhazian political expert Tengiz Jopua told CoinDesk by phone.  Everyone in Abkhazia knows someone who’s mining, Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta wrote in March.  “People would sell their cattle and cars to buy [mining] equipment. For some, it became the main source of income. The social and economic situation is quite complicated at the moment. Many people lost their jobs, many businesses are not profitable and the pandemic restrictions didn’t help. It’s a natural behavior of people in a situation like this,” Jopua said.  Struggling region  Abkhazia, a nation of around 250,000 people, broke away from Georgia in 1999 and has since been recognized as an independent nation by only a handful of countries, including Russia, Syria, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Nauru and Vanuatu.  The nation borders Georgia and Russia, on which Abkhazia heavily relies economically. Abkhazia and Georgia were at war in the early 1990s, and their relationship remains tense.  However, they still share the Inguri hydropower plant, located on the border: Georgia takes 60% of the electricity the plant produces while Abkhazia takes 40%. In theory, the power plant provides enough electricity for Abkhazia, said former economy minister Adgur Ardzinba, but the power lines are so worn out that much of the electricity doesn’t reach consumers. In addition to this, the plant was shut down for repair in January.  The result is a constant electricity deficit, leading to routine nationwide power outages. Even in the capital, Sukhumi, people would have no power for a couple of hours each day.  “Every night they would shut off electricity for one to two hours, sometimes during the day, too,” Jopua said.  The country requested “significant amounts” of energy from Russia between 2017 and 2019, Ardzinba said over a call.  In 2020, a new government came to power; in September, it legalized crypto mining, lifting a previous ban that had been in force since 2018. Electricity consumption spiked, Ardzinba said.  The price for electricity in Abkhazia is less than 1 cent per kilowatt per hour, both for individual users and businesses, which made the country a mecca for miners.  “This price is not adequate. It's the legacy of the war times,” said Jopua. “But the attempts to raise it are usually met with protests.”  Abkhazia’s government will have to raise energy costs at some point, said Ardzinba.  The cheap electricity attracted many miners from abroad, especially from Russia, Jopua said, adding that locals often don’t have enough money to buy ASICs and can only purchase a small number of used machines on the secondary market.  Jakhon Khabilov, CEO of the mining pool Sigmapool, believes there were tens of thousands of ASICs working in the region, owned by partnerships of Russian and Abkhazian entrepreneurs. By now, most of them have been unplugged, although not all miners have been able to get the machines out of the republic, he said.  The number of machines imported to Abkhazia is hard to estimate because some are brought in illegally. Many farms belong to government members, although they won’t confirm that officially, Jopua said.  Mining farms have been recently found on government-owned factories. An aide to a local lawmaker recently lost his job for illegally bringing mining machines to Abkhazia from Russia using a government-owned vehicle.  The crackdown  This year the government took the situation seriously and began shutting down mining farms. Multiple venues with thousands of ASICs were reportedly shut down in a series of police raids.  As a result, institutional miners started leaving Abkhazia, taking the equipment back to Russia. By now, most of them have left the country, an individual familiar with the local mining community told CoinDesk.  It’s harder to crack down on farmers who keep small bunches of ASICs in their homes and barns. “The country is small, people hear about raids in advance, they can unplug the mining machines before the raid and plug it back in after,” Jopua said.  At some point, the internet providers were helping the government by blocking the IP addresses of mining pools, but it didn’t help in the long run as people circumvented the blocks, he added.  “Everyone needs free money,” Jopua said.  Sigmapool's Khabilov believes that the ban might not last long and get lifted as soon as the repair of the Inguri plant eases the electricity shortage: “First, they halted everything to figure out who is mining and where, then, they will likely allow mining again, but with the new rules.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TRADING,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/05/abkhazia-bans-bitcoin-mining-shortly-after-legalizing-it,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3eab8f04d4dbb6c27e2c32c26edf68bc0bbdfb00-1200x773.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386374,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSlWT,1617632987,There’s More to Inflation Than the Money Supply,"In a prior column, I argued it’s a myth that America is headed towards catastrophic hyperinflation. I got a lot of angry messages on Twitter about this, and nearly all of them (that weren’t obscene) cited quantitative easing (QE), where central banks buy financial assets to increase the money supply.      The money supply has indeed grown significantly and the U.S. is about to embark on a historic experiment in combining very loose monetary policy with a big fiscal stimulus. This may seem like pouring gasoline on a fire, but there are four good reasons to think it might work out very well.    The velocity factor    The money supply may be much bigger but the velocity of money dropped dramatically at the start of the pandemic and is recovering slowly. The velocity of money is just how fast money moves between parties. Simply put, no matter how much money exists in an economy, if nobody spends it, the economy is actually very small.    Paul Brody is EY's Global Blockchain leader.    At the start of the pandemic, people chose to save rather than spend, and the rate at which money changes hands declined dramatically. In fact, it was the steepest drop ever recorded, even a bit steeper than during the 2008-9 financial crisis, according to Federal Reserve data. QE raised the amount of money in the economy in an attempt to offset this decline, but even so the U.S. had its worst quarter of GDP decline ever in Q2 2020 and output remains below the pre-pandemic level now.    The output gap    Though the economy has staged a big recovery since the beginning of the pandemic, not only are we still below our pre-recession output, but the potential output we can achieve has been growing. The output gap is the difference between what is being produced by the economy and what could be produced. The size of the output gap is a good measure of how much the economy can grow without triggering inflation because companies want to raise output before they start raising prices.      See also: Paul Brody - This Isn’t the Revolution I Signed Up For      Even though we have been in a deep recession, in fact the economy’s output capacity has continued to rise. Indeed, there is a growing group of economists who believe the pandemic has kicked the digital transformation of the U.S. economy into overdrive. Instead of an orderly and conservative implementation of new technology, the pandemic caused a stampede as companies switched to home working.      One good estimate is that the pandemic packed a decade’s worth of transformation and acceleration into a single year. If other parts of the economy have been as suddenly and as swiftly transformed as the retail sector, productivity may well continue to grow rapidly.      Current estimates are that we have an output gap of between $400 billion and $700 billion in the U.S. and the gap is even larger in other parts of the world that have not pursued such large stimulus packages. Even if the U.S. closes its output gap, companies may turn to more productivity technology and imports before they start raising prices.    Online shopping    There has been remarkably little inflation in the last 20 years, despite several time periods where the U.S. economy seemed to be running hot with high demand and low unemployment. Increasingly, economists think that online shopping may have made it much harder for companies to raise prices.    No matter how much money exists in an economy, if nobody spends it, the economy is actually very small.    Consumers don’t like rising prices, but in the past they may not always have had a lot of choices. Today, online shopping means not only can people compare prices but they can also easily find substitutes at lower prices. And while not everyone carefully does comparison shopping, enough are doing so that companies will notice demand changes quickly and social media makes it easy for people to spread the word about cheaper alternatives.      The result: Companies have struggled to raise prices and make them stick.    A little inflation?    For all these reasons, even with strong demand and loose monetary policy, there is still a risk that we will see a small but noticeable burst of inflation. The economy is a super-tanker not a speedboat, and changes in big policies like interest rates can take a while to filter into the economy. Even if the Federal Reserve raises rates today, for example, if you have locked in a low-interest rate mortgage for several years you may not see immediate effects on your cost of living or your buying decisions.      See also: Paul Brody - Forget GIFs, NFTs Are Essential Infrastructure      If inflation does start up and look to be sticking, central banks in the biggest economies, such as the U.S. and Europe, are charged with the responsibility of maintaining long-term economic stability. While no institution can be entirely insulated from politics, both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have strong institutional structures that prevent short-term politics from upsetting long-term economic goals. In the U.S., the Fed’s board of governors are appointed to staggered 14-year terms.      People should worry about significant bursts of inflation in countries where the rule of law and the independence of central banks is not guaranteed. When that happens, the option to print money for political gain now and pain later can be very tempting.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paul Brody,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/04/05/theres-more-to-inflation-than-the-money-supply,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/186480eec4b28909ee1f58295c40c904e1422c74-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSlgX,1617626496,"Fearing Being Cut Off From SWIFT, Russia Hints About Blockchain Alternative: Report","The development of blockchain and digital currencies shows that in the future, global settlements might take place on a new technological platform rather than on the SWIFT payments network, said the deputy head of Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alexander Pankin, talking to the RIA Novosti news agency on Monday.      Pankin said future alternatives to SWIFT will be more advanced and not dependent on being a monopoly. The emergence of such alternatives will be ""not only a reaction to the current geopolitical situation but a response to the need to modernize the existing payment methods using the top digital innovations,"" Pankin said.      The statement comes after the country's authorities voiced concerns recently that Western countries might cut Russia off from the SWIFT. In late March, the press secretary for Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, said the Kremlin ""cannot rule out"" that threat.      Fears of Russia getting cut off SWIFT have been voiced over and over in Russia's ruling circles after the country got sanctioned in 2014 for annexing the Crimea peninsula. Back then, the first round of sanctions prompted the creation of a national payment system that would be working even if SWIFT was no longer available in Russia.      Read more: Bank of Russia Eyes Digital Ruble Prototype in Late 2021: Report      Those concerns apparently mounted further as the relationship between Russia and the West deteriorated this winter, after Putin's most vocal critic, Alexey Navalny, was first poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent, then imprisoned in Russia soon after he recovered. At the moment, Navalny is in a penal colony. According to him, Navalny had been denied necessary medical help and his health has worsened significantly.

42386381,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBSlhn,1617620371,XRP Hits Two-Month Price High in Wake of Ether Rally,"XRP, the cryptocurrency used in Ripple Labs' payments network, is rallying on the coattails of altcoin leader ether's recent move to record highs.      XRP rose to $0.72 early Monday to hit the highest level since Feb. 2 and was last seen changing hands near $0.70. The third-largest cryptocurrency by market value has gained 18% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The price rise comes three days after the Ethereum blockchain's ether token set new lifetime highs near $2,100. Since then, the second-largest coin has established a foothold above $2,000, helping XRP and few other alternative cryptocurrencies such as tron, stellar, orchid, bitcoin cash, and eos score gains amid the dull action in bitcoin – the crypto market leader.      ""We're not seeing anything specific to XRP and the move feels more like an altcoin season type move given outperformance in other tokens as well,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. Names like TRON and siacoin ""are performing even better than XRP on this more thinly traded Easter holiday Monday.""      With a move to two-month highs, XRP has now completely reversed losses suffered in December after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a case against Ripple for raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP in unregistered securities offerings.      Ripple executives' attorney James K Filan tweeted on Saturday that Ripple and the SEC have reached an agreement to keep the payment company's two of the four private email correspondences from being scrutinized under the ongoing lawsuit. So far, analysts are not sure if that's powering XRP higher.      However, according to chart studies, the cryptocurrency's prospects look bright, one analyst said.      ""XRP has formed an inverse 'head and shoulder' pattern with head at 20 cents and shoulders at 40 cents, and neckline resistance passing through 70 cents,"" Delta Exchange CEO Pankaj Balani told CoinDesk.      Balani foresees XRP rallying to $1.00 and possibly $1.30 on a breakout above the neckline resistance.      ""The pattern has formed over the six months; therefore, in case of a breakout, the bullish move is expected to be quick and sustainable,"" Balani said in a WhatsApp chat, adding that volatility is likely to remain high due to the SEC lawsuit.
