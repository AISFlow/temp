42398078,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG4BM,1418939138,ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan: We Won't Sell User Data,"UPDATE (30th December 12:55pm GMT): Professor Emin Gün Sirer has responded to Changetip CEO Nick Sullivan's comments in a new blog post on privacy, profit and the future of the micropayments industry.      ""I feel like we're a charity getting yelled at.""  That was the initial, emotional reaction of founder and CEO Nick Sullivan to a wave of criticism launched yesterday against his micropayments startup, ChangeTip, a company that has emerged as one of bitcoin's most buzzed-about businesses for its efforts to promote bitcoin as a force for fun and social good.  In just a few short weeks, ChangeTip has raised $3.5m in seed funding, hired a former product manager from Blockchain and reported a surprising surge in user metrics as high as 10,000 transactions in a single day. The developments were seen as not only a validation of ChangeTip, but as the startup contends, proof that online tipping could become a powerful use case that helps propel the technology out of the early adopter phase.  This lengthy praise period, however, has given way to backlash, as members of the bitcoin community reacted to an article entitled ""ChangeTip Must Die"", authored by Cornell University computer science professor and noted bitcoin observer Emin Gün Sirer.  The polarizing post took aim at ChangeTip for everything from the candor of its users to its plans for monetization, though it was perhaps the criticisms of the company's data collection policies that carried the most weight among privacy-conscious bitcoin users. The piece speculated that ""the only way"" for ChangeTip to make money would be for it to sell the information it collects about bitcoin users by observing their social media accounts.  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, Sullivan acknowledged that ChangeTip hasn't been as clear with its users amidst its recent surge in attention, a factor he believes has led to confusion among users about the company and its policies.  Sullivan said:  ""We have a privacy policy in big bold letters that says we will not sell user data without user permission, and we have no intention of ever doing so. It's fair for people to be paranoid, but there are no witches to be found here.""  The former mentor at bitcoin-friendly startup incubators Plug and Play Tech Center and 500 Startups cited his long-time advocacy for privacy as evidence against this claim. In particular, he noted his time as VP of technology at Krux Digital, where he helped form a do-not-track policy aiming to empower users.  ""I've spent a good chunk of the last five years opposing this,"" he said.  In the interview, Sullivan opened up about his vision for ChangeCoin, the parent company for which ChangeTip will be just the first product, as well as how he plans to become the ""Yahoo of bitcoin"", the tool that finally makes bitcoin approachable for everyday consumers.  ""I'm envisioning a world where instead of a grandma sending a check in the mail for her grandson's birthday, she actually goes on Facebook and leaves a tip that says here's $5 on ChangeTip,"" Sullivan added.  Plumbing for micropayments  Though taken aback by the recent criticism, Sullivan said that the more inflammatory Internet comments don't paint a detailed picture of his vision for ChangeCoin.  To understand how ChangeCoin will monetize and grow, Sullivan said, users need to see the full breadth of its goals, which envision building a new ""micropayments infrastructure for the web"" on top of bitcoin. While careful not to provide too many details about the company's plans, Sullivan hinted at how an emphasis on technology could empower ChangeCoin.  ""If we become the easiest way for money to move around online over social media, there's going to be a lot of ways to monetize that,"" he asserted. ""We're not going to have to resort to selling user data in order to live up to the financial projections that I laid out in our recent round of funding.""  Sullivan, however, kept the focus on ChangeCoin's potential broad. Technology, he said, will be the company's focus and the best way for it to not only monetize, but create a whole ecosystem of products and services that want to harness micropayments.  ""The technology team is building an API that people can build on top of our platform,"" he said. ""We're not trying to own the whole piece, we just want to enable the plumbing.""  A charitable focus  That isn't to say that ChangeCoin won't seek to monetize ChangeTip in the near term.  Sullivan framed charitable donations as a big part of the company's focus for 2015, suggesting that he will seek to encourage major charities to pay for using ChangeTip as another way to collect donations.  ""For charities where we're able to funnel newfound money into their hands, they'll be glad to give us a percentage fee from that,"" he said, noting that this could in turn help distance bitcoin from its associations with fraud and crime.  Such an idea would appear to be timely. US charities have shown an increasing interest in bitcoin, with the American Red Cross, Greenpeace USA and the Wikimedia Foundation, all striking partnerships with major bitcoin payment processors.  Sullivan also indicated that he sees these organizations as more likely to work with a young company like ChangeCoin through any friction during the payments process.  ""The hungrier you are, the more likely you are to go through some friction or some pain,"" he added.  Sullivan also touched on the planned 1% transaction feehttps://www.changetip.com/collect/125510 that ChangeTip has discussed implementing on withdrawals this January, stating that while the company doesn't want to set the precedent that its service is free, such a charge on users could be postponed again.  A need for abstraction  Yet another criticism levied against ChangeTip by Sirer is that the company has built a centralized tipping service similar to ones already marketed including Beenz and Flooz, though on top of the bitcoin blockchain.  In his remarks, Sullivan didn't shy away from describing ChangeTip as a centralized service, though he stressed that this is largely due to the current technological implications of bitcoin, as well as the needs of a service like ChangeTip.  ""Microtransactions on the bitcoin network aren't really feasible. We have a minimum bitcoin transaction fee, 10 minutes for the average transaction and a total capacity within the bitcoin network of seven transactions per second,"" he said, adding:  ""We felt architecturally we were going to overwhelm that in a short amount of time and we wanted to build a platform that scaled, so we're off-chain with our tips, that enables our tips to be free and instant.""  He further argued that centralizing the control of certain aspects of ChangeTip accounts, including the control of user public and private keys, currently creates the most usable end product for consumers.  ""It's nice to be able to send somebody money over GitHub, Reddit and Twitter, without having to think about what a public key is, what a QR code is or having to worry about cold storage. In our efforts to make it an easy onboarding process for bitcoin, I think there needs to be a little bit of a abstraction on some of the more technical pieces,"" he said.  Compromise necessary  Notably, Sullivan also expressed a willingness on behalf of ChangeCoin to embrace change as bitcoin's technology becomes more sophisticated with the launch of now-proposed projects such as the sidechains initiative.  In the meantime, Sullivan also alluded to the company's decision to use multisig bitcoin wallet provider BitGo to secure all of its offline storage, a move that he said will ensure no single person has access to user funds held by ChangeTip.  With the partnership, ChangeTip has become one of an increasingly varied set of bitcoin businesses and service providers that have sought to partner with BitGo as a means to bolster security.  ""While I'd love to keep everyone happy, I'm not sure we're going to be able to do that,"" Sullivan conceded. ""I think that we can agree around the common point that there is a balance between security and convenience.""  Sullivan went on to encourage those who have found fault with this company to see ChangeTip as just one of a number of bitcoin services that could one day become part of everyday life.  ""I think it's a little misguided for folks to hold ChangeTip to the same thought processes they would a paper wallet when its different use cases,"" he said.  Sullivan noted that the company plans to reach out to the community for feedback on how it could decentralize its model in the coming days.

42398075,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG4AN,1418934018,GAW Miners Altcoin Launch Sparks Speculative Frenzy,"UPDATE (19th December 01:08 BST): Reports indicate that GAW Miners has begun the process of distributing paycoins to its customers.      The weekend launch of GAW Miners’ new altcoin, paycoin, led to a speculative boom in mining rig rental prices and a rarely seen boost in altcoin trading.  Paycoin  launched on 12th December, kickstarting both a sharp jump in hosted mining prices and a period of sustained trading on several altcoin exchanges. The coin has attracted attention due to the ongoing discussion surrounding GAW Miners, promises of crypto 2.0 functionality and a commitment to shore up its price at $20.  The altcoin saw significant amounts of hashing power both at launch and since, with as much as 50 PH/s directed toward the coin at fluctuating periods during the week. With 12m paycoins already premined for the company’s investment partners and customers, only about 500,000 paycoins are available for public mining.  The paycoin launch took place amid continued scrutiny of US-based GAW, which is in the process of shifting from a cloud mining-based business model to that of a cryptocurrency payment service and altcoin development team. In past comments, GAW staff, including CEO Josh Garza, have said that the shifting landscape of the mining industry requires change, though critics and customers have voiced scepticism about the bitcoin firm’s evolving nature.  Garza described the launch as ""record-smashing"", telling CoinDesk that its customer base remains its primary focus as development of paycoin continues.  He explained:  “When we built paycoin’s model, we built it with the idea that we would be willing to sell and willing to buy them for $20. One of the amazing things about digital currency is that it is decentralized and open, allowing anyone to work with it. What we are focused on as a company is our customers.”  Speculative boom hits exchanges, rig rentals  The paycoin launch comes months after GAW first announced the project. The company made its name as a hardware reseller. Earlier this year, it shifted to rig hosting and later began offering cloud mining services.  This evolution hasn't taken place without issue, however. GAW continues to face accusations of misleading its customers, criticisms that ultimately came to the fore in a comments section melee for a recent story on the WSJ BitBeat blog.  Similar debates about GAW and its practices have played out on social media platforms as well, with detractors alleging fraud and misrepresentation and supporters dismissing those concerns as factually unsound. The company has also been dogged by complaints regarding platform glitches, low payouts and an overly active approach to moderating its forum, Hash Talk.  Despite the controversy, paycoin attracted a lot of attention from miners after being listed on popular mining profitability service CoinWarz. Several websites that connect rig owners with potential renters saw a rapid price increase over the weekend owing to the high debut price of paycoin on several altcoin exchanges, with rental prices reaching as much as 0.15 BTC per terahash for a 24 hour-long session earlier this week.  The coin launch sparked a competitive race between a few public pools that emerged following the Friday release, including pools hosted by SuchPool, MinerPools and others. At least one operator has sustained several DDOS attacks, a tactic seen during other coin launches as pools vie for blocks and the rewards they offer.  As with many altcoin launches, a small number of pools have dominated the race for blocks, with MinerPools controlling more than three-quarters of the paycoin network over the weekend at one point.  Several altcoin exchanges, most notably Coin-Swap, were among those who first listed the coin. In early trading the price for a single paycoin reached $24 – that trend has since declined, and at press time, paycoin is trading at an average of 0.02 BTC, or about $6. Coins have also been made available for sale on the official paycoin site for $20 apiece.  GAW staff, including Garza, have indicated that the listing was unplanned and that a broader exchange roll-out is pending. Coin-Swap staff say that communications with the company were friendly and contributed to a smooth – if not high-volume – integration. At the time of this writing, the 24-hour volume for Coin-Swap’s paycoin market is about 850 BTC.  The rush for rig rentals appears to have relaxed alongside the price of paycoin. According to NiceHash, the cost for a 24-hour rental has fallen to roughly 0.035 BTC per terahash.  A proof-of-stake system, based on peercoin  Paycoin is a fork of peercoin, an early descendent of bitcoin that was the first cryptocurrency to deploy the proof-of-stake transaction verification system. Under proof-of-stake, miners utilize their own coin holdings rather than hashing power to process transactions and generate new coins.  GAW cited peercoin's long-standing position as a crypto project as the driving factor for choosing to fork paycoin from it. The paycoin source code can be found here.  How the paycoin network will be managed makes it unique among altcoins today, including peercoin. GAW has sold proprietary wallets in advance of the coin launch, as well as allowed customers to exchange existing mining contracts for the wallets. GAW has said that it will manage these wallets out of its existing data center space.  The network as a whole plans to be supported by a kind of masternode structure similar to the one deployed by darkcoin. GAW’s white paper outlines how this infrastructure will help propagate transaction data, and the company itself plans to operate a number of these nodes.  According to GAW, major changes to the existing peercoin codebase include per-block difficulty targeting and variance for large swings in hashing power. This, the company said, is the reason for the fluctuating difficulty that paycoin miners may be seeing at this time.  Garza explained that the base infrastructure for paycoin’s additional mechanics is in place, though other elements of the paycoin project are in active development and are being tested, he said.  In past statements, both Garza and members of the GAW community have speculated that paycoin will address the flaws they see in bitcoin, pointing to price volatility and the need to wait as much as an hour for transactions to settle. By shifting its resources to focus on the project, GAW is betting that paycoin can compete with bitcoin as the digital currency of choice.  In a November interview with Mint News Press Garza suggested that ultimately, consumers will pass over bitcoin in favor of other options.  “I don’t believe that the bitcoin has a chance to be a viable currency,"" Garza said at the time.  Development continues as questions linger  Paycoin’s proof-of-work phase is expected to end in the next 48 hours, after which time the network will shift to proof-of-stake verification. In the meantime, GAW customers and critics alike have begun speculating on the future of the project.  On Monday, GAW is expected to launch a new money management platform, PayBase, as well as begin offering price support for the currency, though recent comments on social media from staff including Garza suggest that it may take “some time” before the paycoin price sees stability.  Though funds have reportedly been distributed to the company’s investors, it remains unclear when customers will be actually be able to start accessing funds.  Earlier this week it was announced that customers will need to submit personal information before receiving access to funds on PayBase. As well, the platform's original launch date was shifted from this coming Friday to Monday. Garza has since clarified in a post on Hash Talk that a potential solution is in the works that will enable access without prior verification, but said that compliance with KYC regulations has reduced available options without those steps.  Questions have also been raised about the name “paycoin”. According to Bitcoin Talk, stakeholders to an existing project that uses the same name (sign: PYC) and has been traded on exchanges like Cryptsy since September 2013 are voicing opposition to GAW’s launch, claiming that the company improperly filed for trademark ownership. GAW has countered that stakeholders are looking to take advantage of the company’s success.  GAW said its focus is on releasing its new platform as it shifts away from mining and toward new services like digital currency e-commerce solutions. This, as well as maintaining and building out its new cryptocurrency network, remain top priorities.  “We are developing a strong platform for Paycoin which will support the idea of having it integrated in every day life,” Garza said.

42398069,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG42V,1418928353,Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine: Central Bank Warning Isn't a Ban,"Ukraine's local chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation has spoken out against a recent statement by the central bank concerning the legal status of bitcoin in the country.  In a document issued last month, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) says it considers bitcoin “a money substitute that has no real value, and cannot be used by individuals and legal entities in Ukraine as a mean of payment”.  The central bank continues that bitcoin is a “high risk factor” in financial transactions and that the institution has no responsibility for transactions made with the use of cryptocurrency and any potential losses incurred by the contracting sides.  The warning echoes a number of similar statements made by central banks from around the world, including Argentina, Columbia and Thailand, along with many others.  Foundation reacts  However, there has been some confusion over whether the bank meant to imply that bitcoin use is actually illegal or whether it was merely saying the digital currency is not legal tender.  Bitcoin Foundation Ukraine  has recently given its opinion on the matter, saying that the NBU’s statement does not contain a direct prohibition of cryptocurrency use, but is merely a reminder that the national currency, the Ukranian hryvnia, is the only official means of payment.  The chapter said in a statement:  ""The NBU (mistakenly) believes bitcoin is a surrogate currency and has no intention to recognise, regulate, delegalize bitcoin. In other words, this means bitcoin is not forbidden nor illegal, but the NBU would not recommend using it, and would not … provide any support.”  Ruslan Khorin from the BFU told CoinDesk that the Ukrainian government has little understanding of the advantages offered by cryptocurrencies and that the country’s unstable political and economical situation could be key to the future of digital currencies in Ukraine.  However, “the situation is, in general, rather unstable, and both the [banning] of cryptocurrencies or their regulation could happen in the future,” Khorin said.  According to the BFU, it is also currently unclear to the country's authorities what kind of taxation, if any, should be applied to bitcoin transactions, and, as a result, it ""would certainly be difficult to operate a national bitcoin exchange without external clearing connections.""  Boost to bitcoin?  Ukraine's financial woes have deepened since the outbreak of the military conflict with pro-Russian forces in the east of the country.  In October 2014, the country’s inflation rate was at 19.8%, compared to 0.5% back in January, while Ukraine's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 5.1% in the third quarter of this year, according to data released by the NBU.  On 13th of December, the Ukrainian hryvnia's interbank rate fell to 15.9 against the US dollar, which represents a devaluation of almost 50% since the beginning of the year, as reported by the local media.  Local observers say that the Ukrainian banking system is becoming increasingly insolvent, with customers withdrawing their deposits amid widespread fears of a financial slump.  Could this unstable financial situation provide a boost for bitcoin, if it is perceived as a safer store of value than the hryvnia?  Khorin said:  “The difficulties endured by the national currency, which has lost more than 50% of its value in comparison to the US dollar could force such a situation that the demand for cryptocurrencies by Ukrainians will increase. But, at the same time, old fashioned politicians might judge it as a threat to the current system.”  Despite opposition to digital currencies by some politicians, Khorin indicated that the outlook for bitcoin is favourable, but that “there is still very much to be done” to raise popular awareness in the broader population.  Furthermore, the grey area that exists regarding taxation of cryptocurrencies would be a hurdle for bitcoin trading, possibly ruling out the appearance of Ukranian exchanges without external clearing connections. Other cryptocurrency startups and developers would likely experience difficulties too, he added.

42398068,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG43U,1418920278,Lawsky Outlines Revisions to New York's BitLicense in DC Speech,"Benjamin M. Lawsky announced the latest revisions to the draft BitLicense today in Washington, DC, presenting a host of changes in response to reactions from its public comment period.  The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent delivered the news this morning during a keynote speech hosted by think tank Bipartisan Policy Center, where he touched on the regulatory landscape surrounding digital currencies and other payment technologies.  Lawsky first clarified which players in the digital currency community and industry would be required to obtain the BitLicense, specifying that the NYDFS intends to regulate only financial intermediaries.  Software developers, miners and those who issue loyalty and rewards schemes and gift cards denominated in fiat currency will not be required to obtain a BitLicense. The exemptions also apply to individuals who buy and hold virtual currency for personal investment, as well as virtual currency-accepting merchants and their customers.  Lawsky also said that the NYDFS has reduced the proposed record-keeping requirement for licensees from 10 to seven years, and eliminated a stipulation that licensees must obtain addresses and transaction data for all parties in a transaction.  Licensees now only need to obtain that information ""for their own customers or account holders"" and, to the extent possible, for ""counterparties to the transaction"", according to the superintendent.  Lastly, the updates allow for a more broad range of financial assets that can be counted towards licensees' capital requirements that includes virtual currency.  A transitional BitLicense  Lawsky addressed the provision of the framework that affect startup companies in the space, which he presented at the Money 2020 conference in November.  The so-called “transitional BitLicense” is granted for two years to small businesses that are unable to satisfy each of the requirements of the full BitLicense as they build their operations.  “Those firms will still be required to meet robust standards for consumer protection and anti-money laundering requirements,” he said. “But we wanted to provide some flexibility as the firms work to get off the ground.”  The provision is a response to wide concern across the community that the costs of regulatory compliance could be too high for fledgling virtual currency enterprises.  Unleashing innovation  The changes address and clarify the many concerns submitted by the bitcoin community around the degree of regulation proposed potentially being too restrictive for innovation to thrive.  However, Lawsky presented a bullish position on digital currency's place in the US payments system and the need for banks and regulators to adapt to and encourage next-generation payments in an increasingly digitized world.  ""Virtual currency could eventually cause some amount of self-reflection in the legacy financial system,"" he said. ""If banks continue to torpedo even modest updates to the payment system, they ultimately do run at least some risk of facing the Blockbuster Video problem.""  He added:  ""At a certain point, enough is enough – and four decades of slow-to-non-existent progress in the bank payments system seems like fair warning.""  Responding to comments  The NYDFS has received a myriad of comments from the community totaling more than 3,700, which have now been made publicly available on its website and some of which Lawsky addressed in his keynote.  ""Ultimately, in response to public comments, we determined that the original requirement simply would not be workable in the virtual currency context,"" he said.  They included concerns from the Electronic Frontier Foundation among others that the record-keeping provision of the BitLicense would affect not only those who meet the qualifications of a BitLicensee but also those inadvertently affected by transactions whose information would be held for 10 years.  Comments also revealed concerns from Walmart and Amazon that the definition of ‘virtual currency’ might be so broad as to include its own prepaid value and gift cards.  The full text of the revisions will be available ""in the coming days"", Lawsky said, followed by another 30-day comment period.  A final version of the BitLicense framework is expected in January, one year after the initial hearings began in New York.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/18/lawsky-outlines-revisions-to-new-yorks-bitlicense-in-dc-speech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8cbe938a2e8a02c3b9e3755d38b8c12ea8b0b2f1-1266x567.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398079,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbG4EJ,1418913670,Developers Meet for Crash Course in Crypto at Blockchain University Launch,"""I love the blockchain, just not bitcoin.""  This phrase has become one of the overarching sentiments of 2014, echoed by everyone from industry entrepreneurs to corporate CEOs at some of the world's largest payments and banking giants.  Though the statement has been both praised and knocked, it successfully highlights how the bitcoin industry has evolved in the last 12 months.  No longer is bitcoin's technology viewed as disruptive only to the financial world. Rather, a new class of entrepreneurs is seeking to uncover how bitcoin's underlying ledger technology can be used to build everything from decentralized social apps to file storage services.  To take these applications even further, however, the crypto 2.0 segment of the bitcoin community will need a new wave of developers who recognize this vision.  Amidst this backdrop, Blockchain University held its launch event yesterday at the Consensus HQ co-working space in Mountain View, California. The inaugural event consisted of presentations designed to inform the audience about the program's curriculum and to give compelling reasons why developers should learn how to build applications on top of bitcoin's blockchain.  Around 75 people attended the launch, which was was sponsored by Koinify, Skuchain and China Fortune Land Development (CFLD), a real-estate investment company.  Notably, CFLD is building an incubator at Consensus HQ with the aim of investing in startups that focus broadly on blockchain technology as well as IT, clean energy and bioscience.  Described as ""a pure blockchain course for serious developers"", Blockchain University is a free 10-week program that starts January 10, 2015.  Moving on from currency  Giving the keynote speech at the launch was Adam Ludwin, CEO of blockchain API provider Chain. Ludwin made a short presentation that sought to underscore the promise of blockchain technology, his remarks aimed at encouraging attending developers to think big when innovating in the space.  Starting by informing the audience about the perils of thinking about bitcoin simply as a form of currency, the entrepreneur whose firm has raised nearly $10m in total VC funding told the audience:  “Bitcoin is the worst investment of 2014. It’s worse than the [Russian] ruble. So why are we here?”  The talk provided further evidence that some of bitcoin's more mainstream companies see the larger vision for how they could enable a broader bitcoin ecosystem. The coming year will primarily focus on building blockchain-based apps on bitcoin's secure network, protected by the hashing power of miners, Ludwin said.  He cited Skuchain, a stealth startup aimed at disrupting the logistics industry, as a ""cool"" example of that.  Blockchain University instructor Zaki Manian, a founder at SKUChain, echoed the same sentiment during his short presentation, though he hinted at some of the technology issues that may prevent this goal.  ""Proof of work is scarce. There’s only one proof of work [coin] that has the mining power that stands behind bitcoin,"" he said.  'The sky is the limit'  After the speaker presentations, there followed a panel session, moderated by author Tim Swanson. Taking part were Blockchain University instructors Tom Ding, CEO of Koinify; Ryan X Charles, cryptocurrency engineer at Reddit; Ryan Smith, CTO of Chain; and Atif Nazir, CEO of Block.io.  Charles, who as a cryptocurrency engineer at Reddit said he is working on some interesting products, sees massive potential for bitcoin's blockchain to be a dominating force in technology going forward and at his mainstream social media company.  ""[Bitcoin] is really just not like anything that has happened before. The sky is literally the limit,"" he said.  Block.io's Nazir, whose company builds API products for blockchain and wallet applications, indicated that the purpose of Blockchain University is to get developers up to speed in very little time – something that could be very valuable both to busy people and an ecosystem that needs talented programmers.  Nazir said:  “You can’t expect a developer to spend months learning how to develop on the blockchain. We want to get you started within five to 10 minutes with a few lines of code.”  New Year kickoff  Of course, while those involved may have a larger vision, the course will emphasize the basics over its run. Leading operations for the course will be Robert Schwentker, who previously helmed PayPal's Startup Blueprint program.  The initial half of the Blockchain University program will focus on building basic apps, such as a blockchain explorer, while the second half will be concerned with creating decentralized applications using blockchain technology to provide a public trust mechanism.  Reddit's Charles did his best to inspire the audience at the launch event:  ""If you want to be a founder, the time is now.""  Other notable instructors for Blockchain University will include Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and BlockCypher CTO Matthieu Riou, both of whom have demonstrated an interest in expanding bitcoin's technology to more advanced applications.  Applications for the free course, which requires some software development experience and a commitment to attend several hours every Saturday, are due by the end of December.  There will be a demo day in March of projects developed by the course's students.

With the new partnership, customers who have earned points with PointTown will be able to cash them out in bitcoin. To do so, however, customers will need to set up a bitFlyer account.  PointTown currently has 1.88 million registered users in Japan. Its business model is similar to other rewards-point prize services in the US, like PrizeRebel and Points2Shop.  Points for tasks  Customers using the site can earn a variety of rewards by performing tasks like shopping online, filling out consumer surveys and signing up for services. Rewards include points that can be spent at over 20 retailers and online or mobile services like iTunes, Amazon, LINE, and Rakuten, along with Suica and T-Point and ANA air miles.  PointTown is currently offering rewards of 0.0211 BTC for 10,000 reward points up to 0.2422 BTC for 200,000 p0ints.  A message onPointTown's explanatory page introduces customers to the concept of digital currency, explaining that it is not processed by banks and is most commonly used for remittances and cross-border transactions. The company also issues a warning that bitcoin's price can be volatile and that users should consider the risks.  A similar bitcoin rewards scheme called bitcoinGET was launched in November by bitFlyer's local competitor BitBank. A brand new service, BitcoinGET allows its users to check out only in bitcoin, and has over 180 ways for consumers to earn points, such as shopping at its partner stores and signing up for services like credit cards.  BitBank also operates a merchant payment processor and bitcoin wallet service.  Spreading the word  BitFlyer  's Shuntaro Kogame told CoinDesk the service was a good way to draw attention to bitcoin and hopefully put it into more hands.  ""We believe this is a large step to broaden bitcoin in Japan, and we hope more people enjoy using bitcoin.""  Given that PointTown attracts a highly tech-conscious clientele who are already familiar with micropayments and the myriad forms of online points and payment networks available, the move might prove a wise decision.  Japanese consumers are saturated with retail loyalty, discount and rewards schemes, with the average shopper carrying a wallet full of point cards for everything from convenience stores and pharmacies to electronics stores and entire mall chains.  History of working together  This is not the first time GMO Media has teamed up with bitFlyer to offer bitcoin alternatives. In September, the two companies partnered to include a bitcoin payment option for over 48,000 online merchants.  As well as processing online payments, GMO also sells domain names, web hosting and security services. It reportedly processes over $61m in annual sales.  BitFlyer went live in April 2014, almost directly in the wake of the Mt Gox fiasco which tarnished bitcoin's reputation in Japan.  Founded by Goldman Sachs alumnus Yuzo Kano, BitFlyer raised $1.6m funding in July, followed by a further $236,000 in October.  In September, the firm also launched a bitcoin crowdfunding platform called fundFlyer, although the list of new projects on the site appears little updated since then.
