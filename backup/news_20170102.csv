42427211,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kXh,1483368189,Why There's Still Hope for Bitcoin Remittance Companies,"As of the end of 2016, we are now about seven years into the bitcoin experiment. In that time, remittances have gone from one of the most buzzed-about use cases for bitcoin to one that's billed as one of its biggest challenges.  So, can bitcoin make an impact as an intermediary for exotic currencies not often traded? Can it help deliver cash on the ground quicker and cheaper?  Well, it turns out there's a lot of ways to approach remittances – from private blockchains, consortiums, apps, FX dealers to decentralized cryptocurrencies.  Let's explore some of them below.  What doesn't work  Traditional FX integrations  Only a tiny minority of currencies are freely floated and exchangeable outside their country of origin (generally, it's the top eight currency pairs: USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, CAD, JPY, SGD, HKD).  Prices are as good as they get here and spreads are tiny, but these are the currencies of rich countries, not of the recipient nations of remittances globally.  There are of course other currencies that are freely traded. But, if we are to solve the issue of remittances globally, we would need close to 180 currencies to be able to be transacted easily and cost effectively, and this is not currently possible.  So, FX providers and websites providing FX services are great for B2B payments between the above currencies, and there is an immense market for that.  But, this is not the use case we are discussing, the use case we are interested in is that of cash distribution on the ground to individuals in currencies and countries that are often not well connected to the financial system.  FX providers work fine, however, more is involved to deliver cash to the street corner where its needed by the recipient.  P2P netting of payments  As startups, TransferWise and CurrencyFair popularized this model, but banks have been doing it for decades.  Essentially transactions going from A to B and B to A can be ‘matched’, and instead of actually transferring the money via the SWIFT network, you can keep currency A and B in-country. The ownership of those balances will then change to be withdrawn domestically via lower cost domestic withdrawal methods.  It's a neat idea, but it works only for the most frequently traded and transacted currency pairs where there is an equal amount going each way to 'match'.  For the big remittance recipient countries, there are always more transactions going in than is coming out, so matching an equal number of transactions to and from is mathematically impossible.  At the end of the day you will need to send money to the destination and how will you do that?  Likely a bank-to-bank transfer, which for exotic currencies are always expensive. So you are not solving any problems here and will be subject to those higher exchange rates at the end of the day and will need to use traditional forms of settlement.  P2P apps  This model is still trying to establish itself via mobile apps, but fundamentally, it actually is based on an ancient system that has been in operation for thousands of years called ‘hawala’.  Mobile apps try to make this more efficient by digitizing the connections between people that power the system.  However, people need to trust the places they are putting in and receiving money. The usual workflow is deposit money with someone on the app, then the person at the other end will withdraw it from someone else at the recipient end.  P2P apps generally want to try to connect you to people who can act as links in the chain nearby. However, some guy on the side of a street you track down via a dot on GPS doesn't exactly illicit trust.  So, the logical conclusion is that you onboard trusted entities who deal in cash: the money transfer operators (MTOs, or physical cash money transfer shops), and MTOs are not about to ditch their complicated compliance and remittance system for a mobile app.  Even if you assume the most optimistic scenario (where let's say people trust the guy by the side of the road), how will it be scalable for that person to handle hundreds or thousands of transactions via an app that will eventually attract the attention of government agencies?  Getting money into and out of the app is the hard part. Hawala has been working for centuries, but it will just take time for people to adjust to applying it with new technologies.  In our experience, we have found many foreign workers sending money home often have long established trust with the shop they send money home with or the guy on the motorbike who collects their cash at a construction site.  Switching to something new is daunting, and it is also why bitcoin ATM-powered remittances haven't taken off. Nobody trusts new things.  Private blockchains  If you are a bank, a private blockchain may offer a few benefits to you in settling payments between your intermediaries or other banks.  However, when other currencies are involved, the lines get blurred, and there is no way to avoid the global FX markets.  If you have a tokenless blockchain (that is, a unit of account that does not have a floating open market price), there is no 'value' to transact across borders, it is merely a database entry on either your system or your connected intermediaries' – and this is possible without a blockchain.  If you have a blockchain with an underlying value token, you need buy-in from entities in your private blockchain system other than yourself to act as counterparties and, regardless of how you structure it, it will never be as liquid as the global FX markets.  There may be a case to be made for exotic currencies (which are not currently traded or adequately connected to global FX markets), but settling payments across currency pairs requires liquidity.  A private blockchain requires buy-in from entities other than yourself, so the solution may be to setup a consortium to debit and credit balance between consortium members using a blockchain as an asset-tracking database.  Consortiums in this space that might be set up to debit and credit payments between each other are an efficient way of settling payments, but it requires everyone to be on the same page (or ledger).  What Does Work  Central bank blockchains  I have previously theorized that the use of a blockchain-type system is inevitable for central banks – it offers them the control and oversight they require, while also removing inefficiencies in the existing monetary system.  All private banks dealing in a national currency would also be participants in the blockchain and be running the same ledger – any transactional payment metadata can be associated with the blockchain transaction is built into the currency itself.  This provides the benefits of a consortium described above (all on the same ledger debiting and crediting balances on the ledger) and also effectively handles end-of-day clearing.  Central banks are not innovators (to say the least), so it will be slow for this to catch on. But I would argue such a move will be inevitable, as it aligns with their goals: more control over monetary policy and better oversight of their licensees.  Various central banks have been talking about blockchain pilots and, as competition between jurisdictions in this space heats up (we are already seeing this with various 'FinTech rankings' of regulators), more are likely to follow.  Using a token of value  Physical money transfer shops have customers because they are trusted entities dealing with physical cash.  Today, there are a few bitcoin-and-cash startups around the place, but we believe there is space for 10x more of them, in every country, in every currency.  But, these brokers need to have access to local forms of payments. Maybe people in one country predominantly get their cash and pay bills, whereas other countries people pay with prepaid RFID cards.  Whatever the payment method, it's important to have companies on the ground who understand this and can offer their services using the local mechanisms, while accepting bitcoin in exchange for these localized payments.  The problem bitcoin solves here is reducing capital requirements.  With bitcoin you don't need to take a $10m position to batch a small payment. You can transfer each individual $200 transaction individually for close to no cost internationally. Game changer!  What if I want 5,000 Liberian dollars right now, how can I make that trade? Normally it requires various antiquated in-country mechanisms, bank contacts, accounts, shaking the right peoples hands and ultimately settlement through the US dollar – a very time-consuming and costly process.  However, bitcoin is traded 24/7 around the world at the touch of a button.  The ‘last mile’ is an essential part of this, and in our case, we connect all the existing last-mile providers and act as the bridge between them.  We don't seek to disrupt their business, but to offer them new efficiencies.  Pegged cryptocurrencies  One of my favorites for a while now has been pegged cryptos, particularly the decentralized kind, like Nubits. (While the Nubits project has had some hiccups of late, I think the idea is intriguing.)  Essentially these pegged cryptos are a token of value that adjusts automatically to market conditions to maintain a peg to a chosen fiat currency or commodity.  However, it only works if its decentralized. If I have to trust any company or single entity along the way for a pegged crypto it becomes uninteresting and subject to all the common problems associated with holding customer funds.  But, having 180 parallel FX assets can't be understated, this will be huge.  If it costs me nothing to trade into and out of a token of value for exotic currencies, this will be a massive boon to the remittance industry.  Conclusion  So, there you have it. The truth about bitcoin remittances is that the digital currency can and already does bring value to the remittance industry.  It's providing a solution for trading into and out of exotic currencies.  As a token of value it is reducing barriers to entry, simplifying back-office work for new companies in the space, and at the end of the day, providing superior pricing to end users – even when taking into account the last mile.  As more people realize this, we believe we're in for exciting years ahead.

42427207,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK0kPh,1483358820,"Politics, Protocols and the Changing Face of Finance","Mat Cybula is the CEO of Cryptiv Inc, a Toronto-based startup that provides enterprise-grade blockchain wallet systems that enable private-key and employee-access management.      In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Cybula discusses why he believes the current political environment is priming the world for blockchain-based change.                    2016 has been a year of full of surprises. Unexpected events like the rise of Donald Trump and the victory of the 'Brexit' supporters in the UK have left a trail of baffled ""experts"" and commentators in their wake.  The scaffolding that has held the global order in place for the past 20 years has taken a string of unanticipated hits from unlikely sources, and the powers that be have looked clumsy as they have tried to adapt.  It is difficult to pin down, but it feels like something big is changing in our world.  Now, as blockchains stand poised to impact the world of protocols, this may really only just be the beginning of more change to come.  Power and protocols  Before we explore how the power structures of the world may be changing, let us take a careful look at these things we call ""protocols"". The word ""protocol"" has a certain cross-disciplinary characteristic that is quite interesting and relevant to current events.  A protocol, by definition, refers to a set of rules and procedures that govern a given system.  This can refer to social systems, like one's expected behavior in a certain situation amongst a group of people. Many of us may remember feeling a social sting when we were judged to be in violation of accepted social norms by your peers. That was you breaching protocol.  Within the corridors of power, protocols are very important indeed.  Diplomats, politicians, and CEOs all have to abide by these protocols if they want to be part of the game. And when protocols are breached, even in subtle ways, it usually means that there are tensions below the surface.  One thing that seems certain is that something profound has changed.  The election of Donald Trump and the 'Brexit' referendum have altered the norms and protocols that many smart people previously took for granted.  Whether one thinks that Trump is a con artist, a neo-Reaganite messiah or a disciple of the dark art of non-linear warfare (developed by Putin’s propaganda chief Vladislav Surkov), it is undeniable that he has just rewritten a lot of rules.  Suspicious minds  The common thread is a feeling that the old rules must change at all costs because those in power have failed us. And this suspicion of the elites and of globalization's benefits make sense when viewed through the lens of inequality.  Voters want new protocols to replace a status quo they feel is rigged in favor of those with wealth and power. But, why has this populist demand for change seemingly come out of nowhere in 2016?  What may have changed is that these arrangements are getting harder to cloak in their traditional veil of secrecy. Partly, this is due to the fact that there is now a digital paper trail that has allowed hackers like Guccifer 2.0 and whistle-blowers like Snowden to spring ""leaks"" and allow us to peer behind the curtain.  Leaked emails and documents, like the Panama Papers, have provided a glimpse into the messy details of how the world really works at the top levels.  What they have revealed confirms the suspicions of the most cynical amongst us.  Monetary experiments  This sentiment now seems on the verge of spilling over into the world of finance, with monetary experiments and unexpected shocks coming from multiple sources.  In China, the year began with state interventions designed to reverse a collapse in Chinese stock market, which was followed by a persistent flight of capital, reserve depletion and currency devaluation.  Europe faced its own set of challenges, with the UK choosing to leave the political union, while the euro currency project braces for challenges from populist parties in Italy and France. Despite all this turmoil and the unexpected election of Donald Trump, stock indexes are flirting with the record-breaking levels.  The year has also seen the evolution of a number of unorthodox monetary policies being carried out and some that are winding down.  India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shocked his country, and its economy, with an unexpected ban on the two highest currency notes in circulation.  This move, which some view as an escalation in the ""war on cash"", is a bold monetary experiment on a massive scale that aims to strengthen central controls over their currency. Meanwhile, another monetary experiment – named quantitative easing, a policy that has been in place since 2008 – has begun to unwind with the Federal Reserve raising rates for the first time since the financial crisis.  Equally notable have been the monetary experiments that are being conducted on public blockchains.  These projects have come a long way in 2016 and are beginning to carve out an important niche within the world’s financial system.  A year ago, the price of bitcoin was a lowly $400 and the ethereum network was an upstart altcoin that was worth barely $1 and had yet to prove itself. Granted, both projects have had their issues, bitcoin is still seemingly stuck in a civil war over scaling plans, and ethereum had to deal with the repercussions of the DAO hack and DDOS attacks on their network which led to some unplanned hard forks.  Not to be outdone, the financial industry has collectively awoken to the potential for blockchain technologies in 2016 and has spent the year investing heavily in the industry, forming coalitions and generally trying to figure out a way to leverage this new technology.  Changing of the guard  The word protocol can also refer to something a bit more technical, like a set of rules that allow a computer to interact with a given network.  Packet-switching protocols, a brilliant idea developed by Paul Baran to create nuke-resistant communications, are about as integral to our daily lives, and the economy, as electricity or central heating.  After all, that is all these blockchain networks really are – a clever arrangement of a new set of technical protocols that allow peers to move ""value"" between one another.  Given the uncertainty in geopolitics, the fragility of legacy financial infrastructure and the potential for blockchain technology to address these issues, it looks like a number of new technical protocols may be on the horizon in 2017.  On the public side, bitcoin continues to appeal to those seeking shelter from monetary chaos and capital controls, while the ethereum network has enabled a new wave of innovative projects. Ethereum now serves as a platform for decentralized implementations of everything from predictions markets and fund management to P2P cloud computing and corporate governance.  Meanwhile, bitcoin is being used as a remittance alternative and a store of value in countries like Venezuela, India and China.  Public-ledger advocates believe that the open-sourced and permissionless nature of these systems, combined with network effects and a genuine demand for stateless and secure P2P money make change inevitable.  In the corporate world, blockchain technologies are viewed as a solution to help re-engineer the existing financial system that is desperate to modernize. From this perspective, blockchain is an incredible technology that can be leveraged by the world's existing financial institutions to clear transactions faster, reduce overhead and replace legacy systems that are long overdue for an expensive upgrade.  This could create a financial system that is safer, more transparent and affordable.  Square pegs  Achieving this has nonetheless proven difficult as blockchain technologies don’t fit well within existing regulatory paradigms and technological hurdles like scalability and privacy still pose obstacles.  The financial industry is highly competitive and attempting to get financial institutions to collaborate is no easy task. This has stemmed the ability for network effects to take hold as we see startups, consortiums and banks trying to build permissioned blockchains.  It is evident that we are beginning to pass through the peak of Gartner's hype cycle.  As the excitement settles down and many come to terms with the limitations of blockchain technologies, we will begin to see some proof of concepts die off and the more promising ones go into production. Incumbents will go after the low-hanging fruit where blockchain technologies can provide real solutions in the near-term.  They will continue to use this technology to sustain and strengthen their existing business models. In the meantime, we will likely see more ICOs and the development of applications on both the bitcoin and ethereum networks.  These applications will come to represent a growing threat to the incumbents as they provide alternative financial services and products to a developing niche market of early crypto-adopters. We will begin to see mainstream adoption of these applications from financial institutions like hedge funds and other fund managers.  Likely, the predominant use cases of public blockchains will continue to be for financial speculation and as an alternative store of value.  What is so fascinating about blockchain technologies, however, is that they combine powerful forces – peer-to-peer cryptography, financial markets and network effects – to achieve disruptive ends. The thing about disruptive change is that it is scary and difficult to predict.  People have trouble dealing with uncertainty and we generally avoid it.  But, in 2016, we witnessed a tide of uncertainty being unleashed deliberately by voters who are increasingly willing to gamble on an uncertain future because they feel like they have little to lose.  By all accounts, 2017 could prove to be even more unpredictable. Scary as this may be, it also means that there will be ample opportunity to make a positive impact in a world yearning for change.  Under these uncertain conditions, blockchain technologies of all flavors have the potential to be transformative in the coming year – it is exciting to be a part of it.
