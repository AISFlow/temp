42429484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz5xh,1533671339,SEC Delays VanEck-SolidX Bitcoin ETF Decision to September,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed a decision on a proposed bitcoin ETF, pushing its final determination ahead by more than a month.  In an order published on August 7, officials at the agency wrote that they were giving themselves more time to deliberate on whether to approve what would be the first exchange-traded product of its kind in the U.S. It's also perhaps unsurprising, given that in the past, SEC officials have used the agency's statutory powers to push back decisions on bitcoin ETFs.  As the agency wrote:  ""Accordingly, the Commission ... designates September 30, 2018, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change.""  The proposed rule change from CBOE would, if approved, constitute a critical point on a path to listing a bitcoin ETF, in conjunction with money management firm VanEck and crypto startup SolidX. The companies submitted their proposal back in June, setting off a busy comment period that saw the crypto community rally in support.  All told, more than 100 comments were submitted through mid-July.  The choice to punt forward a final decision also comes days after SEC commissioners completed a review on a proposed bitcoin ETF from investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose multi-year effort was dashed after a majority of the SEC's commissioners backed up the agency's original March 2017 rejection.  One commissioner, Hester Peirce, dissented from that decision, later telling CoinDesk in an interview that the move to block a bitcoin ETF is a disservice to both investors and innovators.  As of press time, the price of bitcoin has not reacted, trading at around $7,060 according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).

42429491,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz6Bh,1533669656,Ukraine Election Official Launches Voting Trial Using NEM's Blockchain,"A member of the Ukraine Central Election Commission is investigating the use of blockchain in elections.  Oleksandr Stelmakh, working for Ukraine's Central Election Commission, commented on the ongoing trial Tuesday by way of Facebook. The trial run began back in July when Stelmakh encouraged his friends on Facebook to participate in a ""test vote"" that had been created in partnership with a local NEM Foundation group, using NEM's blockchain platform.  ""One of the basic useful properties of the blockchain is the impossibility of making changes to the saved information ...These are the properties we tried to use to save the information of the local ballot sessions,"" Stelmakh wrote.  He added:  ""It must be noted that the experiment was held in the test environment of the blockchain NEM and for the transactions used by the test coins that were kindly given the representative of the NEM Foundation in Ukraine, Anton Bosenko. The blockchain test environment has 28 nodes. ""  Stelmakh also wrote that based on the results, it would cost roughly $1,227 to place a node which can be used to vote in each police station, which he said was a ""small"" price to pay for the technology.  Stelmakh reminded readers in his post that the trial period for the blockchain experiment was still ongoing and polls using ""test coins"" had not yet closed.  The official's work represents the latest effort to apply the technology for tabulating votes, with the idea being that blockchain could be used to create an immutable record – or, at least, an auxiliary one – to help ease issues when tallying final counts. Blockchain has also been advanced as a tool for proxy voting, in which shareholders of a company vote on corporate matters.

42429481,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz5nh,1533664830,Here's the Bitcoin ETF Presentation SolidX Gave to the SEC Last Week,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently published a presentation given to agency staffers by crypto startup SolidX in late July, a move that comes days ahead of an expected decision on its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The public document, dated August 1, reveals that representatives from SolidX, Cboe BZX Exchange, VanEck Securities Corporation and Patomak Global Partners met with the agency on July 31. The meeting drew officials from a number of SEC offices, including the Division of Trading and Markets, the Division of Corporation Finance and the Divison of Economic and Risk Analysis, according to the memorandum.  While the document itself doesn't provide a blow-by-blow of the meeting, it does offer insight into the arguments being made in favor of the bitcoin ETF, including ""significant changes in product, market structure and overall circumstances since March 2017 disapproval"" – referring to the decision made last year with respect to SolidX's prior proposal.  The information is notable given that the SEC is expected to issue some kind of decision this month on SolidX and VanEck's proposed bitcoin ETF, though a choice to punt its approval or disapproval forward could lead to the process extending for additional months.  Historically, the presentation argued, the approved commodity-trust exchange-traded products (ETPs) all have been ""well-established, significant, regulated markets"" for trading futures on the underlying commodity such as gold and silver.  The document cited the SEC's comment at the time:  ""The Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop. Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act""  With that being said, the presentation made it clear that ""significant changes"" in bitcoin and its market structure have been made since then, for example, multiple derivatives markets are now available for bitcoin such as CME bitcoin futures, and Cboe bitcoin futures.  ""All of the above are markets regulated by the CFTC (the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission) and all are cleared products,"" the presentation added.

Currently, according to the startup, clients have to wait five days for those funds to settle. But that's about to change, with Coinbase reasoning that ""when someone makes the decision to sign up, they don't want to wait days before they can start buying cryptocurrency.""  Coinbase went on to note:  ""While we do support instant transfers via wire transfer and debit cards, purchases via direct debits from your bank account can take days to appear. With this update, customers will receive an immediate credit for the funds being sent from their bank account. They can then buy and sell crypto to and from their USD wallet right away, but cannot send their funds off the Coinbase platform until the funds coming from their bank have settled.""  Daily purchase limits are being lifted to $25,000, according to Coinbase, though only customers who have completed the site's identity verification process will have access to these changes. Coinbase is still in the process of adding these changes for its non-U.S. customers.  A Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk that ""these improvements are built on our [six]-year history of focusing entirely on cryptocurrency and building the most trusted, compliant cryptocurrency exchange in the world.""  ""We've focused on building a state-of-the-art fraud detection system that relies on machine learning and, over the past year, we've made significant improvements to our systems that help us balance a good user experience with preventing losses due to fraud,"" the representative said.

42429492,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz69h,1533652931,Researchers Discover Huge Crypto Scam Botnet on Twitter,"Researchers have uncovered a huge botnet that mimics legitimate accounts on Twitter to spread a cryptocurrency ""giveaway"" scam.  As reported by ITPro, the discovery was made during a research effort by Duo Security that looked at 88 million Twitter accounts from May to July and used machine learning to identify bots, malicious or otherwise, on the social media platform.  The team notably found a single network of over 15,000 bots in a three-tiered structure that spread the fake cryptocurrency giveaway, and further evolved as time passed in order to avoid detection.  The Duo team described how the botnet works in a paper to be presented at the 2018 Black Hat cybersecurity event on Wednesday.  Typically, they write, bots first create a spoofed (or copycat) account for a genuine cryptocurrency-related account that would copy the name and profile picture of the legitimate account.  To spread the fake giveaway scam, the bots would reply to tweets posted by the legitimate account, containing a link to entice Twitter users to the scam.  Adding to the complexity, many spoof accounts followed what the researchers termed ""hub accounts"" and suspect are followed ""in an effort to appear legitimate"".  The botnet also employed ""amplification bots"" – other fake accounts that are used to give ""likes"" to scam tweets to ""to artificially inflate the tweet's popularity [and] make the cryptocurrency scam appear legitimate.""  The paper states:  ""[Searching for connected bots] resulted in a 3 tiered botnet structure consisting of the scam publishing bots, the hub accounts (if any) the bots were following, and the amplification bots that like each created tweet. The mapping shows that the amplification bots like tweets from both clusters, binding them together.""  Intriguingly, the team found that the discoveries allowed them to connect the bots in a way ""that can result in the unraveling of the entire botnet.""  While Twitter has been making moves to clamp down on such cryptocurrency scams, Duo writes in its conclusion that the work shows that botnets are still active and can be discovered by ""straightforward analysis.""  ""We don't consider the problem solved,"" they said.  Going forward, Duo plans to open source the techniques described in the paper in the hope that new techniques can be developed to identify malicious bots, and help ""keep Twitter and other social networks a place for healthy online discussion and community.""

ZhongAn Technology, which is publicly listed in Hong Kong, announced the launch of its gem-tracking blockchain application on Tuesday, saying that the project was created to achieve a higher level of traceability in the luxury industry.  The product is being marketed through Diamsledger, a new subsidiary jointly created by ZhongAn and online diamond trading firm Ediams.  Built on top of ZhongAn's proprietary blockchain network, and hosted on its Anlink cloud platform, the application is deployed across selected parties along the diamond supply chain, including diamond dealers, processing firms, customs, logistic companies and exchange centers.  The end of goal, according to the firm's announcement, is to provide a transparent ledger on a decentralized network that tracks every piece of information about a diamond, from production to customer.  The system also works in parallel with traditional industry certificates such as GIA, NGTC and HRD, ZhongAn says, meaning purchasers can type in a diamond's certificate number to view all its information via a portal on Diamsledger.  Zhang Yongwen, CEO of Diamsledger said that currently ""information of 760,000 diamonds has been uploaded to Anlink as of mid-July."" Zhang went on to state that the application provides a double assurance together with traditional certificates, which mainly record diamonds' physical information such as color and place of origin.  The launch follows previous initiatives from ZhongAn including a blockchain-based application to track and record the food supply chain, as well as a patent filing for a blockchain solution designed to protect media from piracy.

42429482,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz5jh,1533643235,Ethereum-Powered Insurer Nexus Is Winning Over Blockchain Skeptics,"""My premise is that you can use blockchain to essentially trust people you don't know – you trust the code.""  While that statement by Hugh Karp may sound like a standard line in crypto-land, his startup, Nexus Mutual, is actually building a product for those who don't trust the code.  Or, at least, don't trust it completely.  With Nexus, Karp is trying to revive mutual insurance, a model that dates back to the 17th century and, many argue, aligned the interests of participants better than today's profit-maximizing insurance firms. Nexus is one of a handful of blockchain startups, at various stages of development, aiming to use the technology for this purpose.  But the first insurance product Nexus plans to offer will cover an ultra-modern type of risk: security failures of smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.  Think of the DAO hack of 2016, in which some 3.6 million ether (valued at around $50 million at the time) was drained from the smart contract by an attacker. Or last year's Parity Multisig Wallet attack, in which just over 150,000 ether was stolen (then worth around $30 million).  Starting early next year, Nexus will offer to insure customers against financial losses from such ""unintended code usage.""  Yet Nexus itself will run as a smart contract on top of ethereum. That's what Karp means when he talks about trusting the code. For him, blockchain is a way to overcome one of the limitations of the old mutuals while retaining their benefits.  His thesis is that users will trust the rules of a smart contract underpinned by the immutable ethereum public blockchain. This way, members who don't know each other can trust each other, allowing the mutual to scale. Eventually, consulting with members, the plan is to explore other areas of catastrophe cover beyond crypto.  Karp stands out in the insurtech space because of his deep understanding of both the sector and the technology. He began his career as an actuary and rose to become the chief financial officer at Munich Re, one of the world's leading reinsurers. He became fascinated by bitcoin and then ethereum relatively early, in 2014.  Stephen D. Palley, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of the law firm Anderson Kill with extensive experience in the insurance sector, is something of a blockchain skeptic, yet was uncharacteristically bullish about Karp and Nexus.  ""People who really understand both the technology and the insurance vertical are lacking,"" said Palley. ""I also like the Nexus idea of mutualization; it's almost like back to the future for insurance.""  He added that Nexus ""proposes something like an old-fashioned view of insurance, a community-based model, as opposed to an adversarial one.""  Back to the future  More broadly, it's easy to see the appeal of the old-fashioned mutual insurance model that Nexus and a few similar startups want to recreate using today's bleeding-edge tech.  Historically an important part of life and property and casualty insurance, mutuals are customer-centered, as opposed to the profit-maximizing firms that largely replaced them, and which arguably put shareholders' interests before policyholders' benefits.  The number of conversions from mutual to stock ownership grew steadily from 1960s onwards, with the pace of demutualization increasing significantly in the 1990s, while in Europe legislation removed some of the barriers between insurance companies and banks.  ""Over the last decades, statistical advantages, network effects and efficiency gains have led to a massive concentration of power and capital in the insurance space and pushed mutual systems into a niche in most markets,"" said Stephan Karpischek, co-founder and CEO of Etherisc.  Like Nexus, Etherisc wants to use blockchain to counter the long-running demutualization trend. Karpischek's startup has already used ethereum to create parametric insurance products (in which payouts are automatically triggered in an event such as a hurricane; no need to file claims) and has explored decentralized risk pools to expand access to insurance for previously excluded populations, like small farmers in Africa  Peer-to-peer structures are more stable and less prone by design to failures like hacks, information leaks, corruption, mismanagement, or abuse of power, Karpischek argued.  The common denominator in the case of Nexus and Etherisc is the ethereum blockchain. But it's not just ethereum; this type of innovation is also being explored on other public chains.  Singapore's Zilliqa blockchain will soon be the home of Inmediate, a collaboration between Deloitte, the pan-Asian insurance group FWD and four yet-to-be-named phase one insurance partners.  Inmediate CEO Otbert de Jong decided to start with a small pilot group of insurers, but maintains a lofty goal. ""We indeed can bring insurance back to what it is supposed to be, which is basically taking care of each other in times of adversity, "" said de Jong.  Yet another back-to-the-future, blockchain-powered insurance model is being pursued by Layer 2 Labs. Based in New York, this early-stage startup is revisiting the risk-bearing syndicates pioneered at Edward Lloyd's coffee house in London in the late 1600s – which eventually evolved into one of the world's best-known insurance markets.  ""What we are building is a decentralized platform for insurance actors to issue and purchase risk, akin to the early days of Lloyd's of London,"" said Jonathan Mohan, a co-founder of Layer 2 Labs.  Similar to Nexus, Layer 2 will also focus on covering blockchain-specific risks, which Mohan said is analogous to the way Lloyd's formed a pre-legal commercial framework prior to regulation.  'Reverse ICO'  Aside from allowing mutuals to scale trust via code, another part of blockchain's appeal to insurtech firms like Nexus is that tokenization opens up access to more flexible capital raising.  Nexus plans to tokenize early next year, but not the typical fashion of raising capital through an initial coin offering (ICO) with the promise of building out some solution thereafter. Instead, Nexus, which in April of this year completed a £800,000 ($1.03m) seed funding round, plans to build the platform first and launch with a live smart contract protection product that is fully operational.  In the days and weeks immediately following this launch, Nexus will tokenize membership rights (in what Karp calls a ""reverse ICO"") to crowdfund the risk pool.  ""It's like an ICO in some ways, but the big difference is the money goes into the pool. It is members' money to back the cover that the mutual writes, for which they will get tokens representing membership rights,"" said Karp.  To get started, Nexus is exploiting an unregulated pocket within the British insurance sector, a model called a ""discretionary mutual,"" where members have no contractual obligations to pay claims. Being unlicensed means Nexus can move nimbly in the otherwise highly regulated world of insurance.  Once Nexus is funded it will function as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) sporting a governance process driven by members who will vote on upgrades and proposals over time. Premiums will be paid either in ether or the price-stable cryptocurrency known as dai; payment of claims will be subject to member votes.  In case you were wondering how Nexus' own risk capital can be protected against a possible smart contract security breach, Karp said that in addition to all the usual security testing and auditing, it will also launch with an emergency pause button.  This will initially be controlled by the Nexus board (company founders), but any member can replace an existing board member via a proposal (provided it was voted in by members) that can't be stopped by the current board.  And just as large insurance firms invest their capital in assets such as bonds and commercial mortgages, the Nexus DAO will put the risk pool's money to work – though it will choose more contemporary flavors of investment.  ""We can invest in any ERC-20 token,"" Karp said, referring to assets created on ethereum. Nexus also has ""automated all the trades using the 0x protocol,"" a decentralized exchange platform.  ""The membership base can even update the list of assets to invest in and the pool automatically rebalances. And when ethereum goes to proof of stake we plan to 'invest' a large chunk of the capital pool in staking,"" he added, speaking to a plan in the works to change the way the world's second-largest blockchain is validated.  In the conservative world of insurance, the most innovation you might expect would be private blockchain deployments. But public chain insurtech proponents like Karp have no doubt about where the real transformative power lies.  Karp concluded,  ""I think private chains will have a lot of benefit to insurance companies especially connecting them up – but public chains are where my energy and fascination lies.""

42429495,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz6Hh,1533639616,Bitcoin Price Eyes $7.4K After Defense of Key Support,"Bitcoin looks primed for a minor rally, having defended a key moving average support in the last 72 hours.  The 50-day moving average (MA), one of the most widely tracked technical indicators, was put to test in the previous two trading days. However, on both occasions, prices failed to penetrate the MA support by the daily close (as per UTC), signaling bearish exhaustion.  Today, BTC is following a similar pattern. The leading cryptocurrency picked up a bid around the 50-day MA support of $6,938 earlier today and rose back above $7,000, raising prospects of a corrective rally.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,050 on Bitfinex – up 0.70 percent on a 24-hour basis.  The solid defense of the 50-day MA support and the early signs of bullish reversal, as seen in the short-duration chart below, indicate scope for a stronger rally toward $7,400.  4-hour chart  The above chart shows, the current 4-hour candle is hovering above the top end (resistance) of the falling channel (bearish pattern).  A bullish breakout would be confirmed if the candle closes above the falling channel hurdle. In this case, BTC will likely rise toward the downward sloping (bearish) 100-candle MA, currently located at $7,438.  This scenario appears likely as a bullish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) signals that the tide has turned in favor of a rally.  Daily chart  BTC created a bearish outside-day candle yesterday, meaning the day began with optimism and ended with pessimism. Still, BTC's strong showing today backs up indications of bearish exhaustion seen yesterday.  While there is a reason to be optimistic, the bulls can't afford to lower their guard as the 5-day MA and 10-day MAs are still biased toward the bears.  If prices close today (as per UTC) below $6,847 (low of the previous day's bearish outside-day candle), the sell-off from the July high of $8,507 would resume, sending BTC below the rising trendline.  View  BTC looks set to take out the falling channel resistance and could rise toward $7,400 in the next 24 hours, courtesy of the bear failure at the 50-day MA support and the bullish RSI divergence.  BTC risks a deeper drop below $6,700 (rising trendline support) if prices find acceptance below $6,847 (previous day's low) today.

The news comes after lawmakers from the state introduced a bill in May that sought to treat blockchain data and smart contracts as electronic records in a bid to provide safe harbor for the emerging technology.  Part of the wording from that bill (SB 300) was later incorporated into legislation (SB200), which was approved by the state's senate in June and finally signed by the governor into Ohio law on Friday, according to a release published Monday.  As passed, Ohio's Uniform Electronic Transactions Act has been amended from the prior version to state that ""a record or contract that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic record.""  Electronic signatures secured through blockchain technology are also considered to have the same legal standing as any other electronic signatures defined under the act.  However, initially proposed language to amend the law to recognize smart contracts has been omitted from the passed bill.  SB 300 originally suggested making it clear that electronic contracts can't be denied legal effect or enforceability just ""because the contract contains a smart contracts term"" – wording would have cleared the way for smart contracts to be used for legal documents in the state.  Elsewhere in the U.S., the state of Arizona has also passed a bill recognizing the legal status of data stored and transacted on a blockchain, while politicians in California have been working on a similar piece of legislation since February.

42429487,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz5vh,1533628859,Trigger Warning: Why the 3D-Printed Gun Debate Matters to Crypto,"Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk. The views expressed here are his own, so please don't blame his colleagues.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      While it may seem only tangentially related to cryptocurrency, the fight in the U.S. over publication of software for 3D-printed firearms bears close watching by the whole blockchain community.  The word ""publication"" should give you a hint why, as the case highlights freedom-of-speech issues that may resurface in future attempts by governments to regulate crypto and distributed networks.  More broadly, the groundswell of media hysteria and political grandstanding around this issue is a reminder of the type of resistance any game-changing technology is bound to meet.  Stepping back, last week a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Defense Distributed, a company founded by the provocateur and crypto-anarchist Cody Wilson. The order barred the Austin, Texas-based firm from posting computer-aided design (CAD) files online for weapons that can be manufactured at home with a 3D printer or a computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine.  Wilson had recently celebrated victory in a long-running fight with the federal government, which settled with his company and agreed to let it distribute the technical information, throwing in the towel on claims that doing so would violate munitions export rules.  This capitulation prompted gasps of outrage from the likes of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. Shortly thereafter, attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia sued to stop the settlement, claiming it violated administrative procedure law and states' rights under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.  In response to that suit, the judge issued the TRO, which Defense Distributed abided by, refraining from posting the files. However, they are still available all over the internet.  Is code speech?  Wilson is a familiar figure in the crypto world, in part because of his work on Darkwallet, a privacy-enhancing bitcoin wallet, and also for his campaign to dismantle the Bitcoin Foundation during that organization's heyday.  But the relevance of Defense Distributed's current struggle to the blockchain world goes deeper than that coincidence.  ""Winning this fight could prove crucial for bitcoin and other crypto projects,"" Peter Todd, the perspicacious cryptography consultant, tweeted after the states intervened. ""If you can't post technical blueprints to guns, banning technical blueprints to crypto too doesn't seem far-fetched.""  Indeed, beyond the arcane procedural questions in the states' lawsuit, the fight arguably boils down to whether software is speech.  ""Both cryptocurrency protocol software and AutoCAD files may be protected speech under the 1st Amendment,"" said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the director of research at blockchain industry advocacy group Coin Center in Washington, D.C.  ""Thus, in either case, a law that attempted to censor or put prior-approval/prior restraint upon the speakers of that speech would likely be found unconstitutional.""  However, the free-speech argument for code is not always a slam dunk in court, according to Aaron Wright, an associate clinical professor of law and director of the Blockchain Project at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.  ""There's a notion in the crypto community that software is unimpeachably protected by the First Amendment. That's simply not the case,"" Wright said. ""If someone develops and implements software that runs afoul of U.S. law, they could face liability.""  In their book ""Blockchain and the Law: The Rule of Code,"" Wright and co-author Primavera De Filippi note that courts in the U.S. have already denied First Amendment protections for one kind of software because it ""had no purpose other than facilitating illegal gambling.""  Looking ahead, they add:  ""If governments choose to regulate blockchain developers, some code may be protected by the First Amendment, while other code may not. For instance, decentralized e-commerce marketplaces used for the exchange of everyday items, but also potentially unlawful products ... could receive First Amendment protection ... because they facilitate both lawful and unlawful acts. Conversely, decentralized prediction markets and exchanges that facilitate the trading of binary options would likely be deemed to violate existing laws like the Commodities Exchange Act.""  Moral panics  Legal questions aside, disruptive technologies, both in the world of atoms and in the world of bits, run the risk of attracting a frightened and angry mob.  To Andrew Glidden, the head of legal research for Blockchain@BerkeleyLaw, a student club at the University of California Berkeley's law school, the hoopla over 3D-printed guns resembles the ""moral panics we face about 'evil internet money.'""  He points out that home manufacture of firearms has long been legal in the U.S. (provided they are not transferred to another person and are not fully plastic), and as mentioned, information about how to build the weapons is already in the public domain.  Compounding the silliness of the present controversy, Glidden went on, is the way some have conflated two different technologies Defense Distributed is involved in, thereby overstating the risks.  Defense Distributed's 3D-printed plastic pistol, known as the Liberator, is inexpensive to produce, and potentially undetectable (if the maker ignores the CYA instructions to add a small block of steel) but ""largely useless,"" less capable than a black powder musket and liable to explode in the user's hand.  On the other hand, the company's CNC-milled, metal firearms are ""functional, but expensive and detectable,"" Glidden noted. ""The moral panic is premised on taking the Most Evil characteristics of each.""  Hence the similarity to the FUD you hear from time to time about bitcoin facilitating a terrorist attack.  ""In either case, there's a lawful activity, with a hypothetical (but not particularly warranted) possibility for abuse that drives the public to panic,"" Glidden said.  None of this is to say these technologies are endangered. They are, after all, decentralized, and as observed in the Defense Distributed case, enjoining one actor hasn't prevented the flow of information.  The prohibitionists almost certainly can't stop innovation or adoption of either blockchains or home manufacturing altogether. But they might slow it down in some places and cause collateral damage.  At a minimum, they're a nuisance.

42429486,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz5zh,1533621623,West Virginia to Offer Blockchain Voting Statewide in Midterm Elections,"West Virginia is rolling out a blockchain-based mobile voting app to all of the state's 55 counties so that military personnel stationed abroad can more easily cast their ballots in the midterm elections.  CoinDesk previously reported that the state piloted the blockchain app in May for deployed military staff and their dependents from Harrison and Monongalia counties. Secretary of State Mac Warner said at the time that the plan was to extend the effort statewide during the midterms in November if the pilot proved to be successful.  Now, according to CNN, Warner's office claims that a round of four audits of the application's blockchain infrastructure was completed following the pilot phase and ""revealed no problems.""  The app was developed and deployed by voting technology startup Voatz, which said the tech encodes and stores ballot data on a decentralized network, ensuring voting information is securely encrypted and quickly transacted.  That said, Warner's deputy chief of staff, Michael Queen, was quoted by CNN as saying that the state will leave the final decision to individual counties whether they will use the app come election time.  While it remains to be seen how the overall adoption will play out in the state, technology experts have already weighed in, with one calling the idea of mobile voting ""horrific.""  Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told the network:  ""It's internet voting on people's horribly secured devices, over our horrible networks, to servers that are very difficult to secure without a physical paper record of the vote.""

42429496,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz6Dh,1533614437,"For Wall Street, Bitcoin ETF Decision Could Answer '$1 Billion' Question","""I wish I knew the answer to your $1 billion question. Seriously.""  That's Gabor Gurbacs, director of digital asset strategy at New York-based investment management firm VanEck, the company has been making headlines of late for a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). No lightweight in the arena, though, the VanEck proposal has been deemed by some to have the best shot of being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Indeed, all eyes are on the SEC in the wake of its comment period, with a possible yes or no – or further delay – expected by Friday. Even so, Gurbacs is cautious about what to expect from the SEC in coming months.  When asked what he suspected the outcome would be, he deferred.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Unfortunately, I don't know the answer. I do know that we have addressed market structure issues and this is a chance for regulators to bring bitcoin under existing frameworks and protect investors.""  Still, if the measure fails, it won't be for a lack of effort.  For one, VanEck's specific proposal came about nearly three years ago when SolidX, a financial technology company also headquartered in New York, first began to work toward bringing a bitcoin ETF to market.  Since a partnership between VanEck and SolidX, announced in early June, commentary on the matter has since significantly increased in favor of approval. And it's not just crypto investors who are pushing the concept, but economists, CEOs, financial analysts and even one SEC commissioner herself (though the latter was made in support of a different bitcoin ETF proposal).  The difference  So, what makes the VanEck-SolidX bitcoin ETF unique? Simply put, it's different from past efforts such as the recently rejected Winklevoss ETF.  As Gurbacs explained, ""it is an insured product."" As such, the physical bitcoins backing ETF shares would be covered in case of ""theft and hacks and losses of all sorts.""  This, however, isn't the selling point for Phil Bak, a former managing director at the New York Stock Exchange and current CEO of Exponential ETFs.  The way Bak sees in, the insurance aspect of the VanEck/SolidX proposal may be useful but ""could also open up a can of worms and more questions,"" explaining that ""[the SEC is] always going to have some hesitation about claiming that anything is guaranteed or insured in any scenario.""  No, the very ""elegant"" solution in Bak's mind that is unique and quite ingenious on the part of VanEck and SolidX is how it is designed to weed out non-accredited investors.  Bak explains:  ""When you launch a new fund, you can arbitrarily set the initial N.A.V. and the initial trade price where you want and they come in around $20, $25…What they've done, they've announced that they're going to set the price to $200,000, which means you can't buy a fractional share. It means the minimum notional amount that an investor can put into the bitcoin fund is going to be $200,000, which means that by definition anybody who's trading the fund is an accredited investor.""  And Gurbacs would completely agree.  In an interview with CoinDesk last week, Gurbacs affirmed that the ETF was ""institutionally oriented.""  ""Today, the bitcoin markets are still 90-95 percent retail and institutions are looking for a way to get into these markets so the physical ETF we have tailored to institutions,"" he remarked.  Others see the ETF as a possible path to future products around crypto, including Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  Balchunas thinks of the institutionally-geared VanEck-SolidX ETF as the ""bridge between not approving and approving an actual regular primetime-ready ETF with a share price that looks more normal,"" adding that this is one of the primary reasons why the SEC might consider the prospect of approving it as a ""baby step towards a real ETF.""  Long road ahead  Those differences aside, whether the SEC actually approves the proposed ETF remains to be seen.  For his part, Balchunas predicted a 5 to 10 percent likelihood of seeing the VanEck/SolidX proposal greenlit by the SEC this year.  To be clear, the proposal is currently at a stage frequented by all new ETFs – crypto or otherwise – wherein the partnering exchange (in this case, Cboe BZX Exchange) has filed for a ""rule change"" with the SEC in order to be included on the exchange listing venue.  According to Bak, even with approval by the SEC on this front, the partnering companies ""would still need to get approval from the Division of Corporate Finance from the SEC,"" adding:  ""There's a whole 'nother set of approvals that would still need to come.""  Given that, in his view, a ""blanket approval"" is highly unlikely at the outset, Bak emphasizes that the SEC certainly has ""the option to extend these things out over longer time frames,"" which has been the case for five other bitcoin ETF proposals in recent days.  Indeed, in light of all the commentary that has been sparked by the VanEck-SolidX bitcoin ETF, the proposal remains in early ""registration"" stages, which though Gurbacs insists has addressed all relevant concerns to do with ""customer protection and compliance, price and validation, liquidity and a few other major outstanding issues"" does not indicate a regulated bitcoin ETF is coming soon in the U.S.  ""I think that what most people don't understand is that there's a formal process where you go back and forth with the regulators... They might say, 'Hey, let's work on this particular topic like pricing,' and they'll call us and we'll look at our indices,"" Gurbacs told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We think we have done the work and the work is good enough to go but again… no one is going to know the date but the SEC.""

42429494,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLz6Fh,1533611722,Ethereum Classic Tops $2 Billion to Set 3-Month Price High,"There's a new top 10 cryptocurrency.  As of press time, the total value of all ether classic (ETC), the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum classic blockchain, in circulation has topped $2.2 billion, a move that helped it leap from 12th place at the start of the day to 10th place according to CoinMarketCap data.  Best known as the original ethereum blockchain, or the version in which funds stolen in a high-profile 2016 hack still belong to the attacker, ethereum classic is benefiting from tailwinds provided by major market listings.  Already, August 6 has seen the addition of ETC to U.S. crypto brokerage Robinhood's trading platform, news that was followed by a pop in the price amid access to new market liquidity. As a result, the listing could be seen as a catalyst that helped ETC scale significant resistance at $19, a level it failed to scale on multiple occasions.  Propelled in part by the announcement, ETC is currently up 8.5 percent on the day, a figure that has helped it gain ground on competing cryptocurrencies.  At 2:00 UTC, ether classic passed MIOTA, the cryptocurrency that powers the IOTA blockchain, claiming the 10th spot on the CoinMarketCap chart and creating a fresh 3-month high of $20.37.  Bitfinex data shows ether classic had largely traded between $14.18 and $18.99 since the middle of May, slipping only once below. However, an announcement from Coinbase, one which declared ETC's listing on its exchange, helped push prices higher on June 21.  As a result of increased retail investor interest spurred on by greater market accessibility, traders are once more switching over to ether classic, an activity that could continue ahead of Coinbase's expected listing tomorrow.  Daily Chart  The daily chart for ether classic is in favor of the bulls with a widening of the MACD lines (blue and orange) and the histogram ticking up, confirming the strength of its most recent move.  Further, a spike in bullish volume seen on August 3 and 6 provided substantial backing to nudge it over the $19 resistance line, which had acted as a stiff psychological barrier since May 13.  A pullback is expected in the coming days as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) breached its highest levels in three months at 64.87 points and began to curve down, marking the peak of bullish momentum.  Weekly Chart  The break from the symmetric triangle seen on the weekly chart adds credence to longer-term bullish continuation as these chart patterns historically offer stronger buy signals on the longer timeframes.  Growing total volume is already at the same levels as the previous week of July 23, with the bulls setting their sights on doubling the current total volume to match the previous week of July 30 at 4.42 million.  View  Continuation is likely as the bulls have already matched the previous weekly (July 16 - July 23) total volume  Weekly RSI levels look healthy and show only a slight uptick in momentum, signaling room for further growth  Bullish Symmetric triangle has allowed for continuation topside with prices breaking the long-term resistance level at $19  A pullback prior to continuation is also a potential as traders seek profit-taking and the daily indicators take their time to cool off.

Earlier this month, the firm also executed its largest trade to date for a December $15,000 strike call.  Partly in response to increased client demand, LedgerX launched a new bitcoin purchasing system last month. Called one-click bitcoin, the service acts as a ""one-stop shop"" for institutional or high net-worth clients to buy bitcoin easily through a federally-regulated platform, Chou said. The service is built on top of the LedgerSavings platform LedgerX debuted in May.  The demand for this type of product is high, Chou said.

I think it's showing that derivatives and options are really useful long-term products and they can offer killer solutions to a wide variety of participants,"" she said, adding:  ""June was one of the record months for us and July was a record month by far. If you look at how we've been doing our transactions, a third of the value has been over the last month, we've seen a lot of healthy activity.""  The platform is available to all of LedgerX's clients, she said, which include roughly 130 institutions as well as high net-worth individuals.  The company has already begun conducting transactions with the system, and one client will see at 15 percent per annum return on their bitcoin for the next six months. This figure will remain steady, even if bitcoin's price drops or stays stagnant in that period.  Going forward, LedgerX hopes to add ethereum products. The firm is working with regulators to receive approval, but Chou is confident that the company will receive this approval as all of its products are ""full collateralized.""
