14231917,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613738-polygon-what-we-know-about-2-0?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1687823277,Polygon: What We Know About '2.0',"Summary Polygon Labs recently announced plans for ""Polygon 2.0."" This plan involves changing the PoS Chain to a zkEVM Validium chain. Because some transaction data is off-chain by design, Validium would enable cheaper transactions and more throughput. This comes with tradeoffs. What we don't yet know is how MATIC would be utilized in a post-Validium transition. A lot has happened since my last article covering the Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) network in late March. It's been an interesting year for the Polygon network and for the MATIC token. Roughly three months after launching a zkEVM chain that lives separately from Polygon's original Proof of Stake chain, Polygon Labs recently announced plans for ""Polygon 2.0."" The Elephant in the Room I don't want to go too much further in this article without first acknowledging Polygon's recent designation as an unregistered security by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In the agency's lawsuit against Binance ( BNB-USD ) in early June, the SEC accused the exchange of selling unregistered securities to customers. As part of that accusation, the agency designated Cardano ( ADA-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), and Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) to be unregistered securities, among more than a half dozen other coins as well. Since that designation, MATIC has declined more than 25% had has dramatically lagged other coins in the crypto market. This is what I wrote last year regarding the regulatory risks of buying MATIC: Polygon carries significant regulatory risk in the United States. The market still requires clarity on if MATIC would be considered a synthetic commodity, currency, or a security. I will not attempt to handicap how the federal government views MATIC but in my opinion it would probably negatively impact the price of the coin to a larger degree if the SEC gets regulatory oversight of Polygon. The SEC has now claimed jurisdiction. Whether that planted flag bears any fruit for the SEC or not is anyone's guess but judging from the 25% MATIC price decline since the designation, I'd say we're much closer to pricing in that risk than we were in December. MATIC has characteristics of a commodity or currency since it's used as payment in network transactions. However, there was an IEO through Binance in 2019. The latter of which adds credence to the notion that MATIC could be considered a security. In my personal opinion, we're still very much in need of clarity regarding whether MATIC truly is a security or not. But it's also important to remember that distributed ledger blockchain networks are global. In the event the SEC is ultimately granted regulatory oversight of MATIC, non-compliance with SEC regulations could theoretically result in US consumers being geo-blocked from dApps that utilize the Polygon network. Polygon 2.0 On June 12th , Polygon Labs announced ""Polygon 2.0."" This new iteration of Polygon has been dubbed ""The Value Layer of the Internet"" by its proponents. Where the internet has allowed for improvements to information access and speed at the user level, one area where the internet is still held back by analog systems is in value transfer and ownership authentication. According to Polygon Labs: The Internet democratized access to information; the Value Layer democratizes access to the global economy. It enables decentralized finance, digital ownership, new mechanisms for coordination and much more. It is the missing piece of an Internet that serves users, not gatekeepers, rent-seekers or middle-men. Essentially, Polygon wants to be the property ownership layer of the internet. In building this, Polygon has proposed updates to the main PoS chain as well as how the network will be governed in the future. 2.0 Announcement Calendar (Polygon Labs) We don't yet have details on all of these proposed changes, but we do know Polygon Labs wants a ""purple merge"" from PoS to zkEVM Validium for the main chain. Due to the fact that Polygon just launched a separate zkEVM earlier this year, for the remainder of this article we'll refer to the post-transition PoS network as the ""zkValidium"" chain to avoid confusion: If accepted by the community, this upgrade will mark an incredible technical achievement-the first time that an existing chain (especially of this size and importance) adds ZK proofs to become an L2. Validium is a bit different from roll-ups because the transaction data is not all stored on the Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) blockchain. In practice, this would allow for network activity that is faster and more cost-efficient. However, it would come with some tradeoffs. For instance, off-chain data requires greater trust in the operator. If something catastrophic were to happen to Polygon's zkValidium network, it could make it more difficult to prove prior ownership state because some of the data pre-catastrophe wouldn't be publicly recorded on-chain. From a user standpoint, the transition from PoS to zkValidium should be seamless for the overwhelming majority of current developers. According to Polygon Labs, validators will have to upgrade to the new software, but for users and developers the transition from PoS to zkValidium shouldn't have any friction whatsoever. Of course, this is if the broader community wants to go through with the plan. So far, this discussion is all pre-proposal as there hasn't been any official PIP yet. We're told those things could come later this year with plans for a Q1-2024 finished product. Impact on MATIC? The proposed change from of the PoS network does come with some questions that don't yet have answers. One of the major changes when Polygon launched its zkEVM chain earlier this year was the token utility for the MATIC coin. Polygon's PoS chain utilizes MATIC as the gas payment coin for transactions. Polygon's zkEVM chain uses ETH for gas fees and instead utilizes MATIC for staking only. All we know so far regarding the PoS/zkValidium proposal is that MATIC would still be used for staking. We don't know what would be used for gas post-transition though Polygon Advisor Pete Kim speculated that it would still be MATIC: AFAIK Polygon PoS will continue to use $MATIC for gas post zk-validium transition, unlike Polygon zkEVM. It won't be backward compatible otherwise. Polygon Labs' Product VP David Silverman added some important context and suggested that the Polygon community would ultimately determine how MATIC is used: the polygon community will decide together as we collectively discuss the best way to transition PoS to a zkValidium. speaking as myself, MATIC as native token would be the most backward compatible From where I sit, maintaining utility as a gas payment token is one of the core reasons MATIC remains a top 5 holding in my cryptocurrency portfolio. I suspect the broader Polygon community would feel similarly as I do that forfeiting that utility would be detrimental to MATIC's bull thesis. Thus, I view it as a low probability outcome if the community is truly able to determine how the token is used. But I will freely admit that it's a possibility that MATIC becomes a pure-play staking token in Polygon 2.0. zkEVM Growth Following the launch of the zkEVM in late March, TVL growth on Polygon's roll-up chain was slow up until mid-May. Since then, the trend has been far more impressive after having gone from $5.4 million on May 10th to roughly $43 million about six weeks later: Polygon zkEVM (L2 Beat) A major catalyst in this TVL spike on the zkEVM chain appears to be in response to a May 10th tweet from Polygon Labs Founder Sandeep Nailwal that hinted at a MATIC airdrop at some point in the future: Also good things take time. Remember Arbitrum One took 1 year+ to fully blossom. Polygon zkEVM ecosystem is getting ready for a big boost with critical infra deployments like safe, oracles like Chainlink coming in, UX improvements per early devs feedback, cost optimisations using data compression and so much more. Plus there is no rule that an existing token can't do a massive airdrop. If there is one thing you can't doubt Polygon on, it would be adoption. Bold my emphasis. This seems to corroborate a theory that I've had for some time that a lot of the L2 activity we've seen in other ETH scaling chains like Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), Optimism ( OP-USD ), StarkNet and zkSync Era can be explained by airdrop hunting. In late March I said the following: But even the small prospect of an airdrop could conceivably juice activity from speculators. That element is missing from Polygon's zkEVM because Polygon already has a native token on its PoS chain. Turns out, Polygon evidently can dangle an airdrop. Whether or not MATIC is airdropped to Polygon's zkEVM depositors remains to be seen. I don't know that the airdrop model has proven to be all that successful at this point in time, but it is something that development teams are still apparently considering. Summary Polygon is clearly going through a transformational moment in the chain's history. From a usage standpoint, Polygon is still one of the most widely used networks in the crypto market and continues dominance in daily active users of Ethereum scaling chains: Monthly DAU Trend (Token Terminal) At 370k average DAUs, June is shaping up to be the 8th month out of the last 9 with at least 300k average daily active users. Polygon has consistently averaged more DAUs than Arbitrum and Optimism combined according to Token Terminal. There is an obvious regulatory concern for the network, but I do wonder if an antagonistic SEC hasn't been priced in already at least to some degree. Furthermore, BlackRock's ( BLK ) spot Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF proposal could be an indication that the SEC's actions regarding crypto are losing favor with power financial institutions. Of course, that's pure speculation on my part and spot bitcoin ETF applications certainly aren't indicative of broader crypto acceptance in TradFi. What we do know is Polygon Labs has lofty goals for the network and as currently constructed the success of the network should benefit the price of MATIC. In a diversified crypto portfolio with a longer term outlook than just a few months, I still think MATIC deserves a spot.",NEUTRAL,MATIC,ICO | MATIC | REGULATION | TRADING | AIRDROP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613738-polygon-what-we-know-about-2-0?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14231917.jpeg

When it comes to altcoins, crypto investors could get a wake up alarm they won’t be able to ignore. Keep reading to learn all about the morning star pattern that recently appeared on the weekly chart of several blue chip cryptocurrencies. Why Crypto Could Be In For A Good “Morning” Earlier in June, the United States SEC launched an onslaught of enforcement action against Binance and Coinbase. Many top altcoins were named as securities in the case. This list explicitly mentioned MATIC, SOL, and a handful of others. The result was a deep selloff, severely worsened as US-based institutions began unloading altcoin holdings en masse without care of market impact. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On? However, following the news that BlackRock and several other institutions were filing for Bitcoin ETFs, the market staged a strong recovery. The rebound was especially powerful in altcoins, which have been extremely oversold in the midst of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The sharp turnaround was also enough to form a morning star pattern in many top cryptocurrencies . Top altcoins have formed a morning star pattern | ETHUSD on TradingView.com The Morning Star Pattern: A Wake Up Call For Altcoins A morning star pattern has formed on blue chip altcoins like Ethereum, Litecoin, Chainlink, and Fetch.ai. This type of Japanese candlestick pattern is a potential bullish reversal pattern with powerful implications. The pattern solidified with Sunday night’s weekly close, but to fully confirm must be followed by further upside. This upside is expected to materialized within 3-5 candlesticks, or in this case, weeks.

The company operates a fully integrated model and benefits from low-cost nuclear and hydropower. TeraWulf has been restructuring debt in recent months and appears to have a favorable setup as Bitcoin is turning bullish. As US regulators continue the assault on the broader cryptocurrency industry, one of the clear standouts in the coin market has been old reliable Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). In Still King of the Coins , I highlighted how BTC dominance has been surging in recent weeks. With the SEC hammer coming down on altcoins and the exchanges that provide them, Bitcoin looks marvelous by comparison. One area where market sentiment appears to be shifting is in the Bitcoin public miner equities. Data by YCharts After what was a brutal decline from cycle tops that saw many of the miner equities down between 80-90%, the bid has come back on many of the players in this market as several stocks have more than tripled from recent lows. One of the miners that has lagged the year to date performance of larger peers like Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), and Bitfarms ( BITF ) is TeraWulf ( WULF ). But there are positive signs for WULF shareholders. TeraWulf Model TeraWulf runs a fully integrated mining operation that has been quickly scaling exahash capacity in recent months. What sets WULF apart from many of the larger industry peers is the company's incredibly cheap BTC production cost. In May, TeraWulf achieved a per-coin electricity cost of $6.2k due to the company's average energy price of $0.028/kWh. Lake Mariner Nautilus Ownership 100% 25% Site control Long-term lease Long-term lease Total fleet capacity 34k miners 16k miners Power source Nuclear >91% hydro Source: TeraWulf TeraWulf operates two different sites; Lake Mariner is located in Barker, NY and Nautilus is in Berwick, PA. Nautilus is particularly interesting because the power source is 100% nuclear. Lake Mariner's power source is largely carbon-free hydro. Even though it's a shared site, at Nautilus, TeraWulf has a 5-year fixed power price of $0.02 per kilowatt-hour. Nautilus is home to 9,000 S19j Pros and 7,000 S19 XPs. At Lake Mariner, TeraWulf is running 18,000 S19j Pros and 6,000 S19 XPs. Projected EH/s Capacity Growth (TeraWulf) TeraWulf had been guiding for 5.5 EH/s online by the end of Q2-23, and announced on June 22nd that the company hit that goal. Going forward, TeraWulf has the ability to scale up to 10.5 EH/s at current sites if the company opts to do so, though that would require more capital. Financials In recent quarters, TeraWulf has been focused on cost reduction. Despite having a highly competitive gross profit of 57% last quarter, WULF has had a bit more SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenue compared to peers with large EH/s figures: Q1-23 RIOT CIFR MARA WULF Total Revenue 73.2 21.9 51.1 11.5 Cost of Revenue 63.1 8.1 33.4 5 Gross Profit 13.8% 63.0% 34.6% 56.5% SG&A 12.7 17.4 15.3 10.3 SG&A % of Rev 17.3% 79.5% 29.9% 89.6% Source: Seeking Alpha, non-percentage figures in millions of USD On the 2022 year-end conference call , the company guided for just $22.5 million in SG&A for 2023, which would be a dramatic reduction from the $36 million spent last year and an indication that SG&A will decrease in upcoming quarters. Q1-23 Assets (TeraWulf) From a balance sheet standpoint, WULF has $17 million in cash, $117k in digital assets, and $159.4 million in property, plant and equipment. Q1-23 Liabilities (TeraWulf) The liabilities are a bit high at $170.5 million, but the company has been working to restructure its debt in recent months . $113 million of that debt is long term, but does require quarterly payment between now and December 2024. The question for WULF shareholders is what BTC price is needed for TeraWulf to pay that debt down without restructuring again? Can They Pull This Off? In April and May, TeraWulf was able to mine 281 BTC at an average BTC to EH/s ratio of 77.6. If we use 75 BTC per EH/s as a baseline estimate for revenue going forward and $7k for a power cost per BTC produced, we can start to see the vision a little bit better for TeraWulf: Quarterly $30,000 $35,000 $40,000 $45,000 Revenue $38,400,000 $44,800,000 $51,200,000 $57,600,000 Electricity $26,880,000 $26,880,000 $26,880,000 $26,880,000 SG&A $5,000,000 $5,000,000 $5,000,000 $5,000,000 Depreciation $9,000,000 $9,000,000 $9,000,000 $9,000,000 Loan Payments $16,000,000 $16,000,000 $16,000,000 $16,000,000 Earnings -$18,480,000 -$12,080,000 -$5,680,000 $720,000 Source: Author's calculations and assumptions It's important to remember this does not take into consideration any upward adjustments to global network hash rate or any changes to the company's current mining capacity. Production per exahash has generally varied month to month, and 75 BTC per EH/s could be an optimistic expectation if the price of BTC continues higher. The quarterly depreciation estimate is based off 5-year life use of the property, plant, and equipment from the company's Q1 report. Like every public Bitcoin miner, TeraWulf's destiny will ultimately come down to how the underlying commodity performs. By my calculations, TeraWulf's breakeven price is roughly $45,000 between now and the end of 2024. However, after the company's long-term debt is paid off next year, TeraWulf is generating positive earnings at $35k BTC as currently constructed. But of course, these are my estimations and may differ from the company's actual outlook. Summary I do think there is quite a bit to like about this name. It's not one that I am currently holding in my personal portfolio, but it's definitely one that I'll be keeping an eye on. There is a large level of insider ownership and the company has been able to reduce debt over the last couple quarters. At this stage in the cycle, public miners probably want to think about scaling BTC holdings into the halving, and WULF simply isn't in a position to do that yet. It's a watchlist stock for now for me.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613735-terawulf-quickly-scaling-before-halving?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14231514.jpeg

42420072,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXmY9,1687820457,Damus Founder Now Expects Deplatforming From Apple App Store,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to remove Damus – a Twitter-like app popular with bitcoiners – from the App Store on Tuesday, for reportedly violating the company’s in-app purchase guidelines.  The decision was tweeted out Monday by Damus founder William Casarin, who also confirmed the news to CoinDesk in an interview.  Damus is a decentralized social media platform that runs on the Nostr protocol, which is popular with bitcoiners partly because most implementations of it support payments over the blockchain's Lightning Network. (Nostr is an acronym for “notes and other stuff transmitted by relays.”)  The app went live in the App Store earlier this year, only to be threatened with delisting on June 13 because of “zaps” – a special Damus feature that allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin (BTC) over the Lightning Network to tip their favorite content creators, much like Twitter’s “tip” feature. Lightning is Bitcoin’s second layer payment network for cheaper and faster transactions.  “Two weeks ago, we identified a feature in the Damus app that allowed users to send a tip in connection with digital content in the app, which violates App Store Review Guidelines 3.1.1 and 3.2.1 (vii),” Apple told CoinDesk.  Casarin said that Apple wanted the zap button removed from all “notes” or content sections – a configuration Apple deems tantamount to selling digital content according to Casarin – although it was fine to have a zap button on user profiles.  “​​I had a call with Apple and they told me that they don't want zaps to be used for selling,” Casarin explained. “I thought one of the compromises we can do is we’ll actually remove all note zapping functionality.”  He said he modified the Damus interface such that zap buttons would still appear on notes, but the zaps themselves wouldn’t be associated with any notes and would only be sent and processed at the profile level. Casarin says Apple wasn’t satisfied with his compromise.  “I spent the last two weeks removing the ability for users to see zaps,” Casarin said. “I resubmitted it and they just gave the exact same response.”  Apple confirmed it had engaged Casarin and clearly explained to him how to resolve the issue.  “As we previously communicated to this developer, they were to address the issues we outlined to them by their next update,” Apple explained. “Upon receipt of their latest submission, we found the issues were unresolved and rejected their app.”  None other than former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to criticize Apple's decision, arguing that ""tips aren't unlocking content."" Earlier this month, he had tweeted that a move by the tech giant to cut off Damus could restrict Bitcoin adoption and thwart the “one opportunity to build a truly global payment protocol for the Internet.”  Dorsey, who is now CEO of Bitcoin-focused financial services company Block (SQ), has donated millions towards the protocol’s development.  It’s unclear if the looming removal is simply a misunderstanding by Apple or part of a broader crackdown to restrict certain types of bitcoin-focused apps. On June 14, the company rejected an updated version of the non-custodial Lightning-enabled bitcoin wallet Zeus, but it was subsequently approved the next day.  “We review all apps against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers,” Apple said.  Casarin and others have criticized the company’s approval process, calling it “opaque.”  “The frustrating thing is that whenever you get feedback from Apple reviewers, they don't tell you specifically how you're breaking the guidelines,” Casarin said. “It's very frustrating. I think a lot of Bitcoin apps are at risk.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/26/damus-founder-now-expects-deplatforming-from-apple-app-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/03f3d4790213f6ddad9ef9d108bce2124ce0f599-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
14230805,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539706,1687820408,"The Blessing Of July: Can Bitcoin Climb To $36,000 In The Coming Month?","The month of June is quickly drawing to an end and although the price of Bitcoin is maintaining a bullish streak, it is still sitting well below expectations. However, all hope is not lost as the market moves into the month of July which has historically been a bullish month for the digital asset. So the question now is, will Bitcoin will able to finally break above the $36,000 level in the new month? July Could Hold The Answers For Bitcoin In a June 26 report, Markus Thielen, Head of Research at Matrixport pointed to a possible bull run for Bitcoin in the month of July. The prediction is not without merit as Bitcoin has historically done well during this month. Although there have been years where this did not hold true, the years in which it did far outweigh the latter. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Becomes 14th Largest Cryptocurrency As Bull Rally Heats Up Thielen points to the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, all of which saw the digital asset move up double-digits. Additionally, in the last decade, July has seen the price of BTC recover significantly for a total of seven years compared to only three years where it failed to rally. Given this, the head of research paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency that could see it reach as high as $36,000. This figure plays on the fact that over the last three years, BTC’s price in July has risen an average of 20%, so another 20% move for BTC from its current level will see it move above $36,000. Furthermore, expectations going toward the end of the year 2023 also remain very bullish as Thielen also sees a possible move up to $45,000 for the digital asset. “Bitcoin tends to move 10,000 points up, only to retrace 5,000 and then rally another 10,000 points (until we reach $45,000 by year-end,” the head of research said. July is a historically bullish month for BTC | Source: Matrixport He added that: “We have seen a rally from nearly $15,000 to $25,000 only to drop back to $20,000 due to the U.S banking crisis, then rally another 10,000 points to $30,000 and sell off to $25,000 because of the Binance-SEC lawsuit. Now we appear on the way to $35,000 as the expectations for the Bitcoin ETFs approval will bring more U.S. institutions and U.S. retail into this space.” US Investors Continue To Lead BTC Rally US Investors have been participating more in the crypto market, especially when it comes to Bitcoin, as reported by NewsBTC last week, and this increased participation from the region has been fueling the digital asset’s rally so far. BTC shows strength above $30,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The Matrixport report shows that most of the BTC rally has occurred during US trading hours. To put this in perspective, BTC prices have risen 16% during US trading hours, 1% during European trading hours, and have declined by 7% during Asian trading hours.

14229409,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539728,1687816838,ETHBarcelona IRL: A Look Behind One Of The Ethereum Community Most Anticipated Events,"“Crypto is Culture” is one of the main themes behind the ETHBarcelona Conference. The community-led event is gearing up for its second edition at one of the most important civic centers in the world, with a promise of highlighting Ethereum and crypto beyond its market value. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation Education, social impact, art, price, and Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology are some subjects that will be present during the three-day event from July 5 to 7. We sat down with the team behind ETHBarcelona to discuss their vision, running an event amidst a bear market, and why conferences still have value. This is what they told us. Q: Conferences are a big part of anything that wants a place in today’s culture, but what’s different about ETHBarcelona; what’s at the event’s core? And maybe you can tell us more about what inspired its creation. ETHBarcelona Team: What sets EthBarcelona apart from most web3 projects is our unique focus on culture, values, public goods, and social impact, rather than solely prioritizing, it’s the only ETH event largely focused on social impact, which is also why we had about 40 percent of female attendees which is quite rare in Web3 events. The reason being the kind of focus this event has thats different from other ETH events. The idea for EthBarcelona and event organization actually originated back at Devcon V in Osaka, back in 2019. During those early days, when the local places would close early, I would receive numerous messages asking for plans and suggestions on where to go. That’s when I had the idea to create a group, and thus Blockravers was born. It started with coordinating gatherings of around 20-30 people, and soon it gained traction worldwide, leading us to organize parties. The popularity of Blockravers caught the attention of companies who began inviting us to their events, offering us free tickets. We became known as the curators of good vibes! This trend continued during Devcon in Colombia, and at EthDenver, we even rented a party house, which remained open every day for people to come and go. To ensure a sense of accountability and respect for shared spaces, we introduced a vouching system. In order to enter the party house, individuals needed to be vouched for by someone else. This system helped us maintain order in public spaces with limited resources. Those who caused damage, harassed others, or exhibited racist or homophobic behavior were expelled from the group, and the person who vouched for them also received a yellow card. Two yellow cards would result in expulsion as well. The vouching system extended to Zuzalu, where we rented a house and required people to be vouched for before entering. We even developed an application that initially used Venezuelan Bolivares’ serial numbers as unique identifiers for self-issued identities. As we distributed over 153 Venezuelan banknotes, more Zuzalu residents wanted to participate, leading us to allow anyone with a banknote to register and build trust. The serial numbers, along with a photo, became a way of saying, “This is me,” helping us establish a network of trust. As we continued experimenting with the system, we implemented a rule that attendees needed at least three vouches to attend the next party. Our work with identity, reputation, and vouching systems started with parties, but the concept extends far beyond that. It can be applied to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), governance, verification, and more. Token distribution within any community can benefit from this approach as well. We could reward actual humans who genuinely engage with us, contribute to the community, and have been part of the Blockravers journey. They are the ones who bring the vibes and make this community vibrant! So, our journey began with parties, but the potential for identity, reputation, and vouching systems reaches far and wide. It aligns perfectly with our focus on building a strong community and making a positive impact. Q: What are the challenges of running a community-driven event in 2023? And from your perspective, has the bear market impacted people’s interest in the nascent industry? Is it true that people build more during these price drawdowns? ETHBarcelona Team: Running a community-driven event in 2023 presents several challenges that organizers need to navigate. One of the key challenges is the issue of budget constraints. As mentioned, budget has always been a challenge, but despite that, we managed to pull off a highly successful event last year. Additionally, the bear market has further exacerbated the funding challenge. During a bear market, where cryptocurrency prices are generally in a downward trend, securing financial support becomes more difficult. But, we are grateful to our sponsors who have stepped in to support the event. Their involvement highlights the continued interest and belief in the nascent industry, despite the market conditions. One positive outcome however is the increased interest in the hackathon event. The bear market has not stopped builders from participating and showcasing their skills and innovations. In fact, it is often during price drawdowns that people tend to focus more on building and developing new ideas. This may be due to a combination of factors, such as lower market speculation and the opportunity to explore new avenues of growth and development. From my perspective, the bear market does impact people’s interest in the nascent industry, but not necessarily in a negative way. While it may discourage some investors and speculators, it tends to attract individuals who are genuinely passionate about building and creating value in Web3. These individuals are driven by their belief in the technology’s long-term potential rather than short-term market fluctuations. The bear market has not deterred builders, and if anything, it has fostered a stronger focus on development and innovation within the nascent industry. Q: With most conversations happening online, do you think conferences are still relevant? As crypto is said to be the bridge between the digital and physical spaces, how does ETHBarcelona embody this idea? ETHBarcelona Team: Oh, absolutely! While online conversations have become the norm especially in the Web3 world, conferences like ETHBarcelona are the ultimate proof that physical events still have their charm and relevance. You see, attending a conference like ETHBarcelona is like stepping into a whole different world—it’s like a festival for Web3 enthusiasts! First of all, picture this: a bustling gathering of brilliant minds, passionate developers, and crypto-curious individuals from all corners of the globe all with the goal of driving impact using this technology. It’s a vibrant melting pot where ideas collide and friendships are forged. You can’t replicate that level of energy and personal connection in a virtual setting! We’re taking the best of both worlds and merging them seamlessly. While the event is firmly rooted in physical interactions, it doesn’t shy away from leveraging technology to enhance the experience. Attendees get to enjoy captivating presentations, engaging workshops, and hands-on activities, all designed to deepen their understanding of Ethereum and blockchain technology. ETHBarcelona is providing attendees with an exquisite NFT (non-fungible token) ticket. It’s like owning a little piece of digital art that grants you access to this event. Not only does this embrace the digital aspect of crypto, but it also creates a tangible, collectible experience for participants. Q: How will ETHBarcelona address the negative narrative surrounding cryptocurrencies, such as bankruptcies and company collapses? What should be the dominant narrative in the industry beyond these issues? ETHBarcelona Team: I often am asked this question but to be very honest It is important to note that negative narratives are found in all industries, not solely within the web3 world. The current bear run affects not only the web3 industry but has also affected the tech ecosystem, which has been influenced by factors such as AI disruption, market uncertainty caused by ongoing conflicts, and other diverse elements. But sometimes it feels like people outside of the Web3 ecosystem have a tendency to beat this ecosystem more. Regardless of whatever happens outside, our focus is on shifting the narrative towards one of resilience, creativity, and boundless possibilities. We firmly believe in highlighting the accomplishments of entrepreneurs, startups, and visionaries who are pushing the boundaries of what is achievable. Our emphasis extends beyond mere profit generation—it encompasses the social impact that can be derived from crypto on finance, governance, supply chain management, and culture. Last year we took pride in showcasing projects like Ukraine DAO, which exemplifies how cryptocurrencies can serve as a powerful tool for positive change. This year we have amazing speakers from projects like Worldcoin, Giveth, ReFi DAO and many others! By showcasing the remarkable potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, we aim to inspire confidence, foster innovation, and drive positive change in the industry as a whole. Q: What can attendees expect from ETHBarcelona? How does “Crypto is Culture” relate to financial services, cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum? How do you go from finance to web3 to culture? And what’s the component that allows for this transformation? ETHBarcelona Team: Our event is designed to provide valuable insights, networking opportunities, and a deeper understanding of the intersection between culture, financial services, cryptocurrencies, and the Ethereum ecosystem. The theme “Crypto is Culture” encapsulates the idea that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have transcended their purely financial aspects and become intertwined with various aspects of our culture. This includes art, music, literature, social movements, and more. At ETHBarcelona, we explore the cultural impact and potential of the crypto industry, shedding light on its transformative power and the diverse perspectives it brings to the table.

By leveraging blockchain, artists, content creators, and cultural innovators can tokenize their work, establish ownership rights, and directly monetize their creations. This empowers creators with new revenue streams, facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, and promotes the growth of a vibrant cultural ecosystem.

In the past week, LINK has surpassed several support levels, resulting in a gain of over 20%. Although there haven’t been significant changes on the daily chart, the technical outlook for the altcoin has turned notably bullish. Both demand and accumulation have shown significant improvement, while the overall strength of the broader market has also contributed to LINK’s upward movement. The positive momentum in major altcoins, driven by Bitcoin surpassing the $30,000 mark, has further added to the optimism. Sustaining this price momentum will largely depend on BTC’s continued upward push. Related Reading: Binance Rescinds Decision To Remove Privacy Coins From European Market While a price pullback cannot be ruled out for LINK, the increased buying power should help prevent a loss of momentum. If LINK manages to maintain its nearest support level, the ongoing price rally is expected to continue as the increase in LINK’s market capitalization suggests the anticipation of further bullish gains. Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart After surpassing the significant psychological level of $6, the price of LINK was $6.20. The $6 mark has demonstrated its importance as a support level and dropping below it would potentially lead to a decline toward $5. On the other hand, if LINK manages to break the overhead resistance at $6.46, it could potentially rally to $6.70, representing a gain of over 11% in the upcoming trading sessions. In the event of a decrease from the current price, support levels to watch out for are $5.60 and $5. The trading volume of LINK in the last session has shown an increase, indicating an influx of buyers into the market. Technical Analysis Recent trading sessions have witnessed notable improvement in buying strength for LINK. Despite a slight dip in price, the buying strength has remained stable on the chart. This is indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) surpassing the 60-mark, signaling growing demand. This suggests the potential for increased gains in the price action. Additionally, buyers have driven the price momentum in the market, causing it to surge above the 20-Simple Moving Average line. The daily chart for LINK has shown buy signals in line with the increasing demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has displayed tall and growing green histograms, which are typically associated with buy signals. This suggests a positive momentum for the altcoin.

Yet in a Sunday report, Markus Thielen, head of research for crypto service provider Matrixport, wrote that July has been a historically strong month, including 24%, 20% and 27% returns in the past three years.  “Therefore, the probability that Bitcoin will be 10-20% higher during the next 30 days is high,” Thielen wrote. “Bitcoin could be at $33,000 to $36,000 by August.”  Thielen noted that bitcoin had followed a pattern this year of rising about $10,000 before falling $5,000 first after the tumult caused by the U.S. banking crisis in March when BTC sank to $20,000 after reaching as high as $25,000 and then following this month’s SEC lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase when it dropped to $25,000 from $30,000. “Now we appear on the way to $35,000 as the expectations for the Bitcoin ETFs approval will bring more U.S. institutions and U.S. retail into this space.”  Earlier this year, Matrixport predicted that bitcoin would reach $45,000 by years-end. Thielen added that BTC’s strongest rallies have occurred during U.S. trading hours, “a sign that U.S. institutions are buying Bitcoin while other regions are less active. “Claiming that ‘Crypto is dead in the U.S.’ appears to be a misconception,” he wrote.

On the flip side, dealers will be forced to sell on a potential decline below $30,000.”  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,854, off roughly 2.2% from Sunday, same time. In an interview with CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program, Katie Talati, head of research for crypto asset management firm Arca, said that a developer proposal to change Ethereum’s maximum validator balance from 32 ETH to over 2,000 “shouldn’t have an effect on the price of ETH necessarily,” calling the proposal “a long shot.”  Other major cryptos were largely in the red with ADA and SOL, the tokens of smart contracts platforms Cardano and Solana, recently both down more than 4%, although Bitcoin Cash was a rare bright spot, rising nearly 16% to reach a fresh one-year high. BCH, which forked from the original bitcoin blockchain, extended its rally to more than 100% in the week after being one of the four cryptocurrencies listed on institutional-backed crypto exchange EDX Markets.

The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys and safe haven asset gold ticked upward.  Arca’s Talati was cautiously optimistic about investors’ enthusiasm following the spot bitcoin ETF filings over the past 10 days. “The bigger problem is that most people don’t realize that ETF approval is going to be a while away, if it happens,” she said. “The SEC has taken a very strong anti-crypto stance.”  But she added: “There could be some more pressure on regulators to approve this vehicle, just because it is being sponsored by BlackRock. We’re also seeing other asset managers for the traditional world filing their own ETFs, which is promising down the road in terms of having access to the asset class.”",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH,BCH | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/26/bitcoin-holds-above-30k-as-investors-await-historically-strong-july-eye-options-expiry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35b4e313f6b5813dfd04ae2eca222b1b78572ab7-1706x1348.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420102,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoLd,1687811617,Federal Judge Permanently Bars MetaBirkins NFT Maker From Selling Birkin-Based Collectibles,"A federal judge has permanently banned a non-fungible token (NFT) maker from selling digital art collectibles fashioned after Hermes’ iconic Birkin bags, closing out a lengthy court saga that has served as a warning to NFT makers.  Judge Jed Rakoff, who presided over the case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ordered Rothschild and his associates to abstain from minting or selling MetaBirkins NFTs or using online domains associated with the collection. He also doubled down on a jury’s findings that Mason Rothschild, the collection’s creator, attempted to mislead consumers about his digital art pieces’ connection to Hermes’ luxury bags.  “As the jury expressly found, Rothschild, a self-described ‘marketing strategist,’ purposely sought (with some success) to confuse consumers into believing that his non-fungible tokens (‘NFTs'), labeled ‘MetaBirkins…’ were affiliated with Hermès’ iconic ‘Birkin’ trademarks,” Judge Rakoff wrote in a filing on Friday.  He added, “In effect, the jury found that Rothschild was simply a swindler.”  The judge’s permanent injunction marks the final judgment in the months-long lawsuit. It is possible Rothschild can appeal the ruling, however.  Rothschild’s lawyer declined CoinDesk’s request for comment.  The MetaBirkins NFT collection, a set of 100 digital art collectibles, garnered considerable attention when it dropped in December 2021, generating more than $1 million in sales, Reuters reported.  However, French fashion house Hermès International sued the MetaBirkins NFT creator in January 2022, alleging the California-based artist’s Birkin-inspired collection infringed on its intellectual property rights. In February, a jury sided with the handbag maker, awarding the company $133,000 in damages.  Rothschild’s loss to Hermes serves as a warning to other creators in the underregulated NFT space, where intellectual property infringement isn’t entirely uncommon.

Over the past week, most of the crypto market has seen a boost in prices following the Bitcoin-fueled recovery, which also saw the premier cryptocurrency trade above $31,000 for the first time since June 2022. AAVE Price Overview AAVE began last week trading around $50.99 before experiencing some steady gains during the week, causing the DeFi token to close its weekly market at a price of $56.86. Related Reading: Pepe Surge: Trading Volume Outshines SHIB And DOGE – Will This Trend Continue? That said, the AAVE coin experienced a massive spike in price yesterday, June 25, propelling the token by 32% to trade as high as $75.06 for the first time since last month. Although the token has since declined from this price level, AAVE appears to have found some stability and could be preparing for another breakout. At the time of writing, AAVE is exchanging hands at $65.4, with a 0.67% rise in the last hour. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume stands at $406 million, having gone up by 1.85% in the last 24 hours. In addition, AAVE boasts a total market cap of roughly $942 million, allowing it to rank as the 44th biggest cryptocurrency in the market. AAVE Trading At $65.88 | Source: AAVEUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Behind’s AAVE Rise Following AAVE’s recent price boost, there has been much speculation on the propelling force behind this bullish movement. According to on-chain analytics firm, Lookonchain, AAVE’s gain in market price appears to be due to massive whale activity by an investor with wallet address “0x5a80” in the last day. Related Reading: Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity Via a post on their official Twitter handle, Lookonchain reported that Whale “0x5a80” began acquiring massive amounts of the DeFi token in the early hours of yesterday. The individual purchased 182,152 AAVE – worth $13.2 million at the time – within a span of 5 hours. Looking at data from CoinMarketCap, Lookonchain concluded that this massive whale activity coincided with the period in which AAVE’s surge in market value began yesterday. As of this morning, the blockchain data platform also reported that the whale “0x5a80” had acquired a total of 257,147 AAVE tokens – valued then at $17.2 million – in the last 24 hours. Before halting their buying spree, whale “0x5a80” is believed to hold an estimate of 474,579 AAVE tokens – valued at $31.8 million. However, since whale “0x5a80” stopped accumulating AAVE, the token’s market price has been on a nosedive, losing nearly 13% of its value in the last 8 hours. That said, several AAVE investors are likely to be on the watch for the actions of the whale “0x5a80” over the next few days, as it may be pivotal to the token’s future price movements.

42420105,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoNh,1687807627,U.S. Judge Rejects Binance.US Complaint Over SEC Press Release,"A federal judge has rebuffed Binance’s request to curtail the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) use of language pertaining to Binance.US’ management of customer funds in press releases, which the company had argued could hurt it at trial.  D.C. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over the SEC’s case against Binance.US, dismissed the claims, maintaining the court’s mandate is not to “wordsmith” public statements from either of the case’s parties.  “It is not apparent that Court intervention … is needed at this time, or that it is necessary or appropriate for the Court to get involved in wordsmithing the parties' press releases,” Judge Jackson ruled. “Nor is it clear that the agency's public relations efforts to date will materially affect proceedings in this case.”  Lawyers for BAM Trading, which operates under the name Binance.US, filed a complaint about the SEC’s press release on Friday, raising concerns over the SEC’s “misleading extrajudicial statements.”  “The SEC’s press release also appears to be designed to introduce unwarranted confusion into the marketplace, which will have the effect of harming BAM customers rather than protecting them,” Binance’s lawyers said.  They added that “it also risks tainting the jury pool with misleading descriptions of the evidence concerning the Defendants.”  The company’s lawyers also maintained that there is “no evidence that BAM customer assets have been dissipated, commingled, or misused in any way.”  The judge gave Binance until September 21 to respond to the SEC’s allegations. The SEC’s reply to the company’s pleading will be due November 7.  Binance's complaint to the court comes as the company gears up to fight against the SEC in court. The SEC sued Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volumes, on June 5, alleging the company and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao violated federal securities laws, according to the complaint.  The SEC has sued several high-profile crypto companies in recent months, citing a need to protect investors from a risky, largely non-compliant industry.

42420088,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoAH,1687807321,"Uniswap's Hayden Adams: Q&A on Weathering the Regulatory Storm, What’s Next for DeFi","Uniswap Labs CEO Hayden Adams launched Uniswap in 2018 just as Ethereum and the idea of blockchain-based computer code, called “smart contracts,” were first taking hold.  The platform mainstreamed the automated market maker (AMM) – a tool that allows people to swap between currencies without the use of middlemen – and quickly grew into a financial behemoth. Still the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) in a growing field of competitors, Uniswap has processed over $1 trillion worth of transactions across a variety of blockchains.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Adams argues that Uniswap v4 – an upgraded version of the platform that Uniswap Labs opened for public review earlier this month – will make the platform even less centralized and more powerful than ever. Adams also addresses concerns with the distribution of power in Uniswap’s governance system, and he gives his take on the U.S. regulatory crackdown on crypto.  This interview, which was edited, was conducted on June 12.  Can you tell me a little bit about what the plan is with Uniswap v4, the vision, and how it differs from v3 and other previous iterations of the platform?  Historically, the way that new protocol versions have come out has been almost more like products, in the sense that they've been basically announced when they're almost done. And that was sort of, I think, something that made sense at the time. But with where the Uniswap protocol is today, building in public and inviting the community to build alongside us and contribute to this decentralized protocol is a really important thing.  When we first rolled out Uniswap v3, it was a really powerful protocol. And it sort of ultimately proved itself, and today it has about 90% market share on Ethereum specifically for on-chain trading and AMMs. But, you know, one very valid piece of criticism that it got a little bit was like, ""Oh, this thing came out. We're kind of surprised. I didn't have time to build my integration, and so I had to wait and build it after it launched.” And so I think part of it is it allows, basically, shifting towards a model much closer to Ethereum, where on Ethereum, everyone knows about a hard fork many months, or half a year, before it happens. All the different projects building on top of Ethereum have many months to prepare and start building on top of it, as well as give feedback on the upgrade itself. There are open processes for how people give feedback on the Ethereum roadmap. And so similarly, people will be able to give feedback and even contribute code to the next version of the [Uniswap] protocol.  It sounds to me like the biggest thing with Uniswap v4 is these ""hooks,"" which expand upon the functionality pools. Can you kind of explain this whole hook idea and what it's going to unlock for users?  Really what you find in the process of building things like Uniswap is that you make a lot of trade-offs. Hooks are essentially ways of customizing and modifying how liquidity pools work within Uniswap. These are done by the people who create pools, anyone can create a pool and then choose how to customize it. What we wanted to do with hooks is let people basically make these trade-offs themselves and really choose how their pool works.  Hooks are really about exposing a lot more flexibility and customization. I'd say that that's one part of it. I think that another aspect of hooks is that it's, in part, just about turning Uniswap into a little bit more of a platform that’s more expressive.  Can you talk to me a little bit about Uniswap’s approach to decentralization – both in terms of how the platform is built and in terms of how the platform is run in a permissionless manner where anyone can create a pools? How does your approach differ from other decentralized platforms?  Decentralization has been part of our philosophy since the very, very beginning and still is today. Just like all previous versions of the protocol, Uniswap v4, at its core, is a smart contract that runs on Ethereum. It's an immutable smart contract. It can't be upgraded, it's permissionless, it's open, it does what it says it does. And so that's a core part of it.  I think that where Uniswap v4 may even take it to like the next level is that it just gives people more choices and flexibility and allows for a very powerful developer ecosystem on top of it. v3 already had this in certain ways, but with this hooks design, not only are we not controlling the system, we're also not even telling you how the pools should work.  Does the whole decentralized governance thing fall apart a little bit when there are individual entities like a16z (the crypto-friendly venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz) that control so many tokens? Uniswap is by no means exceptional in this respect, but is there any concern around VCs and other big entities controlling these initial distributions or accruing tokens over time?  I think there's many different forms of decentralization. But first, I think that the most important aspect of decentralization within Uniswap is that no one controls the protocol. No governance vote, for example, can withdraw the funds of liquidity pools. There's different types of decentralization and different degrees of it. I'd say that the best form of decentralization is not needing any governance. True automation. The most pure form of decentralization is to automate and make immutable what can be automated and made immutable.  The second form of decentralization is economic, if something can naturally work because of economic incentives that are created. You can imagine liquidity providers and swappers – they engage in a two-sided marketplace, and there's no need to govern what's happening. It's not about governance. There's a natural economic incentive to participate in the system. And that's also a really important form of decentralization: anyone can participate, and then you have this open marketplace.  Let’s turn to the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits from the SEC. I want to get your take on what it means for a decentralized platform, like Uniswap, that the SEC is going after these centralized platforms.  I don't really know too much about those lawsuits. Generally, I think that DeFi and decentralized platforms are quite different from centralized ones. There are different properties and so I don't have a ton to add.  Personally, I do think that over time I always expect to see more decentralized platforms over centralized ones. I think there are, like, fundamental benefits of self-custody, transparency that they can offer, provable solvency – all these things.  Binance and Coinbase, they're thinking about regulation every single day. They've got a bunch of lobbyists on their payrolls who are in Washington, D.C. – and, I'm sure, in many other countries – lobbying on their behalf. They have legal apparatus within their companies, checks that engineers have to do with their PMs, and so on, in order to make sure that they're compliant. In your day-to-day, how does regulation factor into how you make decisions at Uniswap Labs?  Yeah, I mean, obviously we have lawyers and we make sure that everything that we do is legal and all of that. I would say that generally speaking, the way I think about the space, though, is DeFi is a new industry, and I work in it because I believe that it offers fundamentally better outcomes for users. I wouldn't work in DeFi if I thought that it was not a good thing for the world, right? I see DeFi as like the internet in its early days, where, yeah, there's a lot to figure out – there's a lot of rules that had to get crafted to regulate the internet. There was a period of time when it was an open question, like, should like e-commerce be legal? Buying things on the internet? That sounds scary. Or, like, should things like YouTube be legal? ""Oh, how should we deal with trademark infringement?"" And the DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] got created.  I think that generally speaking, this industry is, in my opinion, here to stay. And this technology is here to stay. The U.S. is probably lagging behind – almost definitely lagging behind – other countries. We've seen in Europe for example, in the UK and France, people have started to engage more directly with DeFi and are thinking about how to create rules for it, and I think being quite thoughtful about it from what I've seen. The U.S. seems pretty far behind on that front, as far as I can tell.  Something I'll note as well is that I think sometimes in crypto people can talk very much about what's happening in the U.S., but something like more than 70% of Uniswap users are not in the U.S. At this point, my hope is that more progress can be made in other countries, and the U.S. can learn from that as opposed to the U.S. leading.  Crypto is in a down period. Volumes across decentralized platforms, relative to a year ago, two years ago, are continuing to decline. Are you nervous about the future of decentralized finance in light of the regulatory crackdown and in light of the retail fleeing from these platforms? Or do you see this as a more normal cycle where we're just in a bear market, and there will inevitably be another bull market?  My own measures of progress have never been prices. My measures of progress have always been progress, and to me, progress is the state of the industry, people using. My rates of progress are about the fundamental value that's been created and the kind of technical innovation that has happened. And to me, that number has continued to go up over time.  While there's a lot of noise in the industry sometimes, and there's a lot of hype and distraction – there have been a lot of very high-profile scams in the past year – I've said that a lot of the things that broke were things that were kind of broken to begin with. They were highly-centralized things that were heavily marketed. True DeFi has really weathered the storm quite well, in my opinion. In terms of, like, MakerDAO, Compound, Uniswap – all of these protocols have actually handled this market cycle extremely well in terms of operating flawlessly.  And so that's a really strong indication – the things that broke were the things that looked most similar to the things that we're trying to replace. It was the highly-centralized projects, the off-chain, hedge fund-looking things that had loans that were not secured on-chain, you know, stuff like that, that broke. It wasn't the Uniswaps.  Personally, for me, I almost enjoy these times more, in a sense, because we get to focus on building and progress as opposed to hype and marketing, which is sort of what dominates a bull market.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | UNI,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/26/uniswaps-hayden-adams-qa-on-weathering-the-regulatory-storm-whats-next-for-defi,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a4447c02872ae57f9ab38525eb3b55a5c8fb4a61-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14225233,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539752,1687806027,Kaspa (KAS) Takes Altcoin Market By Storm With 60% Growth,"Kaspa (KAS) has been making waves in the altcoin market lately, with its impressive surge of over 60% in the past 14 days, according to CoinGecko data. The cryptocurrency is based on the GHOSTDAG protocol, which is a generalization of the Bitcoin Consensus. This protocol offers several advantages over traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms, including higher throughput and faster confirmation times. Kaspa Emerges As Top Performer Recently, the Kaspa team announced a significant new feature that is set to go live on the KAS testnet. The 10BPS feature promises to deliver “unmatched” transaction speeds of up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). This is a massive improvement over the current transaction speeds of other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which typically offer only a fraction of this throughput. Related Reading: Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity According to the announcement, the 10BPS feature is currently being stress-tested on the KAS testnet, where it is setting new records for crypto BPS. 🚀Groundbreaking 10BPS will be live and public on the $KAS testnet at 7AM UTC. Stress testing block and transaction rates & setting new records for #crypto #BPS. More on how to participate soon. Witness this milestone live: https://t.co/ZjXVeSwUKY#POW #RustyKas #rustlang pic.twitter.com/hjxXXhc5fo — Kaspa (@KaspaCurrency) June 26, 2023 This considerable jump in transaction speed could be a game-changer for the Kaspa protocol, as it looks to gain more market share from established Layer 1 protocols such as Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana. In addition to the 10BPS feature, the Kaspa blockchain offers several other impressive features that make it a compelling choice for developers and users alike. One of the key features of the Kaspa blockchain is its scalability. The protocol is designed to support a high throughput of transactions, which makes it well-suited for use cases that require fast and efficient processing. This scalability is achieved through the use of the GHOSTDAG consensus mechanism, which allows for a high degree of parallelism and concurrency in the processing of transactions. Another key feature of the Kaspa blockchain is its security. The protocol is designed to be highly resistant to attacks, with a robust set of cryptographic algorithms and other security measures built in. This ensures that the network remains secure and reliable, even in the face of potential threats. Will KAS Bullish Momentum Continue? The cryptocurrency market has been on an upward trend lately, with many cryptocurrencies posting impressive gains over the past week. Among these is KAS, which has seen a price increase of 28.90% in the last 7 days, outperforming both the global cryptocurrency market (up 9.80%) and similar Layer 1 (L1) cryptocurrencies (up 12.90%). As of today, KAS is trading at $0.02558, with a 24-hour trade volume of $9 million. While the price has declined slightly by 0.83% in the last 24 hours, the overall trend is positive, with the cryptocurrency market showing signs of recovery after a period of consolidation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges In the short term, KAS is facing resistance at $0.02609, which it has struggled to break through since Saturday. However, if the token manages to overcome this resistance level and attract more players to its ecosystem, its bullish momentum may continue and new all-time highs could be within reach. Conversely, in the event of a further price drop, the $0.02449 level may serve as a support floor for KAS. This means that if the price falls to this level, it may find some buying support from investors looking to enter the market at a lower price. According to Coingecko, KAS has a total supply of 19 billion tokens, with a market capitalization of $495,310,928.

The company's offerings also consist of ""intelligent energy monitoring and controls, intelligent microgrid design software, middleware communications protocols for the energy industry, energy system engineering, custom hardware solutions, microgrid installation, energy modeling, management and implementation services, traditional data center services, and software consulting."" This, I believe, creates synergies with and complements CLSK's bitcoin mining business. CleanSpark Is Doing Great Deals As of June 21, 2023, CleanSpark announced the acquisition of 2 turnkey mining sites in Georgia with over 6,000 S19 XPs and S19J Pro+ miners for $9.3 million. This adds nearly 1 EH/s of hashrate, which will increase their total hashrate by over 50% to around 3 EH/s total at a time when the BTC price has crossed $30,000. CleanSpark got a ""deal"" >80% discounted price for hash rate factoring in the price of Bitcoin in 2022 vs now. In Apr 2023, CleanSpark had announced the acquisition of 6.3 EHs of Hashpower for $144.9 million which represented a $23 million per Exa-Hash/sec hash power, the new deal already represents over a 50% discount to the price paid per EHS in 2023. To further put the value of today's acquisition in perspective: In March 2022, Bit Digital (BTBT) had announced a $324 million deal to acquire 63,000 miners (2.4 EH/s) from Bitmain when Bitcoin was at $49,000. This had valued 1 EH/s at $135 million. In January 2022, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) had purchased 78,000 of Bitmain's newest S-19j Pro miners for $879 million when Bitcoin was, again, at $49,000. This deal effectively valued 1 EH/s at around $250 million. In October 2021, HIVE Blockchain Technologies (HIVE) had purchased 30,000 MicroBT Whatsminer's (1 EH/s of power) for $65 million when Bitcoin reached $66,930. Also in May 2021, Riot Platforms (RIOT) had acquired Whinstone US for $80 million when Bitcoin peaked at ~$58,000. Whinstone's facility in Texas had been 700 MW, representing 5-7 EH/s. This had valued 1 EH/s effectively at ~$20 million. If you compare CleanSpark's recent acquisition to previous acquisitions, it clearly seems to have secured an incredible deal, acquiring nearly 1 exahash of mining power for just $9.3 million, and this is at a time when Bitcoin appears poised for growth, fueled by the potential approval of Bitcoin ETFs from major fund managers like BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco, this purchase could provide major upside. SEC regulations may also benefit Bitcoin by driving a shift of value from lesser-known cryptocurrencies and irregulated tokens back into the blue-chip crypto options like Bitcoin. Let's get back to CleanSpark metrics and data that lead to my recommendation: Revenue and Income Per Q2 reports, CleanSpark generated $42.5 million in revenue in Q2 2023, up 14% from $37.2 million in the prior year. Bitcoin mining revenue was $42.5 million, showing the vast majority of their revenue is now from Bitcoin mining, as intended. Net loss for Q2 2023 was $18.5 million, compared to a $171,000 loss in the prior year. The increased loss was due to higher costs as CleanSpark continues scaling their operations. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.7 million, down from $19.6 million, as margins decreased with their growth investments. Bitcoin Mining Operations Output In Q2 2023 , CleanSpark mined 1,871 bitcoins, more than double the 871 coins mined in the prior year. At their 16 EH/s targeted ETH, they would mine around 9,500-10,000 Bitcoin per quarter, which as of BTC price today is an estimated annual revenue of ~$56 million. Operations seem largely on track according to CleanSpark's plans. They have acquired most of the new miners needed to reach their 16 EH/s target by the end of 2023: 6.7 EHS by Q1 2023 + 6.3 EHS (Apr 2023) + 1 EHS (June 2023) which already represents 14 EHS so far as of June 2023. Comparison To Industry Peers CLSK today, trades under its book value at a P/B ratio of ~0.81, which suggests it is significantly undervalued in comparison to its peers like TeraWulf (WULF) at a P/B of 2.05 and MARA at a P/B of 3.56. Despite targeting a hash-power of 9EHs, MARA trades at a higher market cap compared to CLSK, which is on track to achieve 16 EH/s in hash-power by the end of this year. Forecast Model, Outlook, and Risks In my forecast model for CleanSpark, I assumed a conservative 14 EH/s of Bitcoin mining hash power, which it would be at after the close of its latest acquisition. I also assumed Bitcoin price remains at its current levels (~$30,000) and had it factor in mining difficulty adjustments due to the increase in interest in Bitcoin this year. The model with these parameters projected CLSK to reach a quarterly revenue between $80-100 million by the end of 2023, which is to the order of ~$320-400 million annually at that scale if the BTC market price stays at current levels. Profit margins would expand at that level, generating potential net income in the range of $5-15 million per quarter ($20-50 million annually) factoring in operating expenses, depreciation, equipment maintenance and energy costs, and some mining difficulty adjustments. However, there are risks if Bitcoin falls into a bear market and if the mining difficulty increases significantly beyond expected figures. Also note that there is a projected block-reward halving next year, approximately in Apr 2024, which could impact revenue if Bitcoin does not continue to rise in market value (however, halving events historically have been followed by BTC bull runs). Profitability and margins could also come under pressure due to the short-term volatility in the Bitcoin price. Execution and miner acquisition/installation also present risks. Financial Position CLSK's cash and Bitcoin holdings declined QoQ to $15.6 million as per Q2 2023 report, compared to that reported in Q1 , as operations consumed more capital during this growth phase. But with higher hashrate and a potential market recovery, cash flows would likely strengthen significantly going forward from Q2 reported levels. In the Q2 report, there were no updates on energy services revenue but with a multi-year mining facility service contract, energy services could provide additional revenue or margin upside. Summary While the quarterly loss per Q2 report shows the impacts of scaling up a utility-scale Bitcoin mining operation during a bear market, CleanSpark seems to be executing well on its stated plans and the Bitcoin price gains seem to be another tailwind. In my view, CLSK is best positioned both in value and growth among other BTC mining peers (which are trading at a higher market cap than CLSK). At projected 16 EH/s, with even moderately higher Bitcoin prices, annual projected revenue and income potential from their Bitcoin business appears substantial, which should take CleanSpark towards profitability. However, potential Bitcoin price declines and market weakness could put pressure on financial results and growth. There are also risks around their ability to continue acquiring equipment and scaling at their targeted pace. But if achieved, I believe, CleanSpark has the opportunity to become a market-leading North American Bitcoin miner, with a strong base for future growth beyond 2023.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4613679-cleanspark-recent-bitcoin-mining-site-deal-wins-growth-spark-promising-long-term-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14224971.jpeg

However, ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, stood out among the digital tokens with a notable price surge over five consecutive days of the rally. With a 20% increase on last week’s Monday trading session, ADA’s price spiked above $0.30. Although the ongoing market correction has stalled the token’s price rally, it still retains a 10.57% price increase. ADA’s Recent Price Performance The increased number of ADA transactions captured over the last month by Cardano Blockchain data hasn’t significantly affected the token’s price. Hence, ADA’s price elevation over the past few days seems more connected to external factors than development events on the Cardano network. Related Reading: Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity Fortunately, the recent market movements driven by the increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin coincided with ADA’s price trajectory. Most of the buzz generated in the market came from the news of BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF application, followed by WisdomTree, Invesco, and Volatility Shares’ ETF filings. Interestingly, observers perceive Cardano (ADA)’s price recent rally as part of the broader market dynamics triggered by the rising institutional attention on Bitcoin and crypto. As of Sunday, June 25, ADA traded at $0.29, a 2.67% price gain from its previous day’s valuation. ADA Price Outlook After the notable price increase in the past few days, the bulls have taken a break as the bullish momentum stalls. As of the time of writing, Cardano’s (ADA) price has tumbled 2.74% from its past-day price and now trades at $0.288. ADA has reclaimed $0.288 as its primary support level after the bulls failed to push the price higher. The pullback may be considered a typical occurrence given the rapid price surge in the last week. The token’s trading volume slumped slightly over the weekend, with a 24-hour decline of 25.45%. ADA’s market capitalization has declined by 2.80% and is at $10 billion at press time. Also, ADA/USD Price Chart on TradingView shows the coin is trading below the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, signifying a bearish trend in the short and long term. As of the time of analysis, the bulls are losing control, and the bears could take back control of the market once the price relapses deeper. A Spot ETF Approval Could Affect ADA Price It is worth keeping a close watch on how external market events could influence ADA’s price and investor optimism. Moreover, market participants should watch how the expected changes in the crypto space following the BTC ETF approval would impact crypto asset prices, including ADA’s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges The SEC approving the series of ETF applications would boost Bitcoin’s legitimacy. Also, it would attract more institutional investors who want leveraged exposure to Bitcoin through various investment products that would eventually be available. This improved investor sentiment could rub off on ADA and other cryptocurrencies, propelling their prices upward.

This innovative approach aims to flexibly classify tokens based on their function and purpose. Trevor Power, the Australian Treasury assistant secretary, shared in an interview with Cointelegraph during the Australian Blockchain Week that the purpose of this approach is to structure regulations around the principles of the token's function, rather than focusing solely on the specific technology or token. ""The token mapping paper spends a lot of time talking about the token, the system, the value delivered for the very purpose of trying to structure whatever regulation such that it draws on those principles so then a token can be placed within that,"" Power stated. He further emphasized the intent behind the approach, stating: ""It's trying to be tech agnostic. It's not trying to be token specific."" Shaping the Framework Power outlined that crypto assets, which change their utility and function over time, would be subject to regulatory review, particularly if they become significant within the ecosystem. This review will ensure that they ""graduate through the regulatory system"" accordingly, despite previous delays. He stressed the importance of creating a robust token mapping regulation that could function in a ""tech-neutral"" and ""principles-based manner,"" to adequately account for such changes. Influence and Reception Power highlighted that the token mapping initiative hadn't been influenced by recent regulatory enforcement actions by the United States Securities Exchange Commission. Instead, he hinted that Australia's crypto framework might lean closer to the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation in its approach. As Australia's token mapping framework takes shape, Power welcomed U.S. and foreign digital asset firms to consider the Australian market, asserting that they should align with the token mapping framework, designed to balance innovation and consumer protection: ""There are two arms to every component of regulation. One is to make sure that that framework is there, and the second one is to make sure there's room for industry to grow and be innovative."" Australia's Treasury Department believes that token mapping is essential to understanding how the crypto ecosystem interacts with the country's existing financial regulatory frameworks. They had earlier conducted a consultation process, inviting stakeholders' views on the proposed token mapping framework. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420089,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoBJ,1687801200,FTX Bankruptcy Team Says the Exchange Owed Customers $8.7B,"A new report from the FTX team that’s digging through the financial guts of the failed exchange said the company owed its customers $8.7 billion after commingling and misusing their deposits, and senior executives started hiding that trouble as early as August 2022.  About $6.4 billion of the money the FTX.com exchange owed its customers was “in the form of fiat currency and stablecoin that had been misappropriated,” according to the report filed on Monday. About $7 billion in liquid assets have been recovered so far, and those searching the company’s assets “anticipate additional recoveries.”  “The image that the FTX Group sought to portray as the customer-focused leader of the digital age was a mirage,” said John J. Ray III, the CEO who is trying to recover money for creditors, in a statement. “From the inception of the FTX.com exchange, the FTX Group commingled customer deposits and corporate funds, and misused them with abandon at the direction and by the design of previous senior executives.”  A product of months of analysis and forensic auditing, the new report paints a picture of company management and at least one senior lawyer knowingly misusing customer money, saying they “lied to banks and auditors, executed false documents, and moved the FTX Group from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, taking flight from the United States to Hong Kong to the Bahamas, in a continual effort to enable and avoid detection of their wrongdoing.”  The 33-page review is the second filed by Ray after he’d detailed an initial examination in April that provided a number of revelations of improper activity under founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s watch. Bankman-Fried is facing a number of criminal charges set for an October trial in New York.  The company is now in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings in Delaware. Ray has been trying to settle the exchange’s affairs since its November collapse, and there have been some hints that its operations could be restarted as FTX 2.0.  Those trying to trace FTX transactions and funding are finding the task ""extraordinarily challenging,"" the report indicated.  The company's senior executives, including Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX's trading affiliate Alameda Research, knew as early as August of 2022 that the firm owed more than $8 billion to customers, and it didn't have the money, according to Ray's report.  ""They did not disclose the shortfall, but at that time, for the first time, they created a sham customer account on FTX.com to reflect the hidden fiat currency liability,"" as described in the document. ""To minimize the risk of scrutiny, the FTX Senior Executives and Ellison referred to this sham account only as 'our Korean friend’s account.' The account reflected that their 'Korean friend' owed the FTX.com exchange $8.9 billion.""  The company also routinely misled its banking partners about how it was using accounts. A former employee of Alameda Research told the bankruptcy team that the company ""made no meaningful distinction between customer funds and Alameda funds,"" the report said.  Bankman-Fried also gave false testimony to senators at a Feb. 9, 2022, hearing when he spoke about his company's practices in protecting customers and their money, according to the report.

14223212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539677,1687800642,Ripple Emails Reveal: XRP Buybacks Were On The Table To Prop Up Price,"The recently published Hinman documents in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have caused quite a stir and strengthened the XRP army’s belief that the fintech will prevail against the regulator. What has attracted little attention, however, are the documents and emails that Ripple has had to release. One issue is of particular interest. Just recently, the “XRP buyback” theory hit the headlines once again. In recent days, there has been a lot of speculation about a possible buyback of 10 billion XRP tokens by Ripple Labs. However, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz was quick to put a stop to these speculations. In a clarifying tweet, Schwartz wrote: We do sometimes buy XRP. But I don’t know of anything specific that this could be referring to. And there’s no official source mentioned. Ripple Emails Reveal Musings About XRP Buybacks Even though the XRP buyback theory (propagated by Valhil Capital’s CEO Jimmy Vallee) has been dismissed as absurd by Ripple executives several times in the past, recently released documents and emails reveal that the fintech company was considering XRP buybacks to prop up the price even shortly before the SEC lawsuit in June 2020. In an email from Breanne Madigan, the VP Head of Global Institutions Markets at the time, she shared a presentation relating to XRP-O (On Demand Liquidity) supply concerns and the impact on the price. The presentation states that there are three possible narratives: First, XRP supply, regardless of the source, has a similar impact on the market. Second, Ripple’s XRP supply has a greater impact on the market, possibly due to higher visibility. Third, Ripple theorizes that On-Demand Liquidity’s XRP supply has the greatest impact on the market, possibly due to higher visibility, lower neutral liquidity and wider spreads. Related Reading: Breaking Through This Ceiling Will Propel XRP By Another 12% The third scenario is the most likely, according to the presentation, and also the reason why XRP has underperformed BTC since its halving in early May 2020. Ripple writes that XRP sales via XRP-O have led to negative pressure on XRP price. It also says that buybacks could directly dampen the impact of XRP-O sales. In total, the fintech company sets up five potential buyback options for XRP-O, each with a one to three month pilot period. These are: (a) Repurchase XRP via market makers (MMs) on multiple exchange (b) Repurchase XRP directly from MMs (c) Repurchase XRP on xxxxx via MMs (d) Reduce XRPO volumes and divert/ channel them to traditionals ODL (e) Stop XRPO altogether Jimmy Valhil’s #XRP buyback theory is extremely controversial. BUT: Recent #Ripple emails from the SEC lawsuit show: the company was considering buybacks in June ’20 (few months before lawsuit) to prop up XRP price. What would have happened without the lawsuit? #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/FkPAatVyhG — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) June 26, 2023 The recommendation of the creators of the presentation is option b) that Ripple buys back XRP directly from MMs (short-term plan). In the long term, the team recommended that Ripple sets up a new company and develops internal expertise. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi What the plans would have become without the SEC complaint can only be speculated. However, the documents show that Ripple is definitely pondering about XRP buybacks (but probably not like Valhil theorizes). A Stumbling Block For Ripple? However, popular Twitter user @JayVTheGreat has also pointed out a negative revelation from Ripple’s emails. He writes: “Don’t fool yourself or let anyone fool you into thinking that #ripple wasn’t marketing #xrp to speculators/retail.” He is referring to an email from Monica Long, the current general manager at Ripple. In the email, Long writes that:”it’s clear that we’re going to have to invest our near-term energy into attracting speculators.” The statement is critical in that Ripple has always denied advertising XRP as a speculative investment.

42420106,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoPl,1687799987,"Step Aside ‘Blockchain Technology’, IMF and BIS Have a New Crypto Buzzword","Last week the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – a United Nations organization that effectively operates as a global lender of last resort – and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) – a super-governmental central banking agency – published separate reports about the future of the monetary system. Both reports mentioned crypto and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and were generally positive about the potential for tokenization.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s not just the big governmental organizations either. Earlier this year the head of JPMorgan’s digital assets platform said “tokenization is a killer app for traditional finance,” Goldman Sachs said it was examining the “tokenization of real assets” and a recent research report published by financial firm Bernstein asserted that “tokenization could be a $5 trillion opportunity.”  Even CoinDesk’s Chief Content Officer Michael Casey wrote in March how technology has migrated the tokenization of real-world assets from “closed, permissioned projects onto public, permissionless blockchain platforms” and suggested that, yes, this time might be different. (Also, it’s me, hi, I’m the longer-serving colleague mentioned in Casey’s piece who rolled his eyes at the idea that tokenization of real-world assets is viable).  In any event, the IMF and BIS reports provide an interesting insight into how the bureaucrats view crypto because they both coalesce around the idea that tokenization is the killer application for crypto.  The BIS wrote: “Today, the monetary system stands at the cusp of another major leap. Following dematerialisation and digitalisation, the key development is tokenisation – the process of representing claims digitally on a programmable platform.”  Parsing this quickly, dematerialization and digitalization have both happened and have worked wonders for the world economy and commerce. Dematerialization, as in, banks keeping records on ledger entries rather than requiring the movement of physical currency with every transaction and digitization, as in, when that ledger entry practice moved from paper to digital. Tokenization, meanwhile, is the forward-looking idea that is “the process of representing claims digitally on a programmable platform,” to use the BIS’ words.  Okay, one more time, but this time slower.  Tokenization is the process … of representing claims … digitally … on a programmable platform.  Hold on. Is this anything?  Digitization of the monetary system is clearly the digital representation of financial claims. Does that mean financial technology companies, which often operate programmable platforms, is the next leap? Is that tokenization?  Read more: Crypto Ban May Not Be Best Approach to Balance Risk, Demand: IMF  Well, no. Tokenization, in the eyes of the IMF and the BIS, is the practice in which claims are traded on programmable platforms. If a blockchain is involved, those claims will likely be represented as tokens. Tokens are not just digital entries in a database. Rather, they integrate the records of the underlying asset normally found in a traditional database with the rules and logic governing the transfer process for that asset.  For a homebuyer, tokenization might mean that their deed is represented as a token on a blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead of a deed transfer signaling who the homeowner is, it’ll come from the transfer of a token.  Admittedly, tokenized real estate today stands on shaky foundations. Sure, the “rules and logic governing the transfer process for that asset” could exist on a token platform, but the exact moment a legal document or legal proceeding governs some aspect of ownership then you invalidate the entire use case for a token representing that piece of real estate.  Given the actual contents of the IMF’s and BIS’ reports, it appears institutions are less focused on the tokenization of commodities or real estate and are far more interested in the tokenization of central bank digital currencies.  Doing a what to a what-now?  First off, CBDCs deserve wider contemplation than will be offered here, but let’s focus on taking on CBDCs strictly from the lens of tokenization. The best way to summarize where central banking institutions stand on tokenization of CBDCs is to just share a quote directly from the IMF report:  To make a payment, participating banks deposit reserves in this escrow account and the platform creates a digital certificate of escrow for the bank to transfer on the ledger among other participants. In the simplest case, the recipient bank would receive a tokenized reserve from the sender’s bank and would credit the recipient’s account in parallel. The recipient’s bank could then sell the tokenized reserves to any other participant on the platform in exchange for domestic reserves. Many other operations beyond simple settlement are possible…  The central idea connecting the IMF’s and BIS’ reports on tokenizing CBDCs is the existence of some single or unified ledger. So distrustful are these organizations of non-central bank money (of course they are) that they must create a centralizing force to ensure the stability of settlement and “singleness of money.”  The BIS defines this unified ledger as “a ‘common venue’ where money and other tokenised objects come together to enable seamless integration of transactions and to open the door to entirely new types of economic arrangement.”  Now we’re not sure what will come of these discussions and explorations and examinations into tokenization, if anything at all. Plenty of countries are researching CBDCs, but only a handful have implemented these systems.  One thing’s for sure: The technobabble is dizzying. If the IMF, BIS and organizations like them want to create a CBDC with a single, unified, centralized ledger they don’t need to pretend they’re using cryptocurrency to do it. Conflating things like Bitcoin and the tokenization of CBDCs is misguided. At best, it’s a misunderstood yearning for a more tech-enabled money system. At worst, it’s a treacherous, intentional distraction from what makes Bitcoin and crypto attractive – which aren’t attractive because they are digital, but because they lack central control. Exactly what the central banks and regulators are trying to insert.  Simply signaling innovation is not actually innovating. And tokenization is hardly an improvement over what financial institutions already do. It is a distraction. It is nothing.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/26/step-aside-blockchain-technology-imf-and-bis-have-a-new-crypto-buzzword,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b783b529b4965eb5cc3203573a09f4437f664b5-4272x2848.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin-related products were the primary asset for inflows, seeing $188 million in total, representing 94% of the total flows. Short-bitcoin products saw total outflow of $4.9 million, for the ninth consecutive week, according to the report.  This comes after a number of high profile institutions filed for exchange traded funds (ETF) last week and bitcoin (BTC) price hit one-year high. Asset management giant BlackRock filed an application to roll out a spot bitcoin ETF on June 15. There were also re-filings for similar products by well-known TradFi firms such as Invesco and WisdomTree.  “We believe this renewed positive sentiment is due to recent announcements from high profile ETP issuers that have filed for physically backed ETFs with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission,” the report said.

The report noted that Exchange Traded Product (ETP) trading volumes totalled $2.5 billion for the week.  Meanwhile, Ethereum saw inflows of $7.8 million, representing only 0.1% of assets under management (AUM), relative to bitcoin's inflows of 0.7%, demonstrating less of an appetite for ethereum than bitcoin at present.  However, the positive sentiment didn’t flow through into altcoin investments, according to the report. “This turn in sentiment didn’t trickle down to altcoins with only very minor inflows into XRP and Solana totalling $0.24m and $0.17m respectively.

According to a press release, Azuki Elementals will include 20,000 NFTs based on the four Azuki elements of earth, fire, lightning and water. The collection includes different levels of rarity traits that will be revealed upon mint.  “Azuki Elementals expands the universe we created with the original Azuki collection,"" Zagabond, the pseudonymous co-founder of Azuki, told CoinDesk. ""This is our most ambitious artistic endeavor to date, and we are excited to tell the next chapter of the Azuki story using art and technology.”  The sale, which opens Tuesday as a Dutch Auction, will start at 2 ETH, (roughly $3,800) and will first be available to holders of Azuki NFTs or BEANZ – another Azuki derivative collection. Every five minutes, the price will fall by 0.1 ETH, or $187, until all 10,000 of the remaining Elementals NFTs have been sold.  A portion of the NFTs from the new collection was airdropped to existing Azuki holders on Friday at an event hosted in Las Vegas called “Follow the Rabbit.”  Azuki holders received an unrevealed Azuki Elemental NFT as well as a soulbound token to commemorate the event, according to a tweet from Azuki holder and event attendee Charlie G.  “The trailer that was launched at Vegas was of a quality the space hadn't witnessed before,” said Charlie. “It's the ability of Azuki to capture the attention of a whole space that goes far beyond what we typically see in NFT projects.”  According to data from secondary marketplace OpenSea, Azuki’s floor price at the time of writing is 15.3 ETH, or about $29,000. The project has brought in a trading volume of 569,795 ETH or just over $1 billion. The floor price of BEANZ is 1.28 ETH, or $2,400, and its trading volume is about $300 million.

The token’s price rose 17% in the past 24 hours to as much as $226.44, the highest since May 2022. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Cash Price Index (BCX), which tracks the token’s price on multiple exchange venues, is now higher by 111% over the past week.

The news was first reported by crypto journalist Colin Wu and reproduced by a number of different sites, including The Block.  However, this appears to be something of an overreaction. HSBC's customers in Hong Kong have in fact been able to trade such crypto investment products since they were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) in December, as the bank allows trading of all publicly-listed ETFs.  Crypto ETFs debuted on the HKEX with the listing of the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF (3066) and CSOP Ether Futures ETF (3068). These were joined by the Samsung Bitcoin Futures Active ETF (3135) in January.  Today's development would appear to be that HSBC customers can now also access these ETFs from the bank's investment platform.  The overreaction to this modest development demonstrates the excitement in the crypto community for any and all adoption of cryptocurrency investments by mainstream institutions such as HSBC in major financial centers like Hong Kong.  Indeed, Hong Kong has been emerging as a potential global crypto hub in recent months with its Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) accepting applications for cryptocurrency trading platforms on June 1 and inviting Coinbase (COIN) to come and register in the region.

14221387,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/binance-eyes-strategic-move-to-uae,1687795200,Binance Eyes Strategic Move to UAE,"The world’s top cryptocurrency exchange is eyeing a move to Dubai, in the midst of its battle with the United States’ Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Binance Dubai General Manager Alex Chehade has said that the UAE is the prime destination for crypto businesses and has noted its pro-crypto stance and policies. Chehade notes that the UAE is diversifying away from fossil fuels and has turned to cryptocurrency to achieve this. He also expects the influx of young people to the country to contribute to the rapid adoption of cryptocurrency. In a tweet last June 15, Binance MENA retweeted that over 27.7% of the UAE’s population are crypto owners. Virtual Assets and Financial Diversity The UAE has its own regulator exclusively for virtual assets, the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). Just last June 15, top crypto exchange OKX received an MVP preparatory license from VARA. MVP stands for ‘minimal viable product’ and a preparatory license allows approved licensees to fulfill all pre-conditions required to undertake MVP operations within the VARA regime. Binance itself received its own MVP license last September 2022. All of these point to the UAE’s pro-crypto environment and why numerous crypto businesses are eyeing to expand on the country. “There’s a clear framework for people and businesses to engage with, whereas you’re just not seeing as much of that elsewhere,” Chehade said. Contrasts and Regulation This is in contrast to the United States and the SEC. Binance is currently in the middle of a dispute with the United States’ SEC and has just filed a lawsuit against the commission last June 23. The SEC and its chairman Gary Gensler in particular, have not flinched on their hardline stance against virtual assets and businesses and there seem to be no signs of a shift anytime soon. Binance's interest in Dubai emphasizes the potential for countries with forward-thinking policies to position themselves as global crypto centers. By welcoming industry leaders like Binance, they can drive innovation and economic growth. Conversely, regulatory hostility or uncertainty, as observed in the US, can deter businesses and stifle the sector's development. The implications of Binance's strategic move extend beyond individual companies or countries. This shift illustrates a key aspect of the future growth of the cryptocurrency industry – the necessity of harmonious interaction between crypto businesses and regulatory bodies. While the robustness and security of the crypto market are paramount, overregulation can inhibit innovation and advancement. Striking this delicate balance could determine the trajectory of the global crypto landscape. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Arkham deanonymize blockchains by showing users the people and companies behind cryptocurrency transactions. Arkham’s support for the TRON blockchain will enable traders and researchers to track the entities on TRON using Arkham’s AI-powered analytics engine. TRON is the world’s leading blockchain by number of daily active addresses. It averages over 2 million daily this month, which surpasses both Ethereum and Bitcoin. It is the 2nd largest blockchain by total value locked. The TRON-Arkham partnership thus represents a major step forward in Arkham’s coverage of global blockchain activity. “This partnership aligns perfectly with our values, offering our millions of users the ability to dive deeper into the blockchain than ever before,” says a spokesperson of TRON DAO. “Arkham's cutting-edge analytics engine will bring a new level of understanding to the TRON blockchain, allowing traders and researchers to map out the entities within our network. Together with Arkham, we aim to revolutionize the way people view and interact with the blockchain.” Miguel Morel, Founder and CEO of Arkham, also added, “We’re delighted to have TRON as a partner, as we launch support for their blockchain on Arkham. They’ve achieved a significance which few other blockchains have, particularly in the Asian market, where Arkham is deeply committed to growing our presence.” About TRON DAO TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps. Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2023, it has over 168.8 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 5.97 billion total transactions, and over $12.49 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which marks the first time a major public blockchain partnered with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.

Coinbase (COIN) has been leaning into the institutional market, particularly with its plans to be the custodian for BlackRock's highly-publicized bitcoin exchange-traded fund, pending regulatory approval. In March, Coinbase acquired institutional digital asset manager One River.  Hut 8's new credit facility is made up of a $15 million term loan ""which is expected to be funded at or shortly following closing,"" an option to draw an additional $20 million between one and two months later, and another $15 million within 15 business days after completing the merger with USBTC, the press release said.  Hut 8 shares did not move significantly in early Monday trading.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Coinbase of operating an unregistered securities exchange in one of two recently-filed blockbuster lawsuits, the other one against Binance.  Coinbase Credit is one of the crypto exchange's subsidiaries, according to the firm's 2022 annual earnings report. In a previous filing, it is labeled as a ""finance subsidiary.""

This change in course comes after the exchange revised its operations to align with the local regulatory requirements. According to the developers of Verge (XVG) and Secret (SCRT) cryptocurrencies, a significant outcome was achieved. Seven privacy-focused tokens were stopped from being de-listed. These tokens, which were at risk of being removed from the listings, have been successfully retained. A comment received from the cryptocurrency exchange on June 26 states: After carefully considering feedback from our community and several projects, we have revised how we classify privacy coins on our platform to comply with EU-wide regulatory requirements. The crypto exchange also mentioned that due to its status as a registered exchange in multiple European Union jurisdictions, it is obligated to comply with local regulations. These regulations mandate that exchanges have the capability to monitor transactions involving the coins listed on their platform. In May, Binance communicated via email to its customers in France, Italy, Spain, and Poland regarding changes to its services. The message outlined the discontinuation of trading services for 12 cryptocurrencies known for enabling anonymous transactions. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Rumbles With 18% Gain – Is A Trend Reversal On The Horizon? Prominent privacy coins such as Monero, Dash, and Zcash were among those affected. Additionally, lesser-known tokens like XVG and SCRT were also scheduled for delisting from the exchange’s offerings. Following the retraction of the decision to delist privacy-focused tokens, several projects have utilized Twitter as a platform to provide reassurance to their community members. Binance Complies As EU Sets Standards For Digital Assets The decision to delist privacy-focused tokens came as a response to the European Union’s implementation of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. This regulation includes the “travel rule” for crypto transactions, which requires enhanced transparency and information sharing. Consequently, there is a potential risk for firms facilitating the trading of privacy coins to be non-compliant with EU law. EU policymakers have established clear regulations with the goal of positioning Europe as a leading hub for cryptocurrencies and digital assets. In July, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is set to initiate a consultation process for MiCA. These laws have an implementation timeline of 18 months to ensure full compliance and effective implementation of the regulatory framework. Cryptocurrency companies, including Ripple, have expressed their appreciation for the regulatory clarity provided by the MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) regulations. Binance’s decision to cease support for privacy coins dealt a major blow to advocates of these cryptocurrencies in Europe. Earlier, leading exchanges such as Kraken, Huobi, and Bittrex had already delisted popular privacy coins like Monero and Dash. Related Reading: MATIC Price Recovery Hits Roadblock, When Will Bulls Break Through? In other jurisdictions such as Dubai, Japan, and South Korea, authorities have taken a firm stance regarding anonymity-enhancing cryptocurrencies. These governments have adopted a clear-cut approach by implementing strict measures to crack down on these privacy coins. Outright bans have been imposed in some cases where there has been an explicit prohibition of the trading and issuance of privacy coins.

As part of the network update, Polkadot launched OpenGov to give the Polkadot community full control of the network by allowing holders of the DOT token to vote and propose referenda to make changes to the network. Polkadot hopes to transform its network into a fully autonomous, transparent, & efficient decision-making network by giving users equal rights to vote. As a result, OpenGov has removed the so-called first-class voters like the Polkadot Council and the Technical Committee from the voting. Now, the amount of DOT tokens a holder has determines their voting strength. In addition, this new governance infrastructure will allow for multiple governance proposals to be simultaneously voted on by the Polkadot community. With OpenGove in place, Polkadot has been transformed into a fully decentralized Web 3 project where all the governance processes are directly controlled by its community members. Tradecurve to Integrate AI Support Into Its Hybrid Exchange Since the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022, many projects have been exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. Tradecurve is a new hybrid exchange that is building the first crypto-exchange platform with AI integration to support algorithmic or automated trading. With the inclusion of AI-assisted trading, Tradecurve users will be able to leverage the advanced mathematical models of the platform to make trading decisions. The AI trading feature of the platform will support several variables, including price, timing, and volume, for users to place trades automatically. To add to AI trading, Tradecurve will also support copy trading. With this feature, traders can directly copy the trading positions of other more successful traders on Tradecurve. As a hybrid exchange, Tradecurve combines the best features known to centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to create a well-rounded platform. Tradecurve is currently in the fourth stage of its presale, where its native utility token currently retails for $0.018 apiece, but is expected to rise by up to 40% in the upcoming week.

The miners will be produced by MicroBT in the U.S. for a total price of $162.9M (exclusive of applicable taxes and fees and adjustments), equating to around $21.50 per terahash. Delivery of the new miners -- comprised of M56S+ and M56S++ models -- is expected to start in December, with miner deployment planned for Q1 2024. Full deployment is anticipated to be completed by mid-2024. Riot ( RIOT ) said it sees its self-mining hash rate capacity increasing to 20.1 exahash per second (EH/s). As of May 31, the company's deployed hash rate was 10.5 EH/s. ""These new miners will contribute an additional 7.6 EH/s to Riot’s self-mining capacity when fully deployed and will further enhance our already strong fleet efficiency in advance of the upcoming Bitcoin halving,” said Riot CEO Jason Les. RIOT advanced 3.8% in Monday morning trading, even with bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) down 0.1% to $30.5K. Also under the terms of the deal, the company has secured the option to buy up to 66,560 more M56S++ miners from MicroBT.

""We've got [other acquisitions] pending,"" Belshe told CoinDesk TV's First Mover on Monday. ""I haven't been able to announce them yet, but I think there's going to be consolidation in the space over the next six months.""  BitGo terminated the acquisition of Prime Trust on June 22 amid speculation of the target's bankruptcy. Nevada's Financial Institutions Division (FID) subsequently said Prime Trust had ""a shortfall in customer funds"" and was unable to meet all withdrawal requests this month.  Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was itself almost bought by Mike Novogratz's crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital (GLXY), until the $1.2 billion deal was canceled in August. Belshe said since Galaxy walked away, other offers have come ""from time to time,"" but BitGo is now more focused in growing its business rather than being acquired by a major player.  One possible suitor in the custody sector is crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), which was selected by BlackRock (BLK) as the custodian for its fund-management unit iShares' proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).  ""Coinbase is a public company and it's got a very healthy balance sheet, so they do get some of those first movers,"" Belshe said.

Japan’s National Tax Agency (NTA) has revised its corporate tax rules to provide a tax exemption to companies issuing cryptocurrencies. Under the revised regulations, companies will no longer be taxed on unrealized gains. Under the previous rules, companies issuing cryptocurrencies were taxed on unrealized gains at the end of a tax period. The NTA explained that companies’ holdings would be excluded from the market evaluation of a company’s assets if specific terms are met. Japan’s previously harsh tax regulations forced many domestically established crypto and blockchain firms to set up shop elsewhere. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) approved the proposal for the revised rules in December to improve business conditions for companies issuing cryptocurrencies in Japan. Japan Introduces Stricter AML Measures The Japanese crypto industry is changing after introducing stricter anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. Since June 1, tougher AML measures were introduced to trace crypto transactions to align Japan’s legal framework with international crypto laws after its AML measures were found to be lacking by the Financial Action Task Force. The cabinet revised the relevant crypto rules in December, focusing on monitoring the movement of illicit funds under the pretext of legal crypto transactions. Japan is such a significant player in the global crypto market, and the government was forced to address the risk associated with the industry. Part of Japan’s stricter policy includes the enforcement of the “Travel Rule.” The Travel Rule aims to ensure the precise monitoring of illicit proceeds. Under this rule, any financial institution processing a crypto transfer exceeding $3,000 must share customer information with the recipient exchange or institution.

14216990,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539666,1687782637,Lightning Network Hits Record Highs In Bitcoin And US Dollar Capacity,"The Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s Layer 2 payment protocol, has achieved a new landmark, reaching an all-time high in Bitcoin capacity, a pivotal move underscoring the network’s continued growth and increased adoption. The network, which works by locking Bitcoin in payment channels, witnessed a substantial boost, pushing its Bitcoin capacity to a record-high of more than 5,500 BTC for the first time since April, according to data from The Block. This monumental achievement signifies not just the robust growth of the network, but also the increasing confidence in the Lightning Network as a viable payment protocol. Surge In Bitcoin Network Capacity According to The Block, this past Saturday, the Lightning Network attained an apex in capacity, hitting 5,630 BTC. This figure surpasses the prior peak of 5,620 BTC recorded on April 18. Concurrently, the network’s US Dollar capacity also reached an all-time high, topping $172 million. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation The Block noted, as these numbers reveal, Lightning Network’s capacity has grown significantly, increasing 42% in Bitcoin and 105% in US Dollar terms over the last 12 months. This considerable advancement is a testament to the ongoing acceptance and utilization of the Lightning Network in the crypto world. The Future Of Lightning Network David Marcus, CEO of enterprise-grade Lightning Network firm Lightspark, emphasized the importance of expanding the network’s infrastructure and capacity. Marcus said the reason for this was “Particularly because we can actually guarantee that even larger payments succeed on Lightning, which in the past has been pretty hard to achieve.” Envisioning the future, Marcus explained that this development could “enable any enterprise out there to access a real-time, super low-cost settlement network for the internet that’s interoperable, that’s open, that any developer can build on.” Notably, Marcus underscored the need for the greater exchange involved in the network, arguing that this would not only bolster Bitcoin mobility but also enhance the Lightning Network on and off-ramps. Moreover, the Lightning Network’s success in Bitcoin and US Dollar capacity signifies a significant step forward in the ongoing evolution of Bitcoin as both a digital asset and a transaction protocol. It affirms the increasing demand for fast, cost-effective, and scalable Bitcoin transactions, a demand that is only likely to grow as more enterprises and developers tap into the potential of the network.

In this article, we'll explore the top cryptos of 2023, including Cardano, Solana, Avalanche, Ripple, and the newcomer, Caged Beasts (BEASTS). 1. Caged Beasts: Instant 20% USDT On Referrals Caged Beasts (BEASTS) is not your ordinary meme coin. With its vibrant art style and rewarding referral system, it sets itself apart from the other meme coins littering the market. It has just gone live with the first stage of its presale. The nascent meme coin rewards members of the community who actively participate in growing the community through its referral system. This system operates by allowing users to generate a shareable custom code that they can send to their friends to invite them to the community. When someone makes a purchase with this code, the referrer instantly receives 20% of the deposit made by the friend in BNB, USDT, or ETH, while the referred friend receives an extra 20% on top of their purchase as a welcome gift. 2. Avalanche: Riding the Wave of Potential With a $0.18 increase in value over the past 24 hours and a 1.06% upward trend in the last 7 days, Avalanche (AVAX) is capturing the attention of investors.

While the growth may be more modest compared to other projects, a 4.75% increase in the last month indicates the reliability of XRP as an asset.

42420108,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoRp,1687781895,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Retreats Slightly From 12-Month High,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) has slid about 3% after rallying to a one-year high on Friday above $31,300, trading currently at $30,300. The crypto’s roughly 20% drive higher over the past 10 days began after asset management giant BlackRock filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, with analysts suspecting that’s green-lit a move from large institutional investors to push further into the space. Making a big move higher on Monday morning is NEAR Protocol’s NEAR token, up 10% on the day and the top performing digital asset. The token climbed as the company’s foundation announced it would partner with Alibaba Cloud, the Chinese tech giant’s arm for computing and storage.  Last week, ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) – a Bitcoin futures fund offered in the U.S. – recorded the highest weekly inflow in over a year as bitcoin prices breached the $30,000 level, according to Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. BITO allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns with a regulated product and the latest holdings numbers show it holds over $1 billion worth of CME Bitcoin Futures. Investors poured $65 million into BITO in the past week, breaking a previous 2023 high of just over $40 million in April. The product did not see meaningful inflows in May and most of June alongside a retreat in the price of bitcoin.  Belgium's top markets regulator is ordering embattled crypto exchange Binance to immediately cease serving local customers, according to a Friday notice. The Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) said Binance is ""offering and providing exchange services in Belgium between virtual currencies and legal currencies, as well as custody wallet services, from countries that are not members of the European Economic Area,"" which the regulator says is in violation of a prohibition. ""The FSMA has therefore ordered Binance to cease, with immediate effect, offering or providing any and all such services in Belgium,"" the notice said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows a recent spike in bitcoin cash is accompanied by a rise in trading volumes and an uptick in social volume, a metric representing the degree of crowd chatter about the cryptocurrency on various social media channels.  An increase in trading volume alongside an uptick in prices confirms the uptrend. However, increased social chatter is often seen as interim market tops.

The startup has created a decentralized finance protocol that aims to bridge the gap between borrowers such as businesses and private debt foundations, and stablecoin holders who wish to lend their capital to earn yield. The protocol hosts a debt marketplace through which borrowers can obtain financing using tokenized collateral. Lenders, who pledge capital to Soil’s marketplace, will earn a highly competitive yield on their stablecoins, Soil says. The protocol’s revenue is derived from fees earned for connecting borrowers to lenders. Soil said its platform’s compliance with Estonian regulations is a key step for the company as it confirms the validity of its business model. According to Soil Chief Executive Jakub Bojan, the company hired teams of lawyers from multiple jurisdictions to ensure its protocol would be validated by local regulators. “Despite this great success, we continue to work and do our best to ensure that our project is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency market and is transparent and safe for our partners and investors around the world,” Bojan added. Soil explained that the security and compliance of its platform is a major priority for the company, as it seeks to position itself for the EU’s upcoming MICA regulation, which aims to protect consumers from the risks associated with investing in digital assets. The new legislation ensures that crypto asset service providers respect strong requirements to protect user’s wallets, and have certain liabilities in cases where customer’s assets are lost. The legislation also covers aspects such as market manipulation and insider dealing. Soil said the solid legal support, along with its innovative business model, means that it’s well positioned to inspire greater confidence in the DeFi ecosystem among investors.

Open interest, or the total number of unsettled contracts, on bitcoin futures increased to over $11 billion over the weekend to their highest level since May last year, when the then-behemoth Terra imploded.  Rising open interest either means that new money is flowing into the market or existing participants are increasing their allocation. The metric can be used as an indicator to determine market sentiment and the strength behind price trends.  As such, open interest has largely hovered at the $8 billion level since late April, Coinalyze data shows.  The rise in bitcoin futures trading comes parallel to a bump in volumes and buying activity on bitcoin options markets, used mainly by sophisticated investors to hedge against price swings or take levered bets on bitcoin movements.  Some market observers say the trend is likely to continue should ETF applications from traditional finance giants such as BlackRock be approved in the coming months.  “Bitcoin’s rally is part of a larger trend signaling a shift towards bitcoin as a distinctly strong and established store of value,” shared Alex Adelman, CEO of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, in an email last week.  “The recent burst of bitcoin ETF applications from leading institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco shows that new regulatory guidelines are the greenlight institutions have been waiting for to launch bitcoin-based products and meet client demand,” Adelman added.

14215692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539628,1687779006,Bitcoin Bullish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Plunges,"On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has taken a plunge recently. Here’s why this may be bullish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio Has Registered A Sharp Decline Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the selling pressure in the market may be diminishing right now. The “exchange whale ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the sum of the top ten Bitcoin transactions to exchanges and the total exchange inflow. Generally, the 10 largest transactions to exchanges are coming from whale entities, so this metric can tell us how the inflows of these humongous holders compare with that of the entire market. When the value of this ratio is high, it means that the whales are making up a large part of the total inflows currently. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can be a sign that this cohort may be taking part in mass dumping right now. On the other hand, low values of the indicator imply the whales are contributing a relatively healthy portion toward the inflows at the moment. Since these large investors aren’t selling significantly more than the rest of the market during such periods, the price of the cryptocurrency can feel a bullish effect. Related Reading: Momentum: Why The Bitcoin Train Is Ready To Leave The Station Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 72-hour simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin exchange whale ratio over the past several months: Looks like the 72-hour SMA value of the metric has taken a deep hit in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 72-hour SMA Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has plummeted recently, implying that the whale deposits have dropped relative to the rest of the market. Before this plunge, the indicator had been in an overall uptrend since March, suggesting that these humongous investors were possibly slowly ramping up their selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resurgence: Three Reasons Why BTC Has Eyes Set on $50,000 Next During the recent period when the asset’s price was struggling, the metric had surged to around 0.88, meaning that around 88% of the total exchange inflows were coming from this cohort alone. Following the latest rapid decline, however, the 72-hour SMA Bitcoin exchange whale ratio has dropped to around 0.80. Interestingly, this drawdown in the indicator has come while the coin has seen a sharp rally that has now taken the price above the $30,000 level. Usually, whales may ramp up their selling a little during such periods, as at least some of these large investors might be enticed by the profit-taking opportunity. Since that doesn’t seem to have occurred yet, it may be a sign that these holders believe that there is more to come for this rally. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator also saw a sharp plunge following the FTX collapse, which allowed the cryptocurrency to bottom out and eventually build up toward the rally. The current relatively low selling pressure from the whales may potentially allow the price of the cryptocurrency to grow in a similar fashion as well (which would only be, of course, given that the metric continues to be at these low values in the near future). BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $30,400, up 15% in the last week.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) presented the framework in a Monday report, which was produced in collaboration with the Bank for International Settlements’ (BIS) and other financial institutions.  The initiative, Project Guardian, has enlisted 11 institutions to test asset tokenization across financial asset classes. Pilot studies across wealth management, fixed income and foreign exchange will be carried out by banking giants such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, DBS and Citi, according to the announcement.  Standard Chartered, for instance, is developing an initial token offering platform to issue asset-backed security tokens listed on the Singapore Exchange. The bank will work with payments platform Linklogis.  “The initial pilot trade conducted in collaboration with Singapore Exchange and Linklogis proves the viability of assets-backed tokenization as an innovative originate-to-distribute structure, and the potential opportunities it presents to investors to participate in financing real-world economic activity,"" said Kai Fehr, global head of trade and working capital at Standard Chartered, in a statement.  Singapore's central bank is no fan of the crypto ecosystem, but has stated its commitment to promoting the technologies of the industry to improve existing traditional financial systems.  “While MAS strongly discourages and seeks to restrict speculation in cryptocurrencies, we see much potential for value creation and efficiency gains in the digital asset ecosystem,"" said Leong Sing Chiong, MAS' deputy managing director of markets and development, in the statement.

42420099,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoJZ,1687777396,Terra Classic Revival Plans Continue as 6 Engineers Aim to Revive LUNC Ecosystem,"Six engineers calling themselves the “Six Samurai” are proposing a Terra Classic ecosystem revival plan for the blockchain as some community members try their best to break away from the shackles of disgraced founder Do Kwon and rebuild the project.  Terra Classic is the original network created by Terraform Labs. It has continued as an independent blockchain rather than Terra 2.0, which is a forked version that was created in the wake of Terra's collapse. Its LUNC tokens are valued at $580 million as of Monday.  The engineers, co-led by “Bilbo Baggins” and “Solid Snake,” proposed a $116,000 three-month spend from the Terra Classic community in a governance proposal over the weekend, claiming they would work part-time on the project if approved.  “LUNC has limitless upside potential, and we want to help realize it by leveraging our skills to bring value to the blockchain and all its investors in order to accomplish a true revival of the ecosystem,” Samurai Six said.“We're here to provide value to the ecosystem on its road to revival, and we see ourselves as contributors to the Terra Classic blockchain, both as developers and long-time community members/investors,” the team added.  Some tasks listed by Samurai Six in the proposal are upgrades to the network to reduce the syncing time between nodes, a terraUSD (USTC) testnet for testing financial services, an application for generating yield to token holders, and a plan to reward developers for the user activity that their applications generate.  These efforts aim to eventually drive value to the Terra Classic ecosystem, and, hopefully, an increase in LUNC value over time.  Samurai Six is among the few community members set on Terra Classic’s revival to save the once-storied ecosystem.  In discussions that started in mid-April, community member “RedlineDrifter” described a new model for Terra Classic’s UST stablecoin that relied on token buybacks, unidirectional swaps, staking and an “algorithmic peg divergence fee” to address the issues with the original design.  UST was the token at the center of Terra’s collapse that led to a 99.9% drop in LUNA token prices, a $28 billion hemorrhage in Terra-based DeFi applications and an eventual spiral to crypto funds going bust.",POSITIVE,LUNC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LUNC | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/26/terra-classic-revival-plans-continue-as-6-engineers-aim-to-revive-lunc-ecosystem,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b285a082d12a690438373a948ddfbb486f34afd-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420104,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUXoMf,1687777023,Crypto Traders Eye $6.8B Bitcoin and Ether Options Expiry,"The bullish buzz returned to the crypto market last week as bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, jumped more than 15% in its best performance since March. Now a significant event looms on the horizon.  On Friday at 08:00 UTC some 150,633 bitcoin options contracts worth $4.57 billion and 1.23 million ether contracts valued at $2.3 billion will expire on Panama-based Deribit exchange, which controls over 85% of the global options activity. The bitcoin contracts due for settlement account for 43% of the total open interest, according to Amberdata.  In bitcoin's case, investors have recently bought call options with strike prices at and above $30,000. As a result, that level has the highest open interest – or the number of active contracts – and market makers/dealers, who create order book liquidity by taking the other side of the investors' trades, hold a significant amount of ""negative (short) gamma"" exposure.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call gives the right to buy, a bullish position, and the put confers the right to sell, a bearish position. Being short (negative) gamma means holding a short or sell position in the call or put options.  The large build up of open interest at $30,000, means the spot price could gravitate to around that level in the lead up to the expiry. Bitcoin is currently trading just above $30,000, according to CoinDesk data.  Meanwhile, dealers' negative gamma positioning means a slight move away from $30,000 could translate into an explosive rally or price slide. That's because, dealers, when holding net-negative gamma exposure, ""buy high and sell low"" when the underlying picks up a bullish or bearish momentum in order to maintain a neutral market exposure.  In other words, if bitcoin builds momentum above $30,000 as expiry approaches, dealers will buy the cryptocurrency in the spot and futures markets. That, in turn, could lead to an exaggerated price rally, often called a gamma squeeze, or sling-shot effect. On the flip side, dealers will be forced to sell on a potential decline below $30,000.  ""This [bullish] flow is heavily impacting dealers' positioning, and ahead of Friday's expiration, we expect a historic record (since we started tracking) of negative gamma,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in the latest edition of the weekly newsletter. ""With only a little spot move, we could witness fireworks.""  Options gamma is the rate of change in delta, which is the degree of options' sensitivity to a change in the underlying asset's price. Gamma shows how directional risk exposure changes with the fluctuations in the underlying asset and rises as expiry nears.  Market makers provide liquidity to an order book and profit from the bid-ask spread by constantly hedging their gamma exposure to keep the book direction, or delta, neutral.  According to crypto derivatives trader Christopher Newhouse, the impact of potential dealer hedging could be stronger than usual this time.  ""With several of the topside call strikes set to expire this week in large size and gamma concentrated around the $30,000 [level] and bitcoin trading near $30,000, dealer hedging flows as we approach expiry may have more of an exaggerated impact on spot prices than some of the smaller weekly expiries – especially as price coils near previous highs and potential short liquidation levels,"" Newhouse told CoinDesk.  ""By strike, the $30,000, $35,000 and $40,000 strikes are some of the most popular call strike targets with many of these bets being taken only a few days prior as bullish exuberance starts to overwhelm some of the short-term market flows,"" he said.  In ether's case, market makers have accumulated long gamma positions in the ether (ETH) market, and hence the risk of a gamma squeeze in Ethereum's native token is relatively low.  ""Since market makers hold a large amount of positive gamma, their hedging will keep ETH relatively stable during settlement,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/26/crypto-traders-eye-68b-bitcoin-and-ether-options-expiry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fee0bacd9fabee98898005dfbe4e5f8b64528004-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new ETF is being pushed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, named Coinbase, the nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, as its custodian. If approved, BlackRock will bring legitimacy and heavy money inflows to Bitcoin trading. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) breached and ended the week above the psychological level of $30,000 per coin on recent developments signaling traditional finance giants' further investment in the largest decentralized token by market cap. Heavyweights Fidelity National Financial ( FNF ) and the Charles Schwab Corporation ( SCHW ), as well as Citadel Securities, one of the largest designated market makers, launched the EDX exchange platform on June 20. BlackRock ( BLK ) already operates a spot Bitcoin private trust, but like EDX, it is for institutional clients only. BlackRock's proposed spot ETF for retail investors will likely be the first to succeed in the US. Eric Balchunas , Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, tweeted BlackRock's 575-1 record of getting ETFs approved by the SEC. Continued adoption and endorsement by major organizations can only drive up demand and BTC prices. BlackRock's proposed spot ETF filed on June 15 is nothing like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Investors in the ETF purchase shares which represent ownership in a fund that holds Bitcoin and do not directly own the underlying Bitcoin. Investors in GBTC purchase shares of the trust which represent direct ownership interest in the BTC held by the trust, currently at 0.00090534 BTC per share . GBTC shares trade at a steep discount to their net asset value ((NAV)). That narrowed as of June 23, when a share of GBTC's market value climbed to $19.19 from $17.72 the day before, even though the amount of Bitcoin held per share inched to $27.94. Normally, shares trade at a discount to their NAV during periods of low demand or negative market sentiment. However, the ""GBTC discount"" deteriorated because the fund doesn't allow redemptions; investors can only sell their shares on secondary markets. Institutions or accredited individuals who have the ability to create and redeem GBTC shares can exploit this discount by buying GBTC shares at a lower price and exchanging them for Bitcoin at the NAV. A normal ETF uses creation and redemption mechanism to prevent its shares from trading at such a huge discount or premium, thus keeping prices in line with the underlying NAV. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected Grayscale's application to convert GBTC into a spot market Bitcoin ETF in June 29 of last year, because, in their analysis on page 83, ""the Commission must approve a proposed rule change [to list and trade shares of GBTC] if it finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act-including the requirement... that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices-and it must disapprove the filing if it does not make such a finding."" The same day, Grayscale sued the SEC for its arbitrary decisions in continuing to approve Bitcoin futures-based ETFs, while denying all spot Bitcoin ETFs to date. BlackRock's is not like a Bitcoin futures ETF such as ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ). BITO holds futures contracts, or agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date, so an investor's exposure is to anticipated Bitcoin price movements. Unlike spot ETFs, futures ETFs only trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ). Bitcoin futures ETFs have been around since 2017. The SEC maintains that even off-exchange manipulation aimed at affecting prices of CME Bitcoin futures would be caught by surveillance. However, the Grayscale representative in the lawsuit claimed that the CME can't prevent fraud and manipulation and thus satisfy the statutory standard, but the SEC found the standard satisfied anyway. Judge Rao seemed to agree that the SEC emphasized ""only the regulatory detection of fraud ."" Furthermore, the SEC rep contradicted herself with these closing statements: ""the key empirical question is whether fraud and manipulation in the spot market impacts CME futures in the same way. And there's just, we don't have conclusive data."" ""the second prong is about trading in the ETP itself and if it predom - if it predominates, then there is a concern that the fraud and manipulation could be in that, and then you wouldn't see it in the market that you're surveilling because it's not the underlying market, it's trading in the ETP itself."" Regardless of which ends on the market first, a spot Bitcoin ETF will offer many benefits, including easy accessibility, through a traditional brokerage account, for individuals who want exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. BlackRock ETFs generally offer high liquidity, allowing investors to enter or exit positions quickly and at fair market prices. Investors get a sense of security, knowing that the ETF is regulated like familiar stocks. To conclude, Bitcoin prices will likely continue to rise as the prospects of the ETFs are good. If approved, more investors will have access to crypto investments with much lower risks, notwithstanding the coin's inherent volatility and macro challenges with the continued high inflation and possibility of recession. The International Monetary Fund economists had concluded the practice of completely banning crypto assets "" may not be effective in the long run,"" could make Bitcoin investing available again to those countries. If anything, BlackRock's application is a strong show of support for its partner Coinbase ( COIN ), which could reverse some of the $517 million in outflows from a separate SEC lawsuit alleging the exchanged offered unregistered securities such as Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to users with its staking service. Thus, several major altcoins fell out of favor, and Bitcoin dominance exceeded 50% for the first time in 2 years on June 19 and is climbing, suggesting it could be investors' crypto of choice.

This particular hurdle had proven to be a significant challenge for AVAX bulls in the preceding weeks, hampering their upward momentum. The surge in AVAX’s performance can be attributed to multiple factors, one of which is the increasing demand for the wrapped version of Bitcoin (BTC) on the Avalanche network. As Bitcoin prices rose, more users sought to utilize the wrapped BTC on Avalanche, contributing to the network’s growing user base. Will AVAX’s upward momentum continue? Avalanche Price Shows Signs Of Exhaustion The price of AVAX, currently standing at $13.37 according to CoinGecko, has demonstrated a 2.7% rally within the past 24 hours, accompanied by an impressive seven-day surge of 18.0%. However, a closer examination reveals that AVAX’s recent upward momentum may be losing steam. Source: Coingecko Between June 10 and 25, AVAX gained a substantial 40% and established a price range spanning from $9.65 to $14.25. Despite approaching the upper boundary of this range, indications of exhaustion are becoming increasingly evident. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Price Rockets 22% – Is There More Fuel In The Tank?

AVAX 7-day price climb. Source: CoinMarketCap This disparity, known as “bearish divergence,” suggests that the momentum behind AVAX’s recent ascent may be waning. In technical analysis, this formation typically serves as a sell signal and often precedes a correction in the underlying asset. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s Influence May Shape AVAX Future Meanwhile, the potential resumption of bullishness in Bitcoin’s price at the beginning of a new week could present a challenging scenario for bears. The interplay between Bitcoin’s movement and AVAX’s price trajectory plays a pivotal role in determining the future direction of AVAX. As one of the most dominant cryptocurrencies in the market, Bitcoin serves as a major influencer for the overall sentiment and trends within the crypto space. Its movements often set the tone for the entire market, and AVAX, being an altcoin, is not immune to this influence. Avalanche market cap currently at $4.6 billion.

This correlation stems from various factors, such as Bitcoin’s status as a benchmark cryptocurrency, its high trading volume, and its position as a store of value for many investors. As investors and enthusiasts closely monitor these developments, the question of whether AVAX can overcome the sell signals and embark on a renewed ascent lingers in the air.

That bitcoin has broken out and that a strong uptrend is forming is not in much doubt. The higher high has been made and bitcoin is currently buoyed up by the strong horizontal support at $30,300. If what is happening with the traditional monetary system is taken into account bitcoin would appear to be a complete no-brainer as a means of moving wealth out of the system and into bitcoin where it cannot be manipulated, more of it cannot be printed, and where it cannot be confiscated. More currency will be printed The mainstream narrative of whether the Federal Reserve will or will not pivot into quantitative easing and start printing more currency is not really here nor there, at least in the long term. That it will print more currency is an absolute certainty given the economics of a debt-based system. How will bitcoin bear up? However, many economic commentators are of the opinion that bitcoin will suffer greatly as liquidity becomes more scarce and a descent into what could be a dreadful recession provokes a massive sell-off in risk assets. Bitcoin has never had to deal with such an environment in all of its lifetime so far, so it is going to be extremely interesting to see how it will bear up among other financial assets. It must be said that it was built for exactly this. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin the Genesis block bore the text: Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks This was a reference to the Times newspaper of January 3 2009, when the Great Recession was in full swing and the world was on the brink of economic catastrophe. Satoshi Nakamoto realised that people would need a lifeline to get them out of constant debasement of the currency and an ever-increasing chance of complete economic meltdown. Bitcoin is due to start its bull market and with its halving coming in April next year it does look like an incredibly good bet. On the other hand, if one holds fiat currency its inherent debasement is an absolute certainty. Education oneself on these matters is the only way to be able to survive what is coming.

Clarifies","Japan's National Tax Agency has clarified that crypto issuers in the country will not have to pay capital gains taxes on unrealized gains, in a June 20 notice.  The country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) tax committee approved a proposal to exempt crypto startups that issue their own tokens from paying corporate taxes on unrealized gains last December.  Japan has been reviewing its tax treatment of crypto since at least last year to encourage startups to remain in the country after heavy tax burdens seemingly led to a company exodus.  The partial revision noted in the June 20 document is a change from an earlier requirement that subjected token issuers to a capital gains tax of around 35% on their own tokens – as well as on unrealized gains.  The tax exemption will also apply to unrealized gains from holding applicable cryptocurrency continuously from the date of issuance or from taking certain technical measures to prevent its transfer to other persons, the document said.  Japan's industry associations have also sought other tax reforms, including for crypto gains to be taxed at the same rate as stocks and for individuals to be taxed only when crypto gains are converted to fiat currency.

14213150,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/has-true-blockchain-interoperability-been-achieved,1687771800,Has True Blockchain Interoperability Been Achieved?,"Blockchain users could be forgiven for losing count of the number of different networks they interact with. As established blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum experience limitations over the number of use cases they support and their scalability, crypto projects are looking to newer chains to support their activities. By building on alternative blockchains, projects can tap into the new capabilities they offer and benefit from faster transactions and lower processing costs. As a result, the number of blockchain networks competing for market share in industries like decentralized finance, gaming, metaverse, and other areas is growing. There is no single blockchain that has emerged as the platform for every type of use case, as each network comes with trade-offs. As a result, developers simply select the most appropriate blockchain for whatever it is they’re trying to achieve. The Need For Interoperability Given this reality, it has become clear that a solution for blockchain interoperability is imperative for all users. In a world where businesses of every shape and size are so reliant on collaboration, it’s necessary to find a way for the different blockchains they use to safely interact with one another. By building interoperability, networks provide a more user-friendly experience, enabling frictionless sharing of data and smoother execution of transactions governed by smart contracts. With traditional software systems, the makers of those programs and applications strive for interoperability as they know it’s beneficial for their users. For instance, imagine if it were not possible to send an email from a Gmail account to a Yahoo account. It would throw a massive spanner in the works of mass communication. As such, software has become highly integrated in many ways. Not only can we email any address from any provider, but we can also import our contacts into messenger software like Skype. In the enterprise world, software interoperability is even more important, allowing business workers to import data from Salesforce into Excel spreadsheets where it can be analyzed, for example. Blockchain networks recognize that use cases such as DeFi, healthcare, gaming, and digital identity cannot exist in siloes, and so interoperability has become a key goal of most projects. Luckily for blockchain users, a number of projects have made rapid progress in this area, enabling both data and digital assets to traverse across blockchain networks with remarkable ease. How Blockchain Interoperability Is Achieved One of the most successful examples of blockchain interoperability is the Cosmos ecosystem, which bills itself as the “Internet of blockchains”. Within Cosmos, developers can access a wealth of applications and services built for distributed networks. Cosmos enables blockchain interoperability through its Inter Blockchain Protocol, known as IBC. It supports a suite of cross-chain applications and makes it possible for users to exchange data and digital assets freely across multiple supported blockchains, including Binance Chain and Crypto.org. IBC is best understood as an open-source protocol that works by relaying messages between independent blockchain networks, and linking them together. Because not every chain is IBC compatible, Cosmos has gotten around this with the introduction of a “peg zone” that’s able to bridge zones within Cosmos to external blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Cosmos also offers a software development kit that can be used by coders to create alternative versions of their dApps for different, compatible blockchains. Another blockchain that’s following the ecosystem approach is Polkadot, which has developed a network of interoperable parachains that are linked to its central Relay Chain. Each of the parachains on Polkadot’s network hosts its own, specific project or dApp, with some of the most interesting being Moonbeam, Centrifuge, Manta Network, and Parallel Finance. Each parachain is designed in a way that ensures optimal performance for the specific dApp it supports. To ensure scalability, Polkadot provides a common set of validators for every parachain within its ecosystem. By spreading transactions across its ecosystem of parachains, they can be processed faster. At the same time, because the parachains all share the same architecture, they all support cross-chain transactions. Polkadot is strongly supportive of developers too. It’s possible to create a customized blockchain using Substrate that’s natively compatible with all other chains on the Polkadot network. Horizen bills itself as the most secure, interoperable blockchain ecosystem supported by the most decentralized, multi-tier node infrastructure in the crypto industry. It enables interoperability between blockchains through a protocol called Zendoo, which uses a novel sidechain construction that’s tailored to be compatible with Horizen’s main chain while adapting to other blockchains. Secure, decentralized cross-chain communications are conducted via a sidechain that’s enhanced with privacy-preserving zk-SNARK technology. With Zendoo, a Bitcoin-based protocol can operate with any other domain-specific blockchain or blockchain-like ecosystem, with the protocol only updated once to introduce the required mechanism for deploying sidechains that enable cross-chain transfers. One key advantage of Horizen’s method is that Zendoo enables backward transfers to be verified by the main chain without the use of external certifiers or validators. In other words, the main chain does not monitor the sidechains and knows nothing about their internal structure, boosting security. Zendoo does this through the generation of recursive proofs of each sidechain state transition. Any discussion of blockchain interoperability should also mention the efforts of Chainlink, which is a Web3 platform that provides oracle services to smart contracts hosted on any blockchain network. Its primary focus is not so much on blockchain-to-blockchain interactions, but rather on enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world networks. It gives new industries access to any blockchain, enabling dApps to integrate with Web2 software and systems. Oracles play a key role in facilitating communication between blockchains and things that happen in the real world. For example, they allow blockchains to monitor traditional financial markets, and react to events such as sports results, the weather, and more. By enabling this kind of interoperability, Chainlink is emerging as a crucial link between blockchains and third-party data. Blockchain Interoperability Is Crucial The success of any dApp has long been tied to its ability to interact with the growing number of blockchain networks and legacy-based systems in the world. Blockchain interoperability is crucial because it lowers the barrier of entry, enabling more users to engage with protocols and conduct transactions freely. As blockchain interoperability has improved thanks to the efforts mentioned above, users now have multiple ways to move their data and assets across networks, making the dApps that use them much more flexible. Instead of being restricted to a single blockchain, smart contracts can now interact with almost any network and even tap into real-world data. Interoperability allows dApps to support more flexible use cases, helping to spur more widespread adoption of crypto in general. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Grayscale earns around $380 million in annualized fees “despite the product being inefficient, illiquid, and has traded at a significant discount over the last 28 months,” the broker said.  While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved multiple bitcoin futures ETFs, it has yet to approve a spot bitcoin ETF despite receiving numerous applications.  “If BlackRock and others manage to break through the spot ETF market, it would offer the most convenient, compliant and acceptable product for both retail and institutional players to gain bitcoin exposure,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  The iShares unit of fund management giant Blackrock filed paperwork earlier this month with the SEC for the formation of a spot bitcoin ETF. This prompted other asset managers including Invesco and Wisdom Tree to apply or reapply for a bitcoin ETF product.  Bernstein notes that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is only 3% of the total bitcoin market cap, which means there is the “headroom for a compliant ETF to grow its share as a bitcoin on-ramp solving the pain of custody.”  With the current GBTC annual fee at 2%, there is room to bring the pricing in line with more traditional asset ETF’s, the report added. Those are significantly cheaper, and tend to be less than 0.5%.  Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG).

14211469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539611,1687767310,"Ethereum Poised To Break $2,000 As $12 Million Short Seller Nears Liquidation","The Ethereum price has followed Bitcoin’s lead and has seen a 10.3% price increase over the past seven days. News of BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission took the entire market by surprise and also breathed new life into altcoins. For one trader on the decentralized perpetual exchange GMX, however, the news is not really good news, but rather a nightmare. Ethereum Short Seller Getting Rekt? The largest short seller on GMX is using 6.64x leverage to short Ether (ETH) at an entry price of $1,703.97. A total of $1.8 million of collateral is at stake for the anonymous trader. At press time, the position was down 77.4% for a total of -$1.416 million. As it stands, the trader’s short position of about $12 million in ETH will be liquidated when the Ethereum price reaches $1,945.18. According to a report from Chinese journalist Colin Wu, it could be the owner of rebelvarma.lens. As popular analyst An Ape’s Prologue speculates, the ETH short seller could even double down on his bet. As the analyst writes, the consensus assumes that the short position will be liquidated when ETH reaches $1945. However, there are limit orders that could add a total of $149,000 to the trader’s collateral within the $1935 and $1945 price range. If triggered, this could increase the liquidation price to around $1967. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullsh Signal: Supply On Exchanges Continues To Hit New All-Time Lows The analyst’s chart below shows how his liquidation price changes with ETH price swings. Until Ethereum reaches $1935, the liquidation price remains at $1945, but limit orders are triggered when ETH enters the $1935 and $1945 range, increasing the liquidation price to $1967. In addition, the analyst notes that the address holds about $224,000 worth of other assets spread across Arbitrum and the Binance Smart Chain: $90,000 in USDT, $51,000 in USDC, $64,000 in WBTC and $21,500 in AAVE. “With a history of mitigating liquidation risk by bridging tokens from other chains to Arbitrum for collateral, we’ll probably see a similar strategy if ETH prices increase. The $224k in available assets could be used to top up collateral in this scenario,” the analyst notes. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In Range As Risk of Downside Correction Escalates If the ETH short seller uses up all of its assets and puts them up as collateral, the maximum liquidation price could rise to around $2,000, representing a further 6.5% price increase from the current price. Hence, Twitter user @apes_prologue concludes: While his position appears risky, the danger of liquidation is not as imminent as popularly believed, as he has mechanisms at his disposal to protect his position. Additionally, it is also possible he could have hedged his position in other markets that we are unaware of. ETH On The Verge Of Breaking Above $2,000? Rumors are circulating in the crypto community that the liquidation of the GMX short-seller could trigger a breakout of ETH above $2,000. The 1-hour chart of Ether shows that the price is currently stuck in the price range between $1,964 and $1,930 for the moment. A breakout to the upside or downside could be decisive for the next move. A look at the 1-day chart reveals that a breakout above $1,930 does not necessarily mean a follow-through to above $2,000. The 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level is at $1,975, where major resistance is expected. Ethereum bulls can only target the psychologically important $2,000 level if they break out above this price level.

ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) – a Bitcoin futures fund offered in the U.S. – last week recorded the highest weekly inflow in over a year as bitcoin (BTC) prices breached the $30,000 level, data cited by Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows.  BITO allows investors to gain exposure to bitcoin-linked returns with a regulated product and holds over $1 billion worth of CME Bitcoin Futures, holdings data shows.  Investors poured in $65 million to BITO in the past week, the data shows, breaking a previous 2023 high of just over $40 million in April. As such, the product did not see meaningful inflows in May and most of June as demand for bitcoin lulled.  BITO has closely tracked spot bitcoin prices which has likely added to its allure among traders. “It pretty much has tracked bitcoin perfectly. It lagged spot by 1.05% (annually), but its fee is 0.95%,” Balchunas tweeted.  The BITO buying pressure likely indicates interest in bitcoin exposure among institutional investors closely on the back of a bitcoin ETF frenzy in the U.S.  Bitcoin prices rallied in the past two weeks as investment giant BlackRock (BLK) filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S.  The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization touched $31,000 over the weekend to extend monthly gains to 14%, as per CoinGecko data.

Wintermute Caught In Legal Quagmire According to the new court filing, Wintermute Trading Ltd has been added as a new defendant in the ongoing class action lawsuit against Celsius Network. Celsius creditors recently amended the lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that executives from the bankrupt crypto lender had engaged Wintermute to facilitate wash trading and inflate the trading volume on the platform. According to the filing, this was done between March 2021 and June 2022, when the firm froze withdrawals. Wash trading is a type of market manipulation where a company creates the illusion that an asset is trading at a higher volume than it actually is. “Defendant Wintermute and the Executive Defendants engaged in a scheme that artificially inflated the trading volume of the CEL tokens sold and marketed by Celsius.” The filing also stated that the alleged scheme was discovered through publicly available internal conversations between executives from Celsius. Furthermore, it was also reported that Celsius did not have any measures to prevent improper or malicious wash trading. “The supposed controls were virtually non-existent, and those that did exist did not monitor for or protect against “wash trading” or self-dealing.” Before it filed for bankruptcy, Celsius allegedly transferred $160 million of wrapped bitcoin to third-party wallets. It is alleged that Wintermute controlled several of these wallets. According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, Celsius also ended up moving around $20 million worth of wrapped Ethereum (WETH) into a Wintermute-controlled wallet. Wintermute itself was caught up in a hacking fiasco in September 2022, when the protocol suffered a breach and ended up losing around $160 million across 90 assets held in the company’s portfolio. Following the hack, the Wintermute CEO had to reassure users, lenders, and partners that the company remained solvent. Fahrenheit Acquires Celsius Assets The developments come after it was reported that Celsius assets had been acquired through an auction. According to reports published on the 25th of May, crypto consortium Fahrenheit had acquired the Celsius assets after a successful bid. The assets were previously valued at $2 billion.

Among its investors are Pantera Capital, Binance, Coinbase, and Apollo Crypto. In its page on Medium, the startup said that the latest funding round is aimed at expanding its ecosystem and build more efficient Liquid Staking Token (LST) Infrastructure, enable deployment to other chains, and subsequently attract new players and projects to its ecosystem. Understanding Maverick's Liquid Staking Token Infrastructure Maverick Protocol, a DeFi infrastructure startup, has shown considerable potential in its aim to revolutionize the decentralized finance landscape. One of the critical aspects of its infrastructure that the firm plans to enhance is its Liquid Staking Token (LST) Infrastructure. Liquid staking represents an innovative approach within the blockchain and DeFi space. Traditionally, staking involves participants locking up their cryptocurrencies to support operations such as block validation on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. In return, stakers receive rewards. However, staked tokens often remain locked and inactive, reducing their utility within the wider crypto ecosystem. This is where liquid staking comes into play. It allows users to stake their tokens and still maintain their liquidity. In essence, when users stake their tokens, they receive a representative token in return. This representative or 'liquid' token can be freely traded, providing the holder with liquidity while the original tokens remain staked. By prioritizing an efficient LST infrastructure, Maverick is aiming to optimize capital efficiency. This infrastructure could enable the deployment of its services to other chains, broadening Maverick's ecosystem and attracting new players and projects. Maverick’s Steps Towards Improving DeFi Infrastructure The second phase was the introduction of Boosted Positions just last May which it defined as a “set of incentivization tools for token projects hat provided token projects with greater control over liquidity.” Its latest phase, introduced just a day ago, unveiled its own voting-escrow (ve) model that enable voting on liquidity positions through its own MAV token. Last March, Maverick also launched its own exchange which, as of writing, has amassed $40.9 million in total value locked, according to aggregated blockchain data from CoinMarketCap. The protocol was also recently introduced alongside the Binance Launchpool program. Maverick has been steadily charting its own course in improving DeFi infrastructure and it remains optimistic for its future. “Down the road, Maverick will also announce more ecosystem partners and explore more cross-chain opportunities to enable market efficiency across the whole industry,"" the firm said.

The partnership grants the NEAR Foundation access to Alibaba Cloud's developer ecosystem across Asia and the Middle East in a bid to attract more developers to build on the NEAR protocol, said the company in conversation with CoinDesk. Developers that want to launch new NEAR validators will be able to do so with Alibaba Cloud’s ""plug-and-play"" infrastructure as a service.  The NEAR Foundation and Alibaba Cloud will offer remote procedure calls (RPC) as a service to developers and users in the NEAR ecosystem, a press release said. RPC is a type of computer server that allows users to read data on blockchains and send transactions to different networks. It will also offer multi-chain indexing to provide data-query application programming interface (API) to developers.  Users will also be able to use the NEAR Blockchain Operating System (BOS), a platform it launched earlier in the year that allows developers to build into and interact with other users, while using Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure.  The price of NEAR jumped 8% to $1.57 on Monday after the Alibaba announcement.  This comes as Alibaba recently announced the hiring of its new Chairman, Joseph Tsai, who has been an active Web3 investor and has signed multiple deals with crypto-related entities.  “The NEAR Foundation and Alibaba Cloud partnership is an important one as we continue to support Web3 developers to explore opportunities,” said Raymond Xiao, head of international Web3 solutions at Alibaba Cloud Intelligence.  “It is also significant for developers and validators in the Asian markets, as they can leverage Alibaba Cloud’s comprehensive infrastructure in Asia.”  UPDATE (June 26, 07:30 UTC): Adds NEAR's price jump in fifth paragraph.",POSITIVE,NEAR,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | TRADING | NEAR,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/26/embargo-26th-june-7am-bst-near-foundation-partners-with-alibaba-cloud-to-accelerate-web3-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9ef0f977ebb0ab20bd7b9b6815f9a3eddfcf7991-7952x5304.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
14208627,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/hedera-integrates-chatgpt-for-hbar-interactions,1687759200,Hedera Integrates ChatGPT For $HBAR Interactions,"ChatGPT, an advanced natural language AI implementation, has been coupled with Hedera, the decentralized network supporting the $HBAR cryptocurrency. This unique integration is projected to facilitate secure and streamlined interactions between the AI tool and Hedera's various services. Any #ChatGPT users and enthusiasts in the house? 🙋‍♂️Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a #ChatGPT #plugin that interacts with @hedera This will be useful for those who want to tap into the power of #AI with #blockchain 🤖🧊⛓Happy coding💻https://t.co/yhdWqSkG24 — Ed (@ed__marquez) June 23, 2023AI Fuses Into Blockchain Artificial intelligence implementations such as ChatGPT from OpenAI are semi-autonomous systems capable of learning, decision-making, and adaptation based on minimal user input. Blockchain, on the other hand, provides a secure, immutable method to record transactions or digital interactions. The convergence of these technologies introduces an innovative approach to data processing and utilization. In healthcare, for example, AI could analyze patient records securely stored on a blockchain for personalized treatments. In finance, AI-powered decision-making combined with smart contracts could automate processes ranging from simple transactions to complex investments. The blend of AI's adaptive learning and blockchain's secure, transparent nature opens doors to more intelligent and efficient solutions across numerous sectors. ChatGPT, a conversational AI that responds to text inputs in a human-like manner, is now taking a leap into the blockchain world via a new plugin that interacts with the Hedera network. Unpacking ChatGPT and Hedera Integration Hedera, a decentralized, open-source, proof-of-stake, EVM-compatible public ledger, uses a leaderless consensus algorithm. This confers the network with the highest level of security and performance theoretically possible. The network is governed by a collusion-resistant, decentralized council of notable enterprises, universities, and Web3 projects worldwide, such as Google, IBM, and Ubisoft. The network provides several services that facilitate web 3 components and applications development. These services, including the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), Hedera Token Service (HTS), and Smart Contract Service, are now accessible to ChatGPT via a newly-developed plugin. In essence, this integration allows ChatGPT to retrieve HBAR and other token balances from Hedera accounts. As a result, users can easily monitor and manage their assets on the blockchain. The interaction between AI and blockchain holds immense potential. However, we are in the early stages of this integration. Close observation is necessary to comprehend its full potential and its impact on the broader technological landscape. Implications and Potential This integration between ChatGPT and Hedera presents a unique and significant development in the world of technology. With the AI's capability to engage with blockchain securely, the interaction between these technologies could influence a range of applications in the sector, particularly relating to decentralized applications (dApps). Notably, this ChatGPT-Hedera plugin allows for streamlined asset monitoring and management. Users can retrieve HBAR and other token balances from Hedera accounts, which can simplify the process of monitoring assets on the blockchain. In the context of decentralised marketplaces, the fusion of AI and blockchain could lead to advancements in the ways transactions and interactions are conducted. Blockchain's secure, transparent, and decentralised nature, coupled with AI's advanced computational capabilities, could offer potential benefits in terms of security, transparency, and efficiency.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: If bitcoin manages to stay past $30K, we might get another leg up, says one analyst.  Insights: Japan's recent amendment to exclude unrealized gains of self-issued cryptocurrency from taxation promotes a healthy environment for crypto startups. This continued trend of regulatory adaptability has earned praise from stakeholders.

The world’s largest digital asset is still above the $30K mark, while ether is up 1.3% to $1,901.  Analysts say that this mini-bull market, which has followed multiple applications for spot bitcoin ETFs, is pushing BTC and ETH to some of its strongest weekly gains since March. CoinDesk Indices’ Bitcoin Trend Indicator (BTI) shows the asset is in a “significant uptrend” with its price gaining 15.6% during the last week and 17% over the last 14 days.  “Last week, we noted how the market looked strong for mid to long-term opportunities, and Bitcoin was likely to be in the spotlight,” BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale said in a note to CoinDesk. “This week we saw Bitcoin breaking through the $30K resistance and managing to stay above it despite volatility.”  DiPasquale sees continued growth across the market in the coming weeks, but also volatility.  “On the flip side, alts are now also starting to rally. But the market is likely to remain volatile in the coming weeks,” he said. “If Bitcoin manages to stay above $30K for long, we may see another leg up. On the downside, $27K now remains strong support.”  Data from CoinGlass shows that over the weekend, traders with short positions had a slight edge. In the past 24 hours, there were $9.5 million in liquidated long positions and $7.10 in liquidated short positions. Open interest is up to $14.6 billion from $11.7 billion at the start of last week.  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hasn’t indicated when it intends to announce a decision on the bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree.  Many are optimistic that the inclusion of a surveillance-sharing agreement would be enough to make the SEC comfortable enough to approve it, much like how the Ontario Securities Commission wanted a mature crypto custodian sector before it approved the first bitcoin ETFs to be listed in Toronto in 2021.  Until then, the question is: how high will bitcoin go?

This is a huge relief for crypto startups that issue their own tokens.  Before the change, the Japanese tax law required corporations to pay taxes on unrealized gains from their cryptocurrency holdings at the end of each fiscal year, irrespective of whether those gains had been realized or not.  In short, if a company was holding a token and its value increased within the fiscal year, the company had to pay taxes on the increased value (the unrealized gain), even if it hadn't sold the cryptocurrency (i.e., hadn't ""realized"" the gain). This law applied to all types of cryptocurrencies, whether self-issued by the company or not.  Taxing unrealized gains isn’t a policy that’s conducive to building a dynamic, successful environment for entrepreneurship. Norway tried it, and it led to an exodus. But having taxes on the unrealized gains of a token is particularly detrimental to the crypto industry as developers and other team members are often heavily compensated in these tokens to compensatefor the inherent risk of the industry – with its tremendous ups and downs.  For Japan, this is another smart public policy move that has identified a problem and built a specific, crypto-native solution.  “What we see in Japan is a very clear taxonomy for digital assets,” Rahul Advani, Ripple’s policy lead for Asia, said in a recent interview withCoinDesk. ""Regulators are now looking beyond just money laundering and terrorist financing. They're looking at capital, they're looking at bank exposures, and a very important part of that is market integrity but also consumer protection.""  Japan has been an early adopter of cryptocurrency rules and established regulations and standards for crypto exchanges, Advani explained, praisingthe nation’s laws regarding the segregation of customer funds on exchanges.  For example, despite the global bankruptcy of FTX, its Japanese subsidiary, FTX Japan, appears poised to pay its customers in full, largely due to Japan's careful regulation of crypto exchanges. It was the safest place to be a customer of Sam Bankman-Fried’s.  “Japan has in its bankruptcy laws, [a priority for] exchange customers above other creditors,” he said. “So that's one reason why exchange customers were able to be made whole before other creditors.""  Now, in contrast, none of this is happening in the U.S.  Sure, given existing rules about capital gains in the U.S. it's unlikely that tokens issued by crypto companies would be taxed. But there’s no specific rules to say that this won’t happen. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won’t even give guidance on how it determines if something – like the issued tokens at the center of this – is or isn’t a security.  If the SEC won’t even advise voluntarily, good luck getting any other sort of policy development in the U.S.  Important events.
