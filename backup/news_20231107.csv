One crypto analyst explains the current trend as the altcoin having entered what is referred to as a “markup phase.” XRP Price Leaves Accumulation To Markup Phase Crypto analyst and trade The Signalyst took to TradingView to share an interesting phase that the XRP price had entered. Using a chart, the crypto analyst outlined where the altcoin’s price had been in the past, where it is now, and where it is headed using distinct terms. Related Reading: Top 3 Altcoins For November 2023 That Could 100x Your Crypto Portfolio The first phase outlined in the chart is the markdown phase which took place after the price surge following Ripple’s first victory over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July. This markdown phase saw the price go from as high as $0.9 to as low as $0.45 when all was said and done. What came after the markdown phase was complete was the accumulation phase. Here, the XRP price traded in a pretty tight range, offering an opportunity for investors to buy as many coins as possible. During this phase, the price never crossed above $0.55. Source: TradingView.com Next came the markup phase which is where the XRP price is currently residing. This markup phase is when the price starts to recover. “After breaking above the 0.55 level mentioned in my previous idea, XRP exited the accumulation phase and entered the markup phase,” the analyst said. This markup phase is important in the fact that it possesses the strength for the XRP price to continue to grow. However, like with any rally, it faces a good measure of resistance from bears who continue to try to pull the price down. Related Reading: ETH Sent To Exchanges Climbs Above 500,000, Is Ethereum At $2,000 Still Possible? XRP recovers above $0.68 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com The most important level for bulls to break in this markup phase, according to the analyst, is $0.7345, from which the price has already been rejected once on Monday. The Signalyst believes that if this level is broken, then bulls can maintain control of the price. The chart suggests a rise as high as $0.8 following a break of this resistance; an event that would cement XRP’s bull rally. “Meanwhile, XRP could still face rejection at the resistance, which can be confirmed on lower timeframes,” the analyst warned. “In this scenario, a correction towards the 0.55 support level would be anticipated.” Despite the drawdown, the XRP price is still showing bullishness and a high level of interest from investors. Its daily trading volume is up 32% in the last day, breaking above $3.3 billion. Its price is currently sitting at $0.69, up 1.63% and 21% on the daily and weekly charts, respectively.

42392109,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0omf,1699395410,Crypto's Bromance With U.S. CFTC May Be One-Sided,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees more than $400 trillion in notional value in the swaps market, making crypto's $1.3 trillion market cap seem paltry, yet the agency devoted 47 enforcement actions against the industry in 2023.  In a year from 2022 to 2023, the CFTC cranked up its crypto case load from 20% to 49%.  Half of the 2023 sanctions from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) targeted digital assets companies and individuals, according to the agency's annual enforcement snapshot released on Tuesday.  The opening section of the report boasted that ""the CFTC cemented its reputation as a premier enforcement agency in the digital asset space."" The U.S. derivatives regulator, which has authority over fraud and manipulation in the crypto markets, filed 47 actions in fiscal year 2023 against the crypto industry that represents a tiny fraction of the trading the regulator oversees.  The CFTC listed ongoing cases such as its pursuit of FTX and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was convicted in his related criminal case but hasn't yet received a sentence; Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao; and the action against Celsius and ex-CEO Alex Mashinsky (who also faces criminal charges).  The agency also ""obtained a first-of-its-kind litigation victory against a decentralized autonomous organization"" when a court found that Ooki DAO could legitimately be sued as an unincorporated association and be held responsible for breaking the law.  CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam praised his enforcement division's ""groundbreaking work in the digital asset space, which resulted in a record number of cases, as well as staff’s dedication to holding registrants and market participants accountable for their conduct in CFTC regulated markets.""  In recent years, Behnam's agency has routinely been held up in crypto circles as the preferred U.S. regulator. Industry insiders have suggested its handling of digital assets is much more reasonable than its sister agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC.) But while the CFTC's reach and staff may be more limited than the SEC's, its enforcement preferences reveal that crypto is in its crosshairs.  Last year, about 20% of the CFTC's cases involved crypto, and this year it's 49%.  Crypto lobbyists and the industry's allies in Congress – typically among Republican lawmakers – have advocated that the CFTC be given more power, especially a direct regulatory authority over the crypto spot markets where actual crypto assets change hands. That could put the agency in a more dominant crypto role than the much larger SEC.  Read More: U.S. CFTC as Crypto’s Regulatory Savior?

19911753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559599,1699394459,"SOL Price Reaches $41, But What’s Happening In Solana Ecosystem?","Solana (SOL) has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency market, surpassing its peers with an impressive 79% upward trend over the past 30 days. As its price continues to soar, inquiries have arisen regarding the reaction of the Solana ecosystem to this surge. About this subject, the Jarvis Labs team has offered intriguing insights into the ongoing SOL bull run and the condition of its ecosystem, addressing the factors influencing its growth. Is The Solana Ecosystem Lagging Behind? Despite SOL’s price surge, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Solana has only doubled during this period, failing to match the fourfold increase in SOL’s token price. This disparity raises concerns about the growth and development of Solana’s ecosystem in 2023. A closer examination of the ecosystem reveals a significant lag compared to the rapid appreciation of SOL’s price. The Jarvis Labs team highlights that a new wave of projects injects liquidity into Solana’s ecosystem, offering hope for its growth. Notably, these projects have been launched within the past year, leading to a diverse ecosystem rather than a concentration of similar offerings. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase? Among the top gainers in TVL, seven projects emerged recently, contributing to Solana’s expanding landscape. Several projects have caught attention within Solana’s ecosystem, showcasing their potential to drive growth. Jito, a liquid staking provider, offers maximum extractable value (MEV) rewards alongside staking yields. Marginfi, another noteworthy project, offers liquid staking tokens (LST) based on Jito’s platform, as well as a lending service emphasizing risk management. Additionally, decentralized exchanges like Phoenix and Jupiter have excelled in their respective niches. Surprisingly, many successful projects within Solana’s ecosystem have yet to launch their tokens. This absence of tokens, according to Jarvis Labs, has contributed to “the lag in Solana’s TVL” despite the soaring token price. Sustainable Token Design The hesitance to introduce tokens stems from past experiences, where projects tied to now bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its trading arm Alameda Research suffered significant losses, leaving a cautious sentiment among Solana developers, according to Jarvis Labs’s analysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Be Headed Towards 20%+ Decline Based On This Pattern The Jarvis Labs team believes that while tokens have the potential to be valuable assets, the cautionary tale of FTX-related projects highlights the importance of sustainable token design. Fair distribution, reasonable supply, and clear use cases are essential to creating tokens that add real value to the ecosystem. Despite the challenges Solana’s ecosystem faces, the emergence of new projects and the forthcoming launch of tokens by some protocols offer hope for its future growth. Ultimately, Jarvis Labs suggests that by embracing sustainable token designs and maintaining a focus on ecosystem development, Solana can unlock the full potential of its “thriving network.” The Jarvis Labs’ analysis concluded: So, to all the Solana protocols out there: let’s make tokens great again. Let’s create tokens that are more than just a quick cash grab, tokens that contribute to the growth and sustainability of the ecosystem. SOL’s price is approaching the $42 level, experiencing a notable surge of 3.7% within 24 hours.

Tuesday's proposal would, if adopted, let the CFPB look after parties involved in ""general-use digital consumer payment applications,"" the document said, including fund transfer or wallet providers if those funds are used by individuals for certain non-commercial purposes. Some digital asset transactions would be included in how the regulator defines ""funds,"" the document said.  ""The CFPB’s ability to monitor for emerging risks is critical as new product offerings blur the traditional lines of banking and commerce,"" the proposal said.  The document went on to list different components for how it defines consumer payment applications, including where the consumer is located (in the U.S.), that there is indeed a payment happening, that it's to someone who is not the first consumer and that the transactions ""must be primarily for personal, family or household purposes.""  The bulk of the rule seems focused on large technology companies that provide financial services. While the proposal doesn't explicitly name these companies, footnotes reference Venmo (owned by PayPal) and Cash App (owned by Block) as examples of person-to-person payment apps that a majority of Americans have used.

42392107,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0ocP,1699393634,Navigating The Post-FTX Era: How Crypto Trading Platforms Must Adapt,"The landscape of crypto trading and its associated platforms is currently experiencing substantial regulatory, adoption and perception changes. The industry has been in what some are referring to as the ""post-FTX era"" for about a year, during which we have seen escalating pressures to adapt.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  Today, the crypto trading landscape is witnessing heightened institutional involvement, intensified regulatory examination and rapid advancements in technology. The path ahead for crypto trading platforms involves numerous challenges but also opportunities for those platforms that can — and are willing to — adapt and innovate.  In the wake of FTX, regulatory concerns have intensified, spotlighting the need for stricter oversight of exchanges, enhanced consumer protection and a global standard to curb regulatory arbitrage. The collapse has sparked industry debates on the risks of centralized platforms, emphasizing the need for better risk management and a potential shift towards decentralized exchanges all while impacting market stability and investor confidence and necessitating steps to rebuild trust.  Because of this, the ever-evolving crypto industry must stay competitive while adopting cutting-edge technology, improving security and streamlining user experience.  As countries move toward formalizing frameworks for cryptotrading, taxation and utilization, compliance is not only emerging as a major operational obstacle but also as a key factor that could set platforms apart from one another. One of the pressing issues that crypto trading platforms are facing is the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape.  As traders require almost immediate transaction execution and a broad selection of digital assets, factors like scalability, speed and reliability become crucial. Institutional investors in particular are quietly exploring digital assets and this is only expected to increase. This means trading platforms will need to offer the kind of security, liquidity and financial instruments that these participants require.  Further, governments and financial regulators are inching closer to providing clearer guidelines and regulations for crypto, meaning that institutional investors are more likely to feel secure entering the market formally and robustly.  The potential approval of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), as mentioned by Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, would be a significant step in this direction. But once one goes live, trading platforms will likely need to adopt more advanced features, including layer 2 solutions for scaling, improved user interfaces and possibly even decentralized trading options that can provide greater security and privacy.  As the crypto market matures, we can expect increasingly sophisticated financial products. And as the competition among platforms intensifies, those that offer the best user experience, lowest fees and most reliable services will gain market share.  Easing traders in  One particular improvement is crafting easier and more intuitive interfaces that cater to all levels of traders: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. One feature that exchanges increasingly provide are educational resources, which can serve as an invaluable tool for novices by helping to demystify the complex terminology and array of trading tools that often intimidate those new to the crypto space.  Educational guides or tutorials should also emphasize risk management strategies to better help empowering traders make informed investment decisions. Trading in the crypto market operates around the clock in a stark contrast to traditional Wall Street hours. This constant activity, coupled with a high entry barrier due to industry jargon and the high level of risk most digital assets presents, makes education indispensable for onboarding and retaining newcomers.  Interoperability and automation  Additionally, the future might see more interoperability between different blockchains, making it easier for users to move assets and trade across various networks. This could be a critical feature that trading platforms may need to implement.  See also: Post-FTX, Bitcoin Is Ready for its Next Chapter | Trading Week  Advanced analytics, including AI-driven trading bots, and other automated tools should become standard features to make trading easier (and potentially more profitable). This could ultimately lead to better informed user base, as well as help prevent embarrassing mistakes we're all made moving crypto. These safety features will add another layer of competitive advantage among trading platforms, in the same way that basic security features have helped modern wallets replace the old guard.  FTX, as damaging as the collapse has been, has also been a jolt to the industry. If anything, the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried has proved a reminder of why crypto exists and for this industries potential for growth and success.  It's a cliche that the crypto winter is a time for building, but its a truism for a reason. Many important lessons and precedents have been set out for us remaining. As crypto trading platforms attempt to rebuild and attract users in the post-FTX era, they must embrace this opportunity to grow.  By doing so, crypto trading platforms are setting the stage for the financial future and providing a more inclusive, technologically advanced and beneficial environment for traders.

42392103,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0oHt,1699392213,How Sam Bankman-Fried Mastered the Art of Crypto Marketing,"Sam Bankman-Fried's story is a rollercoaster journey of a crypto marketing savvy. He was entrepreneur who founded the FTX crypto exchange and gained widespread admiration before falling from grace.  Tim Haldorsson is the CEO of crypto growth agency Lunar Strategy.  How did someone who had won the hearts of the masses and the mindshare of major institutions end up on a bullet train to prison for committing fraud? His fall from the dizzying heights as CEO of a $32 billion crypto exchange to the sobering depths of multiple criminal convictions is one for the ages.  The rise of Sam Bankman-Fried  Bankman-Fried's career trajectory was nothing short of parabolic. A few years into founding what would become one of the largest crypto exchanges, he pulled off an impressive $1.8 billion fundraising feat from top investors.  Two years after founding FTX (with Gary Wang), it had become one of a few crypto ""unicorns,"" valued at $18 billion. By the time of FTX's now infamous Super Bowl ad, the exchange boasted over one million users and its valuation had nearly doubled to $32 billion.  At its peak, FTX saw $21 billion in average daily trading volumes, ranking among the world’s top three crypto exchanges. Bankman-Fried continued to expand operations aggressively and seek out the spotlight; he tapped a bevy of new investors when raising the $420 million ""meme round"" in Series-C funding. There was no doubt about it: within a few short years, his company had become a titan of the crypto industry.  You’re probably wondering by now: “How did he manage to achieve such success so quickly?” The short answer lies in his marketing strategies. Sam Bankman-Fried didn't just follow the industry playbook; he rewrote it.  Billion-dollar marketing actics  FTX's path to crypto superstardom was marked by a series of calculated moves orchestrated via a multi-faceted marketing approach devised by none other than Bankman-Fried himself.  By branding himself as the “most generous billionaire” in the world, Bankman-Fried weaponized altruism as a subversive mass-marketing tool.  He leveraged influencer marketing, signing high-profile deals with celebrities such as Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen and Stephen Curry as brand ambassadors — going as far as offering some of them equity stakes in the company. He utilized strategic partnerships with beloved global brands, including the Mercedes Formula One team, the Washington Wizards NBA team and buying the naming rights to the Miami Heat stadium, to mention a few.  By branding himself as the “most generous billionaire” in the world, Bankman-Fried weaponized altruism as a subversive mass-marketing tool. He created an enigmatic, almost mythical, self image designed to appeal to the average Joe or Jane. He claimed to sleep on a beanbag, practiced veganism and drove a Toyota Corolla despite his well-documented fortune.  The extent and efficacy of his publicity campaign are probably best defined by the popular acronym by which he was affectionately referred to – SBF. Just like you would give a nickname to a close friend, SBF had created the illusion of a mild-mannered, affable, yet approachable personality that endeared him to millions across the globe.  His star power contributed immensely to the success of the FTX corporate brand. As both were inextricably linked, the fame attached to SBF’s name amplified that of FTX, and vice versa.  In addition, Bankman-Fried used the FTX Foundation and the FTX Future Fund to dish out investments in everything from crypto ecosystem funding to academic grants and political donations, which earned him favor in the eyes of the public and his institutional stakeholders.  In reality, it was all just another layer of fraudulent activity that crippled the development of several promising projects. Bankman-Fried is quoted as saying that the entirety of FTX’s marketing was a ""bunch of bullshit"" devised to create a rosy image of the company in the public eye. And it worked.  Things fall apart  The zenith of Bankman-Fried's success, however, was followed by an abrupt fall. Things took a dark turn as controversies began to surface. Ethical concerns about fund management were raised, and allegations of wrongdoing started to emerge, prompting a series of criminal investigations.  The world learned that for years, Bankman-Fried and his associates had engaged in fraudulent activities, syphoning off user funds and perpetrating misdeeds that shocked the crypto community. His carefully curated public image was forever tarnished as it shifted from that of a brilliant entrepreneur to an embattled figure, transforming him from a celebrated whiz of modern marketing to a disgraced public figure.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried's Wildest, Craziest, Dumbest Trades | Trading Week  What was once admiration has now turned into condemnation as the result of his recently concluded high-profile criminal lawsuit points toward the inevitable prospect of jail time. Bankman-Fried was indicted on seven criminal charges, including wire fraud as well as conspiracy charges to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud and money laundering. He has been found guilty on all counts and awaits sentencing, even as he faces up to 110 years in jail.  In the end  The tragic story of Sam Bankman-Fried is a stark reminder of how rapidly fortunes can change in the world of crypto. From marketing and business maverick to convicted criminal, his downward spiral serves as a cautionary tale for the entire crypto ecosystem, especially marketers.  Bankman-Fried’s fate illustrates that the crypto world, like any other, is not immune to dishonesty and deception. Furthermore, it emphasises the importance of transparency, ethical conduct and accountability in this nascent landscape and the consequences of unethical practices and the negative impact they can have on the entire ecosystem.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Tim Haldorsson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/07/how-sam-bankman-fried-mastered-the-art-of-crypto-marketing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35573309bcd92ab2ca12a29fa1cf2ba47561c528-2048x1057.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This has since caused quite a stir in the cryptocurrency space. Shiba Inu Experiences Surge In Whale Activity According to data, Shiba Inu has been exhibiting astounding whale transactions over the past 24 hours amid the latest actions taken by the SHIB community to increase token support. Currently, the total inflows of SHIB tokens held by major holders are at an impressive 7.84 trillion SHIB. This indicates a significant 48.48% increase in inflows from these major holders over the past 24 hours. What makes this surge so impressive is the fact that the numbers were 410.21 billion SHIB tokens. The recent numbers present a spectacular 1,911.2% increase in SHIB held by the major holders. The Shiba Inu’s surge in whale activity came just after a recent whale activity from an unknown wallet involving approximately 4.43 trillion SHIB tokens. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Update: 530% Spike In Shibarium Metric Could Trigger SHIB Recovery According to data from Whale Alert, the unknown wallet 0x8d14cc60…6e5c7e24dc, transferred the 4.43 trillion SHIB tokens, currently valued at approximately $35.82 million, to another unknown wallet, 0x3ba943c7…225e6dabee. The alleged transaction is said to have occurred in a freshly created wallet, with just two transactions being carried out in the wallet in 12 hours. In addition, the Amsterdam-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitvavo, a centralized crypto exchange, also sent trillions of SHIB tokens to the same alleged wallet. Whales’ large SHIB hoarding is increasing at the same time as the token’s remarkable price movement. The price of SHIB spiked sharply in tandem with this wave of large-scale Shiba Inu token transactions. SHIB price has since experienced a significant 20% surge in recent weeks. Currently, the price of SHIB is sitting at $0.0000082, slowly gaining momentum at a critical point of $0.0000084, marking the highest price level the token has seen since August. If the token can surpass this critical point, it might pick up speed and eventually reach $0.00001 and beyond. This is because the last time this happened was back in July; according to historical data, the price of SHIB experienced a significant 37% surge after this happened. So far, crypto experts are particularly curious about the recent wave of large transactions involving SHIB tokens. These wallet-to-wallet transfers ignite optimistic sentiment in the colossal crypto market. Shibarium Sparks Price Growth The achievements of Shiba Inu layer 2 blockchain Shibarium have always had a positive impact on the price of SHIB. The blockchain milestones have caused quite a hype in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which could bolster SHIB’s growth past its current price of $0.0000082. Related Reading: Avengers Assemble: Shiba Inu Lead Dev Issues Call To Influencers To Push SHIB Growth The adoption rate of Shibarium will only increase as more SHIB holders become familiar with its advantages.

Widening crypto rally lifted total cryptocurrency market cap to $1.3 trillion, its highest since May 2022.  K33 analyst recommends ""aggressive accumulation of bitcoin"" for November.  Bitcoin [BTC] jumped to $35,500 Tuesday as the widening altcoin rally and risk-on sentiment in traditional markets lifted the total cryptocurrency market's value to a 16-month high.  A quiet and modestly lower session was upended mid-afternoon as bitcoin quickly spiked nearly 3% from $34,600, with some suggesting a short squeeze in the derivatives markets as the reason. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $35,600, up nearly 2% over the past 24 hours.  Solana [SOL], toncoin [TON] and Crypto.com's Cronos ecosystem token [CRO] gained 5%-10% during the same period, helped by continued capital rotation into altcoins. Binance's BNB, Ripple's XRP, Cardano's ADA and dogecoin [DOGE] gave back some gains from earlier this week, retreating 3%-4%.  Ether [ETH] remained flat at around $1,900 Wednesday, but one analyst suggested not going to sleep on the world's 2nd-largest crypto, noting increased blockchain activity could push its price to $3,000.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], a basket of 189 cryptocurrencies, was up 1%.  With the crypto rally now fully expanded past just bitcoin, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization topped $1.31 trillion Tuesday, TradingView data shows. That's the highest reading since late May 2022, marked by the implosion of the Terra ecosystem.  Increasing risk-on sentiment on traditional markets also supported the digital asset space. Safe haven asset gold sank to its lowest price in three weeks, while West Texas Intermediate crude oil (WTI) plummeted 4% to its weakest level since July. The Nasdaq 100 advanced 1.1%, now on a seven-day winning streak.  What's next for bitcoin (BTC)?  As bitcoin's price stays increasingly compressed in the range between $34,000 and $36,000, capital rotation into altcoins is creating a ""mini altcoin season,"" a K33 Research report noted.  It's a typical behavior on the crypto market that traders take profits after a sizable BTC rally and put the proceedings in smaller, riskier tokens.  At the same time, K33 pointed out, accelerating inflows into bitcoin-related funds provides support for BTC's price.  ""It’s hard, nearly impossible, not to remain bullish,"" K33 senior analyst Vetle Lunde said. ""An ETF verdict is nine weeks away, and institutional traders provide the only significant heater witnessed in the derivatives market.""  ""November represents yet another solid month for aggressive accumulation of bitcoin, with an extended plan to distribute, reduce exposure, and reallocate to altcoins once the cat’s out of the bag,"" Lunde added.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/07/bitcoin-squeezes-to-355k-as-mini-altcoin-season-lifts-crypto-market-cap-to-13-trillion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80116fb8f3457bdb006ca901a8a09fbd35f6e20b-1394x702.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392101,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0o7d,1699386490,"Sam Bankman-Fried's Wildest, Craziest, Dumbest Trades","The massive fraud perpetrated by Sam Bankman-Fried and his posse of insiders has cost the crypto industry an incalculable loss. There’s a numerical figure to attach here — $8 billion worth of customer funds was spent greasing the political wheel and on trifles like luxury real estate and Tom Brady’s endorsement. While the industry may very well move on from the embarrassment of SBF’s “old-fashioned” embezzlement scheme someday, there is a certain, unalterable harm done from learning the supposed smart money in crypto was incredibly dumb.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME. A version of this article was published in The Node newsletter, which you can subscribe to here.  Billions were misappropriated to prop up SBF’s money-losing hedge fund, Alameda Research. This went towards venture capital bets, which catalyzed the liquidity mismatch that ultimately brought SBF down, as well as plugging holes in Alameda’s finances. If at one time befuddled outsiders thought SBF must be making money hand-over-fist, all the evidence now shows Alameda Research was a money sink. Founded as a “market neutral” market maker, Alameda eventually developed into a pump-and-dump firm that inexplicably lost money during the largest bull market to date.  This is a roundup of some of the worst gambles we know Sam Bankman-Fried took during his five years as a crypto-trading behemoth, gleaned from the fallout of FTX, his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison’s courtroom testimony and on-chain sleuths. For a man obsessed with calculating the “expected value” of his actions, SBF was remarkably bad at gauging reality — in hindsight that may be expected, considering he thought taking the stand at his own criminal trial and likely perjuring himself was a risk worth taking.  See also: Sam Bankman-Fried Lost Half a Million Dollars Everyday After Alameda Launched  Creation and misuse of FTT  On May 8, 2019, shortly after the founding of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried launched his own exchange token called FTT. The idea was to give the young platform an “equity cushion,” apparently at a time when getting loans was difficult for the upstart traders. From the outset, the Department of Justice’s cooperating witness Caroline Ellison said SBF had directed Alameda to protect the price of FTT — at first buying the token to prevent it from ever dipping below what SBF saw as a key psychological price level of $1.  Alameda Research had received between 60%-70% of the initial token distribution, and in early 2020, SBF told his technical co-founder Gary Wang to include Alameda's FTT stockpile in calculating its balances. In many ways, this was the original sin of FTX long before SBF directed head coder Nishad Singh to program the “Allow Negative” functionality used as a backdoor to drain customer funds from FTX.  The largely illiquid token, which would have cratered had Alameda been required to sell it, was used as collateral in billions of dollars worth of investments and loans, and created a false impression of Alameda/FTX’s conjoined “net asset value” (NAV), which convinced SBF it was okay to borrow billions worth of customer funds, Ellison and Wang both suggested on the stand. Without FTT, many of Sam Bankman-Fried’s errancies wouldn’t have been contemplated.  Although FTT was often treated as a bet on SBF’s potential success, the token did not actually represent equity in the exchange. Yet, SBF often treated it as such. As part of Binance’s investment in FTX and SBF’s later buyout of Changpeng Zhao, Bankman-Fried had given his would-be competitor a total 23 million FTT tokens. Worth ~$529 million at the time CZ threatened to liquidate his FTT holdings, that was leverage that eventually enabled CZ to deal the fatal blow to his rival at a time when the world was increasingly worried about Alameda’s solvency.  Misplaced XRP  Two months before FTX went bankrupt, SBF reportedly circulated plans to wind down Alameda. That never came to fruition, of course, because Alameda had by that point an unpayable $14 billion debt to FTX. Still, some of SBF’s deliberations from the time were entered into evidence, including a Twitter thread he had planned to send had Alameda been dissolved. In the draft, he described Alameda Research as ""one of my largest successes–and then, briefly, largest failures–and then again successes.""  While there are many “failures” worth mentioning, SBF noted one of his largest was when “the company” lost track of “millions of dollars worth of XRP tokens.” He explained: ""In February 2018, we got lazy–and our accounting was lazy–and we lost most of what we'd made.” In typical verbose SBF style, he continued: ""Employees were sad and angry and frustrated, and I had no idea what to do about that.""  See also: The Other FTX Case | Opinion  Although he blamed the company, this loss corresponds with a known attempt by early Alameda employees to toss SBF out of his own company after a string of compulsive and risky trades that lost almost all the trading firm’s profits.  Poor accounting, worse controls  The XRP gambit wasn’t the only accounting flub at Alameda. In a series of recent X/Twitter threads, former Alameda Research engineer Aditya Baradwaj disclosed the trading shop had lost $190 million from security incidents. This was apparently a direct result of SBF’s management, and his Ensam-fueled desire to move at breakneck speed.  ""Safety checks for trading would only be added on an as-needed basis, blockchain private keys and exchange API keys were stored in plaintext in a file that several employees could access,” Baradwaj alleged, adding that ""meant virtually no code testing and incomplete balance accounting.” At one point, for instance, an attacker gained access to Alameda’s private keys that were held in a “plaintext file,” enabling him to transfer $50 million ""out of some exchanges.”  On another occasion, an Alameda trader lost $40 million in a yield farm on a new blockchain. The largest loss Baradwaj mentioned happened after an Alameda trader, who was unnamed in Baradwaj's account, lost $100 million after clicking on a DeFi phishing link that was promoted in a Google ad. Woof.  Eating losses  At various times, the Jane Street veteran SBF described Alameda as a market neutral market maker, a critical piece of crypto infrastructure and a “quant” trading firm. Market makers make money by supplying liquidity and filling both buy/sell sides of trade, slowly accruing profits from the tight “spreads” between what people are willing to pay for an asset and the price at which it can be sold. To some extent, Alameda was no different — apart from all the frontrunning.  But even though Alameda knew what trades occurred before other FTX customers, giving it an advantage, it still sometimes lost money performing basic functions. The so-called MobileCoin (MOB) incident, for instance, cost Alameda as much as $1 billion, according to the Financial Times.  The trade is actually so stupid, it’s almost difficult to explain. But, in short, in 2021 a trader began buying so much of the thinly-traded MOB token (which at the time was only listed on FTX and Binance), he began to push the price from below $10 to above $60. He then took out loans using FTX’s “unique” margin and liquidation engine, pledging the overly-inflated MOB as collateral. When the price of MOB inevitably collapsed, he defaulted on the loan but kept the capital and Alameda apparently stepped in to eat the loss to prevent FTX from going bankrupt.  Ellison reportedly sent SBF a document titled ""Notable Idiosyncratic P&L Stuff” breaking down the trade, which described a “malfunction” in FTX’s margin system. However, during his testimony, SBF said he had actually manually overridden FTX’s risk engine while it was happening, in part because he wasn’t sure if the trade was legitimate. Further, he also directed Alameda to take on the loss because he didn’t want it on FTX’s books, because investors would likely ask questions about it.  Mining bets  In 2021, Alameda had reportedly made over $1 billion in profits which it began to reinvest. Some of Alameda’s largest investments were in the mining sector, which in retrospect happened at the absolute height of the market. The trading firm had invested more than $100 million in a Kazakhstan-based mining facility, just months before the country effectively banned bitcoin mining, as well as another $1 billion into Genesis Digital Assets. The profitability of Genesis then tanked alongside the collapsing price of bitcoin.  Alameda sank $1.4 billion into startups in 2021, according to the Wall Street Journal, up from just $10.5 million the year before. In total, SBF borrowed $2 billion to start a venture fund that invested in more than 500 startups and seed rounds. While not all of those bets have turned south — in particular a $500 million investment in AI startup Anthropic, which is being courted by Google and Amazon, as well as “VC coins” like Aptos and Sui — there were also a few oddities including a fertility clinic, a military drone maker and something called Wordcel.  SBF’s innovation  Of course, SBF wasn’t a complete fool. A market entrant of “the class of 2017,” Bankman-Fried saw the rise and fall (and legal headaches) of ICOs (or initial coin offerings) and innovated on the design. As opposed to launching tokens and raising capital from retail buyers, who undoubtedly would be annoyed and possibly threaten legal action once the token’s price inevitably catered or the promised innovation failed to materialize, SBF developed a different scheme.  See also: Divisions in Sam Bankman-Fried's Crypto Empire Blur...  Instead of selling people tokens for vaporware, SBF used his trading firm to be a net buyer of his own sh*tcoins. He then used those holdings to leverage up, and take out cash loans. This was a repeat strategy for SBF, which he seemingly did multiple times with tokens like Serum (SRM), Maps (MAPS), Oxy (OXY) and FTT — tokens now known as “Sam Coins” because of his sizable ownership and direct control over the supply. At one point, afraid his own employees had grown too rich, he reportedly changed the vesting schedule of SRM to keep them working.  Alameda was also a net buyer in coins before they listed on FTX, according to research outfit ChainArgos. Between the start of 2021 and March 2022, Alameda reportedly bought 18 different tokens before public listing on FTX, and sold them at a profit.  In a way, this was SBF’s chief innovation in the world of crypto — it was a strategy that ensured tokens associated with his personal brand held their price, and helped him finance a fraudulent empire. But this token-buying scheme was also his chief undoing. Curiously, the Alameda balance sheet that CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported on was created by Caroline Ellison to try to hide the hedge fund’s level of risk, leverage and indebtedness to FTX. Yet, despite the misrepresentations, Alameda’s massive holdings of FTT, MAPS and OXY were enough to cast doubt on its solvency and ultimately bring down SBF’s entire operation.  The nail in the coffin was when SBF directed Caroline to tweet out FTT’s liquidation price. It’s incredible that anyone ever thought SBF was smart.",NEGATIVE,FTT,MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/07/sam-bankman-frieds-wildest-craziest-dumbest-trades,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f04466b0154e03ed4467ed8e6af1091d69173c7a-1632x918.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It would appear that the ranges below $10 are host to the cost basis of a hefty number of holders. Related Reading: XRP Enjoys 11% Rally As Sharks & Whales Hit 2023 High Holdings Since the LINK price is above these levels right now, these investors would naturally be in a state of profit. These addresses only make for about 55% of the network total, however, implying that a significant number of them are still sitting at a loss. From the chart, it’s visible that the $16 to $27 range in particular has a considerable density of investors. In on-chain analysis, major support and resistance levels are defined on the basis of the number of investors that are at a particular range. This is because of the fact that whenever the spot price interacts with the cost basis of an investor, they become more likely to show a move. When the price retests the cost basis from above, the holder may decide to buy more. The reason behind this is that they might tend to believe that the level, which had been profitable for them earlier, might produce gains in the future again, so it would appear like an ideal point of accumulation for them. On the other hand, the red holders might see the break-even point as a decent exit point, as they might fear that the cryptocurrency would go back down in the near future, so going out here at least means they can avoid taking any losses. Such buying or selling from just a few investors when the price retests their common cost basis doesn’t produce any effects on the macro scale, but if a large number of investors bought at the same level, the reaction might be more pronounced.

Kaal Dhairya, a Shiba Inu developer, revealed this today, November 7. As part of their efforts to make the Shib Ecosystem self-sufficient, the developers also introduced The Shib Magazine. Shiba Inu Developers Launches The Shib Magazine The Shiba Inu developers recently launched Shib Name Service (SNS) on its layer-2 network, Shibarium. The Shib Name Service aims to introduce the Shibdentity, a self-custodial identity system for the SHIB ecosystem Related Reading: Near-Term XRP Price Rally Of 270% Is Imminent: Crypto Analyst The product aims to make the ecosystem sufficiently decentralized so users wouldn’t have to depend on third-party platforms. Shibdentity creates a decentralized identity platform, enhancing security and user experience and eliminating censorship so that users can control their digital identities. As stated in an October 31 disclosure, the launch of the SNS marks a milestone for Shiba Inu. The team described the newly launched feature as a disruptor introducing something special and human-readable addresses to the ecosystem. It allows users to self-manage their Shibarium addresses without third-party interference. They can quickly transfer tokens to others using unique initials. Meanwhile, the SHIB self-authentication system Shibdentity, launched on November 1, developed some technical issues. The developer has yet to reveal the reason behind the technical glitch. However, the issue may be due to overwhelming traffic on the system. Dhairya noted that the developer team is working to resolve the issues and have things back to normal as soon as possible. “The newly launched self-custodial authentication system as part of the Shib Magazine is having technical issues for some users. We are working towards fixing this as soon as possible,” the developer said. Shiba Inu Developers Launches The Shib Magazine For Timely Ecosystem Updates The Shib Magazine aims to furnish the community with updates regarding Shib Inu products and services, including the layer-2 network Shibarium. In addition, the newly launched magazine will also report on the latest interviews with top cryptocurrency industry experts. This will ensure the community members remain up-to-date on happenings around the ecosystem and the broader crypto market. Moreover, when fully up and running, the magazine will promote a timely update of trending tokens and upcoming Shibarium features. According to reports, the first 1,000 readers will receive an NFT of the magazine cover for free. The SHIB Doggy DAO Foundation sponsors this effort. More Updates On Shibarium Progressive Strides Shibarium has proven successful since its launch in late August, covering significant milestones in the subsequent months. On October 18, the layer-2 network exceeded 3.5 million in total transactions, with over 1.2 million blocks in less than two months post-launch. Currently, Shibarium boasts a total of 3.8 million transactions and over 1.5 blocks. Related Reading: Chainlink Enters Bull Territory, Signals Long-Term Uptrend — Crypto Expert There was a popular notion that the launch of Shibarium would boost Shiba Inu’s price by facilitating token burns, lowering transaction costs, and increasing speed. However, within the launch period, Shiba Inu recorded a considerable price decline, even when most tokens soared. But recently, Shiba Inu has posted notable strides, recording over 15% 30-day price increases and a nearly 6% gain in the last seven days. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB price has increased over 2% and trades at $0.0000081.

42392115,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0pMZ,1699378200,How the Crypto Industry Responded to the IRS Proposed Broker Rule,"I was just going to write about spending several hours in a Costco, but luckily perhaps for all of us, there are somewhat more important things happening in crypto and regulation. Such as: we have just passed the first deadline for comments on the IRS proposal to classify certain types of crypto entities as brokers for tax reporting purposes. There's going to be a public hearing later today (and tomorrow) discussing these comments, although the actual comment deadline has been extended by a few weeks.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Reporting requirements  The narrative  We're coming up on a comment deadline for the IRS' proposed rule for enforcing broker reporting requirements on certain types of crypto entities and transactions.  Why it matters  The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS are poised to bring fresh crypto tax reporting rules into effect. The crypto industry largely seems opposed – the majority of comments I read urged caution or raised concerns about the proposal as written while only a relative few seemed to support it.  Breaking it down  A few months ago, the U.S. Treasury Department put out its long-awaited proposed rule for enforcing broker reporting standards on cryptocurrency entities. The proposal suggested capturing hosted wallet providers, payment processors, some decentralized finance (DeFi) entities and others as ""brokers,"" meaning these groups would be subject to specific crypto tax reporting requirements. The Treasury also announced a public comment period, asking for feedback on the overall rule, and also asking specific questions about different provisions detailed within the document.  Over 117,000 comments were received as of Nov. 6, and just under 40,000 of those were posted online (it seems like they're getting posted as Treasury officials read them).  I read…some of them. I can't really estimate how many because I closed a lot of the repetitive ones pretty quickly, and at some point started filtering out anonymous ones (many of which echoed the main themes I touch on below). Let's say more than a few, less than a lot and nowhere near 40,000.  A few main themes emerged over the limited selection of comments I read through: privacy implications, reporting requirements on stablecoin transactions, the collection burden on brokers and the possibility of requirements beyond what the proposal stated on DeFi applications. All of these themes were in turn focused on what various comments described as the sheer amount of information that would need to be collected and reported.  The central concern seems to be that DeFi platforms may not be set up to collect personally identifiable information (PII) from the parties transacting on said platforms, and cannot be easily configured to do so in a way that people would actually still use those platforms.  Factoring in stablecoin transactions also dramatically increases the volume of data that platforms may have to collect and report, some of the comments said.  Treasury said in the proposed rulemaking that – as of right now – stablecoins are not going to be excluded from the sale provisions of the rule, but it sought feedback on whether stablecoins should be excluded if their sale results in no gain or loss, as well as other aspects of this part of the proposal.  Some comments seemed concerned about having to report transactions as small as purchasing a cup of coffee. To the best of my knowledge, U.S. persons are already supposed to report those transactions, but the concern may be in how these transactions are reported and who's collecting and listing the data. More on this below.  The privacy implications outlined are also split into two groups. One group suggested that because some people self-custody assets, their personal information – including addresses – may be more easily leaked, putting them in direct danger. It's worth noting that while unhosted wallet providers – seeming to refer to entities that develop and sell or license unhosted wallet software to others – may have broker reporting requirements, unhosted wallet users themselves only have the actual tax reporting obligations. It's entirely possible that I'm missing a specific nuance here on the tax form that's being shared but if you're filing taxes, you're sharing your address with the IRS anyway.  There's also concerns that the brokers themselves – say a centralized or decentralized platform – may be compromised, which, erm, yeah fair enough.  The other group – and I'm reading between the lines here a little – seemed to suggest that to some extent, cryptocurrency transactions below a certain level (dare I say ""de minimis?"") should just be exempt from tax reporting requirements, though that's not an issue raised by this proposed rule.  Requests for extensions filed by various companies and entities in the crypto sector made up a smaller sub-theme. Treasury extended the comment deadline by two weeks, and the public hearing was pushed to Nov. 13. People who'd like to attend as a listener should email the IRS with ""Request to ATTEND Hearing Telephonically for REG–122793–19"" in the subject line before Nov. 9, per instructions on the Federal Register.  Some of the comments were less on-topic. A few seemed to have some boilerplate language about Pulsechain or defended Richard Heart, the face of that project who's now facing a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. Another called Heart a ""scammer"" and seemed to urge the federal government to heavily regulate anything that isn't Bitcoin. I'm going to do something a little bit unusual and inject my personal opinion here, which is that maybe sending comments intended (I'm guessing?) for the SEC to the IRS is a waste of everyone's time.  One comment ignored the proposed rule itself to mostly complain about the Federal Register's search function, which I'm including because it made me snort at [redacted] p.m. on a Monday.  Also – neither here nor there but regulations.gov, the site hosting these comments, was intermittently inaccessible from Monday night into Tuesday morning.

SBF_FTX  As some of you may have noticed, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on seven different charges tied to the operation and collapse of his crypto exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research last week. The verdict came on the one-year anniversary of CoinDesk's Ian Allison publishing a balance sheet from Alameda, which led to Binance's Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao threatening to dump the exchange's entire FTT stack, which in turn accelerated withdrawal requests and ultimately led to FTX's bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022.

42392112,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0p23,1699378051,"Ether Could Hit $3,000 as Soaring Network Activity Turns Token Deflationary","Ether [ETH] broke out from its downtrend and could head towards $3,000 as the recent altcoin frenzy revitalized network activity, Markus Thielen, research head of Matrixport, noted in a report this week.  ""Revenues for the Ethereum ecosystem are bottoming out from depressed levels; this could signal a tradeable bottom for ETH,"" said Thielen.  Ethereum's weekly revenue – which is the income from the network's transaction fees, also known as gas – recently rose above $30 million for two consecutive weeks, up from a yearly low of $12 million hit in early October, Token Terminal data shows.  ""A tactical bullish trade could have merit for as long as weekly Ethereum fees stay above $30 million,"" Thielen added, setting a $3,000 price target based on technical chart patterns.  The bullish outlook marks a pivot from Thielen's bearish views on ETH in September, where he cited deteriorating network revenues and user activity. Indeed, ether early in October declined to a 7-month low, while its relative valuation against bitcoin [BTC] tumbled to a 15-month low.  Alongside a major rally for bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market since, ETH has bounced roughly 20%, recently changing hands at $1,870.  Ether (ETH) turns deflationary  Capital rotation from bitcoin to altcoins helped spur user activity on Ethereum, which is the foundation of many decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), IntoTheBlock pointed out.  The network settled $250 billion of asset transfers last week, the most in value since the mid-March regional banking crisis and up from $105 billion in late August, per IntoTheBlock data.  As a result of soaring activity on Ethereum, blockchain data shows that more ETH was burned than added to its supply over the past week, turning the token deflationary after two months of being inflationary.  The rising on-chain activity signals that fundamentals of the crypto market are improving, according to Lucas Outumuro, research head at IntoTheBlock.

42392118,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0pCJ,1699377519,The Handover Begins: TradFi Takes Center Stage in Crypto’s Next Phase,"The great handover of crypto infrastructure from crypto natives to traditional finance is happening, but it is not driven by ideology, a newfound desire to “bank the unbanked,” or to promote an alternative financial system. Instead, it’s a function of both push and pull forces.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week, presented by CME.  On one side, traditional institutions are pushing into crypto because they see a business opportunity and are jockeying for a share of this promising asset class. On the other, institutional investors are pulling them in because they lost trust in crypto native intermediaries.  Not only are institutions here, but they’re starting to eat the crypto-natives’ lunches.  Future futures  At the end of October, we saw headlines about CME was “on the cusp of replacing Binance as the top futures exchange.” This should come as no surprise (see table below). Binance (and its geographic entities) is opaque and lightly regulated. Imagine an investor or institution looking to short a crypto asset – say, for hedging purposes. Many will have a strong preference for expressing this view (shorting) with a traditional financial institution with a diversified balance sheet.  For some, carrying a large position in crypto with a crypto-only institution would be akin to buying CDS on Lehman from Bear Stearns, to make an extreme analogy. Operationally, the onboarding practices at large institutions are easily understood by their peers and have been fashioned over decades of securities law amendments (e.g. credit, KYC, and AML checks).  Stablecoins  For centralized stablecoins, instant settlement and de-risking are no longer unique selling propositions. The market has moved on. Transparent and attested backing, openness around banking capabilities (rails and custody), liquidity and yield are now the most important elements.  It’s different for DeFi stablecoins, as it should be, as protocols try to carve out their own niches and look for competitive advantages. Even in the post-Terra world, DeFi continues to experiment with new constructs. Many of the first generation of stablecoin protocols, such as FRAX, were exploring ways to improve capital efficiency. But the latest batch is focused on passing through yield to users – in effect, importing “TradFi” returns into DeFi, mostly through U.S. Treasury yields (Frax, Ondo Finance, and Mountain Protocol for instance).  Can the dominance of USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) last forever? The only sure answer is that they will be challenged, both by DeFi importing outside yields, and by traditional institutions in jurisdictions that allow for regulated issuance. But, one way or another, the footprint of TradFi increases.  The rise of hybrid Institutions  The logical outcome is to expect institutions to “move to the center,” meaning crypto natives will become more TradFi-like, while TradFi institutions reinforce their operations in the space.  Consider the landscape: Coinbase is a crypto-native business that became a listed company. It is now offering futures to retail customers. FRAX, a DeFi stablecoin, has created a way to derive yield through investing in short-dated US treasury bills and repo agreements. JP Morgan created its own private blockchain to facilitate settlement and handles $1 billion daily. PayPal, with more than 400 million active users, has entered the stablecoin market through a partnership with NYDFS-regulated Paxos. Nomura and Standard Chartered have each invested in their own digital assets custody services (Komainu and Zodia respectively).  Then there are the spot Bitcoin ETF filings from BlackRock and Fidelity. In the U.K., we have noticed that industry stalwarts have registered as crypto-asset firms under the AML/CTF regime. Even regulators are adapting.  The institutional embrace of crypto is not a threat to the original vision of digital assets, but rather a catalyst for its further development and innovation. By bringing more legitimacy, liquidity, and diversity to the crypto space, institutions are helping to create a more robust and resilient ecosystem that can benefit all participants. The future of crypto is not a zero-sum game, but a collaborative and creative endeavor that can transform the world of finance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | ONDO,"Mark Arasaratnam, Ilan Solot",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/07/the-handover-begins-tradfi-takes-center-stage-in-cryptos-next-phase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aed1bd54e772c3020f8ede07ebcc899f8be990a0-1980x1320.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Why Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Picks Bitcoin Over Cash And Gold According to data from IntoTheBlock, in the last 24 hours, Dogecoin whales have carried out over $1.48 billion worth of transactions. This is in stark contrast to last week’s figures coming in at an average of $600 million in daily transactions by these large holders. DOGE large transactions climb to $1.48 billion | Source: IntoTheBlock It means that there has been a more than 100% rise in daily large transaction volume for Dogecoin, suggesting that the whales are coming out to play. The spike also began around November 4 which is when the DOGE price had begun moving upward quickly. This could mean that these whales have been buying large quantities, leading to a drastic decrease in the available DOGE supply on the open market. The number of large transactions reached 1,320 on November 6, just 100 transactions shy of the asset’s October highs. IntoTheBlock also shows a leaning toward bullishness with more addresses being bullish compared to those which are bearish. DOGE Volumes Are On The Rise Dogecoin whale transactions and volumes are not the only Dogecoin metrics that have been on the rise. The meme coin’s daily trading volume has also exploded during this time as well, with a 64% increase in a 24-hour period. Daily trading volume rises | Source: CoinMarketCap This drastic rise has brought its daily trading volume above $870 million with the possibility of crossing $1 billion in the coming days. This exponential rise in daily trading volume indicates rising interest, especially with the spot buying and selling.

""Tokenization is focused on solving an actual problem, and that problem is settlement."" Hsu said at the DC Fintech Week event in Washington. ""This is boring back-office stuff, but it's super, super important.""  Any time an asset changes hands in the financial world, the transaction typically passes through multiple entities and checks of its validity before it's cleared and settled to officially land in the hands of the recipient. At any of those layers – most of which carry their own expenses that may be added to what the customer pays – the transaction has some risk of failure.  ""Tokenization holds the promise to collapse that and to simplify it, if it's done right,"" he said.  His OCC is so engaged on the idea of the tokenization of real-world financial assets and liabilities that it's hosting a Feb. 8, 2024, all-day discussion on the topic at its Washington headquarters. But when it comes to the rest of the crypto space, Hsu remains suspicious.  ""There seems to be more and more of a divide between crypto on one hand and tokenization,"" he said.

42392133,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg107L,1699373225,A CBDC Alternative to SWIFT?,"There are more ongoing cross-border CBDC trials with cute names than one can possibly keep track of (such as Cedar, Icebreaker, Jasper, Mariana and many more). But one stands out: the mBridge project.  Why? For the following reasons:  - It involves 23 central banks, including the BIS (the official organization for central banks)  - It is designed to bypass the US dollar-based global financial system  - It is almost ready to go live  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Assuming it meets its target schedule, mBridge is set to become the first functioning blockchain-based payment platform involving official entities. Its nucleus is in Asia, but organizations from all continents are also involved. And while it is unlikely to knock the dollar off its global reserve currency perch, it could end up impacting international flows, trade agreements and the power of sanctions.  Let’s dive into the where, why and what of mBridge:  CBDC frictions  Wholesale CBDCs (which involve the exchange of value between banks, rather than between people) have often been touted as a potential solution to the frictions of cross-border trade. These include transaction costs, currency illiquidity, opacity and documentation.  The problem is, the frictions are often due to differences between systems, both financial and commercial. Changing these systems, many of which are deeply embedded in a country’s economic governance, is going to be difficult, to say the least, especially since there is as yet no agreement on how they should change. Even if governments are convinced that a wholesale CBDC is in their best interests, any application would require profound modifications to accounting and documentation processes.  As yet, there are no unified regulatory frameworks. What’s to guarantee that a CBDC from one jurisdiction will be treated as “good money” by another? How can the CBDC of one country spread through the financial system of a trading partner? If it can’t, how would swaps work? Beyond bank processes, which laws need updating? And, obviously, all trading partners agreeing on one common token is probably out of reach, given the potential impact on local currencies.  That doesn’t mean we won’t get regional alliances, however. Trading partners that see the advantages of a common payment platform that not only removes frictions, but also bypasses the SWIFT choke-hold on global finance. Right now, most cross-border payments rely on SWIFT messaging to coordinate payments. The dependence is such that being shut out of SWIFT is pretty much the same as being shut out of global trade. SWIFT is one of the key tools in the U.S. sanctions box, since – even though the platform is based in Brussels and is jointly owned by more than 2,000 banks – it is largely controlled by the U.S.  Do it together  One such alliance worth watching is mBridge. It officially launched in 2021 as a joint venture between the innovation arm of the BIS and the central banks of Hong Kong, China, Thailand and the UAE, specifically to test the viability of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for cross-border trade. The key aim is to streamline payments between commercial banks in different jurisdictions by connecting them to a network co-managed by their central bank.  Beyond the use case of cross-border trade, the project has been working with commercial banks (including all the large Chinese institutions, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, SocGen and others) as well as exchanges to trial blockchain-based security issuance, multi-jurisdiction insurance payments, programmable trade finance, FX settlement and more.  At the end of October, the BIS published an updated document on mBridge showing that, in addition to the five principal participants, 25 other official entities have signed on as observers. These include the IMF, the World Bank and the central banks of 23 countries, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Africa, Namibia, Malaysia, France, Italy, Norway, Chile, Australia… every continent has representation. Even the U.S. central bank is present, via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The European Central Bank is also in the group. Observers have access to a “sandbox” for experimentation. According to the BIS, 11 have been taking advantage of this.  Until recently, mBridge was running on a proprietary blockchain based on Ethereum’s Solidity language (which might imply some compatibility?) and developed “by central banks for central banks”, unlike other initiatives that run on blockchains built by third parties.  A couple of weeks ago, Chinese press reported that mBridge was transitioning to the Dashing protocol, which was developed by the PBoC’s Digital Currency Research Institute and Tsinghua University (affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China, and President Xi Jinping’s alma mater). I don’t know what language Dashing uses, but apparently it achieves higher scalability and lower latency.  This is significant in that it highlights just how much mBridge is a Chinese project, with international add-ons. China is the main trading partner for all the other key participants, and the UAE has been making moves to also deepen its investment and military relationship with the region. The UAE central bank representative on the project, Shu-Pui Li, spent 17 years at the HKMA. And the CEO of the UAE’s principal sovereign wealth fund is also the Presidential Special Envoy to China.  The blockchain does seem to be relatively decentralized. Each participating central bank operates a validator node which participates in establishing network consensus. Commercial banks will be able to operate non-validator nodes.  Polishing the details  Last month, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that it would go “live” with a minimum viable product (MVP) next year. What’s more, Chinese media reported that Tencent (owner of the ubiquitous WeChat app) will also be involved.  The mBridge project is much more than a few organizations tinkering with tokens and addresses. The project has committees focused on key issues such as the legal framework, the policy implications, governance, redemption terms, ownership rights, AML compliance. It is leagues ahead of most other cross-border investigations, and is moving forward while the U.S. is using CBDC resistance as a way to score political points.  Stepping back, this is not surprising. The U.S. already dominates the global financial landscape, and it has no incentive to design a new system. It is content with the current one. China, on the other hand, has long been working to expand its economic reach beyond its borders – with smoother and broader trade comes greater global influence. Throw in a growing number of countries struggling to obtain enough dollars to pay for imports, and you get a simmering and widespread demand for an alternative. Countries with geopolitical grievances with the U.S. have strong reason to think the current system could become even more weaponized.  There is a chance mBridge is not that alternative. China’s heavy influence in the group may deter some. And even if not, it’s possible that it doesn’t get much traction. SWIFT has over 11,000 affiliated banks. That kind of market penetration will be extremely hard to dislodge, especially since any systemic change will be expensive. Most banks are conservative and tend to be reluctant to change what isn’t broken.  But even if the use remains geographically limited to China and its main trading partners, that’s still potentially a lot of volume. And China already has a functioning CBDC that could make the initial launch smoother.  The exact timing of an mBridge launch is unclear – Hong Kong’s claim it will be next year feels ambitious. It’s a daunting task as the pieces are fragmented, complex and changing. But mBridge’s development is far along, its launch will happen, and when it does, we will have yet another strong sign that the established balance of power is shifting.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/07/a-cbdc-alternative-to-swift,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/83b590fa5328163070633c13cbb688c407ff6c44-1632x1224.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project is ""inviting validators and light client operators – the titans who guard Avail’s network – to test, validate and operate, helping us battle-test our code base, refine our infrastructure, vet our operational readiness,"" according to a press release.  In blockchain terminology, a ""light client"" is software application that allows users to interact with the network without having to download the entire blockchain data – so it can be done on smaller devices with less memory and computational power.  These light clients are a key user segment for data availability solutions like Avail and Celestia, which aim to relieve primary blockchain networks like Ethereum of the extra load of having to constantly field queries for data on historical transactions. That task is expected to grow more burdensome as Ethereum's network of affiliated ""layer-2"" networks expands, ostensibly producing reams of data that need to be stored and accessed.  Avail, spun out of Polygon in March and led by Polygon co-founder Anurag Arjun, has released test networks this year in anticipation of its main launch, expected in early 2024.  The new incentive program marks ""a significant stride toward Mainnet,"" the company said.  Under Avail's new ""gamified"" incentive plan, called ""Clash of Nodes,"" participants can earn rewards from completing quests. Those include consistently and correctly validating the chain, helping to simulate ""disaster scenarios,"" authoring as many blocks as possible and staking, Avail said.

Republican lawmakers have leaned into a state-oversight route for companies issuing stablecoins – the steady tokens whose value is pegged to a less volatile asset such as the dollar – and Democrats have favored a dominant role for the Fed. Barr is decidedly in the latter camp.  ""We need a strong federal framework,"" he said Tuesday at the DC Fintech Week event in Washington. ""They're creating a form of private money, and private money needs to be well-regulated.""  Lawmakers have moved a stablecoin bill through the House Financial Services Committee, winning some support from a handful of Democrats on that panel. The regulatory effort would still need to pass a floor vote in the House, though possibly attached to another must-pass spending bill. Then it needs Senate approval, which has so far been harder to come by.  Barr also addressed the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the U.S., saying the Fed is still entirely in the research phase.  ""We haven't made a decision on whether it would be a good idea,"" he said. And he repeated the recent promises from the central bank that it won't move on a digital dollar unless the White House and Congress ""clearly authorize"" establishing such a thing.

42392127,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0zmp,1699370901,Why Institutional Allocation to Crypto Is on the Rise,"Over the past decade, crypto’s potential as a viable investment asset has greatly expanded. The bleeding-edge innovations combined with the eye-watering performance numbers delivered by leading assets have made the prospect of institutional-caliber investment in the space seem like an inevitability. About 15 years into the crypto experiment, however, institutional participation in crypto remains limited. Instead, many institutions are in a ""wait and see"" mode, conducting thorough due diligence before taking the plunge into this new investment landscape.  Among the many reasons for delayed allocations, institutions may be deterred by the opacity of the regulatory landscape, insufficiently mature market infrastructure, inadequate investment vehicles, and a lack of suitably long track records for these assets. Fortunately, a wide range of positive developments are emerging which address these concerns, from a shifting regulatory landscape to maturing infrastructure and growing demand. As such, we may be approaching an inflection point when it comes to institutional crypto allocation over the longer term.  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week 2023, presented by CME.  A major reason that the tides are turning is because incremental gains are being made on the regulatory front. For example, bitcoin has been deemed sufficiently decentralized to be considered a commodity rather than a security. This distinction contributes to a clearer regulatory framework for the most prominent crypto-asset and sets a precedent for similarly decentralized digital assets.     Furthermore, recent wins in the courts are establishing powerful precedents that are working to establish rules of the road for the crypto industry. Perhaps most notable among these was the decision handed down by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres this summer in U.S. vs. Ripple Labs. In her opinion, Judge Torres stated that programmatic sales of XRP tokens to retail investors on public exchange platforms did not meet the criteria of an unregistered offering of securities, providing a framework for how we might think about the treatment of token sales. While challenges and uncertainties persist, these recent developments among many others suggest a positive-trending regulatory environment in the U.S.  Read more: Sol, Memes, BTC: Digital Assets That Currently Outperform the Market  Market infrastructure is also maturing, with the two largest crypto-assets, bitcoin and ether, now having regulated futures products trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The likelihood of a spot ETF tracking the spot price of bitcoin garnering approval in the U.S. is increasing, potentially opening doors to a wider range of investors by making crypto more accessible through traditional brokerage accounts, 401(k)s, and IRAs. Institutional OTC marketplaces, exchanges, clearinghouses, and custodians backed by traditional financial institutions are coming to market as well. These developments add a layer of credibility and reliability to the crypto ecosystem. In short, these and many other developments are providing institutions with the tools they will need to allocate capital and manage risk effectively.  Finally, we have continued to see resilient global demand for crypto over the course of numerous market cycles. Crypto has weathered prolonged bear markets during which the calls for the “death of crypto” have been deafening. Despite a leverage-driven drawdown that has lasted well over a year, the global crypto market capitalization has again rebounded, currently sitting over $1.3 trillion — nearly twice the value of the crypto market at the peak of the 2017 bull market.  Given the diversity of assets and use cases enabled by crypto, it is unsurprising that more and more investors are beginning to recognize the benefits of an allocation to crypto. Whether they are attracted by the asset class’ relatively low correlations with traditional asset classes, to its idiosyncratic drivers of risk and return, a growing pool of evidence suggests that crypto can act as a powerful portfolio diversification tool. In fact, given the diversity of asset types within the asset class itself, we see that correlations can be relatively low even among crypto-assets.  While institutional allocations to crypto have faced myriad roadblocks through the years, the foundation being laid today signals a shift in the winds. Incremental gains on the regulatory front, maturing market infrastructure, a growing number of institutionally viable investment vehicles, and a deeper understanding of the value of crypto-assets are all leading institutional investors to take a fresh look, promising a potentially transformative crypto landscape ahead.

Aggregated Open Interest Of Assets Except Bitcoin Is Forming A Bearish Pattern In a new post on X, CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn has talked about a bearish pattern forming in the aggregated open interest of all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin. The “open interest” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of derivative positions (in USD) that are open on all exchanges around the world right now. Related Reading: XRP Enjoys 11% Rally As Sharks & Whales Hit 2023 High Holdings When the value of this metric is high for any cryptocurrency, it means that the asset has a high number of positions on the derivative market currently. Generally, this kind of trend makes it more probable for the price to show volatile moves. On the other hand, low values imply the derivative side of the coin in question is cool at the moment, which may suggest a relative period of calmness for the price. In the context of the current discussion, the aggregated open interest of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin is of interest. The below chart shows the trend in this indicator over the past couple of years: Looks like the value of the metric has been rising in recent days | Source: @JA_Maartun on X In the graph, Maartunn has highlighted an interesting pattern that the aggregated open interest of the altcoins and the Bitcoin price has followed in the last two years. It would appear that whenever the indicator’s value has crossed the $12.2 billion mark, the BTC price has observed a top formation and has subsequently registered a decline. According to the analyst, this drawdown that has followed the pattern has always been at least 20%. Just this year, the tops of the cryptocurrency’s price observed in February, April, and July all occurred during periods where the metric was above the $12.2 billion level. From the chart, it’s visible that the aggregated open interest of the sector excluding BTC once again crossed above this line of historical significance back when the asset’s rally toward the current levels first happened. Since then, the metric has only continued to climb higher and has now hit the $13.8 billion mark, meaning that the derivative market has become quite overheated now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Just Cleared A Level That Historically Lead To Rallies Of 99%+ If the pattern that Bitcoin has displayed in the past is anything to refer to, then the asset may be fast approaching the top right now, given the overheated altcoin open interest.

But many traders now say the worst is over and that a new period of upward momentum is upon us.  Where might traders think of putting their money at the moment?  This post is part of Consensus Magazine's Trading Week, which is sponsored by CME.  For CoinDesk’s Trading Week, we asked our sister company, CoinDesk Indices, to do some analysis. Here are three areas that are currently seeing strong growth, compared to the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures performance across the entire market (or very close to it).  Solana Surges  Solana has experienced disproportionate gains compared to other major cryptocurrencies. Registering a 64% increase over the past month, SOL has outperformed Bitcoin's 25% rise and Ethereum's 8.4% gain. This latest rally brings SOL’s year-to-date gain to nearly 300%. However, Solana's position in the market remains complicated by the fact that a substantial chunk of SOL supply is locked in the FTX bankruptcy estate.  Awesome Oracles  Although the recent rally is felt across the asset class, with 156 of the 189 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index returning positively over the past month, some kinds of assets have outperformed others. The Computing Index, which contains protocols dedicated to decentralizing data sharing, storage, and transmission, stands out. This can be partially attributed to the outsized return of oracle networks, including ChainLink (up 47% month-on-month), Band Protocol (up 21% month-on-month), and Tellor (up more than 2x month-on-month). The surge in oracle platforms coincides with growing enthusiasm surrounding the tokenization of real-world assets.  Momentous Memes  Meme coins, which have been on a general downtrend for the past several months, saw a resurgence. On October 23, as optimism around the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF, Bitcoin saw its highest returning day in 2023. Over the same time period, ELON and PEPE were among the top performing assets overall, gaining 23% and 20% respectively.

42392117,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0yxX,1699367929,Bitcoin ETFs: A Surge of Fresh Capital or Speculation From Crypto Insiders?,"This post is part of Consensus Magazine’s Trading Week, sponsored by CME.  The launch of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) from BlackRock is a highly anticipated event in the cryptocurrency industry. It is expected to provide unprecedented institutional access to the crypto market, representing a significant shift from leading banks and promising substantial capital inflows.  These developments will eventually change the industry and kickstart a new market cycle. What we’re seeing in the market at the current moment, however, is still speculation by whales, some traditional firms and industry insiders.  We’re still working with derivatives, not ETFs  While the move towards ETF application approvals is a positive development, the price discovery mechanism for bitcoin [BTC] is typically driven by derivatives like perpetuals. Let’s keep in mind that these are leveraged orders that can be liquidated with the right catalyst, whether on the upside or during a pull-back as traders take profit or leveraged longs get liquidated.  This means that recent price hikes post-announcement weren't necessarily caused by a fresh inflow of institutional capital — though that will happen eventually — they were actually caused by speculation around ETFs, driven by people already plugged into the crypto space (including whales).  An ETF approval means that there will be an exponential increase in the amount of capital with access to BTC  We should still take this as a sign of institutional interest. It's not unlikely that the capital that kept BTC outperforming traditional assets came from large institutions or savvy allocators of capital buying ahead of positive ETF news. CME futures are dominating the crypto futures markets now, suggesting that, indeed, it might be more traditional institutions that are speculating.  These are the same players that have entered the room in previous cycles. Bull run or not, this kind of activity is par for the course.  How capital from BTC ETFs will eventually trickle down  We should still pay attention to the possibility of fresh capital coming in. Former BlackRock Managing Director Steven Schoenfield stated at CCData’s Digital Asset Summit in London that an ETF approval could bring $200 billion to bitcoin, while AllianceBernstein, a global asset management company, expects the BlackRock ETF approval to drive crypto asset management up.  Ultimately, an ETF approval means that there will be an exponential increase in the amount of capital with access to BTC. This simple change will be greater than any other development in the market’s history.  This arrival of capital will come over time as more and more investors and asset managers digest the news and decide that an allocation is not only reasonable but necessary. Likewise, the adoption of this financial product will take years as institutions such as broker-dealers, banks, and RIAs undergo due diligence and other processes before they can even offer BTC ETFs.  It will also hinge on the arrival of key players, such as market makers, that are an essential factor in building investor confidence. The role of market makers is vital to ETFs. They are responsible for creating and redeeming new shares of an ETF, a role designed to keep its price tethered to the price implied by the value of the ETF's holdings.  Will a rising tide lift all boats?  Finally, we have the question of what a BTC ETF means for the rest of crypto markets beyond BTC itself. Market cycles have historically moved from BTC first, to ETH second, and then cycled into smaller altcoins or more exotic projects. This time around the effects might be less direct, but still noticeable.  See also: Sizing the Massive Spot Bitcoin ETF Opportunity | Trading Week  It’s true that a “rising tide” is not guaranteed in the aftermath of the ETFs going live as the new inflow of capital will not come in the form of direct ownership of BTC. Investors who choose that instrument won't easily be able to change or diversify their exposure to other crypto assets until more ETFs are introduced.  While this could mean that capital could be isolated from assets that are usually “floated” by BTC, more money flows into an ETF also means that more of the underlying bitcoin has to be bought. This will create price increases that then raise the value in portfolios that do hold BTC directly. These holders, in turn, will have more money to diversify into other crypto assets.  There’s reason to be cautiously optimistic overall, but BTC EFTs are still a speculative talking point.

In line with this, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, has some answers as he provided insight into the token’s trajectory using technical analysis. What The Charts Are Saying About Cardano In a video shared on YouTube, Gambardello highlighted the fact that ADA saw a weekly close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), which is something he labeled as “special” and “something “huge.” This is so because there are currently similarities between now and the last cycle, which ushered in the bull market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu-Based BONE Eyes $1 As This On-Chain Metric Explodes Interestingly, he noted that Cardano seems to be above the game this time around, as the close above the 50-week moving average occurred this time while ADA is still in the accumulation phase, unlike back in February 2020 when it happened just after the accumulation phase. He also linked the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to these happenings as he noted that, just like the last cycle, ADA was overbought as it was preparing for an upside move. Despite the overbought similarities, he mentioned that this could be different in that ADA continues instead of a retracement as both the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages haven’t crossed over the 200-day EMA. Can ADA Make A Move To $0.45? Although the crypto founder admitted that he didn’t exactly have a target as to what price level ADA could hit, he mentioned that the daily chart was hinting at $0.45 as a possible target. However, he doesn’t believe Cardano can add that much gain to hit such height, as he predicts a “big retracement” soon enough. As to how high he believes Cardano (ADA) can reach before the retracement, he mentioned that the crypto token could peak at $0.40 before the expected retracement, which could see ADA drop to around $0.29 and $0.30 based on the moving average structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Rally Not Over: Crypto Capital Inflows Reach One-Year High Such a decline will represent about a %15 decline, but Gambardello is optimistic as he stated that such a dip usually occurs in between the end of the bear cycle and the start of the bull cycle. Meanwhile, he said that ADA could also fall to a Fibonacci support at around $0.26 and $0.28. Despite his prediction that Cardano is going to fall soon enough based on its overbought status, Gambardello isn’t ruling the target of $0.45 out. He just believes it could take longer rather than just seeing all green candles straight up to that target. At the time of writing, ADA is currently trading at around $0.35, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

It’s unlike some other staking projects where you transfer ownership of your assets and third parties can make decisions for you on how to stake or lend those coins.”  A focus on segregated, bankruptcy protected and regulated custody makes sense following the various crypto companies that collapsed last year.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Prices of the ORDI token tied to the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol surged 50% in 24 hours after it was listed on the crypto exchange Binance as an emerging project under the ""seed"" tag. ""ORDI is a relatively new token that poses a higher-than-normal risk, and as such will likely be subject to high price volatility,"" Binance said in a Tuesday announcement. ""Please ensure that you exercise sufficient risk management, have done your own research in regard to ORDI’s fundamentals, and fully understand the project before opting to trade the token."" ""The Seed Tag represents innovative projects that may exhibit higher volatility and risks compared to other listed tokens. The Seed Tag will be applied to ORDI,"" the exchange added.  Silicon Valley investment firm Proof Group, part of the Fahrenheit consortium that successfully bid for bankrupt cryptocurrency lender Celsius, is in the running to relaunch FTX, according to two people familiar with the plans. FTX, at the time one of the largest crypto exchanges, collapsed almost a year ago, sending shockwaves through the industry. Since then, the bankrupt exchange has received multiple bids for a potential restart, now narrowed down to a shortlist of three, according to Perella Weinberg Partners, an investment bank involved in the process. Other options being considered include selling the entire exchange and its valuable 9 million-strong customer list or bringing in a partner. A decision should be made by mid-December, said Kevin Cofsky, a partner at Perella Weinberg last month. Proof Group is a venture capital investor in crypto projects such as Aptos, Lightspark and Sui.  Crypto funds had their best run of inflows since the 2021 crypto bull market as investors kept piling into the market, digital asset management firm CoinShares said in a report on Monday. Investment vehicles holding cryptocurrencies saw $261 million of net inflows last week, recording six consecutive weeks of positive influx totaling $767 million, according to CoinShares data. ""This run of inflows now matches the July 2023 run of inflows and is the largest since the end of the bull market in December 2021,"" CoinShares head of research James Butterfill noted.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's average monthly volatility since 2014.  Bitcoin has doubled in value this year amid weak liquidity conditions. Still, volatility has been largely absent from the market.  Perhaps macro and leverage traders are continuing to sit on the fence.

Coinbase has been embattled in efforts to legitimize crypto in the U.S. The exchange is fighting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an unregistered securities dispute but quietly acquired approval to handle customers’ buying and selling of crypto futures from The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).  “With deep national security expertise, Esper, Murphy, Townsend, and Urban will help the Council examine what consequences will result from regulatory uncertainty for crypto in the United States, including the long-term economic and national security impacts,” Coinbase said.  The quartet joins former Senator Patrick Toomey (R-PA), former Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH), former Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), Chris Lehane, Chief Strategy Officer at Haun Ventures, and John Anzalone, Impact Research Polling founder on the council that was formed in May 2023.  Senator Toomey tried and failed to push his own crypto legislation through Congress before leaving at the start of the year, and does not see a way forward for any crypto-related legislation in this term.

19896450,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559499,1699361108,"Bitcoin Price Targets $46,000 As DXY Receives Kiss Of Death","In a striking dual analysis, the financial charts paint contrasting futures for the US Dollar Index (DXY) and Bitcoin (BTC). Gert van Lagen, a technical analyst, has provided a bearish prognosis for the DXY, while simultaneously highlighting a bullish setup for Bitcoin that could see it aiming for a $46,000 target. DXY Receives Kiss Of Death The DXY has been in an upward trend since July, as shown by the blue ascending trend line on the daily chart. However, this line was broken to the downside on October 9, indicating a change in market sentiment. Van Lagen explains, “Blue uptrend since July has been broken too. Time to continue down.” This sentiment is reinforced by the price action within the black channel from the beginning of October till recently, where a period of consolidation is visible, succeeded by a strong downward move. The DXY dropped by 1.2% last Friday, November 3, to 104.92 and is currently undergoing a retest of the channel, a common technical pattern where the price moves back to the breakdown point before continuing in the direction of the initial direction. Related Reading: Why Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Picks Bitcoin Over Cash And Gold A third bearish argument for the DXY is the rejection at the highlighted red zone on the chart which signifies a high timeframe Fibonacci resistance area. The Fibonacci retracement is a popular tool among traders to identify potential reversal levels. The DXY’s price action shows a “clear rejection” at this level, where the index attempted to rise but was pushed back down, reinforcing the bearish stance. Bitcoin Price Targets $46,000 Amidst the weakness of the DXY, the inverse correlation with Bitcoin becomes a focal point for crypto investors. Gert van Lagen provides insight into Bitcoin’s potential trajectory, observing a bullish pattern emerging on its 6-hour chart. “BTC [6h] – Bullish pennant in play targeting $46k. The pennant is part of the shown ascending channel,” remarked van Lagen. The chart displays Bitcoin’s price consolidating in a pennant structure, a continuation pattern that signals a pause in a strong upward or downward trend before the next move. The pennant is delineated by converging trend lines which have been formed by connecting the sequential highs and lows of price action, converging to a point indicative of an imminent breakout. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Date For Next Bitcoin Cycle High Of $130,000 In this case, the pennant follows a significant upward trend, suggesting that the breakout is likely to continue in the bullish direction. The ascending channel, highlighted by two parallel upward-sloping lines, encompasses the entire bullish movement of Bitcoin on the chart, including the pennant formation. This channel serves as a guide for the price trend, indicating where support and resistance levels are anticipated at the moment. Van Lagen’s analysis posits a targeted price of $46,000 upon the resolution of the pennant, a level that is determined by the height of the prior move that preceded the pennant, projected upward from the point of breakout. The dashed lines on the chart illustrate the potential path Bitcoin’s price could take following the breakout. An important detail in van Lagen’s chart is the ‘Invalidation’ level marked below the pennant. This level at $34,103 is critical as it signifies where the bullish hypothesis would be considered incorrect, serving as a stop-loss point for traders acting on this pattern. At press time, BTC traded at $34,625.

19894521,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559489,1699356622,Ethereum Bullish Revival: Will This Breakthrough Lead To A New Market Phase?,"Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has exhibited a promising technical development, igniting optimism within the crypto community. The formation of a bullish flag pattern within the daily timeframe has captured the attention of analysts and traders, hinting at potential positive movements in the near future. A bullish flag pattern is a common technical analysis formation in financial markets, frequently visible on price charts. It involves an upward price surge (the flagpole) succeeded by a consolidation or sideways movement (the flag) within a downward or sideways channel. Typically identified within the daily timeframe, it signals recent upward movement followed by a consolidation phase. Traders and analysts keenly observe this pattern as it often implies a potential continuation of an upward trend. This aligns perfectly with the current recovery sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, as Ether managed to breach the upper trendline of the pattern earlier this week, pointing towards the possibility of a substantial upward surge. Related Reading: Chainlink Enters Bull Territory, Signals Long-Term Uptrend — Crypto Expert Ethereum: Breakthrough Resistance The recent surge in Ethereum’s price has broken past a critical resistance level marked by the convergence of its 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). These EMAs hold paramount importance for traders and analysts, often serving as key indicators of market trends and momentum. The successful breach of this resistance level further reinforces the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum, indicating a potential shift towards a more robust upward trajectory. The bullish flag pattern that has taken shape on Ethereum’s price chart has been a long time in the making, spanning over a period of seven months. During this time, the price of ETH has fluctuated within the converging trendlines of the pattern, reflecting the market’s indecision and the tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. It is noteworthy that the upper boundary of the pattern has acted as a significant support level twice, underlining its influence in shaping market sentiment and price dynamics. Related Reading: XRP Hits Critical Price Juncture As Whales Scoop Up 1.26 Billion Coins Ethereum currently trading at $1,883 on the daily chart: TradingView.com Market Insights And Caution As of the latest market data provided by CoinGecko, the current price of Ethereum stands at $1,890, reflecting a modest 24-hour gain of 0.5% and a notable upward trajectory of 5.3% over the past seven days. These figures reaffirm the growing interest in Ethereum, highlighting the market’s confidence in the coin’s potential for further gains. Source: Coingecko Industry experts and seasoned traders offer valuable insights into this recent development, emphasizing the importance of closely monitoring the price action and overall market sentiment surrounding Ethereum. With the bullish flag pattern hinting at a potential bullish continuation, market participants are advised to stay vigilant and consider the implications of this technical setup in their trading strategies. Despite the positive momentum, caution remains essential, as the cryptocurrency market is known for its inherent volatility and unpredictability. Investors and traders are advised to conduct thorough research, employ risk management strategies, and stay informed about market developments to make well-informed decisions in this dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape.

Aggregated trading volume across exchanges has increased at the same time. Market sentiment is not optimistic. Bitcoin is likely to retest the previous low of 16,000. After several months of trading within the price range of $16,000 to $30,000, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is encountering strong resistance at $35,000 in the weekly time frame. We need to check whether it will break through this resistance to move higher or if it will react and move lower. Bitcoin is encountering a strong resistance. (Tradingview) After several gloomy months, there are signs of a resurgence in the daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies on various exchanges. The aggregate trading volume in the spot market across various exchanges has increased sharply. Daily Exchange Volume (7DMA) (theblock.co), (theblock) The cryptocurrency market has become more vibrant, with October witnessing an increase in monthly spot market volumes across cryptocurrency exchanges compared to the first few months of the year 2023. Cryptocurrency Monthly Exchange Volume (theblock) With strong support from the USD, as evidenced by the USD Support Exchange Volume index, liquidity in the cryptocurrency market is further ensured. However, this could also be a sign of approaching selling pressure near the resistance level. Spot trade volumes for cryptocurrency exchanges with USD support and USD pairs contributing significant volume. (theblock) In addition, the trading volume between various cryptocurrencies has also increased, meaning there is trading occurring without the use of USD. This indicates that the liquidity between different cryptocurrencies has significantly increased in October. Spot trade volumes for cryptocurrency exchanges with no USD support or USD pairs contributing in significant volumes. (theblock) In particular, the total volume of BTC spot trading has also seen a significant increase in October, following several months of a downturn. In simple terms, Bitcoin is being traded more actively in the resistance zone of $30,000 to $35,000. Spot market total volume for BTC and ETH across all cryptocurrency exchanges. Chart uses 7-day moving average. (theblock) When examining the ratio of daily spot market total volume for BTC to BTC futures trading volume, it's important to note that both volume calculations incorporate data from the largest exchanges with reliable reporting of exchange volume metrics. This indication shows that spot traded volume has increased relative to future trading volume. In other words, The price of Bitcoin would be influenced by the spot market. Daily spot market total volume for BTC divided by BTC futures trading volume, Both volume calculations include the largest exchanges with trustworthy reporting of exchange volume metrics. (theblock) Looking at the volume for all BTC pairs, in BTC, on exchanges from The Block's Legitimate Index, We can see that the liquidity of BTC in cryptocurrency trading significantly increased in October. In other words, the volume of various cryptocurrencies being traded through BTC has risen. However, when compared to previous years, it may still be relatively low. Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume (in terms of BTC) (theblock) Looking at region-based customers, the number of traders shows signs of an increase in October, but when compared to previous years, it remains relatively low. We determined where most visitors to exchange websites were coming from based on data from SimilarWeb. These are the monthly volumes for exchanges that had a clear dominance in Europe. (theblock) These are the monthly volumes for exchanges that had a clear dominance in Asia. (theblock) These are the monthly volumes for exchanges that had a clear dominance in North America. (theblock) These are the monthly volumes for exchanges that had a clear dominance in South America. (theblock) At the same time, short liquidation and CME open interest and open interest across crypto exchanges have increased. This leads to the prediction that there may be a subsequent long liquidation. Daily liquidations of futures short positions on crypto exchanges. Includes Binance, BitMEX, Bybit, FTX, Huobi, OKEx. On this chart, the start of the day is 4 pm UTC. (theblock) Aggregated monthly trading volumes of CME bitcoin futures, estimated in dollar terms using the price of daily spot and the daily volume of contracts traded. Open interest is the average of the month. (theblock) The total Bitcoin futures open interest across cryptocurrency exchanges, where open interest is calculated as the estimated notional value of all open futures positions, or the aggregate dollar value of outstanding contract specified BTC deliverables. Includes the largest exchanges with trustworthy reporting of exchange volume metrics. (The Block) From the arguments above, we can see that market sentiment is still not very positive, with a significantly lower number of participants compared to previous years. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased as Bitcoin encounters strong resistance in the price range of $30,000 to $35,000. This suggests that Bitcoin may likely continue to move lower to retest the previous bottom at $16,000 in the mid-term. However, there may be positive signs for the upcoming halving event in the long term. Historically, Bitcoin prices often move higher after it's halving as miners receive fewer rewards.

Now that he's been found guilty on seven different charges, a few things are going to happen.  You're reading The SBF Trial, a CoinDesk newsletter bringing you daily insights from inside the courtroom where Sam Bankman-Fried will try to stay out of prison. Want to receive it directly? Sign up here.  One is – of course – the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System will get to work on drafting a memo for a recommended sentence.  The Department of Justice and the defense team will likely have views on that recommendation. Judge Lewis Kaplan has scheduled a tentative hearing on March 28 to discuss the proposed sentence, with deadlines for the two parties to respond to the memo ahead of that date.  There’s also Bankman-Fried’s second trial, currently scheduled for March 11. The judge set a Feb. 1 deadline for the DOJ to update him on whether or not it intends to proceed with this second trial, which is also dependent on the U.S. winning permission from the Bahamas government.  As a reminder, Bankman-Fried faces additional charges of fraud on FTX customers tied to derivatives (though it's worth noting that last week's conviction did include a count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud), securities fraud against FTX investors, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter business and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  These charges were not included in Bankman-Fried's original indictment, meaning they did not appear in the DOJ's request to the Bahamas for his extradition. The Bahamas Supreme Court ordered that the government cannot retroactively grant permission for a trial on these charges until after a hearing has been completed – I haven't yet seen any confirmation that one has been scheduled.  There's also post-trial motions. Defense attorney Mark Cohen and his team may file for a new trial or for the judge to acquit despite the jury verdict. These are pro forma, but Cohen suggested he will file those, and has a Nov. 20 deadline to do so. The DOJ must respond by Dec. 18.  — Nikhilesh De  Editor's notes  We're going to be wrapping up regular editions of this newsletter soon.

Open interest, or the dollar value locked in the number of active perpetual futures and standard futures contracts, tied to SHIB has increased by 23% to $61.74 million since Nov. 1, the highest percentage growth among top cryptocurrencies, according to Velo Data. Open interest in DOGE has increased 14.6% to $328 million.  Open interest in MATIC, ETH, ETC, and LTC has increased by 6% to 7%, while remaining unchanged in bitcoin [BTC] over the same time period.  An increase in open interest indicates an influx of new capital entering the market. The fact that more money has recently flown into derivatives tied to non-serious coins like DOGE and SHIB suggests increased willingness among investors to take risks. Historically, a continued outperformance of meme cryptocurrencies has signaled greed and marked trend changes in bitcoin's price.

Open interest in XRP has increased by a meager 0.76% in seven days, even as the payments-focused cryptocurrency's price has surged by 18.6%, the biggest gain among major cryptocurrencies.

42392123,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg0zNB,1699353707,"Bitcoin’s Role as ‘Digital Gold’ Will Aid Further Demand, Traders Say","Bitcoin [BTC] kept steady under the $35,000 level in the past 24 hours, with meme coin dogecoin (DOGE) driving gains for traders.  Tokens of major blockchains such as Solana’s SOL, BNB Chain’s BNB and Cardano’s ADA lost as much as 3% as traders likely took profits after a broader crypto rally last week. SOL pared gains after a nearly 70% jump in the past month, data shows.  Meanwhile, XRP reversed gains after jumping 10% on Monday. Monday’s surge was prompted by Georgia and Dubai announcing they will use payment firm Ripple's services, which buoyed trader sentiment.  Some traders told CoinDesk that they expect bitcoin to play a key role as “digital gold” – a likening as a hedge to traditional markets offerings, such as stocks – as a possible price catalyst.  “I think the general public’s education about the seriously difficult fiscal situation facing the United States is growing, along with a rising appreciation of bitcoin’s role as a hedge against this financial situation,” shared Banxa CEO Richard Mico in an email.  “The U.S. is now well over $33 trillion in debt, in addition to the unfunded liabilities of approximately $170 trillion. And, really, the only way out of this looming debt crisis is quantitative easing, or money printing, that will inevitably debase the dollar,” Mico said, adding bitcoin was poised to “be gold 2.0” amid such headwinds.  “There will be pullbacks and volatility more generally, but the setup for bitcoin and crypto as a whole is looking more and more auspicious,” Mico stated.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/07/bitcoins-role-as-digital-gold-will-aid-further-demand-traders-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8499111623a4dee33ca31f6fd9a9aa7e678b311-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Armstrong was previously ousted from his media company, BitBoy Crypto, following a decision by the company that produced the channel, as per an August announcement, which led to him dropping the 'Bitboy' moniker.  This is the second suit Armstrong has filed against his former colleagues.  The suit, filed in the Superior Court of Cobb County on Nov. 1, lists six individuals as defendants: Timothy Shedd Jr., CEO of Hit Network (the company that owned Armstrong's former channel); Timothy Shedd Sr., CFO of Hit Network; Justin Williams, CEO of Voomio; Allison Fiveash, a frequent contributor on Hit Network; Nickolas Dimondi, Hit Network's head of content and Carlos Diaz, an associate of the company.  The lawsuit claims that the defendants took control of Armstrong's account on X.com (formerly Twitter) ""for the express purpose of publicly harassing, embarrassing, and intimidating"" him.  ""Defendant Diaz used this X account to leak private conversations between Armstrong and Defendant Diaz, which had been surreptitiously recorded without Armstrong’s knowledge or consent; and to post false and defamatory statements accusing Armstrong of illicit drug use,"" the lawsuit reads.  In the filing, Armstrong alleges that he was coerced into transferring the title of his 2018 Lamborghini Huracan Performante to Diaz under threat of violence, and despite repeated requests, Diaz refused to return the vehicle. Armstrong complied with the demands due to fear, according to the suit.  ""Defendant Diaz warned Armstrong that he had killed people before, and implied that the same fate could befall Armstrong, if Armstrong failed to comply,"" Armstrong claims in the lawsuit.  ""Armstrong is not aware of the Lamborghini’s current location or ownership status,"" the document reads.  Armstrong also alleges that the defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy and violated the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act by conspiring to unlawfully convert his Lamborghini and extort money from him through a pattern of racketeering activities.  None of the claims or allegations have been proven in court.  ""The entire complaint is laughable on its face and has no merit in court,"" Dimondi said, speaking with Decrypt. “This type of bullying is what we have come to expect from Ben Armstrong.""

19891821,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559477,1699350341,Why Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood Picks Bitcoin Over Cash And Gold,"Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood was a guest on Merryn Somerset Webb’s show ‘Merryn Talks Money’, where she discussed the macro environment and the recent happenings in the financial world. What will mainly interest the crypto community is what she had to say about the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. “Bitcoin Hands Down” When quizzed by Merryn about which she would prefer to hold for 10 years between gold, cash, and Bitcoin, Wood replied by saying, “Bitcoin hands down.” She noted that while Bitcoin and Gold both have hedging functionalities, the latter already had its time, unlike Bitcoin, which she labeled as “new” and was just gaining steam. Related Reading: Can The ADA Price Climb Above $20 In The Bull Market? Analyst Provides Answers While highlighting Bitcoin’s future potential and “incremental demand,” she stated that institutions were still barely involved and that the major investors of the future (the “young people,” as Wood put it) would prefer to hold Bitcoin over Gold. She also mentioned that Bitcoin has been outperforming Gold recently in terms of its hedging capabilities. Wood’s bullishness on the foremost cryptocurrency may not come as a surprise to many, considering that her company, ARK Invest, is one of many asset managers who have applied with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Interestingly, her company leads the race toward approval as the SEC is expected to make a decision (possibly approve) on their application in January 2024, with decisions on the other applications to come after. However, it remains to be seen if that is what will happen, as the SEC can choose to approve (if it does) all funds at the same time. Cathie Wood Recognizes Bitcoin’s Importance Earlier in the interview, Wood highlighted the price of Bitcoin as one of the things her company was monitoring in relation to the financial markets and deciding on how to gauge the inflation rate. She alluded to how Bitcoin’s price rose from $19,000 to $30,000 during the regional banking crisis that occurred back in March with a couple of banks like Silicon Valley Bank collapsing. Related Reading: Did Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Short Ethereum? Unraveling A 70,000 ETH Sale She described Bitcoin’s rise during that period as “fascinating” and how many saw the cryptocurrency as a “flight to safety vehicle.” While many have in the past touted Bitcoin as a hedge against Inflation, Cathie Wood believes it can go both ways as the cryptocurrency can also serve as a hedge against deflation because there is no counterparty risk in Bitcoin. She seemed to suggest that Bitcoin was a haven for many, especially with the banking crisis, because it was completely “transparent and decentralized,” unlike banks where customers do not know anything about what goes in there and how their deposits are being used or safeguarded.

6864,http://blokt.com/?p=51956,1699347624,An In-Depth Beginners Guide to Uniswap [2023],"With so many new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols emerging almost daily on the Ethereum blockchain, those in the crypto space hear almost every day about newly minted millionaires, huge returns on tiny investments, and also the occasional rug pull. Beginners Guide to Uniswap The DeFi hype is centered around protocols that offer lending solutions, or other traditional centralized financial products on the blockchain in a decentralized manner, with a particular focus on yield-farming protocols. These apps allow users to ‘lend out’ their cryptocurrency assets in return for fixed high yields, and the associated tokens of these platforms have driven a bull market throughout 2020. As a result, one of the most frequently asked questions from new entrants into the DeFi space is where can you buy the latest DeFi tokens? Well, the easy answer to that question, and indeed the most trusted solution, is Uniswap. But what is Uniswap, and how does it work? What is Uniswap? Uniswap provides decentralized swaps, liquidity pools, and yield farming. Uniswap is a decentralized, peer to peer exchange developed specifically for the Ethereum network, also described as a decentralized protocol for automated liquidity provision on Ethereum. Launched in November 2018 by Ethereum developer Hayden Adams, Uniswap uses an automated market-making system powered by smart contracts to match orders on any ERC-20 token across the entire Ethereum blockchain. Essentially, Uniswap is a smart contract for the exchange of ERC-20 tokens. It draws liquidity from liquidity pools, which we will explore later. Uniswap has over 8,484 unique assets that can be traded on the protocol. Here, we are going to explore how you can get started on the Uniswap protocol, but first let’s examine some of the core concepts behind the decentralized exchange. 2023 Update: Uniswap is developing a mobile app, which is currently available as an limited early release. This means Uniswap is now a good option for those who want to trade crypto on the go. What are Liquidity Pools? Liquidity pools, which power the Uniswap platform, are essential to decentralized finance. Each liquidity pool is a pool of tokens locked inside a smart contract. These tokens, which are otherwise inaccessible to regular traders, are used to facilitate trading through the provision of liquidity. Traditionally, most decentralized exchanges rely on these liquidity pools in order to match open orders on their books – as there always has to be a both a buy side and a sell side when a user places an order. In traditional exchanges, such as stock exchanges and large, well-funded cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance , it is easy to match orders between users, and market makers are also used to ensure that there is adequate liquidity on the exchange at any given time. However, with decentralized exchanges, who have fewer users, there is no guarantee that there will be someone willing to buy or sell the asset you wish to trade. Likewise, as decentralized exchanges work through the blockchain, using a traditional order book model would be incredibly slow and inefficient – because blockchains still only process a few transactions per second. Instead, liquidity pools can be used to provide instant and price-steady trading between two assets within a decentralized exchange. Users can supply their ‘liquidity’ to a pool by supplying tokens, which generates a yield for the user via fees while their tokens are locked in the liquidity contract. This has created both lucrative opportunities for yield-farming, enabled better liquidity on decentralized exchanges, and provided passive returns to long-term token holders. Uniswap leverages these pools to allow users to quickly swap between ERC-20 tokens, and as such it has become one of the most popular places to trade new tokens. How Popular is Uniswap? Although Uniswap got off to a somewhat slow start as users made their way tentatively into the DeFi space, it’s seen a huge upsurge in activity during 2020, powered in part by the rising interest in Ethereum-based DeFi protocols such as AAVE and DMM DAO. In 2020, total liquidity on Uniswap reached $300 million, and 24-hour trading volume regularly exceeds over $200 million collectively on various pairings on the platform—even occasionally surpassing Tether in generated gas fees. On August 30, 2020, Uniswap overtook Coinbase in daily volume, processing some $426 million in a 24 hour period, compared to just $349 million on Coinbase in the same period. Also contributing to Uniswap’s popularity has been the launch of their native token, UNI. Let’s explore UNI below. The UNI Token If you haven’t already, claim your UNI tokens now! Introduced on the 16th September 2020, the Uniswap token, or UNI , is a governance token that allows users to take part in the future of the Uniswap protocol. Over 60% of the total UNI supply was distributed to community members, making it a fairly decentralized token, with only 21.5% given to team members and roughly 17.8% given to investors. Around 150,000,000 UNI tokens were claimed by previous liquidity providers on the protocol, and 430,000,000 tokens were retained as governance treasury tokens. Around 5,000,000 community UNI tokens will also be available for yield farmers to claim through various stablecoin yield farming pools. Uniswap will use the UNI governance tokens to promote community initiatives, provide liquidity mining, and fund other programs for the good of the protocol. If you have used Uniswap, you should be eligible to claim up to 400 UNI tokens just for connecting your wallet. How to Find Uniswap Gems Often, you may find cryptocurrency community members talking about ‘ Uniswap gems ’. As Uniswap offers easy peer to peer trading between any ERC-20 token with low gas fees, it’s often the first place users can access brand new Ethereum-based tokens, such as the latest DeFi protocol or utility token for example. As a result, many crypto traders keep a close eye on new additions to Uniswap to make the most of brand new trading opportunities. These are often called ‘Uniswap gems’, and although most accept that these type of tokens are somewhat of a gamble , they usually share similar characteristics, such as low market capitalization, a small daily traded volume, and a relatively small number of existing token holders – all characteristics which give tokens a high upside potential , if they are sound projects. There is little doubt that the number of Uniswap gems and the returns they have netted for users, has significantly contributed to the protocol’s success, especially during the more bullish 2020 market. How to use Uniswap There are a couple of things you will need before you get started on Uniswap. Firstly, you will need to have a browser extension or plugin installed which lets you interface with web 3.0 applications. The most common of these, and the one best supported by Uniswap, is Metamask. Choose your preferred wallet to connect to Uniswap. There are also options to use WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Fortmatic, and Portis wallets for ease of access. Coinbase wallet is a great option for users who are relatively new to cryptocurrency and have assets stored in the Coinbase mobile app. You can learn how to use Coinbase here . This should make it much easier to transfer your assets across from Coinbase and swap them for ERC-20 tokens easily. Be careful though, as you can only use ETH and Ethereum-based tokens on Uniswap – don’t try and use Bitcoin, for example. The swapping experience is simple on Uniswap. First, connect your chosen wallet extension. Once connected, in the top box, simply select the asset you want to swap and enter the amount, or click ‘max’ if you want to swap all of your asset. In the example below, we will swap ETH for UBT. A basic Uniswap transaction. Select the asset you want to swap for from the list in the bottom box. Occasionally, you may have to manually search for the asset you want to swap to. The easiest way to do this is to paste the contract address of your desired token. This is also the safest way since tokens can have the same name as others and you can’t guarantee you are buying the real one without the contract address. Once you are happy with the exchange rate and slippage tolerance, go ahead and click ‘Swap’. You will be shown another lightbox with more details of the swap. If you are happy to go ahead, click ‘Confirm Swap’. You will now be prompted to confirm the swap via your wallet plugin and select your gas price. We will explore more on this below. If you’re already familiar with Metamask or using other Ethereum plugins for interacting with decentralized applications, or DApps, then using Uniswap should be a pretty easy and familiar experience, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Let’s explore the most common things new Uniswap users stumble on when using the decentralized liquidity protocol. Uniswap Slippage Be careful of slippage on Uniswap. Slippage occurs when the price you have opened a trade at, or wish to swap assets for, isn’t available anymore at the time of the execution of your order. This can happen for a number of reasons, especially in periods of high market volatility when many other users are trying to buy into a token – prices move quickly. To make sure you don’t lose your transaction to slippage, which is particularly annoying on Uniswap because sometimes you will still be charged gas fees for initiating the transaction, navigate to the cogwheel in the upper right-hand corner of the exchange interface. Clicking the cogwheel will show a lightbox with multiple settings, but at the top, you will see ‘slippage tolerance’. The general concept of slippage is simple. If you set a slippage tolerance of 0.1%, the most you will pay for your assets is 0.1% above the spot price – the current market price of the asset. If you set 0.5% you are willing to go that much higher than the spot price to secure your assets, and so forth. You can choose from 0.1% to 1% slippage from the pre-set options, or set your own slippage tolerance using the manual section. Sometimes, in rare circumstances and at times of high market volatility, you may even have to go up to 5% slippage to successfully process a transaction. This is only recommended if you really feel you need to get an entry into a token, and you want to make sure you get a good position. Setting slippage tolerances above 5% isn’t recommended, as you are essentially just paying a premium for the asset. Gas fees Like everything powered by Ethereum, you will have to pay gas fees in ETH to process transactions on the Uniswap protocol. Even though you are able to swap one ERC-20 asset for any other supported ERC-20 asset directly, this transaction would still cost you gas payable in ETH, so you need to ensure you have some ETH handy in your linked wallet to successfully process this transaction. Gas fees on the Ethereum network can get incredibly high at busy periods, or in times of high network congestion, and indeed the recent Uniswap and DeFi craze have added to the rising gas costs on the Ethereum blockchain. Setting gas fees too low on Uniswap can cause your transaction to stall, or fail completely. Be warned, even if your transaction fails due to low gas, you may still lose some ETH funds for initiating the transaction. Instead, it’s best to either use the network recommended gas prices at the time (medium speed), or opt to pay more gas for a faster transaction to ensure your swap completes successfully. If you aren’t in any rush to swap your assets, consider checking back in on Uniswap when gas prices are down, to bring down your costs. Transaction deadlines As we described above, settling too low of a gas fee, or insufficient slippage tolerances, can cause your transaction to stall, or in the worst case, fail completely. You do have to use caution setting a transaction on Uniswap and simply leaving your computer. In periods of high market volatility or high gas prices, you may pay the initial transaction fee but your swap won’t process – and you will lose some funds. In periods of high gas, this can be quite a significant sum of money. As a result, you may want to set transaction deadlines. Navigate to the same cogwheel menu as you did for setting slippage, and you will see the option to change the transaction deadlines. The default is 20 minutes, although this might still be too high for some. Essentially, if your swap hasn’t been filled in 20 minutes or the given amount of time, it will be automatically canceled. We recommend everyone ensures they have a transaction deadline set up. The exact length is up to your risk profile and slippage tolerance, but it is a great tool to ensure your transaction doesn’t get lost in the ether! Expert Mode Here’s a little disclaimer before we teach you about Expert mode – if you’re not an expert, don’t use it! Expert mode allows ultra-high slippage trades, which can often result in poor rates of exchange between assets, and even make you lose part of your original asset or funds. So, why might you use Expert mode in the first place? If you are an experienced trader, there may be opportunities that arise which you just don’t want to miss. For example, some DeFi coins have made astronomical daily gains during the past couple of months, and it can be difficult to get a position in a coin using normal slippage tolerances in a fast-moving market. Instead, by setting high slippage and turning off confirmation transaction prompts, you can settle swaps far quicker than the average user. However, it’s highly likely that you will get less of the asset you are swapping for in terms of current market value. Therefore, Expert mode really is only for experienced traders who are sure they can turn a profit from a trade, despite the unrealized losses they may make on the initial swap. Conclusion If you are familiar with using decentralized applications through a browser extension, such as Metamask or Portis, then you should have little trouble navigating Uniswap. However, do make sure you are careful to avoid some of the common mistakes new users make on Uniswap to avoid losing your funds or missing out on a great trading opportunity.

Floki was released in 2021 as a meme coin named after Elon Musk’s pet, Shiba Inu, but has morphed over time to position itself as a serious decentralized finance (DeFi) project. Decentralized finance is an umbrella term for lending and borrowing carried out on the blockchain without the use of intermediaries.  The 1.8 trillion FLOKI represents almost 18% of the circulating supply, and most tokens are expected to be out of circulation in the coming years as traders continue to stake funds to earn annualized rewards of up to 120%.  The staked floki is used to reward holders with token (TOKEN), a sister project that allows users to tokenize real-world assets (RWA) that was released in the last week of October.  RWA refers to a physical asset, such as real estate or a car, digitized and made available on DeFi applications. Several analysts peg RWA as a “trillion-dollar opportunity,” as such products can theoretically allow anyone in the world to trade or invest in any global asset – which is currently a complex process governed by stringent business and financial laws.  The yields range from 51% to over 165%, depending on when those tokens are locked.  Floki developers previously told CoinDesk that they expect tokenization to become a $16 trillion market by 2030. Users can acquire TOKEN from decentralized exchanges – where it has reached a $40 million market capitalization – but upward of 50% of the supply can only be gained by staking FLOKI.  Incentives will be offered to users who use the protocol to launch their tokens or smart contracts. A percentage of TokenFi tokens will be set aside to reward protocol usage based on daily activity – which may create a flywheel effect that attracts users who keep using the platform for even more rewards.",POSITIVE,FLOKI,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MINING | SHIB | FLOKI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/07/crypto-traders-are-earning-165-yields-by-staking-a-token-named-after-elon-musks-pet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9729c5ab1c5c4f1cf64f7181d5172c6b3958b155-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
19889483,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559463,1699345223,Near-Term XRP Price Rally Of 270% Is Imminent: Crypto Analyst,"The XRP price has seen a strong uptrend in recent days, demanding attention from investors and analysts alike. According to crypto analyst Dark Defender, XRP has surpassed the short-term price target of $0.66, a bullish signal for the digital asset’s trajectory. “We set $0.66 as a very short-term target, and now it’s broken in the 4-hour time frame. Congrats, who believed in it,” tweeted Dark Defender. The Next Near-Term XRP Price Target The analyst highlights the necessity for XRP to maintain its stance above this level to confirm its bullish trend. “We need to stay above this level today as well. The daily time frame indicates we are oversold, so there might be back-tests to $0.66 daily,” Dark Defender added, hinting that a corrective move could be imminent. Remarkably, Dark Defender’s not solely confined to daily movements; the analyst provided a comprehensive bullish outlook across various time frames. “Daily Time Frame, Bullish; Weekly Time Frame, Bullish; Monthly Time Frame Bullish,” stated Dark Defender, reaffirming a strong uptrend sentiment after several months of anticipation. Related Reading: The Main Drivers Behind The 23% XRP Price Rally Revealed In terms of future price predictions, the crypto specialist sees a 270% rally to $1.88 as the next short-term target, but not before a crucial condition is met: “We must observe XRP close above $0.6649 first, a prerequisite for a crucial Fibonacci Level of $1.88.” Fibonacci levels are often used in trading to identify potential levels of support and resistance, and the $1.88 mark is highlighted as a significant Fibonacci level equivalent in strength to the $0.66 threshold. On the way up, Dark Defender sets $1.05 and $1.33 as further targets, although these are considered less challenging than the $0.66 level. Long-Term Price Targets The realignment of focus will shift to $5.8563 once the $1.8815 level is breached. “Whenever I see $1.8815 is broken, then we can set $5.8563” as the next target, the analyst explains, setting an ambitious but calculated path for XRP’s potential growth. The chart shared by Dark Defender showcases the XRP price targets, illustrating a well-defined Elliott Wave pattern, a technical analysis tool that predicts future price movements by identifying crowd psychology that manifests in waves. This method hinges on the notion that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which Dark Defender has applied to the XRP price chart. Related Reading: XRP Enjoys 11% Rally As Sharks & Whales Hit 2023 High Holdings The chart indicates that XRP is currently in an Elliott Wave pattern, a structure that consists of impulse and corrective waves. The impulse waves, labeled as 1, 3, and 5, move in the direction of the trend, while the corrective waves, labeled 2 and 4, move against it. Dark Defender’s analysis suggests that XRP completed its wave 1 and wave 2, with wave 1 characterized by a sharp increase in price and wave 2 marking a retracement. Wave 3, which is often the longest and most dynamic, has targets set by the analyst using Fibonacci extension levels. This is where we see the recent break above $0.66, marking the potential start of wave 3. The 1.618 Fibonacci extension level provides the next target for this wave at $1.88. However, Dark Defender’s ultimate target for wave 3 is above the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level at $5.88. As for wave 4, Dark Defender expects a slight corrective wave, which will likely see the price retrace from the highs of wave 3, but not below $3.5. Finally, wave 5 is anticipated to push the price up again, completing the Elliott Wave cycle. If the prediction of the analyst holds true, the XRP price sets a bold long-term target of $18.22 for the completion of wave 5, which would represent a substantial increase of more than 2,500% from the current levels. At press time, XRP trade at $0.6933.

42419180,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1Zl,1699340078,CME Bitcoin Futures Open Interest Surge Indicates Interim BTC Price Top,"Open interest in CME's standard bitcoin futures contract has increased 35% in four weeks.  Historically, spikes in open interest have marked trend changes in the spot market.  Bitcoin [BTC] futures, offered by global derivatives giant Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), are widely known to aid price discovery in the spot market tied to the leading cryptocurrency. New research by McClellan Financial Publication shows sudden spikes in open interest, or the number of active contracts, in these cash-settled futures, hints at trend changes in bitcoin’s price.  Open interest in CME’s standard BTC futures, also known as large futures, has increased by 35% to 19,603 ($3.4 billion) in four weeks, according to CFTC’s Commitment of Traders report. The standard contract is sized at 5 BTC ($173,000) and is considered a bell weather for institutional activity.  The double-digit rise in open interest in a short period means bitcoin’s ongoing uptrend could soon run out of steam, paving the way for a price pullback. The cryptocurrency has gained over 25% in four weeks to trade near $35,000.  “The fascinating aspect of total open interest in bitcoin is that every once in a while, it sees a spike in a relatively short amount of time. When that happens, it nearly always marks a turning point for bitcoin prices. It can be a top or a bottom,” Tom McClellan, editor at The McClellan Market Report, said in an email to subscribers on Friday.  The chart shows spikes in open interest have historically marked trend changes, including the bull market top of late 2021 and the bear market bottom of November 2022.  Taking lessons from gold  Both bitcoin’s recent price appreciation and the surge in open interest likely reflect expectations the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will soon greenlight one or more spot-based BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  Most analysts expect a U.S.-based spot ETF to bring billions of dollars in new investor money, pushing BTC’s market value skywards.  That said, expected flows may not materialize immediately, leaving the doors open for a post-launch price slide, as observed following the debut of ProShares’ bitcoin futures ETF (BITO) in October 2021. A similar pattern played out in the gold market in the 1970s.  “Speculators are rushing in ahead of that anticipated surge in demand, just as they rushed in ahead of BITO's approval only to see it top. The same dynamic occurred with gold when it was finally authorized public ownership in 1975,"" McClellan said.  Gold prices tanked from $186 per ounce in December 1974 to $110 by August 1976 as the expected rush into the yellow metal did not pan out.  “The lesson here is that those who are chasing into bitcoin now on speculation about the impending ETF approval are likely going to end up like those 1974 gold speculators, and like the earlier bitcoin speculators who topped bitcoin prices as they rushed in ahead of the debut of BITO [futures-based ETF],” McClellan added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/07/cme-bitcoin-futures-open-interest-surge-indicates-interim-btc-price-top,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d208c6694091fa73b00bbe4627d92450ae61d6eb-4095x3018.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rekt Capital’s proclamation that “the macro downtrend is over” has sparked optimism among investors, pointing towards a potentially promising future for the cryptocurrency. One of the key indicators supporting Rekt Capital’s analysis is the notable increase in the number of Chainlink wallets containing a minimum of 1,000 LINK tokens. The data indicates a substantial surge in the total count of such wallets, marking an all-time high of 27,152.

The company's bitcoin mining operations have strong gross margins but struggle to earn a profit due to high corporate costs. Bit Digital's new AI venture has the potential to generate significant revenues, but there are risks and uncertainties in the competitive market. To be upfront, I am a crypto sceptic that have written cautious articles on HIVE Digital Technologies ( HIVE:CA ). The concept of buying rapidly depreciating specialized computing equipment to mine bitcoins with ever increasing difficulty never made much sense to me. However, with the recent rally in bitcoin prices, I am revisiting the space to see if there are any trading opportunities within the crypto miners. This article reviews Bit Digital's ( BTBT ) operations and strategy. Historically, BTBT's bitcoin mining operations is exactly as I envisioned; running on the computing treadmill to mine an ever decreasing number of bitcoins as difficulty ratchets higher. However, the company is diversifying into Ethereum staking and AI computing, which could help diversify revenues and improve corporate profitability. Overall, I expect the BTBT to good financial results for the upcoming Jul-Sept quarter given the YoY increase in bitcoin prices and the already announced crypto production. However, much of the surprise could already be baked into BTBT's share price. I think the more interesting catalyst would be the upcoming revenues and margins for the AI business, which could materially improve corporate margins and swing BTBT into real profits. Company Overview Bit Digital Inc. is an institutional scale crypto miner with a fleet of more than 40,000 specialized computers with a combined hashrate of over 2.0 EH/s (Figure 1). Figure 1 - BTBT overview (BTBT investor presentation) The company has operations in the United States, Canada, and Iceland and 99% of its energy is carbon free. BTBT's business model is unique in that it mines bitcoins, which are then converted into Ethereum and staked to earn yield. The yield is then used to acquire more bitcoin miners, creating a 'Bit Digital Flywheel' (Figure 2). Figure 2 - BTBT's 'Digital Flywheel' strategy (BTBT investor presentation) More recently, the company announced a new AI venture to acquire and host AI workloads for customers. Strong Gross Margins But Not Enough To Earn A Profit The biggest issue I have with crypto miners like BTBT is that despite showing strong 'gross margins' from mining bitcoins, they often have bloated corporate cost structures that lead to poor corporate earnings. For example, for the 6 months ended June 30, 2023, BTBT recorded $17.3 million in revenues and direct mining costs of $10.8 million, or 37.6% 'gross margins' (Figure 3). Figure 3 - BTBT financials (BTBT 10Q report) However, BTBT also recorded $7.4 million in depreciation and amortization and $10.5 million in SG&A, so even if we exclude the gains and losses on digital assets, BTBT had operating earnings of -$11.4 million or -65.9% margin. Excluding depreciation and amortization, EBITDA was still -$4.0 million or -23.1%. Depreciation Is A Real Cost Furthermore, depreciation is a real cost in the crypto mining business, since mining equipment starts to become obsolete the moment they are installed. Miners have to constantly buy new mining equipment in order to stay up to date with the ever increasing difficulty of mining bitcoins (Figure 4). Figure 4 - Bitcoin difficulty is ever increasing (blockchain.com) Never-ending Share Dilution To Fund CapEx Treadmill Since BTBT does not generate positive cash flows, how does it finance its capital expenditures? The answer is a never-ending series of share dilution to fund capital expenditures and any cash flow shortfalls. In the six months to June 30, 2023, BTBT generated negative cash flow from operations (""CFO"") of -$9.3 million and it bought $7.2 million worth of property & equipment. However, if we read the cash flow statement, we see that the cash shortfall was funded by issuing $6.7 million in private placements, and $5.1 million worth of equipment was actually paid for using shares (Figure 5). Figure 5 - BTBT cash flow statement (BTBT 10Q report) Since December 31, 2020, BTBT's shares outstanding have nearly doubled from 44 million to 85 million while shareholders have seen a -89% total return (Figure 6). Figure 6 - Share count has nearly doubled since BTBT went public (Seeking Alpha) New AI Business Looks Promising As mentioned at the beginning of this article, Bit Digital also recently announced it would be launching Bit Digital AI with an anchor customer providing up to $257 million in revenues over the life of the contract. Specifically, BTBT will provide specialized infrastructure to support generative AI workflows for an anchor customer. Under the agreement, BTBT will provide the customer with rental services for a minimum of 1,024 GPUs and a maximum of 4,096 GPUs. To fulfill its role in the agreement, Bit Digital has agreed to purchase 132 FusionOne HPCs for $35 million, each configured with 8 NVDIA H100 GPUs for a total of 1,056 GPUs. Under the terms of the agreement, for the minimum 1,024 GPUs, Bit Digital expects to generate between $23 - 27 million in revenues in annual revenues, beginning in January 2024. If the customer scales up to the maximum 4,096 GPUs for the maximum 3 years, the total contract could be worth over $250 million. On the surface, this sounds like a great deal for Bit Digital, as the company will recoup 66%-77% of the initial $35 million investment within the first year. However, it does come with significant risks for Bit Digital. First, while revenues for the GPUs will be $23 - 27 million, the announcement did not go over the matter of costs. The biggest cost for operating GPU servers is electricity; assuming Bit Digital has an average electricity cost of $0.049 / kWh, and each H100 consumes a maximum power of 10.2 kW , electricity costs for the GPUs alone could reach over $4 million (Figure 7). Figure 7 - BTBT has average electricity cost of $0.049/kWh (BTBT investor presentation) In addition, there are a multitude of server infrastructure costs such as cooling and networking that is required to service thousands of GPUs, so the true margin of these workloads will be far smaller than $23-27 million. However, management did comment in its press release that ""the contract is expected to contribute substantially higher margins than the Company’s existing business operations."" So my expectation is for gross margin in the AI business to be higher than the 37.6% gross margin in the bitcoin mining segment. If the company can generate 50% gross margins on $25 million in revenues, then that implies a ~3 year payback on the $35 million initial investment, which sounds reasonable. However, another risk to Bit Digital is the actual length of the contract. From the press release, the customer signed an initial contract duration of 1 to 3 years. Therefore, if the customer is not successful with its own large language model (""LLM"") AI business, they could conclude the contract after 1 year, and leave Bit Digital holding the bag. Furthermore, there is no guarantee the customer will stay with Bit Digital after one year, as providing AI workloads is fast becoming a commoditized business. Startup competitors like CoreWeave and Lambda are providing H100 workloads on demand at $1.89 to $2.23 / hr (Figure 8). Figure 8 - AI workloads is becoming a commoditized business (Author conducted search on Google) In a year's time, these costs could come down even more, and there could be even more competitors in the space of providing AI workloads. Risks To Being Cautious Balanced against being overly cautious on Bit Digital's business model is the risk that BTBT stock can experience strong rallies if bitcoin prices go up. For example, YTD, Bitcoin prices have doubled and BTBT's share price has rallied by over 250% (Figure 9). Figure 9 - BTBT's share price has strong leverage to bitcoin prices (Seeking Alpha) In the upcoming third quarter (July to September), we already know BTBT mined 403 bitcoins and that bitcoin averaged ~$28,000 in the quarter, so BTBT's financials should see a nice YoY boost. The question is how much is already built into BTBT's stock price. Conclusion In summary, I do not believe Bit Digital's bitcoin mining business has much fundamental value, as it perpetually operates at a negative EBITDA margin due to high corporate SG&A. Furthermore, the company must constantly upgrade to the latest hardware to compete. However, that does not mean BTBT's shares should go to zero, as BTBT's shares clearly have a lot of leverage to bitcoin prices. Looking forward, Bit Digital is diversifying into an interesting business segment of providing AI workloads using NVIDIA GPUs. Although still early days, the AI business could significantly boost BTBT's revenues and spread the corporate G&A over more revenues, improving overall profitability of the company. For now, I remain cautious on the AI opportunity, as the margins in that business is still uncertain. Furthermore, it would help ease my concerns if BTBT were able to sign more customers to the platform. I rate BTBT stock a hold .",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4648274-bit-digital-diversifying-into-ai-workloads?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/19885723.jpeg

The Craig Wright coin, which is said to be the pure “Satoshi’s Vision” version of bitcoin [BTC], is down 1.74% on the news, according to CoinDesk indices data. However, the token trades thinly on the markets with a daily trading volume of $29.5 million and a market cap of $945 million.  Many other crypto exchanges have delisted the token, some responding to Craig Wright’s behavior and others because of the multiple 51% attacks BSV suffered in 2021.  A 51% attack refers to a situation where malicious miners gain over half of a blockchain’s mining power, allowing them to undermine the network by invalidating honest blocks in favor of their own longer chain.  In 2019, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao ordered BSV to be delisted from his exchange after calling Wright a fraud.  “The real Satoshi can digitally sign any message to prove it.

19878896,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559418,1699322411,Altcoins Rally: What’s Next After The Breakout,"Altcoins have witnessed a significant surge recently, with their collective market capitalization rising from $575 billion to $615 billion in just a few days – an increase of 7%. This momentum hints at the potential for further growth in the Altcoin sector. Breakout From Descending Triangle The Altcoin market capitalization had been trading within a descending triangle pattern since its yearly peak in April. This technical pattern, characterized by a series of lower highs but consistent lows, typically signals a bearish sentiment – suggesting that each rally is met with increasing selling pressure, keeping upward price movements in check. Related Reading: November Outlook For Bitcoin Price: Another Pump Or Retrace? However, this past weekend marked a pivotal change. The market capitalization decisively broke through the pattern’s upper resistance line, surging by 7%. Such a breakout from a descending triangle is a bullish pattern, often indicating a reversal of the prior downtrend. With this breakout, the market cap is now eyeing the target set by the initial peak of the pattern, which could mean an additional increase of 7%. Altcoin market capitalization. Source: TOTAL2 from TradingView The significance of this breakout is further highlighted by the fact that the Altcoin market cap has not only broken through the resistance but also surpassed the previous high set in July. This breach could signal that the market is transitioning from a bear-dominated phase to a bullish one, where buyers are regaining control and pushing the market to new heights. Bitcoin Decreasing Dominance Bitcoin’s dominance on the market has recently slipped to 52.50%, down from its annual peak of 54%. This is a normal market fluctuation, considering Bitcoin had been on a ten-week streak of increasing dominance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Season: Leading The Charge In The Crypto Market Yet, it’s crucial to note that Bitcoin’s market share has dipped below the pivotal 53% support level. Should Bitcoin fail to reclaim dominance above this support level, we could anticipate a further decrease to the next support at 49%, opening the door for Altcoins to capture a greater portion of the cryptocurrency market cap. In bear markets, Bitcoin’s dominance tends to increase as the market pulls back, which suggests that if Bitcoin manages to hold or increase its price, Altcoins could experience further rallies. Bitcoin dominance (market share % in the cryptocurrency market) on the weekly chart. Source: BTC.D from TradingView Conversely, an increase above the 53% support could set Bitcoin out for the next resistance at 58%, at the expense of Altcoins’ market share. Historically, bull markets often begin with Bitcoin leading the way due to events like the halving event, which reduces the inflow of new Bitcoin. Nonetheless, there are still phases when Altcoins rapidly gain momentum, experiencing significant and rapid price increases. The current market breakout, along with a reduction in Bitcoin’s dominance, hints that such a phase could potentially unfold now.

42419171,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUE1RV,1699319795,Kraken Said to Seek Partner to Help Build It a Layer 2 Blockchain Network,"Kraken, the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is considering several of the leading blockchain-technology firms to help launch its own layer 2 network, people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  Such a move would bring Kraken in line with the move earlier this year by rival Coinbase to launch its own layer-2 network.  Kraken is considering Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation among others about using their technology as the basis for the new network, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because the effort was not publicly disclosed and the conversations are still fluid. There may also be other teams in the discussions.  “We’re always looking to identify and solve for new industry challenges and opportunities,"" a Kraken spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We don’t have anything further to share at this time.”  Major crypto companies with established brands and customer followings have been seeking to grow their presence as blockchain builders, either as a potential source of new revenue or simply as an extension of their current operations.  In August, crypto exchange Coinbase released its own layer 2 network, Base, which makes use of the OP Stack, from the OP Labs team that built Optimism, the second-biggest layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain.  Polygon, a leading developer of Ethereum scaling solutions with its Polygon PoS network and more recently the Polygon zkEVM, earlier this year came out with a new software toolkit that developers can use to spin up their own blockchains. Matter Labs, the developer behind the zkSync layer-2 network, also offers its technology to upstart builders.  Kraken recently added a job posting on the careers section of its website, advertising for a ""Senior Cryptography Engineer"" with ""knowledge of modern cryptography (including ZK proofs)"" whose opportunities could include ""design and implementation of layer-2 solutions.""  ""We are enthusiastic about open source, layer-2 technologies, zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and continuously strive to explore the potential of on-chain scaling solutions,"" the job description reads. ""The team has recently embarked on exploring how more protocols and decentralized applications can be integrated into Kraken.""

19877320,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559427,1699318810,Polkadot (DOT) Market Cap Dips: Q3 Sees 16% Decrease In Value,"Polkadot (DOT), one of the prominent blockchain networks in the crypto space, experienced a 16% decline in market capitalization in the third quarter (Q3) of 2023, according to a recent report from Messari. This decline came after a moderate downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market during Q3, despite favorable court rulings for XRP and Grayscale. The total crypto market capitalization declined by 5.8%, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) falling by 7.5% and 10.0%, respectively. Polkadot Closes Q3 With $5.2 Billion Market Cap As reported by Messari, Polkadot’s market capitalization closed at $5.2 billion, positioning it as the 13th largest crypto asset by market cap in Q3 2023 (currently 15th). Polkadot’s financial structure is based on a weight-based fee model, which differs from the gas-metering model in other networks, such as Ethereum. Transaction fees in Polkadot are determined and charged before execution, with the calculation comprising a weight fee reflecting computational resources, a length fee based on transaction size, and an optional tip to incentivize block authors. Related Reading: Expert Predicts Date For Next Bitcoin Cycle High Of $130,000 In Q3 2023, Polkadot generated revenue amounting to $94,000, representing a 3% decrease compared to the previous quarter. Messari suggests that Polkadot’s revenue tends to be relatively lower compared to its competitors due to the network’s structural design. On the other hand, the native token of Polkadot, DOT, serves three primary purposes: governance, staking, and parachain bonding. During Q3 2023, the staking percentage of DOT rose by 12% compared to the previous quarter, reaching 49%. This increase led to reduced staking rewards and a 12% decline in the annualized nominal yield to 15%. According to Messari, the close alignment of Polkadot’s staking rate with the ideal rate demonstrates the effectiveness of its mechanism. Polkadot’s OpenGov Milestone The Polkadot treasury supported various initiatives in Q3, including software development, bounties, client upgrades, and community events like meetups and hackerspaces. According to Messari, the implementation of OpenGov on June 15 marked a significant milestone, revolutionizing treasury management and enabling concurrent proposals with distinct requirements. At the end of the quarter, the Polkadot treasury held approximately 45 million DOT ($185 million). Furthermore, Polkadot has recently completed the official release of Polkadot 1.0, marking the achievement of a significant milestone outlined in the Polkadot whitepaper. Related Reading: The Main Drivers Behind The 23% XRP Price Rally Revealed The network’s codebase has been fully transitioned to a repository managed by the community through Polkadot OpenGov and the Technical Fellowship. The roadmap for the next iteration, Polkadot 2.0, will be determined through community discussions and consensus. Founder Gavin Wood has proposed ideas for additional mechanisms to allocate Polkadot’s block space and for creating treaty-like agreements between multiple blockchains called “accords.” As of this writing, the DOT token has exhibited a noteworthy upward trend since October 19, closely following Bitcoin’s lead. Presently, the token is trading at $4,839, reflecting a notable increase of over 16% within the past fourteen days.

19875626,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=559413,1699315215,Ethereum Layer-2 Booming: Will Gas Fees Drop Even In A Bull Market?,"The adoption of Ethereum layer-2s is on the rise if Token Terminal data shared on November 6 is anything to go by. According to statistics from the blockchain analytics platform shared by Erik Smith, the Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of 401 Financial, the average active addresses over the past three months has exceeded 10 million, a nearly 2X expansion from early 2023. Related Reading: Can The ADA Price Climb Above $20 In The Bull Market? Analyst Provides Answers Ethereum Layer-2s Finding More Adoption Looking at the chart, Polygon, an Ethereum sidechain, remains the most popular. At the same time, Arbitrum and OP Mainnet, which are common layer-2s adopting the roll-up technology, are actively being used. Even so, OP Mainnet’s share is gradually dropping. Base, a layer-2 backed by Coinbase, and StarkNet are also finding adoption, expanding their share over the past three months. In crypto, active addresses refer to the number of unique wallet addresses (sending and receiving) that have interacted with the blockchain, in this case, Ethereum, over a given period. An uptick or contraction in the number of active addresses can be used to measure sentiment and the level of uptake. In bear markets, active addresses tend to drop, only rising when bulls flow in, pointing to a possible scramble for arising opportunities. The recent uptrend coincides with the rapid expansion of leading crypto prices. Ethereum (ETH) prices are inching closer to the $1,870 resistance level, with a breakout above this line a potential trigger for a leg up that might see the coin retest $2,100 and even register new 2023 highs. Usually, rising crypto prices tend to revive demand as the number of active addresses and, in some instances, the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi), and more. What Will Happen To Gas Fees? Ethereum is the world’s most active smart contract platform, stretching its dominance mainly because of its first-mover advantage. The blockchain anchors more DeFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and gaming activity. Deploying protocols, depending on their objectives, can either directly launch on the mainnet or layer-2s. The mainnet is directly secured by validators, while layer-2 solutions depend on the mainnet for security but often re-route transactions off-chain. In this arrangement, more transactions can be processed cheaply and efficiently, relieving the mainnet. Though the Ethereum base layer is secure, its peak transaction throughput remains relatively lower at around 15 TPS. This means during peak demand, gas fees tend to be higher, impacting user demand. Still, Ethereum gas fees remain at a multi-year low at around 23 Gwei, according to trackers, as seen on the chart below. This is down from 240 Gwei recorded in February 2021 when crypto assets rapidly rose. For now, whether gas fees will increase as the market recovers is yet to be seen. What’s evident is that as users opt for layer-2s, the mainnet will likely be relieved, keeping gas fee fluctuation low.
