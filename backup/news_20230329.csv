42387816,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtY4l,1680134171,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Rises Above $28.3K Despite Binance Legal Woes,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Investors shrugged off concerns about the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's suit against Binance to send bitcoin above $28K again.  Insights: The Ethereum Goerli test network has been a proving ground for major upgrades such as the Merge. Can a small community of supporters keep it going?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,219 +35.3 ▲ 3.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,380 +1076.9 ▲ 3.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,794 +19.5 ▲ 1.1% S&P 500  4,027.81 +56.5 ▲ 1.4% Gold  $1,964 −8.0 ▼ 0.4% Nikkei 225  27,883.78 +365.5 ▲ 1.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  What Crypto Worries? Investors Send Bitcoin Back Over $28K  Despite ongoing tension stemming from Binance’s recent legal woes, bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies spent Wednesday in the green.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $28,380, up 3.9% over the past 24 hours and well up from its lows below $27,000 earlier in the week after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a lawsuit against Binance accusing the exchange giant of offering unregistered crypto derivatives, among other allegations. BTC is up about 21% in March, outperforming other assets such as ether, stocks and gold.  “The market has reacted positively despite the CFTC story mostly because the broader narrative of a return to quantitative tightening and fiat printing remains dominant,” Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, told CoinDesk in an email.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, was recently changing hands at $1,794, gaining 1.1% for the day. Among other altcoins, crypto payment platform Ripple’s XRP token continued its strength from Tuesday, jumping nearly 6% to 54 cents. Cardano’s ADA token and Polygon’s MATIC token were up 3.8% and 3.3%, respectively.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the overall crypto market performance, recently rose 3.4%.  DiPasquale said the recent outperformance of coins like XRP is tied to “regulators seemingly questioning even the biggest names in the space,” adding that “the playing field is evened for all other coins that were previously considered contentious.”  In the lawsuit filed Monday against Binance in U.S. District Court in Illinois, the CFTC called several cryptos including BTC, ETH, litecoin (LTC), tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD) commodities. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler has previously suggested that proof-of-stake tokens like ETH are securities amid an ongoing feud between the agencies about jurisdiction.  Equity markets edged higher Wednesday: The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq closed up 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was also up 1%.  James Lavish, managing partner at the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, called Wednesday a ""risk-on"" day across the board as investors appeared to position themselves and their books ahead of several data releases later this week, including Thursday’s U.S. final fourth-quarter GDP figure release and Friday’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data.  “The thought is if this data comes in weaker than expectations, then it will give (Federal Reserve Chair Jerome) Powell enough evidence to pause further rate raises,” Lavish told CoinDesk in an email. The CME FedWatch Tool showed that currently over 62% of traders predict that the U.S. central bank will not raise its interest rate in its May monetary policy meeting.  He added that BTC's price benefited from the recent risk-on move as well as the announcement that China completed its first yuan-settled liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade with the United Arab Emirates.  ""This strengthens the argument that bitcoin may be used as a means of exchange in large cross-border energy trades in the near future,"" he said. “That said, I believe this reality, while valid, is still a ways off.”  Meanwhile, the U.S. two-year Treasury rate remained almost flat from Tuesday, same time, to sit around 4.06% Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury rate was also almost flat from a day ago at 3.56%.  Nicholas Colas, co-founder of the market analysis firm DataTrek Research, highlighted in a Wednesday note that the yield on two-year Treasurys has been higher than that of the 10-year’s since July 2022 – a sign that “markets saw U.S. monetary policy as restrictive.”  “Monetary policy is essentially pushing the brakes on the U.S. economy and a recession inevitably follows” based on the historical patterns, Colas wrote, adding: “We certainly have the ‘kindling’ for a recession call, but the catalytic ‘spark’ is still not entirely obvious to US equity markets.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +7.3% Entertainment Chainlink LINK +6.0% Computing XRP XRP +5.8% Currency  Biggest Losers  There are no losers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Insights  A DAO Rallies to Keep the Goerli Test Network Alive  The future of the Ethereum Goerli test network remains uncertain, but a little-known Ethereum community is rallying behind the network in the hope that a solution can be found to keep it going.  GoerliDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, is making the case to continue Goerli as an active blockchain network and using goerli ether (gETH) to incentivize activity on the network.  “Goerli’s historical usage makes it an ideal candidate to be Ethereum’s de facto canary network – a pretesting environment closely resembling the mainnet,” the newly formed DAO said in a post earlier this week.  “An incentivized canary network like Goerli offers unique advantages to builders and users alike, and the concept has seen success on many blockchains – most notably with Kusama in relation to Polkadot,” it added.  It is unclear who is behind GoerliDAO as of Wednesday.  Testnets like Goerli are a testing environment that mimics real-world blockchain usage, allowing developers to find and patch critical bugs for upcoming products or features meant to be deployed on a blockchain's main, or live, network.  Much of the testing of Ethereum’s major upgrades, such as the Merge, were conducted on Goerli.  Keeping such a testing environment alive is what the folks behind GoerliDAO are rallying to do. “The preservation of Goerli as a canary network will not only fill a crucial need within the Ethereum ecosystem but also pave the way for future innovation and incentivization in the world of decentralized finance,” they said.

There are currently a little over a quarter of a million holders and many of the tourists appear to have left. As a network, Arbitrum's metrics are generally strong. Valuation metrics also show a token that is probably well-priced. Long-term holders have to decide if governance is a strong enough reason to keep a token that is going to experience what could be aggressive unlocking in 12 months. The long awaited Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ) airdrop has finally happened. Like Optimism ( OP-USD ) or Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) Arbitrum is the latest Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) scaling chain that now has a token. However, unlike Polygon, gas fees on Arbitrum are paid in ETH not in the chain native token. In this article, we'll look at Arbitrum's network activity since the airdrop, explore the economics of the ARB token, and attempt to put a fair valuation on ARB. The Airdrop For those who don't know, ""airdropped"" coins are tokens or currencies that are distributed to blockchain wallet addresses as a reward for some other action. They are generally granted to crypto users as a ""thank you"" for participating in network growth or development. Up until last week, Arbitrum operated without a native token. But earlier this month the long anticipated Arbitrum token was announced and we had the distribution begin on March 23rd. Anyone who met certain usage criteria on the Arbitrum network before March 16th of this year qualified for the airdrop. According to Blockworks, roughly 625k addresses qualified to receive the token and 87% of those addresses have already claimed their tokens as of article submission. On Friday the 24th, token holders eclipsed 292k but we saw that number dip down to roughly 245k on Saturday as many of the ""tourists"" had exited their holdings: ARB Holders (Dune Analytics/Blockworks) However, after a brief dip in total token holders over the weekend, we've seen ARB holders stabilize and slowly edge back up to 267k. Initially, 625k wallet addresses were eligible. Of those, 543k addresses claimed which suggests a little over half the addresses that have claimed have sold the token given the current 267k current holders. There was so much interest in this drop that the front end website crashed at one point last week when token claiming was enabled. ARB Distribution (Dune Analytics/0xroll) Depending on how many interactions with the chain users had pre-token launch, there were differing amounts of ARB that each user qualified for. The maximum any one wallet address could receive was 10,250 coins. However, the majority of the tokens that were distributed were much smaller individual allocations. Network Usage As part of the push to claim airdrop coins, daily transactions on Arbitrum spiked over 2.7 million on Thursday - which was nearly three times the transactions of Ethereum and more than ten times the transactions of L2 peer Optimism. Daily Transactions (Dune Analytics/Blockworks Research) Arbitrum previously lost share to Optimism as the OP chain had rolled out an ecosystem building initiative - when that initiative ended, the activity on Optimism quickly fell back to early 2022 levels. Now that the ARB airdrop is largely in the rearview mirror and all the ""free money"" has been handed out, it should be interesting to see if the level of activity on Arbitrum remains as high as it has been over the last several months or if we see a reversion to prior levels now that the airdrop incentive is over. Arbitrum TVL (Defi Llama) So far, we've seen more tokens come into lock on Arbitrum than leave. I'd view that as a generally positive sign for ARB holders. Arbitrum now has over $2.2 billion in TVL, which makes it the fourth largest blockchain by TVL after Ethereum, Tron ( TRON-USD ), and Binance ( BNB-USD ). Arbitrum now has more TVL than Polygon and Optimism combined and a solidly diversified footprint of 262 protocols with top protocol dominance coming in at just 23%. TVL Rank Network Protocols Dominance TVL 1 Ethereum 720 36.8% $29.2b 2 Tron 17 69.7% $5.24b 3 Binance 567 47.5% $5.04b 4 Arbitrum 262 23.0% $2.22b 5 Polygon 398 29.6% $1.07b 6 Optimism 120 30.8% $920.09m 7 Avalanche 290 37.3% $832.53m Source: Defi Llama This top protocol dominance figure is a big improvement from just three months ago and one could actually argue that Arbitrum has the healthiest Defi footprint in the crypto ecosystem judging by the lower top protocol dominance figures in the table above. Of course, there are no sure things in crypto and ARB is no different. Key Risk: Tokenomics The major flaw I see in going long ARB today is that the token itself isn't used for gas or any real utility beyond governance voting. And anyone who has followed my work on Seeking Alpha closely may know how I personally feel about governance as a sole utility. It's fine if the network or protocol token distribution is truly decentralized. But as we learned with Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) last year, ""governance"" is often used to justify a token that has no real purpose and major decisions concerning protocol governance may never actually go to a vote. I'm not saying that will be the case with Arbitrum, but the token holders who were just airdropped ARB are a minority vote in the broader governance table: Percentage of initial supply Number of tokens Allocated to 42.78% 4.278 billion Arbitrum DAO treasury 26.94% 2.694 billion Offchain Labs Team and Future Team + Advisors 17.53% 1.753 billion Offchain Labs investors 11.62% 1.162 Billion Users of the Arbitrum platform (via airdrop to user wallet addresses) 1.13% 113 million DAOs building apps on Arbitrum (via airdrop to DAO treasury addresses) Source: Arbitrum Foundation Beyond the utility problem, the token still has a large amount of token emission remaining with just 12.7% of total initial supply in circulation. According to the Arbitrum Foundation , investor unlocks don't start for a year: While the user and DAO airdrops will be available in one week, all investor and team tokens are subject to 4 year lockups, with the first unlocks happening in one year and then monthly unlocks for the remaining three years. Until we have a more clear vesting schedule, I'd be very careful about buying ARB as a long term investment today. ARB holders may be able to avoid significant sell pressure for the next 12 months, but we could see quite a bit of ARB on the ask in the next 12-48 months. Valuation As is so often the case in crypto, finding the proper valuation metric can be challenging and vary depending on what a coin does. Since Arbitrum is a smart contract chain, price to fees is probably a good place to start. Despite the limited history of the ARB token, it actually trades at a lower fully diluted P/F ratio than both MATIC and OP: Fully Diluted P/F Ratio (Token Terminal) Another metric to consider is market cap to TVL ratio. This can be a good way to assess whether a chain is cheap based on DeFi activity. The larger the ratio, the more overvalued the chain token could conceivably be. However like the P/F ratio, ARB's Mcap/TVL ratio is also lower than peers: TVL Rank Network Active Users TVL Mcap/TVL 1 Ethereum 376,762 $29.2b 7.5 2 Tron 2,059,744 $5.24b 1.13 3 Binance 1,581,112 $5.04b 9.98 4 Arbitrum 184,854 $2.22b 0.73 5 Polygon 394,250 $1.07b 9.71 6 Optimism 53,921 $920.09m 0.78 7 Avalanche 25,543 $832.53m 6.78 Source: Defi Llama Arbitrum and Optimism both have very similar market cap to TVL ratios - each of which are significantly cheaper than peers. My guess as to why those valuations are so much lower than chains like Ethereum and Polygon are due to the fact that OP and ARB aren't necessary to pay gas fees, but that's admittedly just a guess. Something else to consider is smart contract chains aren't always focused on DeFi - this could create a large divergence in Mcap/TVL between two chains that have similar market valuations. For instance, Polygon and Arbitrum have close P/F ratios but very different Mcap/TVL ratios. In my view, this is likely because Polygon has a much larger footprint in NFTs than Arbitrum. Regardless, market cap to TVL is another instance of ARB actually looking pretty cheap compared to peer chains if you care about such metrics. Summary ARB is a bit like a tech stock that pays no dividend. If you can get past the idea that the token doesn't have much utility to the average user, it may be one of the better bets in the crypto space if you view it as a legitimate proxy on the success of the Arbitrum network. I take the view that Ethereum is going to be a long term winner in this industry and chains that help on-board users to that ecosystem will do very well provided they aren't cannibalized by any future scaling initiatives at the base layer. Arbitrum fits that thesis as a network, but the token itself needs better utility for me to personally buy it as a long-term investment. Now that the airdrop has come and gone, prospective buyers and holders should keep an eye on the activity level on the network.",NEUTRAL,MATIC | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | MATIC | ARB | AIRDROP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4591072-arbitrum-airdrop-strong-network-metrics-weak-token-economics?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11197976.jpeg

According to a press release, the four works were ""partially acquired"" from well-known art collectors, including Jane Holzer. The collection will include prints of some of Warhol's most famous works – including ""Marilyn"" (1967), ""Double Mickey"" (1981), ""Mick Jagger"" (1975), and ""Rebel Without a Cause (James Dean)"" (1985) – and will be limited to 1,000 tokenized lots each.  Dave Hendricks, CEO and co-founder of digital asset management tool Vertalo, told CoinDesk that Freeport will utilize Vertalo to tokenize the artworks so they can be bought and sold on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The platform cleared a regulatory hurdle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, allowing it to fractionalize shares of fine artworks in the form of security tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.  The collection plans to launch in May, though interested collectors can join the waitlist now. According to the website, the starting price for each tokenized lot will vary from $250 to $860.  ""As more and more value moves on-chain, fractionalized art is increasingly being sought after by a younger, yet less financially flexible, class of investors,"" said Colin Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Freeport. ""Our platform goes far beyond just fractionalizing shares of fine art into security tokens – we've built a fullyvimmersive and interactive platform hosting an art-centric community and redefining the ownership experience surrounding fractionalized art.""

USDC token net outflows have surpassed $10 billion since March 10, when regulators shuttered key reserve banking partner Silicon Valley Bank. U.S. payments firm Circle has weathered SVB’s collapse, and USDC has re-established the dollar price peg it lost in the immediate aftermath, but the token has still dropped 23% from its one-time $43 billion market capitalization, according to crypto price tracker CoinGecko.  USDC’s plunge comes as the stablecoin sector has been severely tested by banking sector uncertainties and increasing regulatory scrutiny. Binance’s BUSD token has also plummeted, among other stablecoins.  USDC remains the second-largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of $33 billion. Circle backs the token’s value with short-term government bonds administered by investment management giant BlackRock and cash reserves at various U.S. banks. After failures in the banking system, Circle has moved ""substantially all"" the cash to BNY Mellon, one of the world's largest custodian bank, keeping ""limited funds"" at other partners, according to the firm.  Read more: What's the Point of Stablecoins? The Reasons, Risks and Types to Know  Outflows surged starting March 10 as SVB imploded, locking $3.3 billion of cash reserve deposit in its vaults for days until government intervention. The event tossed the stablecoin market into turmoil as USDC and smaller stablecoins lost their price peg temporarily, and also highlighted how fiat-backed stablecoins rely on the soundness of traditional financial systems.  Over the past week, investors have redeemed $1.5 billion more USDC than new issuance, including bankrupt crypto broker Voyager, which redeemed $150 million on Tuesday. As USDC pegs its price at $1, a decreased token supply means investors have exchanged USDC tokens for U.S. dollars. The result is net outflows.  “USDC has survived the battle, but it remains unclear whether it will win the war,” digital asset brokerage Enigma Securities wrote earlier this month in a report.  Tether’s rising dominance  Most investors seem to have fled to Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin in the market, boosting its dominance to its highest level since May 2021.  USDT is a key piece of infrastructure of the crypto ecosystem and widely used for facilitating trading on exchanges. Its issuer, Tether, has faced scrutiny over its reserve assets and lack of transparency for years, but those issues appear to have recently become a lesser concern among investors.  The $132 billion stablecoin market has been in the middle of a major reshuffling since February when New York regulators told stablecoin issuer Paxos to stop minting Binance USD (BUSD), the third-largest stablecoin. BUSD’s supply has tumbled below $8 billion from $16 billion in early February.  USDT took advantage of BUSD’s retreat and USDC’s slump, CryptoCompare highlighted in its March market report.  Since March 10, USDT’s market capitalization has grown some $8 billion to $79.5 billion and it holds a 60% market share among stablecoins, according to DefiLlama. The last time USDT had such a large share was in May 2021.  “Ironically, the players who have had the strongest position with U.S. regulation and U.S. banking system integration, are considered ‘unsafe,’ with fears that assets could be stranded,” Circle Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire tweeted last week. “Market participants are shifting into platforms with no oversight, totally opaque bank and risk exposures, and histories of lax financial risk and integrity controls.”  Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Tether, said in a CNBC interview that USDT has around $1.6 billion of excess reserves and the stablecoin issuer was on track to book a $700 million profit in the first quarter of the year.  Another stablecoin, trueUSD (TUSD), has gained prominence thanks to Binance touting TUSD as one of the alternatives to BUSD and expanded trading with the token. TUSD’s market cap has grown to $2 billion from below $1 billion, making it the fifth largest stablecoin.

But depending on how one stakes their ether (ETH), they might not be able to withdraw those rewards immediately.  On Ethereum, there are different ways to stake your ETH – directly as a validator or via a staking service.  Before participating in the block validation process, validators agreed to lock up 32 ETH (currently worth about $58,000) into the Beacon Chain.  But not everyone has 32 ETH lying around, so staking services or decentralized staking pools sprung up, allowing users to stake any amount they liked into that service or pool, and that service or protocol would then pool it together with other stakers’ ETH and lock it into the chain.  Shapella will automatically unlock the ETH rewards for validators.  But in the case of service providers or staking pools, it will be up to them to determine when to release the rewards.  Read more: Ethereum’s Shanghai Hard Fork Now Has Official Target Date  If you are a solo staker or run your own validator:  There are two ways in which you can access staked ETH withdrawals: partial withdrawals and full withdrawals.  Partial withdrawals are the excess profits one has after 32 ETH (or earned rewards). These rewards can be withdrawn immediately, and your validators will continue to add blocks to the Beacon Chain.  If you are running your own validator, you must migrate your validator to include a 0x01 withdrawal credential. If you don’t install that withdrawal credential, partial withdrawals won’t happen automatically.  Even though partial withdrawals will be accessible immediately, getting those rewards will also depend on how many withdrawal requests need to be processed. Only 16 partial withdrawal requests can be put into a single slot (which happens every 12 seconds). Depending on how many requests will occur once Shanghai is live, the queue could take hours.  Full withdrawals, on the other hand, are when you remove the entire balance, including the 32 ETH, from the blockchain. This means that your validator will stop participating in the block validation process. Full withdrawals won’t happen automatically because the validator needs to send a message to the blockchain to add itself to the exit queue. This takes time and will be released gradually.  Read more: Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade Will Not Crash Ether Price, Analysts Say  If you are with a decentralized pool or staking service:  Those who have their ETH staked with a staking service or with a decentralized pool need to check with their providers on what the timeline is for staked ETH withdrawals.  Coinbase, which runs a staking service, said earlier this month it will process withdrawal requests about 24 hours after Shapella is complete. “All unstaking requests are processed on-chain, and we’ll pass the unstaked funds and staking rewards to you once released by the Ethereum protocol,” Coinbase said in a tweet.  Lido, the largest liquid staking protocol, shared that its users who hold stETH won’t be able to retrieve their ETH until the protocol goes through an upgrade in mid-May. The reason for the timeline Lido gave is so the protocol can go through the proper security checks.  Rocketpool, another decentralized staking protocol, disclosed that users can redeem their withdrawals following the protocol goes through their ""Atlas"" upgrade, though no specific date for this upgrade have been given yet.  So if you are hoping to cash in on any rewards from your staked ETH, make sure to check with your providers when that will happen because it may not occur on April 12. And if you are running your own validator, make sure to install the correct withdrawal credentials.

Trading volume is akin to foot traffic in a stairwell, except the movement describes prices, not people.  With buyers moving in one direction and sellers in another, when multiple market participants meet at an agreed price, movement in the stairwell slows.  As market participants move steadily up and down the stairwell in search of a party who agrees to their price, movement on the stairwell is faster.  The same metaphor holds true for total volume. Less volume can lead to rapid movement up and down, while more volume tends toward more orderly price action.  The Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) tool shows trading volumes at various price levels. When activity is higher, “high-volume nodes” are formed, indicating areas of significant price agreement and often leading to relatively flat trading ranges.  Bitcoin is currently trading in a “low-volume node” which can partly explain the seesaw movement in prices over recent days.  When there is less agreement among market participants, prices move more erratically. This is especially true when overall trading volume is lower.  Bitcoin trading volume has fallen below its 20-day moving average for the eighth consecutive day. Prices have traded in a 9% range over that time period, with five days lower and three higher. Wednesday’s 4% gain follows near zero movement the day prior.  Liquidity has slowed for bitcoin as well in recent days.  Bitcoin Illiquid Supply, a Glassnode metric identifying the total supply of BTC held by “illiquid entities,” has risen to all-time highs as of March 28. Liquidity measures the extent to which an entity spends the BTC that it receives by calculating the ratio of BTC outflows vs inflows. Ranging from 0 to 1, higher figures indicate an entity that buys and sells BTC on a regular basis, while figures close to 0 indicate an entity prone to never sell bitcoin.  With the decline in recent volumes, an increase in illiquidity, and a lack of price agreement at current levels, crypto investors may continue to see prices move erratically in search of the next price level.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/29/low-trading-volumes-diminishing-liquidity-spur-bitcoin-price-volatility,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b946a68ef5febdd99048e3432c37c211689980c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Data from crypto stats website DefiLlama showed a spike in Trader Joe’s trading volume over the same time period. The jump in activity comes as the price of Trader Joe’s governance token, JOE, booms. It’s up 11% in the past 24 hours and 58% over the past week, per CoinGecko. At press time it was worth 57 cents.  Key metrics began booming right after Trader Joe launched a liquidity incentives program to boost deposits of popular tokens for trading, particularly Arbitrum’s newly airdropped ARB. Users who loaned ARB, ether (ETH) and USD coin (USDC) to Trader Joe’s pools got a share of 300,000 JOE tokens. The incentives program ends April 6.  Trader Joe’s recent success on Arbitrum has nearly eclipsed its trading volume on Avalanche, the DEX’s original home. Both venues have seen just under $100 million in tokens traded since March 26.

42421303,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoKr,1680120571,That Binance Suit Sure Seems Bigger Than Just a CFTC Case,"Between Coinbase, Binance, Justin Sun, Do Kwon and Custodia, there has been just so much news over the last week. And that’s largely just the U.S. But Binance is the most interesting, not only for what happened (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued it), but also for what didn’t (the Department of Justice hasn’t filed anything). Plus, the CFTC’s Tech Advisory Committee met last Wednesday.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Binance Gets Sued  The narrative  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance, the exchange’s founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and a couple other entities on Monday on charges of failing to register as a “futures commission merchant” while offering unregistered crypto derivatives options to U.S. customers.  Why it matters  The allegations are pretty striking, with details suggesting the company went out of its way to try to bypass U.S. regulations. CFTC Chief Counsel Gretchen Lowe described Binance’s actions as “willful evasion of U.S. law.” These are allegations that have yet to be proven in a court of law. In a statement Monday night, Zhao said the allegations are “an incomplete recitation of facts.”  Breaking it down  The question remains: Is this actually a big deal for Binance? I’m going to speculate wildly, so consider this fair warning.  I think the answer is yes. Not for the CFTC charges themselves – the CFTC can impose monetary fines and bar Zhao from being an officer at a futures commission merchant in future but that assumes Zhao has any interest in being an officer to begin with.  The allegations in the CFTC’s complaint have strong implications for criminal and sanctions-related issues.  Some of the claims in the lawsuit, such as allegations that the exchange was aware that people from sanctioned entities such as Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, were trading on the platform but didn’t see it as a big deal, would probably trigger both Department of Justice and the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control laws.  “[Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer Samuel] Lim explained to a colleague that terrorists usually send ‘small sums’ as ‘large sums constitute money laundering,” the filing said. “Lim’s colleague replied: ‘can barely buy an AK47 with 600 bucks.’ And with regard to certain Binance customers, including customers from Russia, Lim acknowledged in a February 2020 chat: ‘Like come on. They are here for crime.’ Binance’s [money laundering reporting officer] agreed that ‘we see the bad, but we close 2 eyes.’”  The CFTC complaint emphasized that Binance uses U.S. services to operate, pointing to Google Suite, Webex, WeWork and Amazon Web Services as examples.  “Among the services Binance purchases from Amazon Web Services that are provided to Binance in the United States is ‘AWS CloudFront,’ which according to Amazon Web Services is a ‘Global content delivery network,’” the filing said.  We’ve known for a while now that Binance used AWS servers in Japan after an outage affected the exchange a few years ago.  The final piece of this puzzle: We can look at how the Department of Justice has gone after companies and websites accused of distributing ransomware or offering “cyberattack-for-hire services” or even whatever the heck this was.  In those instances, the U.S. government was able to seize the domains and put up a large banner announcing that. The services themselves were inaccessible to their users.  All this is to say that if the U.S. really thought Binance was a criminal enterprise, it already has the tools it needs to shut down the exchange.  Now to be clear, I’m told there's nothing imminent coming from the Justice Department or Office of Foreign Asset Controls about Binance. But as we’ve seen with Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon and FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, sometimes the DOJ will have a sealed indictment that it won’t publish until the subject is arrested, and so we may now just be in a holding pattern.  Stories you may have missed  Do Kwon Arrested in Montenegro: Interior Minister: Do Kwon, creator of the Terra network and UST stablecoin, was arrested in Montenegro last week after he tried to fly out of the country with a falsified passport, Interior Minister Filip Adzic said.  Do Kwon Now Faces Criminal Fraud Charges From U.S. Prosecutors: After Kwon was arrested in Montenegro, the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled a litany of charges against him.  Tron Founder Justin Sun Sued by SEC on Securities, Market Manipulation Charges: So true story: I picked someone up from JFK International Airport in New York over the weekend, and on my way out, I saw a large electronic billboard with a Tron ad that featured founder Justin Sun on it. Anyways, he’s facing civil charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging he engaged in market manipulation of unregistered securities (TRX and BTT), among other things.  SEC Warns Coinbase It's Pursuing Enforcement Action Over Securities Violations: Coinbase received a Wells Notice from the SEC, alleging that certain listed tokens, its staking program and other products may all violate federal securities laws.  Crypto’s Unfulfilled Dreams Get a Tailwind From U.S. Crackdown on Binance, Coinbase: CoinDesk’s Helene Braun took a look at what recent regulatory actions might mean for decentralized exchanges.  EU Lawmakers to Vote on Limited Ban on Self-Hosted Crypto Payments: European Union lawmakers planned to vote on a possible ban on crypto transfers of more than 1,000 euros ($1,084) from self-hosted wallets, CoinDesk’s Jack Schickler reported. Transfers where the parties’ identities can be verified or between two private individuals would be allowed. Lawmakers voted in favor of the bill a day later.  Federal Reserve Says Custodia’s Plans Would Endanger Itself and the Crypto Industry: This was an absolutely rough report from the Federal Reserve Board on why it rejected Custodia Bank’s application for Fed membership. Custodia published a response a few days later.  Regulatory clarity in action  Last week, the CFTC’s Technology Advisory Committee met for the first time under Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero, Chairwoman Carole House and Vice Chairman Ari Redbord.  “We look forward to taking a deep dive on the rapidly growing decentralized-finance (DeFi) ecosystem,” Goldsmith Romero said during her opening remarks. “As regulators and Congress make policy decisions related to DeFi, it is important to have a common foundation and understanding how DeFi works and how decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other DeFi protocols [work].”  This foundation could be as basic as understanding what the indicators of decentralization are, she added, touching on other issues like the role of artificial intelligence in financial markets, digital identity and possible illicit activities in the digital sector.  The meeting was divided into presentations by various members interspersed by free-flowing discussions about issues surrounding regulatory questions in crypto (and other technology topics like artificial intelligence).  Different perspectives were all given equal weight by the different members of the committee, Goldsmith Romero told CoinDesk after the meeting ended, pointing to one participant who asked questions about the value crypto products brought the financial sector in a room full of crypto executives and researchers.  “People were very willing to contribute,” she said.  House said much of the discussion circled around the concept of accountability, which is at the heart of many of the topics discussed, whether that is privacy or decentralized finance or other issues.  “There has to be accountability, both for the regulated activity … but also for the non-financial activity that occurs,” she said.  Goldsmith Romero expressed a similar view during her opening remarks, saying there is discussion about where accountability rests within a DeFi project, whether it’s the code underpinning a smart contract, the organization responsible for bringing the code into the world, an evolving governance structure or something in between.  The forum saw a nuanced discussion about how different parties could achieve confidence in the technology around digital assets and other issues while still ensuring compliance with the law, Goldsmith Romero said after the meeting ended. “I’m glad to have that in this forum.”  Wherefore art thou Signature  There was much ado made the other week about New York Community Bancorp’s (NYCB) Flagstar Bank acquiring Signature Bank’s non-crypto deposits last Monday, leaving about $4 billion worth of deposits in the lurch. Coming on the heels of a Reuters report that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) would force any potential buyer of Signature to give up the crypto business (a report the FDIC denied), there was a growing wave of opinion that this was further evidence that bank regulators were trying to actively boot crypto off the banking system. As always, though, it’s possible things are a bit less conspiratorial than the public narrative seems.  Joshua Ashley Klayman, head of blockchain and digital assets at law firm Linklaters, pointed to 2021 guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of the federal bank regulators, that told banks that they need permission before they can get into crypto-related activities. The regulator has already barred one new conditional bank from engaging with crypto when it approved SoFi in 2022, she said.  “It shouldn’t be a surprise that, as any bidding bank presumably would need OCC approval, that, if they didn’t already have OCC approval to engage in digital asset activities, they weren’t reasonably going to be able to obtain it over a weekend, even if they wanted to start doing crypto,” Klayman said.  The OCC indeed published a notice signing off on the Flagstar acquisition.  Klayman noted that “we don’t know if Flagstar even wanted to have a crypto business, or if it even had the capability to support one. But it almost certainly didn’t have the time to obtain regulatory approval to start one by Monday.”  Only 136 FDIC-insured banks in the U.S. even offer any kind of crypto activities or plan to, according to an FDIC Inspector General report from February. That’s out of 4,706 total FDIC-insured banks (as of the end of 2022).  The FDIC is now giving the remaining Signature Bridge Bank depositors until April 5 to withdraw their funds, or the regulator will send a check to the listed address. It’s also still trying to sell the Signet platform, a payments platform that was popular with Signature’s crypto customers.  This past weekend, the FDIC said that First Citizens Bank will acquire the deposits from Silicon Valley Bank. One detail that struck me: When the FDIC announced Flagstar’s takeover of Signature deposits, it explicitly said that Signature Bridge Bank depositors “other than cash depositors related to the digital-asset banking businesses, will automatically become depositors of” Flagstar.  No such language existed in the announcement of First Citizens’ takeover of SVB deposits. I reached out to the FDIC and First Citizens to confirm just what this meant. The FDIC referred me to First Citizens, which hasn’t responded.

42387802,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtXAd,1680119926,The Metaverse Is Facing a ‘Cooldown Moment’ Amid Crypto Winter,"After being hot for a good part of last year, the metaverse is, at least for now, facing a “cooldown moment,” said Cathy Hackl, chief metaverse officer at innovation and design consultancy Journey and a speaker at Consensus 2023.  “I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing,” Hackl told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday about those who got into the hype of the metaverse but have since left.  “A lot of us are continuing to build,” she said. The metaverse is a longer-term vision and one that she said is “going to be the future of the internet.” That’s despite brands deciding the metaverse is not for them. Most recently Disney shuttered its metaverse team as part of a company-wide contraction.  Catwalk in the metaverse  On Tuesday, the second annual Metaverse Fashion Week (MFW) kicked off. Unlike last year’s event, which took place only in Decentraland, this year’s event is a multi-platform affair. Spatial, a metaverse platform, and Over, an augmented reality (AR) platform that combines the use of virtual assets with the physical world, are among the collaborators.  Luxury brands including Dolce & Gabbana, Balmain and Tommy Hilfiger are also participating in the virtual four-day event, which Hackl said is making room for “opportunities to create virtual couture.”  She said the event opens the door for brands and participants to see forthcoming changes in culture and fashion.  But barriers persist, she said, adding that the need to have a virtual wallet may be keeping some users from getting the full experience. Additional stress points, including servers crashing, are among the technical issues developers are trying to iron out.  “If we see this next year, going into broader [platforms] like Roblox … or into Fortnite or some of these more mass market platforms, it’ll be more accessible,” Hackl said.

42387796,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtWiZ,1680119439,Market Maker DWF Labs Emerges as Top Crypto Investor,"Investment in crypto companies, which poured in at a record pace during the 2021 bull market, slowed to a near stop as the bear market began and headline-grabbing scandals rocked the industry.  However, along with a few feisty venture capital firms, market maker DWF Labs, which has operated in the crypto space since 2018, has stepped in with a steady wave of investments.  “We believe that this bearish market – this turbulent market – is the best time to join the investment space,” DWF Labs managing partner Andrei Grachev told CoinDesk in an interview. “We accumulated enough funds from our profits to invest in projects now.”  DWF Labs has offices in Singapore, Switzerland, the British Virgin Islands, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea and Hong Kong. The firm is an affiliate of Digital Wave Finance (DWF), a global crypto trading player that trades in spot and derivatives markets on over 40 top exchanges.  As an investor, DWF Labs prefers to participate through token purchases and favors infrastructure projects, including layer one and layer two developments. The firm is also interested in artificial intelligence (AI)-based projects and gamified finance (GameFi). DWF has recently backed a $40 million round for “alternative internet” provider Tomi, a $20 million fundraise for derivatives trading platform Synthetix and a new $40 million raise for AI-focused crypto protocol Fetch.ai, to name a few.  Infrastructure projects and consumer-facing systems that make crypto more accessible for mass adoption are key areas during the bear market, said Grachev.  Market risks  Market makers are trading firms that use their own money to make bets on tokens and take the opposite position on trades on exchanges, enabling investors to enter or exit the market quickly. The collapse of centralized exchange FTX – thanks to liquidity issues first revealed in a CoinDesk report – likely removed smaller market makers that were too exposed. Exposure to centralized exchanges is part of market making, as decentralized finance (DeFi) tends to offer less flexibility, said Grachev.  U.S. regulators are a continuing threat to the crypto industry and centralized exchanges. In the latest salvo, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued dominant crypto exchange Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products, breaking federal law.  “It seems that the crypto market is going to be divided into the U.S. market and then outside the U.S.,” Grachev said. “We are mostly concentrated on Asian markets and not on U.S. exchanges. We do trading on U.S. exchanges but no market making. It’s a huge risk. I’m pretty sure that most of the market makers will follow this way.”  Read more: ORBS Token Rises 15% After DWF Labs Invests $10M  CORRECTION (March 30, 18:24 UTC): Corrects date of DWF's first work in the crypto space.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/29/market-maker-dwf-labs-emerges-as-top-crypto-investor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33c219a856c40da24494292a16bf523e4ff02739-1080x608.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""We're an American company,"" based in California, incorporated in Delaware and with a BitLicense from New York, Grewal said. ""We're not going anywhere.""  However, that hasn't stopped Coinbase from looking at other countries where ""regulators are looking to promote this technology and promote opportunities for the crypto economy in ways that doesn't seem to be happening right now here in the U.S.""  Binance, which claims to have no home country, is in a different situation.  On Monday, the CFTC filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Binance for violating U.S. law by allegedly selling unregistered derivatives products and helping its U.S.-based customers evade compliance controls through the use of virtual private networks (VPN).  Grewal said what's most striking about the CFTC’s complaint is it “specifically called out a number of digital assets as commodities.” Those same assets are being “labeled or suggested as securities” by the SEC and others, he said.  The CFTC “has undertaken a great effort to understand what's been happening with Binance and to take action where it sees an issue,” he said.  Whether the CFTC or SEC has jurisdiction over digital assets only adds more confusion for the crypto industry trying to operate in the U.S., Grewal said. He added the situation highlights how regulators can't seem to agree on a regulatory framework for crypto.  “We need sensible rules here to define these terms reasonably and to provide everyone in the crypto economy, including investors and consumers, with certainty and clarity in making their decisions,” Grewal said.

42387808,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtXch,1680117545,Top U.S. Treasury Official Says Crypto Had No ‘Direct Role’ In Bank Failures,"Nellie Liang, the U.S. Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, doesn’t believe the digital assets sector should be blamed for the runs on Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank that led to their quick demise earlier this month.  ""I don't believe that crypto played a direct role in either of the failures,"" Liang said during a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.  When asked whether digital assets were an indirect factor, she noted that Signature was particularly active in the sector, though she didn’t provide further details. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) Chairman Martin Gruenberg had earlier told the lawmakers that about a fifth of Singature’s deposit base was tied to crypto customers at the end of 2022.  But that relationship between the crypto industry and two of its one-time favorite banks has otherwise drawn scant attention from members of the Senate and House of Representatives over two days of hearings examining the failures of Silicon Valley and Signature.  The two regional lenders – and a smaller institution, Silvergate Bank, that arguably sparked the recent blaze that spread through U.S. banking – took business risks that undermined their resilience, according to their regulators. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr said the trouble with SVB, for instance, was rooted in “classic interest rate risk management.”  To be sure, the banks held tremendous sums of uninsured deposits from crypto companies, and the volatility from the industry – along with its rapid withdrawal of funds as the digital assets sector struggled with recent hardships – were part of the unprecedented rapid run on the banks.  However, lawmakers showed little interest in focusing on crypto questions in a long two days of congressional hearings. The hearings revealed the primary concerns of regulators and lawmakers were on problems in the banks’ management and potential failures in supervision by the Fed and FDIC. Discussion about potential new regulatory legislation targeted questions over the banking industry’s capital and liquidity cushions, not bills that might deal with crypto oversight.  Whatever the major causes of failure at the banks, though, the sudden absence of three of the leading crypto-friendly banks has left many virtual-assets customers in the lurch. On Tuesday, for example, the FDIC said it’s still wrestling with some $4 billion in crypto-tied deposits from Signature, and it’s advising the bank’s former customers they have to move their funds out by April 5 or receive them in a check.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/29/top-us-treasury-official-says-crypto-had-no-direct-role-in-bank-failures,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/681353401b1b134fc7f0c3288be065b47e1323f9-3670x2064.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421286,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXno5N,1680109992,The Questions That Linger After Do Kwon’s Arrest,"Perhaps the biggest challenge of writing about cryptocurrency is that everything is happening all the time and it’s all some mix of important, fascinating and dramatic. Case in point: The past two weeks have been so dominated by the ongoing banking crisis and crypto crackdown that I haven’t had time to luxuriate in some of the best news in recent memory – the arrest of Terra blockchain co-founder and alleged fraudster Do Kwon in Montenegro last week.  The collapse of Do Kwon’s Terra blockchain in May, remember, was the proximate catalyst for 2022’s crypto rout, helping destabilize crypto lender Celsius Network and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital in particular. If you want an entertaining recap of the story so far, check out our podcast series “Lunacy: The Rise and Fall of Do Kwon.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Those charges, far more than usual, contained major revelations about Kwon’s activities. With his arrest, we are, I hope, on the way to learning even more.  There are still a few questions about Do Kwon that are badly in need of answers.  Why was Do Kwon in Serbia?  This is currently the most intriguing element of Do Kwon’s arrest. South Korean police reported in December they believed Kwon had fled to Serbia; he was ultimately arrested in next-door Montenegro. These are achingly beautiful countries, both high on my personal wish-list of vacation destinations – but it’s safe to assume Do Kwon had deeper motives.  In part, the choice may have been driven by simple geography. Do and Terraform Labs Chief Financial Officer Han Chang-Joon were reportedly arrested while trying to board a private jet that would have taken them to Dubai. Dubai is a popular hideout for wealthy fugitives, and the Balkans are more or less on the way there from Singapore.  See also: Do Kwon Now Faces Criminal Fraud Charges  But there is another hypothetical factor. The SEC alleged in its February civil charges that Do Kwon was able to sell roughly $100 million worth of bitcoin allegedly stolen from the wreckage of his project by using a Swiss bank. Do Kwon may have turned to organized crime figures for help with that effort or for protection from law enforcement, and the Balkans are a hotbed for Mafia-linked crypto fraud. That could be another explanation for his flight to Serbia.  Who gets to prosecute him?  Literally hours after Kwon was arrested in Montenegro, U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against him. That implies these had been in the works, but officials rushed to get them on the record so they could seek Do Kwon’s extradition to the U.S.  As former SEC enforcement officer Lisa Brancaga recently explained on CoinDesk TV, the U.S. has a claim to jurisdiction because Do Kwon targeted U.S. investors. Meanwhile, he has also been charged with fraud in his native South Korea.  That means the two nations will have to negotiate, or perhaps compete, to see who gets first crack at him. (Though both will likely have to wait until he and his compatriot are tried in Montenegro for trying to use fake passports.) Speaking in strictly moral terms, it seems right to let South Korea go after its (alleged) homegrown con man first. For one thing, while Terraform Labs targeted Americans, it seems that a far higher proportion of South Koreans were harmed by the scheme.  There is also much more potential for a thorough prosecution there, given Do Kwon’s apparent connection to elite networks in South Korea via his Terra co-founder Daniel Shin, a local tech “serial entrepreneur.” However, U.S. prosecutors might use that very factor to argue for their own claim: Do Kwon’s elite connections in South Korea might mean he has friends who can interfere with his trial.  Why were the money men so easy to trick?  This question may or may not be answered by a Do Kwon trial, but it is particularly galling: Were the investors who boosted Do Kwon really so stupid that they believed his shtick? Or was something else going on?  As we discuss in depth in our four-episode narrative podcast “Lunacy,” the terraUSD algorithmic stablecoin didn’t make any sense on paper, even leaving aside the alleged fraud that was uncovered later. This forces us to wonder whether investors, including investors specializing in crypto and seemingly well-versed in finance, simply made extremely bad bets on the Terra system or had other, less-transparent motives. That question might be most embarrassing for Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital, who notoriously got a LUNA tattoo.  But the SEC’s recent charges highlight one counterparty at risk of more than just embarrassment. The agency alleges that a U.S.-based trading firm was involved in a secret May 2021 bailout when the terraUSD token lost its dollar peg. The incident, the SEC says, was later used to support the fraudulent claim that the terraUSD token was self-balancing. That means it could be considered not merely a financial investment but an act in furtherance of fraud.  See also: It's Not Just Fraud That Chilled Crypto Regulation | Opinion  CoinDesk reporting has confirmed this entity was Chicago-based Jump Crypto. It is unclear why Jump has not faced legal fallout for what an ambitious prosecutor could easily characterize as aiding and abetting fraud – particularly when the firm reportedly reaped $1.28 billion in profits from its participation.  What happens to Terra? What about Terra 2.0?  Everything Do Kwon has ever touched is fundamentally worthless. I strongly recommend getting out of any financial or professional entanglements with these projects.  If you don't believe it or don't get it, I’ve already spent a year trying to convince you.

42421297,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoHl,1680108273,The Short-Sightedness of Run-Amok Regulators,"Are regulators trying to kill crypto by forbidding banks from doing business with crypto companies? Sure looks that way.  And if they are, the nation’s federal and state regulators are doing a huge disservice to investors, hindering American innovation and inflicting long-term damage on the U.S economy. Anyone who thinks this is mere conspiracy theory should take a closer look at what regulators have been doing lately. In January, the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint statement discouraging banks from accepting deposits from crypto companies – taking action without the legally required public input.  When banks continued to do business with crypto companies, the regulators made their point by shutting down Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). And in case the message wasn’t clear, when the FDIC turned over Signature Bank’s $38.4 billion of deposits to Flagstar Bank, Signature’s $4 billion of deposits held in their digital assets businesses were excluded.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Businesses involved with digital assets are engaged in legal activities. Can someone explain to me why the FDIC would prohibit Flagstar Bank from accepting the payroll account of a company that’s operating legally?  Former Congressman Barney Frank, a driving force behind the Dodd-Frank Act, served on Signature’s board and has publicly complained that regulators shut down Signature because it was serving crypto companies. “Regulators wanted to send a very strong anti-crypto message. We became the poster boy because there was no insolvency based on the bank's fundamentals,” he told CNBC.  A company that can’t open a bank account can’t be in business. But regulators are foolish to think they can kill crypto by preventing crypto companies from operating. No matter what U.S. regulators do, these companies will indeed operate – simply by moving their operations to other countries.  That’s what bitcoin miners did after China banned crypto. Instead of crushing the mining operations, China had the mere effect of chasing the miners elsewhere – mostly to the U.S., where a dozen states have welcomed them. Crypto creates high-paying, skilled jobs and that’s precisely what forward-thinking governors want. But if these companies now can’t maintain bank accounts, they’ll have no choice but to relocate once again. Investors will have to follow them.  That would harm American innovation, our economy and U.S. investors. Prohibition didn’t stop people from drinking alcohol a century ago; it just forced them into speakeasies where they were overcharged for liquor that too often got them sick. Overregulating crypto would have the same impact: Trying to take the freedom to choose from American customers will simply chase them to what Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the third-highest-ranking member of the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, warns are “offshore, unregulated, opaque and unsafe markets.”  Indeed, banks around the world are licking their chops at the prospect of winning big new bank accounts from crypto companies seeking a home. Digital Currency Group (the parent company of CoinDesk) says lots of banks overseas are still happy to do business with crypto companies.  Think back to when President George W. Bush banned stem-cell research in the U.S. That didn’t kill the science, it just pushed American scientists to other countries, including South Korea and Israel. The science has flourished but we lost the lead in innovation in that sector.  So, if I may speak to U.S. regulators on behalf of the crypto community (no one has asked me to), I’ll channel Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry character and say, “Go ahead, make my day.” When regulators start shutting down banks because they don’t like what banks are doing – even though what banks are doing is perfectly legal – all they’re doing is scaring all bank customers everywhere that banks aren’t safe. Do regulators really think that’s a smart idea?  The most ironic element of this entire situation is the message regulators are sending is that regional banks aren’t safe. Move your money to the national too-big-to-fail banks. Well, since 2000, the nation’s top 25 banks have paid a combined $350 billion in fines – for violations including mortgage abuses, toxic securities abuses, investor protection violations, banking violations, consumer protection violations and anti-money laundering deficiencies.  The regulators can’t shut down all these banks because there wouldn’t be any more U.S. banking system. There’s $20 trillion in deposits at U.S. banks, and half of that money is held by the top 25 banks. So the regulators have been shutting down regional banks like Silvergate, SVB and Signature, and chasing people into those big banks – the very place depositors are most likely to get scammed by abusive sales practices, high fees, poor disclosures and lousy service.  The short-sightedness of our nation’s banking regulators is astonishing. No wonder so many bank customers and investors have been buying bitcoin (BTC) since Silvergate was shut down. BTC is up 70% this year, while the S&P 500 is close to unchanged. Bank depositors now realize they might awake to discover their accounts are gone, with no notice. That won’t happen to a bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) wallet. With a bank, you have to wait for the branch to open – if it opens – on Monday. With crypto, your money is available to you 24/7.  Have the Fed, FDIC and OCC actually made bitcoin safer than banks? It’s hard to say that with a straight face, but admit it: You’re actually debating that question in your head. It’s shocking that the question has even come up.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,Ric Edelman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/29/the-short-sightedness-of-run-amok-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8c92843dfe77979c760115b5f86c8be10189cae1-1941x1092.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tune in next week to find out …”  To those on the outside looking in, the industry was getting pummeled. After months of prices trending downward, as the market felt like it was getting its sea legs back, Sam Bankman-Fried swooped in with the FTX debacle for one last kick to the knees.  Pat Duffy is co-founder of The Giving Block, a Shift4 company. He and his co-founder were also highlighted on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in 2022 in the area of Social Impact for their work at The Giving Block.  Uncertainty like this is nothing new for crypto. We all know the cycle. Every few years, crypto is declared dead as prices drop. Traditional players stop paying attention and a silent growth phase begins as more investors and more developers enter the ecosystem.  We’re in such a phase now. But there’s one area of the crypto ecosystem that continues to grow strongly, despite the ups and downs in asset prices: philanthropy.  Last year, more nonprofits joined The Giving Block, the crypto philanthropy platform I co-founded with Alex Wilson in 2018, than ever before. More, in fact, than the record we set during the 2021 bull cycle. Through rain, sleet and SBF, nonprofits continue to march uphill to fundraise crypto.  The average nonprofit on our platform raised $26,000 soliciting crypto gifts in 2022, with some raising millions of dollars.  Motivated by the powerful tax incentive to choose crypto over cash, donors continued to reward the nonprofits that marketed their crypto options to their supporters. For the second year straight, more Google searches contained “donate crypto” than “donate stocks” because a growing number of crypto users are getting wise to asset-giving strategies. Chalk it up to the digitally native user base, or the fact that crypto remains a top-performing asset of the decade. Whatever it is, more people are going online looking to give crypto than stocks.  Read more: Pat Duffy - Greed, Lies and FTX: Is Crypto a Force for Good or Evil?  Today, the nonprofit sector is one of the leading industries in crypto adoption; half of the Forbes Top 100 Charities are now fundraising via crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFT). With thousands of nonprofits now involved in Web3, crypto philanthropy not only weathered last year’s storm but thrived in it.  Based on the Crypto Philanthropy Adoption Index (CPAI), which compares the total in crypto donated via The Giving Block compared to the average price of bitcoin (BTC) over time, we can measure if changes in crypto giving are outperforming or underperforming the crypto market as a whole. Since we began tracking it in 2020, crypto philanthropy has outperformed crypto markets every year. In 2022, for example, crypto donors collectively gave $172 per every dollar in bitcoin’s market value, a 41% increase compared to 2021. Blending historical donation data from our platform with years of bitcoin price data, we’re also able to forecast crypto philanthropy’s growth over the next decade.  $10B in crypto donations to charities this decade  Most experts expect the crypto market cap to rise over time (although it’s roughly halved over the past 12 months). Given this expectation, it’s fair to assume that crypto philanthropy will grow as well. Taking the last three years of CPAI data, we were able to develop the first forecast for how crypto philanthropy will grow alongside the market.  Based on the last five years of bitcoin price data, charitable crypto giving is expected to drive $10 billion to nonprofits by November 2032, just on our platform alone. Today, that would mean cryptocurrency would account for about 2% of all U.S. charitable giving.  Below are other trends in crypto philanthropy that we’re watching.  Stablecoin donations reign supreme, for now  As we face another year of market uncertainty, we’ll continue to see stablecoins take donation volume market share, demonstrating the growing use of stable-value cryptocurrencies as payment methods. In 2022, USD coin (USDC) was the most donated crypto, clocking in at 44% of our donation volume. This was followed by ether (ETH) as the second-most donated cryptocurrency at 24% of donation volume and bitcoin in third place at 17% of donation volume.  Web3 philanthropy is driving the most awareness  In 2022, we continued to see NFT philanthropy and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) philanthropy grow, proving that you don’t need to just donate bitcoin to make a difference. We predict that we will continue to see the Web3 community come together during difficult times the way they did during the Ukraine humanitarian crisis in 2022 and the earthquake that devastated parts of Turkey and Syria earlier this year.  Crypto has become the norm among leading nonprofits  Almost half of Forbes’ list of “America’s 100 Top Charities of 2022” accept cryptocurrency donations, up from just 12 of them in 2019. Of those 49 crypto donor-friendly charities, 38 of them use The Giving Block as their crypto fundraising system, including four of the list’s top five biggest charities (Feeding America, United Way Worldwide, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and Direct Relief).  Tax literacy is bringing more crypto donors online  Motivated by the powerful tax incentive to choose crypto over cash (in short, like stock donations, direct donations of appreciated crypto aren’t subject to capital gains taxes and may also be deducted from the donor’s overall gross income), donors continued to reward the nonprofits that marketed their crypto options to their supporters. Chalk it up to the digitally native user base, or the fact that crypto remains a top-performing asset of the decade. Whatever it is, more people are going online looking to give crypto than stocks.  For as long as millions of people in the U.S. remain incentivized to give crypto over cash, crypto will continue being a force for good in the nonprofit industry. This trend is good for the planet, but the crypto industry could see tremendous opportunities to benefit as well.  Nonprofits are starving for partnerships from companies, projects and influencers in this industry. These are the relationships that put their brand in front of one of the most valuable donor demographics – crypto donors.  The world needs reasons to see the positive impact that crypto is having. As we pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off from the FTX collapse, regulators are making decisions that will determine what the growth of crypto looks like. We have a chance in 2023 to bring the largest crypto voices together with the largest voices in the charitable sector. If that happens a lot this year, nonprofits will be more ready to solve our world’s most pressing problems, and the world will be more ready for crypto.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Pat Duffy,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/29/crypto-philanthropy-giving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66148bfc00bdce7968c2eff89f3efbb75b458a33-5123x2882.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421304,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoMv,1680107038,Cryptos Gained in Q1 Despite Weakened Asset Class Perceptions,"It’s been an eventful start to 2023, with what feels like a full year of news crammed into just three months. Year-to-date cryptocurrency returns, similarly, have been much bigger than is typical for a single quarter:  Layer 1s  Bitcoin: 71%  Ether: 51%  Avalanche: 58%  Cardano: 57%  Solana: 112%  Algorand: 34%  Traditional finance (TradFi) stock indexes  S&P 500: 3.2%  Nasdaq Composite: 11%  Dow Jones Industrial Average: -2.1%  Crypto stocks  Coinbase (COIN): 71%  MicroStrategy (MSTR): 64%  Marathon Digital (MARA): 99%  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The top-performing digital assets (among those with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more) were the tokens associated with Stacks (STX), Aptos (APT) and Immutable X (IMX), which increased 443%, 268% and 213%, respectively. Among decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens with $100 million+ market caps, the top performers were Liquity’s LQTY, Trader Joe’s JOE and Injective Protocol’s INJ – which all surged at least 230%.  Bottom line: Digital assets have roundly beaten TradFi assets this quarter.  Those two worlds, in other words, have decoupled. This quarter, the correlation between bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 declined from 0.91 to 0.59, and got as low as 0.01 on March 22. (A correlation of 1 means the price of two things is moving in lockstep, while minus 1 means a perfectly inverse relationship. Zero means no link at all.) In other words, digital assets have behaved as the diversifying, uncorrelated asset that many investors crave.  What is amazing about that, though, is these gigantic returns have coincided with a dramatic worsening of perceptions about cryptocurrencies as the U.S. government cracks down on the industry. Instead of being viewed as another asset class that fits within an overall portfolio, crypto is often viewed as a problematic asset linked to fraud and market manipulation.  If you want some insight into the prevailing government/regulatory view of crypto assets, I would invite you to read Chapter 8 of the most recent “Economic Report of the President.” On one hand, the dedication of an entire 36-page chapter to cryptocurrencies highlights digital assets’ rapid ascent. On the other, the tone of the report shows the regulatory hurdles that may be ahead.  While acknowledging the innovation of blockchain technology, the report largely labeled cryptocurrencies as holding no fundamental value, offering no alternative to fiat currencies and existing for the purpose of speculation only. I would offer that this is an extremely U.S.-centric point of view for a global asset.  Residents of countries with sky-high inflation and less-credible central banks arguably place significant value on obtaining an asset with a fixed supply. And an asset with global value likely has value within the U.S. as well.  The main macroeconomic issue for investors (in crypto or otherwise) remains inflation, and that is likely to continue for the immediate future. M2 money supply (a preferred inflation gauge of mine) is down 1.7% from a year ago. It’s good to see it falling, but it remains 38% higher than pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. The Federal Open Market Committee has responded by raising interest rates at the most rapid rate in history in an attempt to quell the increase in prices.  A recent issue that caught my eye was the federal government balance sheet has actually increased by 2.6% this quarter – including a 5% rise over the last week – as the U.S. helps rescue banks. This runs in stark contrast to the Federal Reserve’s previously announced effort to shrink the size of the balance sheet. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the recent increase is temporary lending to banks and not intended to alter the stance of monetary policy.  This past quarter also saw BTC hit a few notable technical signals. It warrants taking a look at how they ultimately panned out.  “Golden Cross” (Feb. 18): The fabled “golden cross” occurs when the 50-period moving average of an asset crosses above its 200-day moving average, and is often interpreted as bullish. We’ve seen this occur seven times since 2015, with its most recent occurrence on Feb 18. Entering a long position on the cross has paid off for investors who have done so, as prices are up 17% since this most-recent occurrence.  10/100 moving average crossover (Jan. 14): Similar in every aspect to the “golden cross” but with lower time frames, the 10/100 cross is one I look at for two reasons. The first being that there are 16 occurrences since 2015 versus seven for the golden cross. The second being that if the signal is viable, it should help identify bullish moves faster. Historically, the results have been unexciting, with just a 3% average return after 30 days. Those numbers will improve after the Jan. 14 occurrence, though, as BTC is 36% higher since that date.  RSI below 30 (March 10): Another popular signal is when the relative strength index (RSI) of an asset falls below 30, indicating that it is “oversold.” This has occurred 108 times for BTC since 2015, with two of the occurrences taking place on March 9 and March 10. The subsequent average 30-day return over all instances has been a 7% increase. Bitcoin is up 40% since March 10.  All in all, it's been a good quarter for digital assets – in terms of performance, anyway. Those who bought and held in January are richer. It will be interesting to see what this next quarter brings, and if the underperformance in perception takes a turn for the better.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  NOW BINANCE: One by one, major crypto figures have run into trouble in the past few months. Now, it’s the biggest exchange’s turn. Binance got sued by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly letting Americans trade on its offshore exchange – which people in the U.S. aren’t supposed to be able to do. The CFTC specifically called out how Binance abetted trading by U.S.-based trading firms. These are the kinds of computer-driven liquidity providers that any exchange – in crypto, stocks, derivatives, whatever – needs to thrive. The trading firms (which weren’t identified by name) had set up offshore entities, but the CFTC alleges those were empty shells and the trading was intrinsically American. A higher barrier to liquidity providers is a serious threat to crypto.  AMAZON NFTS: Cognitive dissonance is rampant in crypto. As Glenn Williams discussed above, crypto returns were huge this quarter even as crypto regulation ramped up. Here’s more: Even as the industry faces a scary future, Amazon appears to be continuing its march toward offering non-fungible tokens (NFT). A hint along those lines came in the form of a receipt emailed to one of CoinDesk’s journalists.  FRESH START: Before FTX collapsed, the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) was in the running to be named biggest crypto blowup of 2022. Investors lost billions of dollars. Industry distress followed. The founders of 3AC are trying to make a comeback by capitalizing on the distress. Kyle Davies, in an interview with CoinDesk, discussed their plans for a new exchange where bankruptcy claims can be used as collateral. “If you think about why people are angry, it has nothing to do with me actually,” Davies said. “People are angry because the market went down. In terms of us, we have no regulatory action [against us] anywhere, no lawsuits at all. There's just nothing.”  YIELD CURVE: Although bitcoin has generated big returns in 2023, the inverted U.S. Treasury yield curve is getting closer to un-inverting (aka long-term yields are approaching their more normal position of being higher than short-term yields). This CoinDesk analysis talks about how that is reason for caution for investors.

For the fourth quarter, the company's net loss widened 45% to 74 cents per share from the year-earlier quarter.  The company widened its 12-month revenue forecast to between $94 million and $129 million from a previous range of $108 million-$114 million. Mining profitability, which is measured as the hashprice, is seen 7 cents to 10 cents per terahash/second (TH/s) per day. Previously, it said it expected a hashprice of approximately 9 cents/TH/s. An exahash is 1 million terahash.  The miner's shares rose 6% in Wednesday morning trading on the Nasdaq.  Fourth-quarter revenue of $23.4 million was driven mainly by selling energy to the power grid rather than crypto mining. The miner owns two coal plants in Pennsylvania that use coal refuse, or piles of the fossil fuel left behind from the physical mining process.  Bitcoin mining revenue dropped 35% from the previous quarter as Stronghold returned equipment to lenders to lower debt. It also curtailed operations at times of high energy demand to sell power to the grid.  Speaking on the earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Smith explained that the boosted use of renewable energy has the effect of increasing electricity pricing during some periods and decreasing it during others, and how Stronghold is attempting to work this to its advantage.  ""We're creating a grid that is a little bit less stable because we're taking out baseload fossil fuel plants and replacing them with intermittent wind and solar assets,"" said Smith. ""So when power is the cheap [the price] can even go negative.""  ""We're in a great position to take advantage of what is quickly becoming a new reality on the power market,"" he added.  In recent months, Stronghold has taken steps to reduce its debt levels. In March it agreed with an electrical contractor to extinguish $11.4 million in exchange for a $3.5 million subordinated note and 3 million penny warrants. In February, the firm also extinguished $16.9 million of principal and $1 million of accrued interest by closing its exchange agreement, under which convertible notes are redeemable by stock. As of March 28, it had $59.8 million in outstanding debt.

Fetch will use the investment to deploy decentralized machine learning, autonomous agents and network infrastructure on its platform, the firm said in a statement on Wednesday.  The aim of Fetch.ai is to provide the tools for developers to deploy and monetize applications by providing an autonomous machine-to-machine ecosystem.  Fetch.ai deploys bits of codes it refers to as ""autonomous economic agents,"" which create connections between a network of independent parties and with real-world systems and devices. The purpose of agents is to ""generate economic value for its owner,"" according to Fetch.ai, be it through acquiring knowledge, sharing predictions or conducting trades.  ""Fetch.ai's platform provides a comprehensive solution for building and deploying peer-to-peer applications with automation and AI capabilities,” Andrei Grachev, managing partner of DWF Labs, said in the statement.  The investment comes after traders started to bet on the potential of AI and crypto, following the recent rise in popularity of AI-driven chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation software DALL-E. Both of these are traditional software that do not use cryptocurrencies or blockchain, However, a spike in institutional interest in their parent company – OpenAI, which recently raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a $29 billion valuation – has helped create a compelling argument for crypto traders to bet on AI-focused tokens as the next growth sector.  The native token of Fetch.ai, FET, currently has a market cap of about $400 million, while one of its peers, SingularityNET's AGIX), has over $500 million, according to CoinGecko data.  Last month, Fetch.ai teamed up with electronics giant Bosch to form a foundation for the research and development of real-world use cases of blockchain technology in areas such as transportation, hospitality and commerce.  The $40 million funding marks yet another investment by market maker DWF Labs, its fifth this month. Most recently, DWF invested $10 million in blockchain firm Radix Tokens.

42421292,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoBZ,1680100222,The Next ChatGPT Won’t Be in Web3 Unless Some Things Change,"In a recent article, I explored potential opportunities at the intersection of ChatGPT and Web3 technologies. The hype behind generative artificial intelligence (AI) and technologies such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 is warranted, and Web3 hasn’t been exempt from it. In recent weeks, we have seen AI-related crypto tokens rally to historical highs, and even new venture funds created to invest at the intersection of generative AI and Web3.  While the possibilities of combining ChatGPT type technologies with Web3 infrastructure can make our minds fly, the Web3 community should face the reality that the majority of the value in generative AI is being captured in traditional Web2 infrastructures. Extrapolating that idea a bit further takes us down the path of a controversial theory, which is nonetheless worth exploring: that ChatGPT momentum can have a negative and lasting impact on Web3.  Jesus Rodriguez, a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April, is the CEO of IntoTheBlock.  The core idea behind the potential negative impact of generative AI in the Web3 space is relatively simple. Generative AI has the potential to change every aspect of how software and content are developed and consumed, from the infrastructure to the application layer. These days we are seeing every major technology and content provider incorporating generative AI into their platforms. If the core of that revolution is taking place outside Web3, it is likely to have an impact on the innovation, talent and funding gap between Web2 and Web3 technologies. Furthermore, if not addressed quickly, this gap is likely to continue expanding at a multi-exponential growth rate. The solutions to this problem are certainly far from trivial, but there are some first-principles ideas that can be explored to start addressing that gap.  Challenges  That the generative AI movement is taking place in Web2 shouldn’t come as a surprise if we factor in that for a decade Web3 hasn’t created any meaningful infrastructure or technologies to support machine learning (ML). Web3 stacks evolved around foundational components such as decentralized computation, storage, identity and messaging, but there has been little attention paid to the ML space. Not surprisingly, all ML breakthroughs such as the transformer architectures and pretrained models had no footprint in blockchains or Web3 infrastructures. When the release of models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 or stable diffusion signaled that generative AI could hit escape velocity, the Web3 movement found itself having no relevant foundation to support the new generative AI revolution. This problem is even worse when we evaluate the rate of progress of generative AI technologies.  Multi-exponential growth and massive technical gap  Gaps in generative AI capabilities between the Web3 and Web2 world are widening fast. Trends such as cloud or mobile computing evolve at a linear or polynomial rate, in which a new release improves upon previous with new features and capabilities. Generative AI grows at a multi-exponential rate.  Models such as ChatGPT or GPT-4 use a baseline of data and infrastructure, which represents a high bar for startups trying to recreate those capabilities. Additionally, those models become exponentially better as more people use them, and they collect more data that can be used to pretrain future versions. At this point, the gap can become so big that it is unbridgeable.  Read more: Jesus Rodriguez - A Pragmatic View of ChatGPT in a Web3 World  At the moment, Web3 infrastructures do not possess the compute, data or data science framework foundations to embrace generative AI. Decentralized applications (dapp) can certainly incorporate generative AI capabilities by interacting with models via Web2 APIs, but the idea of Web3 native generative AI seems a bit challenging at the moment. As generative AI continues to evolve rapidly, the challenges for Web3 can become apparent across different dimensions.  Let’s take a look at different levels of the stack.  Platforms  Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud are rapidly incorporating generative AI capabilities in areas such as natural language, images, video and several others. The computation and data requirements of generative AI models currently seem beyond the capabilities of Web3 infrastructures. Consequently, the new generation of generative AI applications will fundamentally be powered by Web2 cloud platforms with very little footprint in Web3 infrastructures. If generative AI delivers on its promise, this means that Web3 platforms can fall incredibly behind in terms of adoption.  Applications  As Web2 platforms incorporate generative AI capabilities, this will power a new generation of applications that will incorporate generative AI as a first-class citizen. These new-generation applications will take place disproportionately in Web2 as Web3 stacks are not equipped to power generative AI capabilities. Sure, we will see dapps incorporating features powered by models such as ChatGPT, but obviously, those features will be completely off-chain.  Next-wave fintech  For years, crypto and Web3 technologies were regarded as the next major trend to modernize fintech. Undoubtedly that focus has shifted towards generative AI. Most fintech platforms are more concerned about not being disrupted by leaner alternatives powered by models like ChatGPT than to build digital currency rails.  Developer talent  The level of innovation around generative AI technologies and the popularity of technologies such as ChatGPT is certainly contagious and is attracting developers looking to build next-generation applications. The explosion in generative AI technologies coincides with a brutal downturn in the crypto space. With the combination of these two events, the Web3 space might be at risk of experiencing a developer talent drain going into the generative AI space.  VC investments  Venture capital investments are another area that is likely to shift from Web3 to generative AI. The 2021 bull run brought record levels of VC investments into Web3 companies, and movements such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) finally showed practical applications about the promise of Web3. The downturn of 2022 combined with the explosion in the generative AI space has shifted the flow of VC funds into the generative AI space, which also contributes to attracting the top talent in the tech industry.  Silver linings  The lack of strong machine learning foundations has precluded Web3 from participating in the first wave of generative AI innovation, but this could still be addressed. Given the current state of technology and challenges, there are two clear areas in which generative AI can really benefit from the native capabilities of Web3 architectures.  Decentralized generative AI: There are enough concerns about knowledge centralization and control over large generative AI models that it creates an opening for decentralized alternatives. Even though the decentralized AI trend never reached meaningful adoption, generative AI is resurfacing the dialogue around the value proposition of decentralization to mitigate control, bias, fairness and other desired features of these models.  Proof of knowledge: Some of the biggest pushbacks against the adoption of generative AI come from the potential for generating toxic, racist, biased content, as well as their propensity to hallucinate or ""make stuff up."" From that perspective, enforcing verifiable traceability mechanisms across the pretraining, fine-tuning, and use of generative AI models such as ChatGPT is a super important capability for its adoption in mission-critical scenarios. This is one of the scenarios in which blockchain runtimes are incredibly well situated to inject accountability into generative AI models.  These scenarios combine the strengths of Web3 and generative AI platforms. While Web3 was not well situated to embrace the first wave of the generative AI revolution, it can still contribute meaningfully to its future. Releases such as ChatGPT should definitely be a wakeup call for the Web3 community that decentralization is not enough, and we need to build the technological foundations to embrace future waves of innovation.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/29/chatgpt-web3-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61080bf60d8cbfb426fef3f8a0a51c3168ad279f-1707x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The SEC also accused Beaxy Digital Ltd. of illegally raising $8 million in the offering of an unregistered security with its BXY token. The agency additionally noted Hamazaspyan “misappropriated at least $900,000 for personal use, including gambling.”  Windy Inc. took over the platform in 2019 after the founder misappropriated money, according to the SEC, and managers Nicholas Murphy and Randolph Bay Abbott maintained Beaxy for trading crypto assets “that were offered and sold as securities,” the SEC said. So the agency is also accusing them of violating securities law by operating an unregistered exchange, broker and clearing agency, though the platform was described as defunct in another SEC case last year.  “When a crypto intermediary combines all of these functions under one roof – as we allege that Beaxy did – investors are at serious risk,” Gurbir Grewal, the SEC’s enforcement chief, said in the statement. “The blurring of functions and the lack of registrations meant that regulations designed to protect investors were not followed or even recognized by Beaxy.”  The exchange posted on its website that it was suspending its operations because of the “uncertain regulatory environment surrounding our business.”  “We forthrightly committed to cooperation with the Securities and Exchange Commission for over two years, continually providing information, data and interviews to assist regulators in whatever manner we could,” Beaxy said.  The SEC's statement doesn’t mention that Beaxy closed under an agreement in federal court with Windy and the people associated with that company. The agreement included returning all assets to customers and “destroying” any BXY in Windy’s possession. The SEC is still pursuing Beaxy Digital and Hamazaspyan with litigation, the agency said.  Customers of the exchange will be able to withdraw their assets within 24 hours after all user orders are canceled and balances are verified and are encouraged to do so within 30 days, the SEC said.

42421294,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnoDd,1680099589,The EU’s Smart Contract ‘Kill Switch’ Mandate Won't Kill Crypto,"On March 14, the European Parliament voted in favor of new data controls to be included in a larger bill designed to address data privacy without stifling innovation. A new clause in the bill known as the Data Act requires all smart contracts to include a “kill switch.”  In the IT world, administrators commonly use the kill switch mechanism to shut off a device, network or software in the event of a security threat. In a smart contract setting, a kill switch can either destroy the contract or deploy a halt, patch and re-release of the contract in the case of a major bug or breach.  Shahar Shamai is the chief technology officer and co-founder of GK8, a crypto self-custody platform.  While the intention of the regulators was to give people more protection over their own personal information, the act has generated concerns in the Web3 community. Some fear a kill switch mandate would curb the decentralization of smart contracts by giving one person or a group of people the power to shut down operations.  Others claim that this kill switch provision will lead to inevitable security flaws.  Some people might remember an incident that occurred in August when decentralized exchange (DEX) OptiFi accidentally activated a kill switch to its mainnet, leading to it permanently being shut down, and losing $661,000 worth of USDC stablecoin tokens. While this kill switch was not used in a smart contract setting, it does shed light on the risks that classic kill switches create for crypto-related businesses and projects.  Many smart contracts can and do store value rather than merely representing ownership of assets located elsewhere. As such, activating a kill switch that in effect destroys the smart contract would essentially wipe out all the value being held, and shouldn’t be used. What’s the point of protecting consumers with a kill switch if you lose all the value stored in the smart contract?  I also share the concern about safeguarding decentralization, mostly because decentralization is a crucial safeguard of the communities’ assets. We have all witnessed cybercriminals zeroing in on points of centralization for hacking purposes, because these points of centralization give them access to more assets in one fell swoop.  See also: EU Smart Contract Regulations Included in Council's Data Act  Still, it’s important to keep a few things in mind. First of all, some smart contracts already include some form of a kill switch and many users probably don’t even know it. Secondly, there are clear advantages to deploying such functionality to a smart contract, especially considering there are ways to minimize centralization while maximizing security.  A kill switch’s form, application and function may vary drastically depending on the industry and business, or even the type of device. For blockchain-based businesses, projects and protocols operating within EU territory, perhaps the most important place to start is what kind of smart contract kill switches make the most sense for users and regulators.  To kill, or to pause? That is the question  The term “kill switch” immediately brings to mind a self-destruct button. But the language of the data act is currently vague. Instead of a self-destruct button, one could consider the alternative of a pause function. The pause functionality, as opposed to a classic kill switch, won’t completely wipe out the smart contract (and its value) because it can be unpaused.  For example, if a smart contract is compromised, the contract administrator can apply the pause functionality, which essentially freezes the smart contract. After the situation is rectified and stabilized, the unpause functionality can be activated and resume the smart contract.  The pause functionality is not uncommon in the blockchain and crypto space. Tether, the maker of leading stablecoin USDT, also uses the pause function, as seen in the smart contract’s code on Etherscan.  Don’t compromise on decentralization or security  When compared with a classic kill switch mechanism, the pause functionality represents a better fail-safe. Not only does it protect the network if caught on time, it also salvages the contract – and its funds – by enabling it to resume operations.  To pause the smart contract, code admins need to use the system’s private key. Once a private key is used online, however, it becomes vulnerable to cyber attack. In theory, access to this private key could give hackers admin privileges to the entire contract and has grave implications on the immutability of smart contracts.  So how can smart contract admins deploy a pause functionality without endangering the security of the entire smart contract?  The answer is surprisingly simple: Use different keys. One that enables the pause functionality and another that enables the unpause functionality. For added security, store these different keys in an offline manner. Separating the pause and unpause keys and storing both in a truly offline manner strengthens the security of the smart contract and eliminates potential points of failure.  This method still raises questions about centralization in crypto apps. Achieving complete decentralization may not be possible under the best circumstances, and will be made even more difficult under EU rules.  However, the problems of centralized control of mandated kill switches can be greatly reduced through the utilization of a multisignature approval protocol. In this scenario, emergency powers to flick the pause switch could be granted for immediate action (such as in the case of a hack or a glitch). The unpause switch may require a quorum approval.  This group of trusted parties or community members, given the authority to activate the unpause function, would ensure that no single individual or entity has complete control over a smart contract.  Another best practice is to change the admin keys once a kill switch is used or reversed, because the moment they are used they go online and therefore become vulnerable to cyberattacks.  See also: 'No Point' to European Union's Crypto Rules Unless World Follows Suit, Official Says  The EU’s data privacy, tech and crypto regulatory frameworks have so far proven to be quite transparent and forward-looking, and with time, the scope of this new “kill switch clause” will become apparent. In the meantime, smart-contract developers would be wise to do their due diligence regarding deploying the pause functionality.  By utilizing the pause method, separating the keys and establishing a multi-signature approval of the unpause button, smart contracts wouldn’t have to self-destruct in the event of a security breach, while also enjoying greater security and limited centralization.",NEGATIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Shahar Shamai ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/03/29/the-eus-smart-contract-kill-switch-mandate-wont-kill-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87cebc83ad58f9523f8038c60e2b15f4e1ac8f6e-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387815,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQtXvP,1680096784,Open Interest in XRP Surges to $800M as Crypto Traders Hope Ripple-SEC Verdict Will Bring 'Alt Season',"Investors are looking again at the futures market tied to payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP amid hopes that Ripple Labs, which the U.S. argues issued the token, will win its legal battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission and spur more risk taking in the broader market.  XRP has rallied 57% since March 22, reaching a 10-month high of about 58 cents, according to CoinDesk data.  Since the rally began, the notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in unsettled and active contracts trading on futures and perpetual futures exchanges, has increased by nearly 90% to $843 million, the highest since December 2021, data from Coinglass shows.  An increase in open interest coming alongside an increase in price typically suggests an influx of new money on the bullish side and is said to confirm the uptrend. At press time, funding rates – representing the cost of holding bullish long or bearish short positions – were positive on most exchanges, indicating the dominance of bullish leverage traders. The broader market was up as well, with bitcoin (BTC) rising above $28,000 in a move that reversed the losses seen early this week after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume.  ""The bullish impulse stems from Ripple's case vs. the SEC, where optimism for Ripple's win seems to be becoming more dominant,"" Lewis Harland, portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said in a market update.  ""Maybe that Ripple win sets off a bullish impulse down the risk curve (alt season),"" Harland added. Alt season is a crypto slang that describes a period where alternative cryptocurrencies like XRP, SOL, DOT, gaming tokens, decentralized-finance coins and meme coins outperform bitcoin and ether (ETH).  Ripple and XRP aren't interchangeable. While Ripple is a fintech company focused on building a global payments network, XRP is an independent digital asset used for things like online payments and currency swaps. Ripple argues that it did not issue XRP.  In 2020, the SEC charged the Ripple Network with selling unregistered securities after the platform sold $1.3 billion worth of XRP. Ripple has long maintained that XRP is a commodity, not a security, as alleged by the SEC.  Securities are more tightly regulated than commodities and demand greater transparency and reporting by companies. Hence, Ripple's victory is likely to bring cheer to the broader market, but a loss could rekindle risk aversion.  ""A win for the SEC could also impact other altcoins as they will likely be subject to more regulation,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto-services provider Matrixport, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""However, if Ripple is successful in this case, XRP’s legality in the U.S. market will be solidified and help drive a price rally.""

The company will use the funds to expand its team, support community initiatives such as hackathons and grant programs and help onboard developers to both the Aptos and Econia ecosystems, CEO Alex told CoinDesk in an email. Alex didn't provide a family name.  Portland, Oregon-based Econia Labs is building a back-end protocol to serve as a base layer for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on Aptos. The protocol offers order books, a component of traditional finance and centralized crypto exchanges that allows traders to buy or sell assets at their desired price or to just take the best price offered by the market, Alex said. Econia brings order books on-chain in a transparent, permissionless way and supports integrations with DeFi applications that offer a range of trading options such as spot trading or leveraged derivatives.  “The Econia protocol provides a settlement engine at the base layer of Aptos DeFi, which enables other dapps to tap into a common trading venue,” said Alex, referring to decentralized applications. “With liquidity pooled into Econia’s order books, developers can focus on building out innovative products like perpetual futures, options, and margin trading markets on top of the core protocol without having to worry about matching and filling trades between counterparties.”  Other backers in the round included Lightspeed Faction, Wintermute Ventures, Hudson River Trading, and Flow Traders, among others. Aptos Labs also participated. Econia Labs developed the protocol in collaboration with the Aptos team.  Aptos Labs launched its blockchain mainnet in October after raising $350 million across two venture capital-backed rounds, though the ecosystem was rather sparse at the time as a number of teams had yet to launch their projects on the chain. Aptos Labs was created by several former Meta (Facebook) employees who were involved with the tech giant’s failed diem stablecoin, a similar founding story to Mysten Labs’ Sui blockchain.  The native token of Aptos Labs, APT, was up nearly 6% over 24 hours to $11.64 at the time of publication. It hit an all-time high of $16.46 in late January.

The CFTC suit, which focused on Binance allegedly operating in the U.S. without legal authority, followed the exchange's announcement last week saying it would end its short-lived zero-fee trading promotion. It also was forced to temporarily suspend spot trading on March 24 due to a software bug. The pace of withdrawals is heightened compared to normal activity and did pick up after the CFTC announcement,"" Nansen analyst Andrew Thurman told the WSJ . Still, the rush to the exits was more pronounced in February, he added, when the New York Department of Financial Services ordered Paxos, the issuer of Binance-branded Binance USD ( BNB-USD ), to stop minting new BUSD tokens. Binance did not immediately respond to Seeking Alpha's request for comment. BUSD ( BNB-USD ) stablecoin, meantime, experienced over $500M in outflows in the roughly 24 hours that followed the regulator complaint, underscoring traders' worries about the potential implications of the legal battle. The company's decision to bring back fees on spot bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) trading also likely contributed to overall concerns, as most of the trade volume on Binance was zero-fee for the nine months the promotion was live, the newspaper noted Tuesday, citing digital asset data provider Kaiko.

Shimmer, an incentivized staging network, started operation in September. It is the first EVM-enabled launch on Iota and is intended to increase the network's overall utility for developers and traders. The public testing period is a key step ahead of the ShimmerEVM introduction on the mainnet, or real-world blockchain.  “We are continually making new improvements so when the ‘real’ ShimmerEVM is ready to launch, it’s more polished,” Iota Foundation Chairman Dominik Schiener said. “This testnet is an important step forward for the rollout of future ecosystem projects on both Shimmer and Iota.”  Testnets are blockchain networks designed for testing purposes. They mimic activity on the mainnet and allow developers to debug any issues and monitor network activity ahead of wider release.  An Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) refers to the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer utilized by developers for creating decentralized applications (dapps). When deployed on other blockchains, EVMs can allow developers to build dapps and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications similar to the way they would on Ethereum.  Testing ShimmerEVM with multiple validators and dozens of dapps will enhance the resilience, performance, and security of the planned ShimmerEVM smart contract chain, developers said.  Alongside test chain launch come with other important updates to the consensus module.  The basis for this extended EVM compatibility is built by so-called Magic Smart Contracts, which come as a default on every Iota smart contract chain. These smart contracts enable seamless and bridgeless native asset transfer between the Shimmer layer 1 and EVM chains – eliminating the need for custom bridges within the Shimmer ecosystem.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | IOTA,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/29/iota-releases-shimmer-public-test-chain-ahead-of-native-ethereum-virtual-machine-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8effcce7f008709237fc6c73a6094d7ab0087a07-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin showed signs of resilience Wednesday, shedding tremors from the U.S. Commodity Futures Commission's lawsuit against crypto exchange Binance to recover and go above $28,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap was up 6% over the past 24 hours to around $28,400. It has added almost 72% this year, with its best quarterly gain in two years. Just three months ago, some experts were mulling the possibility of bitcoin falling to as low as $12,000 this quarter, after its valuation had declined by 76% since November 2021. The rebound has put bitcoin ahead of ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, which appears on track for a 50% quarterly gain. Gold has added over 7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has rallied 15%.  The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric that aims to measure current sentiment in the market, dropped to 59 on Tuesday, sliding from a nearly 18-month high of 68 reached one week ago, according to data from alternative.me. Readings above 50 indicate market sentiment has moved into the ""greed"" stage, while those below 50 indicate ""fear."" The index hadn't been as high as 68 since November 2021 when bitcoin reached an all-time record of nearly $69,000. Although the gauge has declined since last week to 59, it remains in the ""greed"" zone, suggesting investor sentiment for now remains bullish. The rebound to ""greed"" this year comes as crypto prices bounced despite regulatory crackdowns and macroeconomic fears.  With the ink still drying on the Binance lawsuit, CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam reiterated Tuesday at a congressional hearing he believes ether is a commodity – a potentially controversial assertion that differs from what his counterpart at the Securities and Exchange Commission has said. A lawmaker on the House Appropriations Committee asked Behnam during a budget hearing Tuesday whether he believes ether should be on that list. ""I believe they are a commodity,” Behnam said. “And because they are listed on CFTC exchanges, we do have a regulatory relationship – obviously with the derivatives market and that product, but the underlying market as well.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily changes in the DeFi Dominance index, which measures the market cap of a basket of top decentralized-finance coins as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market.  The index slipped from 5% to 4% in March, as regulatory fears and banking sector turmoil saw investors park money into bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.  ""DeFi dominance at key support (4%) with technicals indicating the sector is oversold,"" Lewis Harland, a portfolio manager at Decentral Park Capital, said.

Kwon was arrested at the airport in Montenegro's capital city of Podgorica last week. Extradition proceedings will take place only after a separate case for forgery of identification documents, Kovac said.  “Primacy is given to the court proceedings led in Montenegro,” Kovac said, speaking through an interpreter. “If they are convicted for the criminal offense of falsifying identification documents, only after they served their prison sentence is it expected that they will be extradited.”  Kovac said he had received no official extradition request from Singapore, though he was aware of media reports of proceedings there. Terraforms is incorporated in Singapore.  Kwon and his business associate Han Chang Joon – arrested alongside Kwon – are the subjects of an international warrant issued by South Korea following the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin last year that sent shock waves through crypto markets. Kovac said he wasn’t aware how or why they arrived in Montenegro.  Kwon is a South Korean citizen, and the U.S. claims jurisdiction because the Securities and Exchange Commission says investors in the U.S. were the subject of fraud by Kwon and his firm.  Given suspicions that they might hold cryptocurrency or other potential evidence, the U.S. and South Korea have also asked for Kwon’s laptops and other devices, Kovac added.

GoerliDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, is making the case to continue Goerli as an active blockchain network and using goerli ether (gETH) to incentivize activity on the network.  “Goerli’s historical usage makes it an ideal candidate to be Ethereum’s de facto canary network – a pretesting environment closely resembling the mainnet,” the newly formed DAO said in a post earlier this week.  “An incentivized canary network like Goerli offers unique advantages to builders and users alike, and the concept has seen success on many blockchains – most notably with Kusama in relation to Polkadot,” it added.  It is unclear who is behind GoerliDAO as of Wednesday.  Testnets like Goerli are a testing environment that mimics real-world blockchain usage, allowing developers to find and patch critical bugs for upcoming products or features meant to be deployed on a blockchain's main, or live, network.  Much of the testing of Ethereum’s major upgrades, such as the Merge, were conducted on Goerli.  Keeping such a testing environment alive is what the folks behind GoerliDAO are rallying for: “The preservation of Goerli as a canary network will not only fill a crucial need within the Ethereum ecosystem but also pave the way for future innovation and incentivization in the world of decentralized finance,” they said.  A canary network is a proper chain of its own, and emulates most or all the features of the main blockchain it's designed to test. Unlike testnets, these are proper mainnets – but are primarily used to gauge riskier applications in a live environment before being pushed out to the public.  GoerliDAO also says that the existence of gETH markets is another “argument against its deprecation.”  Developers use gETH tokens for testing purposes. These tokens are a testnet version of actual ether (ETH) for developers to simulate transactions, smart contacts and other activities prior to deploying on Ethereum's main network. This means that these tokens are supposed to be free – issued simply for testnet developers.  That didn’t stop a market for goerli ether from opening up, however.  In February, cross-chain trading platform LayerZero created a swap product that allowed developers to purchase the testnet ether directly from the decentralized exchange Uniswap.  This made it significantly easier for Ethereum developers to test and have access to ether on the Goerli testnet. At their peak, gETH prices jumped to over $1.50.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | DOT | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/29/keep-goerli-ether-alive-as-ethereum-canary-network-dao-argues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/21695d7db1331b45bb4fb0305ceb93db0b7b13dc-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Any airdrop is an event. This one, which came amid a market downturn and a regulatory crackdown on the crypto industry, seemed timed to lift the crypto community’s spirits just when they were at their lowest. Certainly, the free money didn’t hurt; many ARB claimants rushed to sell their new tokens on crypto exchanges for a healthy reward.  Read more: Crypto Airdrop: What's an Airdrop and Why Crypto Airdrops Are Issued  But from the outside looking in, the Arbitrum airdrop was plagued by bugs and seized on by predators who, a week on, continue to use the project’s likeness to promote phishing scams. Spoof Arbitrum accounts became so prolific on Twitter, in fact, that the real Arbitrum account was briefly suspended after it was erroneously flagged as spam.  As another possible airdrop looms on the horizon – that of the Ethereum scaling platform zkSync – and regulators continue to ramp up scrutiny of token-based projects, it may be time to consider whether the airdrop model is so inherently messy (and so thoroughly mired in a gray area of securities regulation) that some protocol teams might need to find other ways of incentivizing new users and raising funds.  The airdrop fiasco  There was a week-long period between when the Arbitrum airdrop was announced and when investors were allowed to claim their ARB tokens. In that week, Crypto Twitter descended into a kind of frenzy, with people speculating about the token’s eventual price on the open market (will ARB trade for $1? $10?) and gloating about how many tokens they were set to receive. (ARB was apportioned to users according to their past usage of the platform.)  But when the airdrop finally went live on Thursday, the upbeat scene on Twitter quickly turned chaotic.  In the hours leading up to the airdrop, Arbitrum’s block explorer and the website for claiming tokens crashed in response to high server demand. Those who managed to complete the claim process successfully – usually by executing commands directly onto Arbitrum smart contracts – were forced to pay extraordinarily high gas fees because of the influx of network activity.  The high fees and service outages made it impossible for some users to claim their tokens altogether.  Despite the trouble, around half of eligible ARB claimants managed to nab their share within just an hour of the airdrop’s opening. But the airdrop wasn’t just plagued by inconvenience – it was also seized on by criminals.  For months leading up to the airdrop, even before there was official confirmation of an ARB token, scammers were spinning up spoof Arbitrum airdrop links and promoting them on Twitter, Discord and Telegram in an effort to phish unwitting investors – gaining access to their crypto wallets and sensitive personal data. Before the airdrop went live, more than 10,000 people fell prey to fake Arbitrum airdrop schemes, according to at least one analysis shared with CoinDesk by the Web3 antivirus firm De.Fi.  Scammers cast out even more Arbitrum phishing lures once the real airdrop went live. Even now, a week after the ARB claim window opened, virtually any crypto-adjacent tweet that gains modest traction can expect to be flooded with responses from accounts promoting fake ARB claim links. One attacker even managed to compromise the account of an Arbitrum Discord moderator, using it to promote a phishing scam to community members.  And criminals haven’t just employed phishing tactics to fleece would-be ARB holders. According to one analysis, an attacker managed to loot $500,000 worth of ARB tokens by hacking into a third-party service used by some eligible claimants.  With so many users falling prey to ARB scams before the airdrop, there’s no telling how many users may have been scammed since the drop went live.  Can you run a successful airdrop?  Arbitrum is far from the only crypto project whose airdrop was beset with chaos – airdrops have long been magnets for crime and calamity.  Optimism, Arbitrum’s main peer in the race to help scale up Ethereum, famously bungled the widely hyped launch of its OP token last year. In a case mirroring that of Arbitrum, would-be OP claimants were forced to contend with widespread service outages that made it difficult for people to claim their share. OP claimants were also plagued by phishing scams, and an attacker stole $15 million worth of OP’s circulating supply by hacking into one of Optimism’s market-making partners.  It's not just Arbitrum’s competitors that have run into airdrop issues. In another example of an airdrop gone awry last year, the eligibility criteria for claiming airdropped tokens on the Juno blockchain led to a big-money “whale” earning vastly more tokens than should have gone to a single person. In an unprecedented test case of decentralized justice, the Juno community voted to confiscate those tokens – $36 million worth – only to accidentally send them to the wrong crypto address.  The securities problem  Airdrops have been around for around half a decade now, and the playbook for executing one has seen improvements over the years. Newer projects such as Arbitrum and Optimism have used stricter, more thoughtful eligibility criteria than airdrops of years past to avoid sending users more than their fair share. There’s a chance, moreover, that social media companies might find ways to get phishing under control, and that users will fall victim to scams less frequently as they learn to identify red flags.  But beyond the scams and service errors, airdrops might eventually need to contend with regulatory issues – at least in the U.S. – as Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler wages his crackdown on the industry.  Before airdrops, ICOs (initial coin offerings) were all the rage, where project owners would sell off tokens to investors in a process mirroring a more traditional IPO (initial public offering). This system, perhaps unsurprisingly, caught the attention of U.S. securities regulators who have argued that ICOs constitute the unregistered sale of securities (see: SEC vs. Ripple).  Though projects might not admit it publicly, airdrops were initially viewed as a way to avoid some of the regulatory red flags associated with ICOs.  The Howey Test – a legal precedent that U.S. regulators use to determine whether an asset should be considered a security – defines securities as “the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.”  Nowadays, most major projects that airdrop tokens tend to avoid promising investment returns, so there’s no “expectation of profits” from owning a token. Moreover, by distributing tokens to a community (rather than selling them) and using tokenized “governance rights” to “decentralize” control over an ecosystem, it’s easier to avoid the appearance that a project is centrally controlled. If the project associated with a token is decentralized, it’s harder to argue that appreciation of the token’s value has been “derived from the efforts of others.”  The ground rules for what constitutes “decentralization,” however, are not altogether clear: Offchain Labs, for instance, reserved nearly half of ARB's circulating supply for investors and team members.  Also, while projects might not explicitly promise profits to token holders, virtually every big airdrop is accompanied by massive market hype, and one could argue that the investors who accepted tokens as part of their funding agreements might reasonably expect some kind of profit in return for their cash. (So-called fair launches try to address this issue by barring investors and early contributors from reserving tokens, but any project’s creator can theoretically game an airdrop because they set its eligibility criteria.)  ZkSync, another buzzy Ethereum scaling platform, is expected to airdrop a token sometime soon. Whether – and how – it pursues its token launch might be indicative of the future of airdrops and token-based projects. As the crypto ecosystem matures and regulators wise up to the industry, it’s hard to imagine that the messy airdrops of the past several years will be allowed to continue without major revision.",NEGATIVE,ARB,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | ARB | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/29/arbitrum-shows-just-how-messy-and-tricky-crypto-airdrops-can-be,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51f0690d17bb87baa88b580a6b7518aa4d5adef4-2047x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The European Banking Authority, or EBA, is the European Union's banking regulator.  The guidance suggests banks and payment providers will be under pressure to enhance scrutiny of crypto companies, even amid concerns that the blockchain industry is losing access to conventional finance.  Under existing guidance, authorities must gather information on individual sectors of the economy to inform their assessment of money-laundering threats. That includes the type of customers banks have and customers' possible links to financial crime at home and abroad.  Now regulators also need to assess “the (infrastructure) technology prevalent in the sector, in particular where this is essential to the sector’s business model and operation (such as distributed ledger technology),"" the EBA said, referring to the system that underpins blockchains and most cryptocurrencies.  A proposed EU rule regulating the transfer of funds requires that participants in crypto transactions be identified. That rule is due to be voted on in April, and the EBA is already trying to figure out how to implement it.  When vetting senior staff at crypto companies, supervisors should follow existing “fit-and-proper” procedures intended for banks, even before landmark new licensing rules contained in the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets crypto regulation, or MiCA, take effect, the EBA said.  The EBA's guidance comes even as worries that crypto firms will lose access to traditional banks mount. In the U.S., regulators have rejected claims that the shutdown of Signature Bank was due to a crackdown on crypto-friendly lenders.  The EBA's guidance is open for consultation until June 29.

42412508,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl568e,1680082217,"Bitcoin Heads for Best Quarter in 2 Years, Outperforms Ether, Gold, Nasdaq","Bitcoin (BTC) has begun 2023 with a bang, marking a positive turnaround from a year-long swoon.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has added almost 72% to $28,500 this year, its best quarterly gain in two years, CoinDesk data shows. The rally has lifted the cryptocurrency's market value to $542 billion.  Just three months ago, some experts were mulling the possibility of bitcoin falling to as low as $12,000 this quarter, after its valuation had declined by 76% since November 2021.  The rebound has put bitcoin ahead of ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, which appears on track for a 50% quarterly gain. Gold has added over 7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has rallied 15%.  Much of the rebound has been fueled by speculation that central banks, led by the Federal Reserve, will abandon their aggressive rate increases in response to recession signals.  The so-called Fed pivot expectations strengthened early this month after three U.S. banks collapsed and the central bank launched emergency funding programs to arrest panic in the banking sector. The central bank's balance sheet has recently expanded by $300 billion, undoing months of quantitative tightening. According to fed-funds futures, traders now see the Fed beginning an easing cycle in June with a rate cut of a quarter percentage point.  ""It's all about expectations of new easing measures by central banks, especially the Fed,"" Martin Leinweber, digital-assets product strategist at MarketVector Indexes, told CoinDesk TV. ""Among all risk assets, bitcoin stands out as being the most sensitive to liquidity swings.""  David Foley, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, said assets with sound money appeal, like bitcoin and gold, are benefitting from the liquidity injections.  ""With the Fed suddenly turning on a dime, having to throw some QE back into the system to protect the banking system, money flows into sound money assets: gold, silver. And bitcoin being sound money is going to be the fastest in the race,"" Foley said on CoinDesk TV, referring to quantitative easing.  Some observers say bitcoin's worsening order book depth has played a bigger role in the price surge.  Order book depth refers to how easy or difficult it is to get in and out of large trades at stable prices. The depth has steadily dwindled since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and reached a 10-month low early this month. In other words, a small buy order now has a bigger bullish impact on prices.  ""In this instance, the narrative of bitcoin as a hedge against financial calamity gave BTC the push it needed. But there was little upside resistance to hurdle over,"" Conor Ryder, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, wrote in a recently published analytics piece.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/29/bitcoin-heads-for-best-quarter-in-two-years-outperforms-ether-gold-and-nasdaq,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8fd873cfb50cae45c8d6398626e45fbf6d574ec3-1732x962.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411022,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giB3rB,1680081697,What the Bank of England’s Stablecoins Regime Could Look Like,"The U.K.’s central bank wants to protect citizens against the collapse of large stablecoin issuers by updating an existing regulatory regime – a move which is imminent.  Global standard setters are working on norms for stablecoins, especially as regulators fear that they will get more entangled with the broader financial system. The U.K. is joining other economies including the U.S., European Union and Hong Kong, which are also working to set up targeted regulations for crypto pegged to the value of other assets.  Following the collapse of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which sent the market and companies including crypto fund Three Arrows Capital tumbling, regulators such as the Bank of England (BoE) have sought to make sure they have the right safeguards in place to protect citizens against future stablecoin collapses.  The BoE, like other regulators, is worried that stablecoins could become more interlinked with the financial system over time – as more banks and financial companies adopt crypto – and could pose a risk to financial stability, although many of them acknowledge it isn’t a threat at present. So it is planning to set up a regime to monitor stablecoins that could have an impact on the financial system, and will release its consultation on what this could look like in the coming weeks, before its rules are finalized and put into law.  The BoE’s stablecoin regime is coming.  “With millions of consumers now owning some form of crypto, ensuring high standards of consumer protection must be a top priority for government as well as mitigating any potential market integrity and financial stability risks,” Lisa Cameron, a Member of Parliament and chair of the Crypto and Digital Asset All Parliamentary Group, said in a statement.  So what could the U.K.'s stablecoin regime look like?  A closer look  The BoE is looking to amend the Financial Market Infrastructure Special Administration Regime (FMI SAR), which gives the bank broad oversight of big U.K.-based payment systems, to also cover large digital settlement assets including stablecoins, it set out in its consultation. DSAs are digital assets used for payments. If the recently introduced Financial Services and Markets Bill passes into law, the BoE will have the power to extend the existing FMI SAR regime to cover certain crypto.  The FMI SAR regime is essentially an insolvency regime, said an official from Fnality International, a blockchain payment system. In the U.K., insolvency or administration regimes are similar to bankruptcy regimes elsewhere. One objective of the regime would be to help certain critical crypto businesses keep running so they do not have an impact on financial stability.  “The failure of a systemic DSA firm could have a wide range of financial stability as well as consumer protection impacts” including disruptions to services critical to the economy and to individuals' access to their own funds, the Treasury’s consultation on the FMI SAR said.  Read more: UK Government Proposes Stablecoin Safeguards After Terra Collapse  Returning funds  The BoE is exploring adding a new objective that ensures funds are returned to investors should a large stablecoin issuer collapse.  “I like ... the additional objective of ensuring the return or transfer of funds because not only does it give added confidence to consumers by directly mitigating their risk, it would also act as a catalyst to increase the adoption of crypto as a means of payment,” said Asim Arshad, a senior associate at Mackrell Solicitors, a London-based law firm, in an interview with CoinDesk.  However, pursuing this objective may mean keeping a company running takes a back seat to facilitating the return of funds to affected lenders or investors should the issuer collapse, Arshad said. Plus, crypto firms under the FMI SAR may pay administration fees like the ones set out under the existing regime. These are paid after the administration order has been made by the court, which the BoE would have had to apply for – under the current rules – when a firm fails and needs help to continue, the official from Fnality said.  Plus some believe returning funds to customers may be difficult to accomplish.  “This objective may pose real issues for many firms, who may struggle to evidence ownership of crypto-assets in the event of an insolvency,” said James Alleyne, the legal director at Kingsley Napley. “This is likely to be compounded by the lack of ownership detail on the underlying ledgers and the pseudo-anonymous nature of the technology.”  Last year several large crypto firms filed for bankruptcy. Collapsed platforms including FTX and Celsius Network are now embroiled in long and complex bankruptcy proceedings, where courts and judges have struggled to decipher who is owed what.  Read more: FTX Has Recovered 'Over $5B' in Assets, Bankruptcy Attorney Says  Without a custody regime, which protects crypto assets from being used toward the cost of insolvency, the owners of such assets may lose money if a firm goes under, Alleyne said.  The U.K. does not currently have a custody regime, though this was discussed at a U.K. regulator Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) event with the crypto community last year.  Continuing operations  The BoE’s regime would allow systemic DSA providers to continue operating in a crisis. The BoE may have to consult with the FCA before appointing a qualified liquidator to manage the wind-up of a systemic stablecoin firm that they both regulate. The FCA is currently responsible for registering crypto firms to operate in the U.K. using anti-money laundering rules.  “Whilst having another regulator involved always has the potential to increase process and bureaucracy, in practice there is no reason why this should not work smoothly and it may also help to ensure better outcomes for consumers,” Alleyne said.  A special administration order lets regulators appoint experienced liquidators to oversee companies without their consent in the event of a catastrophic failure, said Kathryn Willis, who previously worked at the FCA and is now the managing director at ONE. These administrators can wind down affected companies with an aim to return as much money to consumers as possible, or take over the running of the business for continuity purposes, Willis said.  The BoE may step in when there are issues with the fiat currency reserves backing a stablecoin, such as if a stablecoin is not fully backed by its reserves when it should be, Willis said.  Systemic risks  The regime would be set up to address systemic stablecoins and DSAs and their providers, but no stablecoin or DSA in circulation can currently be deemed systemic.  “This is preemptive legislation, they're anticipating wider adoption and ownership of this particular asset,” said Ryan Shea, an economist at Paris-based crypto trading platform Trakx.  Crypto assets are a small market compared to the broader financial sector but if the pace of growth continues, interlinkages with the financial sector will likely increase and affect the activity in the financial sector, said the BoE in a March report (before the current crypto winter).  “If all the banks moved to deposit stablecoins, then that would definitely be systemic,” said Kene Ezeji-Okoye, co-founder of Millicent, a U.K.-based distributed ledger technology infrastructure provider.  “The bad mortgages that underpinned the 2008 global financial crisis were worth about 15% of U.S. broad money supply, and caused internationally systemic damage,” Ezeji-Okoye said in a statement. “So one would expect the threshold for a stablecoin to be classified as systemic in the U.K. to be far lower than 15% of money supply – the collapse of a stablecoin with a mid 9-figure market cap could well cause ripples in the system.”  UPDATE (April 11, 2023, 14:20 UTC): Updates Fnality comment.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/29/what-the-bank-of-englands-stablecoins-regime-could-look-like,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/48915f8f14bed00094799c4258ef67c27e3ab29c-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP tokens jumped for a second straight day, adding 11% in the past 24 hours. They were buoyed by speculation that the classification of bitcoin and ether (ETH) as commodities in the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) suit against Binance might mean XRP tokens are classified as commodities as well. That might hurt the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case against Ripple claiming the tokens are securities. Classification as a commodity could mean Ripple wins the case – which some traders may consider bullish for XRP.  Other tokens also rallied. Ether rose 4% as Ethereum developers confirmed the Shanghai (Shapella) upgrade, a fundamental release, for April 14. The upgrade will allow ether stakers to withdraw tokens for the first time, among other network improvements such as improved transactional fees.  Cardano's ADA jumped 8%, bnb tokens (BNB) recovered 1.9%, erasing some of this week's losses and Polygon's MATIC gained 7% on the introduction of its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine in what may become one of 2023’s hottest blockchain trends.  XRP, however, may dip in coming days, some on-chain analysis suggests.  Data from on-chain analytics tool Santiment cited by FxStreet shows that transactions “in profit” have reached a 19-month high, suggesting traders could lock in recent gains and contribute to falling prices.

Data from blockchain analytics firm Nansen shows that Binance’s on-chain portfolio currently stands at $64 billion. USDT, BTC, ETH, BUSD and BNB are Binance’s largest holdings, making up roughly 81% of the crypto exchange’s total balance at press time.  The reserves display the asset backing, and strength, of Binance, which may cushion outflows from the exchange at a time when some fear an FTX repeat. Binance has, as of Wednesday, had over $600 million in customer token outflows, although the figure is still relatively lower than when BUSD-issued Paxos was slapped by the New York State Department of Financial Services earlier this year. Binance processed over $2 billion in withdrawals in a single day at the time.  Recent allegations from the U.S. Commodity Futures Commission against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao “should be a slap on the wrist,” Fundstrat analyst Walter Teng told CoinDesk over Twitter.  While Binance depositors rushed to exit from the ecosystem, ”without recursive leverage using bnb [or] busd, [it’s] tough to imagine there will be a force unwind,“ he said. Binance’s on-chain portfolio shows the amount of capital people hold on the world’s largest exchange by transaction volume.  According to Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, funds, traders and investors who have exposure to Binance see the current situation as “business as usual.”  “The news from the CFTC hasn’t caused investor panic. That’s extended into those holding value in Binance …Binance isn’t well known for being the most transparent exchange, yet they’ve managed to weather many storms,” Storry told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.

Blockchain data shows several tokens were exchanged in the wee hours on Wednesday in a single transaction, with the attacker ultimately stealing billions of Safemoon’s SFM tokens locked on an LP.  A liquidity pool is a basket of tokens locked in a smart contract. Liquidity pools are used to facilitate decentralized trading, lending, and borrowing between users without relying on third parties.  Safemoon’s SFM tokens fell over 40% in early Asian hours before slightly recovering at writing time.  Safemoon is a decentralized finance (DeFi) token that has four functions that take place during each trade: fee reflection, LP acquisition, token burn and growth fund – with these factors contributing to making safemoon one of the biggest gainers in the 2021 bull market.  Safemoon developers said Wednesday their liquidity pool had been compromised. “We want to inform you that our LP has been compromised. We are taking swift action in an attempt to resolve the issue as soon as possible,” developers tweeted.  Safemoon CEO John Karony said in a followup tweet the exploit was related to a single LP on BNB Chain.  “I want to make clear that our DEX is safe. This ultimately affected the SFM:BNB LP pool,” Karony said. “We have located the suspected exploit, patched the vulnerability, and are engaging a chain forensics consultant to determine the precise nature and extent of the exploit.”  Some developers pointed to a faulty burn feature on Safemoon’s smart contracts as a key reason behind the exploit.  “The attacker took advantage of the public burn function, this function let any user burn tokens from ANY other address (code attached),” Dappd CEO DeFi Mark posted on Twitter.  “The attacker used this function to remove SFM tokens from the Safemoon-WBNB Liquidity Pool, artificially raising the price of SFM,” DeFi Mark noted, adding this was an “extremely elementary exploit that many contracts in the space have been falling victim to.”",NEGATIVE,BNB,MINING | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/29/safemoon-lp-exploited-for-89m-sfm-tokens-remain-safe-ceo-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85ea389d8d87a2a20495830b14814349200c11fb-2600x1950.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412493,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl55yM,1680067800,The Algorand Foundation Branches Out to India,"Blockchain protocol Algorand (ALGO) has entered the world’s most populous country, India, with a project that aims to support the nation’s transformation from the back office of the Web2 world to the innovation hub of the Web3 world, two senior representatives told CoinDesk. Millions of Indians take on outsourced work from Silicon Valley companies and global banks.  Launched on Wednesday, AlgoBharat won’t have a registered entity in India but will see a dedicated team focus on real world utility for blockchain in India with relevance for the rest of the world, the representatives said. The word Bharat represents the nation of India.  “India was effectively the back office of Web2, right? The innovation might have been led somewhere else,” said Anil Kakani, the India country head at the Algorand Foundation. “Blockchain use cases that have the greatest real world utility are happening here in India.”  For the past several weeks, Kakani and Nikhil Varma, the tech lead for AlgoBharat have been traversing the nation’s engineering universities and blockchain friendly states but have stayed clear of the rule makers.  “We will certainly engage with regulators this year,” said Kakani, who was a senior adviser for India at the U.S. Treasury. “We have been understanding the appetite for Web3 here. When we do talk to regulators, we will come with the track record of working with the National Bank of Italy and the Marshall Islands CBDC project.”  India’s position on crypto has gone from the central bank trying to ban the industry’s access to financial services to a stiff tax regimen in 2022. Currently, India is pushing for global consensus on rules for crypto assets as the President of the Group of 20 nations (G-20), while also asking the Web3 and blockchain industry to decouple itself from crypto.  “We think the regulatory framework that's beginning to get laid out in India makes a lot of sense,” Varma said. ""Bringing India’s Web3 companies under the prevention-of-money-laundering rules for clarity with [know-your-customer] and [anti-money laundering] laws is a sign of institutionalizing the space and we think it's positive.”  Algorand’s India plan is broken up into three pillars – broaden the Web3 developer base through education and events at universities, focus on startups that are transitioning from Web2 to Web3 and focus on high-profile use case partnerships with the central and state governments.  “These partnerships with governments and ministries are already happening,” said Kakani. “They have hundreds of thousands if not millions of users and we want to handhold their transition to address key bottlenecks in their systems from a Web2 to a Web3 solution.”  So far Algorand has partnered with the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) to support women-led enterprises building blockchain solutions, with Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and the Indian School of Business to launch faculty development programs, and with T-Hub, a prominent innovation hub, as its first blockchain partner to support startups.  MAPay, a global healthcare technology firm has partnered with the state of Maharashtra in India to create 100 million NFTs built on Algorand that will store personal health data.

42393753,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA1a1,1680064297,The Liability of DAOs and Their Founders Has Been Put to the Test in Court,"A U.S. court in California has ruled in favor of plaintiffs who alleged that the bZx protocol, and governance token-holding members of its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), were negligent and liable for losses resulting from a hack that drained its treasury.  The putative class action against bZx, its founders, software developers Leveragebox LLC and Hashed Labs LLC was initiated in July 2022.  While the court dismissed some of the claims, such as claims that founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner are personally liable for breaching fiduciary duty, the fact that it allowed the negligence claims to proceed has created a landmark ruling in the relatively murky topic of the liability of governance token holders in DAOs.  The decision implies that DAO members might be held liable for negligence, potentially undermining the already challenged decentralized nature of DAOs, while providing a defense for founders who have seen their creations accused of wrongdoing.  Drained wallets  The case stems from the $55 million hack of decentralized finance (DeFi) lender bZx in 2021, which resulted because a developer downloaded an email attachment containing malware. Not only did the attacker drain the wallet of the BZRX token, but other digital assets like ether. This is on top of other hacks the protocol suffered in 2020, one of which was for $8 million, while two others that occurred were for $630,000 and $350,000.  As a response to the hack, the bZx DAO passed a governance motion to compensate token holders 1:1 for their lost BZRX tokens and a debt repayment plan which would repay holders for their other stolen crypto. The time horizon of this repayment plan was unacceptable for holders, hence the class-action lawsuit.  The bZx DAO later rebranded to Ooki DAO, which many – including courts – have called its successor. In late 2022, the DAO’s co-founders paid $250,000 to settle a case with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding off-exchange tokenized margin trading and lending services.  What fiduciary duty and care does a DAO have?  Before the court was the question of whether all persons holding BZRX tokens are part of a general partnership.  At the core of the case are how the concepts of fiduciary duty (the obligation to act in the best interest), the duty of care (the obligation to act without negligence), as well as joint and several liability (a responsibility that is shared by multiple parties), apply to the concept of a DAO and governance token holders. While existing case law has created plenty of guidance on how these concepts apply to traditional finance (TradFi) partnership structures like general and limited partnerships, DAOs are something of an undiscovered country given their unique structure.  The plaintiffs, citing California law, argued that general partnerships exist when there is an “association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit,” including the caveat that partnerships can be unintentional, which is held up by case law.  The court found that the bZx protocol meets the definition of a general [artnership because of how the token holders can both suggest and vote on governance proposals, including hiring and dispersing treasury assets to token holders in the same way that a corporation authorizes dividends.  The CFTC took a similar approach in its 2021 complaint against Ooki DAO. As of January, the CFTC is asking a judge for a default judgment in the Ooki DAO case as it hasn’t responded.  “Given this context, the Court disagrees that recognizing the bZx DAO as a general partnership would be a ‘radical expansion and alteration of long-standing principles of partnership law,’” the ruling reads.  And with this comes the liability that arises out of a general partnership. The involvement that token holders have in the business via participation in governance protocols also means they have a duty of care, the court found, including that the protocol was properly maintained and had sufficient security measures.  Are DAO founders personally liable?  The next question before the courts was whether the founders themselves are liable for the DAO, and if they could be held responsible for their inaction and negligence.  This is where the concept of joint and several liability comes into play. Joint and several liability refers to the legal concept where multiple parties can be held responsible for the same negligent action, and each party can be held liable for the entire amount of damages, regardless of their individual contribution.  If this concept were to be applied to the DAO’s founders, that means each defendant, in theory, would have been held responsible for the damages suffered by the plaintiffs due to the $55 million hack.  But the court found that complaints against developers Leveragebox LLC and Hashed Labs LLC failed to provide the necessary elements to establish claims of negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and joint and several liability.  ""Because Plaintiffs have failed to allege that the Moving Defendants had actual authority to control the bZx DAO, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to allege joint and several liability,” the docket reads.  Separately, a claim against founder Tom Bean was dismissed because the court found that the plaintiffs hadn’t brought sufficient evidence to show that a California court had jurisdiction over him.

42412502,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl564u,1680054515,First Mover Asia: Will CFTC's Action Against Binance Benefit Crypto’s Asia Narrative?,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Ether is outperforming bitcoin as the CFTC reiterates ether should be under its purview, not the SEC's.  Insights: The CFTC's lawsuit against Binance is part of the increasing regulator scrutiny that crypto is undergoing. Will the suit – and other enforcement actions – ultimately help Asia's crypto narrative?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,185 +22.7 ▲ 2.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,302 +435.7 ▲ 1.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,778 +73.6 ▲ 4.3% S&P 500  3,971.27 −6.3 ▼ 0.2% Gold  $1,972 +20.0 ▲ 1.0% Nikkei 225  27,518.25 +41.4 ▲ 0.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Ether Up on CFTC Remarks, Bitcoin Flat as Market Digests Binance Suit and Awaits Economic Data  Good morning, Asia.  This week is proving to be a tumultuous one for news.  First, Binance was sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over alleged regulatory violations regarding its derivatives products. Next, Sam Bankman-Fried faces another indictment, this one regarding allegations of bribing officials in China, making some wonder if this will damp Beijing’s mood toward the asset class. Finally, to bring it back to the CFTC, Chair Rostin Behnam reiterated Tuesday during a hearing that he believes ether is a commodity.  How’s crypto reacting to this?  Bitcoin (BTV) is trading flat, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours to $27,302. Ether (ETH) is up just under 4.3% to $1,778.  Given that the CFTC chief reiterated once again, before the U.S. Congress, that the regulator believes ether is a commodity – and not a security as the Securities and Exchange Commission would think – tokens in its orbit are also well in the green.  Staking provider Lido saw its token rise by over 12% to $45.81, and Lido staked ether is outperforming ether at on-day gains of 6.5%. Meanwhile, on-chain derivatives exchange GMX’s token is up by 8.7%, perhaps because traders are looking for derivatives infrastructure they believe is beyond the reach of the CFTC (though decentralization, historically, hasn’t been a great defense).  Tokens associated with layer 1 and layer 2 platforms are also in the green, with SOL at 3.5%, DOT at 3.6%, ADA at 6.6% and MATIC at 4.3%.

Insights  The CFTC Cracks Down. Will Asia Benefit?  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Monday action against Binance was a surprise to some and an annoyance to many.  Sure, traders who use Binance, like the U.S.-based prop shops with offshore accounts, holders of its BNB token, are some of the people who are annoyed.  But more importantly, it's those who want the U.S. to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto and stop ruling by enforcement.  In 2020, calendar years ago but centuries in crypto time, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced the Securities Clarity Act, which sought to create a new legal category called “investment contract asset.”  “This new term would refer to any asset sold as part of an investment contract that would not be considered a ‘security’ but for its sale as part of an investment contract,” was how it was described in a September 2020 statement on Emmer’s website.  Effectively, it was a framework for crypto similar to what the Monetary Authority of Singapore has developed, or what authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan are also working on: rules made in the 2020s for an asset class of the internet era, not relying on an interpretation of a court case from 1946.  “The fact remains that digital assets like cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly into the [Securities and Exchange Commission’s] regulatory framework,” Bo Howell, an Ohio-based securities lawyer, wrote in a January 2022 post explaining the contested authority over crypto.  Instead, we have regulation by enforcement. Attempts to dictate things via court rulings, not a rulebook to which all parties have access.  In March, Coinbase asked for just that: rule-making.  As part of a legal proceeding concerning an ex-Coinbase staff member accused of insider trading, the SEC is attempting to establish a comprehensive definition for securities that encompasses the majority of cryptocurrency tokens, by pursuing securities fraud allegations against the former employee.  “The SEC’s suit rests on the erroneous premise that the seven Coinbase-listed assets identified in its complaint are ‘securities.’ But Coinbase does not list any securities on its platform,” an amicus brief Coinbase filed as part of the case in March reads. “The SEC posits that the digital assets qualify as securities because they are “investment contract[s], but the assets lack both essential attributes of that statutory term: They are neither contracts nor investments.”  Something similar happened in December. The SEC made the case that FTX's exchange token, FTT, is a security as part of a complaint against FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. The duo are pleading guilty and looking to cooperate with authorities, meaning the SEC's allegations won't be tested in the adversarial environment of a courtroom.  The SEC hasn’t given Coinbase – or any other exchange – anything close to the rulebook they've asked for. There’s no official code to read; lawyers instead have to interpret court filings and read the tea leaves on possible interpretations.  “This ongoing and ever-changing regulatory environment hinders well-designed compliance and regulatory plans,” Braden Perry, a former attorney for the CFTC, said in a 2020 interview.  His analysis still holds true today.  “The last thing any industry wants is what the SEC and CFTC have done: regulation by enforcement, in which agencies decide that some practices should have been illegal, [and then] go back and prosecute the people who were doing it before,” he continued.  In a January 2023 interview with CoinDesk, Rep. Emmer said that more legislation is coming. The right kind, hopefully, and not the stuff that drives an industry offshore.  “We’re going to focus obviously on legislation, and I think it’s going to be to place key guardrails around the industry,” Emmer said. “Market structure guardrails. Stablecoin guardrails. Things like that.”  Right now, this seems bullish for Asia. China’s state-owned banks are soliciting crypto business in Hong Kong, something that would be unheard of or even considered absurd for its sheer unlikeliness if mentioned years ago.  But this is crypto. Stuff moves fast. Can America keep up? Maybe it's not a bad thing if the industry moves to Asia.
