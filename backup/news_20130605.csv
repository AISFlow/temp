42424945,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Ph,1370466391,Butterfly Labs launches new charity while still behind on shipments,"It's really hard to imagine a more ADD-afflicted, over-promising, under-delivering company than Butterfly Labs, and they're at it again. After just now managing to ship orders that were put in over a year ago for their ASIC miners (with an original fulfillment timeline of three months) and with plenty of more backlogged orders yet to be shipped, Butterfly Labs announced a couple of days ago that it would start taking orders for bulk chip sales. Now, today, they've started a charity called the Bitcoin Development Fund – oh look a SQUIRREL!  Butterfly Labs announced this morning on their Facebook, the following:    “Today, Butterfly Labs is giving a sneak peak at a new project that aims to promote charties and other projects that benefit the greater bitcoin community. The new site is called Bitcoin Development Fund and is intended to be a gathering place for those who wish to donate to various projects or charities through the use of bitcoin, but may not know where to go to do so or how to properly vet credible charities and projects.      Because we missed our power targets we set forth when we began our ASIC development, we are starting off the fund with a donation of 1000 BTC, which is valued currently over $120,000 USD. The BDF project will allocate funds to worthy charities and project as time goes on. Currently the BDF site is in phase one of the roll out, but more user interaction and participation in the selection of projects and charities to donate to is planned for phase two and three.    If you have a charity or open source project that you believe benefits the greater bitcoin community, please feel free to submit it to submit@bitcoindf.org. It will be reviewed and vetted by BitcoindDF for inclusion into the site.    If you wish to donate to the fund, you can send BTC to: 1ERVh27gZfPSDaaagL9R3W12xpMJ38ZBA7”    So far the fund has accumulated 773.946 BTC, which comes out to roughly $94,428 at the current USD/BTC value. The website – Bitcoindf.org – states that the fund was created to support projects that benefit the greater Bitcoin community. Although Butterfly Labs has stated on their Facebook that their production/development teams are not impacted by the creation of the charity program and that they are two entirely different departments, one Facebook commentator named Stephen Evangelou mirrored just about everybody's initial reactions:  “How about you stop wasting your valuable time and start pleasing some of the customers who made your company what is is today with pre-orders.”    Also, Zsolt Katona who posted,    “Ok, that is nice, but what the hell about SC shipping??? When will we got it? About 3 months? I have preordered 4 SC at august 2012. How many years I will have to wait for this product??? My outstanding profit is more than 37 000$/month, calculate actually data....Soo...”    Don't forget Dan Inglis who, in Lolcat fashion, posted,    “But I would like miner please”    Yes, Butterfly Labs, we can has mine now?  Even though it's true that Butterfly Labs' new charity is a separate department, the worrisome thing is how thin they seem to be spreading themselves as a whole. They keep adding new products and new services and new announcements, without even the most basic abilities to fulfill their initial orders. Even though they're doing better with shipment now, the fact still remains that they are shipping for products that were ordered a full year ago with no real gauge as to whether or not recent orders will be delivered anytime soon (will those take another year as well?). Not only that, but they're shipping Jalapenos, not the other ASIC models that people have been waiting on for over a year.  No one doubts that Butterfly Labs has good products (although few have seen them) or that they have good intentions, no more than anyone can doubt the intentions of a wide-eyed little boy who thinks he can build a go-kart out of cinder blocks. The fact is that the company seems to be overreaching, when really they should be putting all of their effort into the one thing that people want – their darn ASIC mines! The more they keep up these announcements while simultaneously making vague excuses mixed with long periods of silence, the more people may lose faith in their abilities.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/butterfly-labs-launches-new-charity-while-still-behind-on-shipments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8436ca3dc4665e86224c49ca467a765ead2c07f5-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6dh,1370463817,Butterfly Labs finally ships out last year's Jalapeno orders,"Finally, after more than a year of waiting, those who preordered the 5GH/s Jalapeno ASIC Bitcoin miner from Butterfly Labs should start receiving their orders. Butterfly Labs announced today that nearly every Jalapeno order through July 3rd 2012 has been shipped out. They have promised that every backlogged order will be shipped within the next 90 days and this morning they posted a picture up of over 100 units that were on their way out the door.  Butterfly Labs has been the source of much excitement and almost equal scorn since they started taking orders for their much anticipated ASIC miners last year. Initially they told people that their orders would start shipping in a matter of three months, and preorders flooded in. Over a year later almost no one had received anything. To make matters worse, Butterfly Labs (BFL) seemed to continually make shallow excuses as to why they weren't able to ship, that is if they were responding to customers at all.  Many of Butterfly Labs' customers who ordered this year have been asking for clarification on when their ASICs may come in. In classic style, they haven't received a response, which leaves the community up to murmuring speculation, the general consensus being that if it took BFL this long to ship the orders from last year, that those who ordered this year won't receive anything until 2014. Of course, with limited information, it's difficult to say if this is true, but we do know that barely anybody that has ordered thus far this year has actually received their miner, despite the website still stating that most shipments will arrive within three months.  They are shipping though, so it's better late than never, right? The problem is that people who put in orders for ASIC miners last year – specifically the Jalapeno – did so under certain conditions within the Bitcoin economy. Remember this was before Bitcoin was all over the news, before it was even above $30 in value, and before everybody and their Aunt wanted a piece of the action. Imagine how painful it was for those who ordered all the way back in March 2012 to see the news in April 2013 of $250 BTC prices. Ouch.  Since those orders were put in, the amount of people who have joined the Bitcoin network as miners has jumped exponentially. Not only that, but Avalon – another ASIC developer – has actually managed to ship several batches of their miners on time. This means that those little 5GH/s Jalapenos that were ordered over a year ago are not going to be pulling in anywhere near the amount of BTC now that it would have this time last year. You would be lucky to be pulling in 1.5 Bitcoins a week under current difficulty with a single Jalapeno.  This raises a question – if mining with a single 5GH/s Jalapeno only brings in about 1.5 BTC each week under current difficulty, what the heck is going to happen when all of these orders are delivered, and those units join the network in the next 90 days? The difficulty is going to sky rocket and fast, which means the poor souls who spent their money this year – especially in just the last couple of months – and who may realistically not receive their orders until 2014 are going to be dealing with the reality that their state-of-the-art Butterfly Labs ASIC is now a dinky little thing of the past compared to what it was during the time of the actual order.  Are ASICs bad? Not at all, but they definitely change things. Before ASICs people typically designed their own mining rigs using GPUs and FPGA technology, which took a certain amount of know-how, startup costs, and space to house the bitcoin miners, not to mention a high electric bill. Now, as long as you can shell out a few hundred dollars, you can start mining on the Bitcoin network with about as much wattage as it takes to power a light bulb. This means that GPU mining will most likely die, and people will be racing to buy their own ASIC chips to build super ASICs that can compete with consumer-grade ASICs for the hobbyist wanting to delve into mining.  It will be interesting to see what kind of impact these new shipments have on the mining difficulty of Bitcoin. Let's hope Butterfly Labs will get their act together for the people who purchased this year, or else a return on investment, or even breaking-even is going to take a lot longer than their customers had originally anticipated.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/butterfly-labs-finally-ships-out-last-years-jalapeno-orders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad30234f5b24e2557d966805946b84635adcc25f-619x466.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424942,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Jh,1370450995,Spend your bitcoins! More shops now accept BTC,"Poke around on long-time crytpocurrency forums and you'll find the elder members there still talking about the newbies entering the marketplace. Of course, Bitcoin itself is only four years old, but that's like.... fifty years ago in Internet time. A lot of the talk is centered around how the Bitcoin gold rush is bringing in a lot of people with a mentality starkly different from the one that many early adopters had, which is to think about BTC as an actual currency rather than a long-term investment geared toward making the investor rich.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with investing or wanting to be rich, but with this mentality has come a hoarding thought process and the community is turning into a bunch of miserly old gold miners hiding stashes of bitcoins atop their figurative hills.  Yet, in order to really help with increasing the value of Bitcoin in the long term while stabilizing its notorious volatility, we must remember that we can do a little more with our stash other than, well, stashing it. We can also spend it, and make an effort to spend it by supporting new online and offline stores.  So far there hasn't been a whole lot of options for spending Bitcoins. Sure, there are a couple of great things happening in NYC such as EVR – a swanky upscale club that allows patrons to pay their tab in BTC – and Domino's pizza even accepts BTC now. However, for the most part, users have been using BTC to buy consumer electronics through various BTC sites or on Silk Road (that is if they're spending them at all).  Now we can add one more very practical online shopping option that allows BTC, and that is Bitfash.com – the first upscale apparel shopping site that allows Bitcoin enthusiasts to purchase from major fashion retailers. Vendors already include Forever 21, Zara, and Mr. Porter with many more to come.  What's so exciting about this is it marks the first time that Bitcoin owners will be able to buy very practical and sought after clothing from major global brands – clothing they would be shopping for online anyway.  I recently connected with Keyur Kelkar – one of the co-founders of Bitfash – to talk about his vision for the site.  “We originally came from an investment banking background specializing mostly in acquisitions. So, our thought process crossed over such as option pricing, market theory, how to value something, how to value business, and so on – we tried to understand it from that perspective,” Said Keyur in a very analytical tone. “What we noticed was that people were using Bitcoin more as a store of wealth, but we wanted it to be used as an actual currency – we wanted to give users the ability to use this currency in real life.”  Although Bitfash.com is not affiliated with any of its retailers, what it does is service BTC holders by allowing them to buy things on the vendor websites using the digital currency. That way, Bitfash.com doesn't mark up or down the cost of the product or the cost of shipping – the prices the vendor sets are the prices you pay other than a small service transaction on behalf of Bitfash.  Hopefully we'll see many more services like this springing up that make it easier for people to pay for everyday items in BTC. However, the question still remains, “What advantages are there to using Bitcoin as payment when I can just use PayPal, credit card, or cash?”  People want to know of real-life examples where Bitcoin solves real pressing problems with payments that are not addressable in any other way, such as being cheaper and easier. It's kind of like when email came out, people weighed the options of going out and spending a bunch of money on a fancy computer and Internet while having to learn the operating system versus simply using the post office. On the one hand, email seemed like a good idea, but a whole bunch of hassle to setup. On the other hand, they could just walk to the end of their driveway and flick up a red flag – done.  Yet, as time progressed, email became exponentially more refined. Not only that, but the technology as a whole became easier to understand, which dramatically broadened the user demographic, this is exactly what we need to see with Bitcoin, which is why so many startups are being funded.  But, even right now – right this second – paying for items in Bitcoin has a real, quantifiable advantage over credit cards, PayPal, cash, or wire transfers for various types of payments and situations. Let's look at some of those now.  Cheaper – Let's say I'm a merchant in Texas and I need to import goods from China. My shipment costs $100,000. If I use a wire transfer or PayPal I will have to pay a fee of about 2.7% ($2,700). With Bitcoin my fee is closer to 1% or less, which makes a huge difference with that volume of money (it would cost $1,100 at 0.55%)  Speed/ease – Let's go back to that same shipment. If I pay the $100,000 for that shipment using PayPal or wire transfer it will take approximately a week to go through. The more money the payment, the longer it takes. But, with Bitcoin it will take about an hour.  Less paperwork/more privacy – Let's say I need to sign a contract for a loan that proves that both parties agree to the terms. Typically, I would need to send the money and the other person would have to make timely payments. I would need to use a notary at a bank, keep track of bank account numbers, and utilize the court system in case problems arise in a he-said/she-said fashion. However, with Bitcoin, I could just write out a contract and sign it using the private keys of the addresses of both lender and borrower. Then, I could use those same addresses to send out the loan and receive payments. There would literally be no need for either party to use personal information because the blockchain can publicly verify that the addresses used in the contract have sent and received money and at what times this occurred. This is also safer.  Easier, cheaper Escrow – Let's say I'm a service provider who is entering into a project agreement with a client. Of course, we have to be safe, so we decide to escrow the total payment and agree it should be released in full when the project is completed. I have to find a third party escrow service that will hold the client's money for them, which can be quite pricy. Both parties have to trust the escrow, and there's always a risk that the escrow is working with either party, which allows theft. With Bitcoin, I can create a multi-sig transaction where the money is sent from the client to me, but in a way that we both have to sign off on it in order for the transaction to clear. The client can't run off with the money, which provides me with peace of mind and I can't take the money and not do the job, which provides the client with peace of mind. All of this without a third party involved.  International payments – Let's say I live in the US and need to pay someone (perhaps a contractor) in Russia, India, Argentina, or another high risk country. I can't use PayPal, because they don't allow transactions there. I could do a wire transfer provided my bank trusts me to, but it would still cost $15 and take a while. Or, I could just pay with Bitcoin, it would cost a small transaction fee, and I will be guaranteed that the money reaches its destination.  Safer overall online payments – There is always a risk that your credit card number or any other information you send through the Internet can be stolen, especially if you're purchasing products online. With Bitcoin, money is transferred using a Bitcoin address, and no credit card information, or any other personal information is needed such as address, telephone number, or social security number.  Just as techie people in 1992 could see the value of Internet and its resulting technologies such as email while most of the rest of the world saw it as a fringe practice (just use the mailbox! Why? Because it's already there!) we are faced with the same reaction to Bitcoin now. When you had Internet back then, you weren't really sure what to do with it. If you didn't have it, you didn't understand the need for it.  As it is now, people that have Bitcoins aren't really sure what to do with them, and those that don't have them aren't sure why anyone does.  So you could save your bitcoins - but you could try spending a few. Put into practice the currency, pay for things using it and encourage other vendors to accept them. The advantages over using traditional forms of payment may not be immediately recognizable, but they are there and they are numerous.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | BTG,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/spend-your-bitcoins-more-shops-now-accept-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4119706ffc34d73f160a5ba6e2c6dccf7394a77d-460x276.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424953,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6bh,1370444332,Ripple turns on giveaway faucet,"Altcurrency-cum-payment network Ripple turned on the faucet late last week, announcing a long-anticipated giveaway. The company sent ‘ripples’, units of its alternative currency, also known as XRP, to over 25,000 beta users.  The users had signed up to the email list as part of the giveaway. The coins are designed primarily to enable trading on the Ripple payment system. Every time a trade is made, a fraction of a ripple is destroyed from a finite amount. To make a trade in any currency, a Ripple account must have 12 ripples available for each order. And an account must be stocked with 50 ripples to be active.  Each user received 1000 ripples, and at the time of writing, they are still being pumped out in batches of 1000 every few minutes. But soon after the giveaway began, several users began complaining of errors. Some received messages telling them that their code had expired when they try to redeem it for ripples, while others got straight 404 pages.  There are 100 billion ripples in the entire currency, with roughly 20 billion held by the founders. The rest were transferred to OpenCoin, the company that currently controls ripple and the payment network.  However, in addition to serving as a security mechanism, ripples also have their own value. If the value gets too high, it could throttle back adoption of the trading system, as people fail to stock their accounts with enough ripples to trade anything else. OpenCoin founder Chris Larsen says that the relationship between account reserve requirements and the price of ripples is dynamic, and can self-regulate.  “As the value of the ripple currency increases or decreases, the servers in the network can raise or lower the thresholds for the reserve and transactions limits on their own through a process of consensus,” said Larsen. “As a result, Ripple is always working to build maximum utility and liquidity within the system. At the same time, it's important to remember that Ripple can accommodate any currency – so the value of XRP does not limit the use of Ripple for payments, transfers, remittances, etc.”  Giveaways aren't unique to Ripple. Many new cryptocurrencies enjoy ‘faucets’ in their first few weeks of life, in which pre-mined coins are given away to stimulate interest and get others mining the currency. However, in Ripple’s case, all the coins are effectively pre-mined, and it’s the growth of the payment network that they are hopefully stimulating, by encouraging more people to use Ripple accounts and trade using ripples.  The biggest challenge for Ripple, however, is getting more gateways and merchants to join the network, creating more links between the Ripple payment system and other businesses.  On May 31, Ripples closed at XRP 62.57 to the USD. At that value, assuming that 25,000 beta users received 1000 ripples, OpenCoin just dropped $400,000 into the market. The founders would, incidentally, be worth $320 million in ripples at that price. On Tuesday, Ripples closed at 54 to each US dollar.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | XRP,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/ripple-turns-on-giveaway-faucet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f6b56078041113a8386c14215afae9d146921ac7-2606x1944.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424951,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Zh,1370430863,The futility of regulating Bitcoin,"Historical precedents have shown that whenever the people have a means of obtaining items of currency (effectively) out of the ground, that governments will step in and not only demand a piece of the action, but will eventually shut it down. For example, the US government eventually made it illegal to use gold as currency, despite the gold rush that added so much to the country's wealth. The same may well happen with Bitcoin, as governments become nervous of a currency being created that is beyond their control, regulation may be imposed to prevent Bitcoin mining.  When Bitcoin began, it was easy to solve the cryptographic problems involved, so much so that CPU mining was practical. As the difficulty of these problems grew, the computation was handed off to graphical cards (i.e. GPUs) which are better suited to the type of calculations involved. At this point, Bitcoins were still being created with domestic hardware – even if it was the type of hardware that a hardcore gamer would own.  At the time or writing, we find ourselves with roughly half of all bitcoins having been mined. The difficulty the cryptographic calculations have created the need for application specific integrated chips (ASICs). These are digital form of heavy duty mining equipment, and is what will drive on the creation of bitcoins. If governments seek to take over, the otherwise anonymous, production of bitcoins then we may well see ASICs made illegal, or at least only available under expensive licencing.  There would be a degree of folly in this, though, as it is still possible for members of the public to mine bitcoins with their gaming rigs, and more importantly, band together in secret pools to combine their resources. Furthermore, limiting voluntary mining of bitcoins is short-sighted as there will always be other countries who will not outlaw such creation of wealth, those countries could then take over the production of bitcoins. Those may well be the same countries that western capitalist governments would be concerned about who would be making use of bitcoins.  In short, Pandora's Box has already been opened, and regulating won't reverse the situation. Just as with the DMCA in the US, regulation would end up hurting people who have no malicious intent, and doing nothing to stop those who are up to no good.  Because Bitcoin allows for identity free transactions, it is understandably of concern to law enforcement, and of course there is value in having an identity attached to financial transactions; e.g. for accountability and reversibility, and so identity-dependant financial systems are not going to be replaced any time soon. However, even in the face established digital payment systems (e.g. credit cards and online banking), tangible cash has not gone away either, and I expect ordinary people will eventually find equivalent online uses for digital cash – e.g. Bitcoin.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/the-futility-of-regulating-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33cb0e2cff80ae893c928a2256b31a3ceb45ebb1-1000x665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424955,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6fh,1370422688,Growth in mobile payments spells opportunity for Bitcoin,"With the value of mobile payment transactions expected to reach $721 billion (US) globally by 2017, the slice of the pie for Bitcoin's taking is growing. This year alone, the value of mobile payment transactions is forecast to total $235.4 billion, a 44 percent jump from 2012's $163.1 billion, according to the latest figures from Gartner.  The leading uses for mobile payments are money transfers -- which are said to account for 71 percent of 2013's total transaction value -- and merchandise purchases at 21 percent. Though bill payments are expected to grow by 44 percent this year, their share is still low. By 2017, the research firm expects bill payments to make up 5 percent of total mobile payment value. Near field communication (NFC) adoption remains stalled; the report predicts NFC payments to account for 2 percent of this year's mobile transaction value and 5 percent by 2017.  Given bitcoin's volatility, no such forecast exists for the cryptocurrency, which has a market cap of about $1.35 billion as of Tuesday and can see $30 million worth of coins transacted in a single day. But BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi says there are limitations to mobile payments that bitcoins overcome.  ""Mobile payments are a booming business with hundreds of companies spending millions of dollars to fight each other,"" he said. ""But every mobile payment company has the same two problems.""  The first, he says, is that mobile payment companies ""are all walled gardens, and users cannot transact outside the walls.""  Additionally, Gallippi, who is in London this week for a conference, said these providers don't work internationally. ""I can have 10 mobile payment apps on the phone, but if I go to Europe, not a single one of them will do me any good.""

42424950,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Xh,1370419056,FinCEN quizzed on mining regs,"Do the FinCEN virtual currency regulations apply to Bitcoin miners in addition to exchanges? No one seems sure, but now, one consultant wants to find out. A US consulting firm has written to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) in the US, asking it to clarify its position on bitcoin mining.  Atlantic City Bitcoin (ACB), registered in the state of New Jersey, has requested an administrative ruling to determine once and for all how the FinCEN rules, announced in March, apply to mining.  ACB's beef concerns what it highlights as a disparity in FinCEN guidance. The guidance says:  ""A person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter.""  Some interpretations argue that a bitcoin miner creates the currency, meaning that if they sell it for fiat currency, they could be regulated. Others, such as Jeff Garzik, one of the core Bitcoin developers who recently began working at Bitpay, say that there's nothing to worry about as long as they effectively outsource the transmission process to a licensed exchange.  The problem is, none of these people are lawyers, making their arguments about whether miners are to be regulated little more than conjecture. As ACB points out, when you're dealing with potentially large amounts of money, you ideally want any regulatory body to be very clear on its definitions.  The ACB request attempts to cut through the whole tangled mess by focusing the discussion on another document: FinCEN’s definition of a money transmitter. It uses this document to propose that miners could never be classified as money transmitters, no matter what FinCEN's virtual currency guidance may say. In particular, this piece of text:  ""The term 'money transmission services' means the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means.""  ACB proposes that this makes it impossible to call a bitcoin miner a transmitter, because they do not receive value from another party. ""Since the coins were created during mining it is not possible to have accepted them from another person,"" the ACB proposal says. It also adds that bitcoin minors are not administrators because they cannot remove coins from circulation. It argues that they are not exchanges either, meaning that the only other way to define them in FinCEN terms is as users, which it says would also leave them exempt from categorization as a money services business.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/fincen-quizzed-on-mining-regs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dae33016a578e2caae583e55086b72e2627543fe-628x419.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424939,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Fh,1370414957,WhereToMine highlights rich altcoin deposits,"Not sure where to mine next? The proliferation of alternative crypto-currencies - also known as 'altcoins' - can be confusing, even for experienced miners, who may not be sure where to point their GPUs. Should you mine Luckycoin, Devcoin, Nibble or PPCoin? Powercoin, Terracoin or Worldcoin? Sites are appearing to help you choose.  One of them is WhereToMine.com. Started by 35-year-old Kevin De Angelis, a senior software developer for deals website Zulily, the site is designed to help people choose which alt-currencies to mine for.  “I couldn’t decide which coin I wanted to get interested in, and I had come across some websites that showed their value and difficulty,” said De Angelis, who is new to cryptocurrencies. “I also found some sites that had mining calculators on them, but they were for specific coins.” He wanted a site that listed all of the coins’ statistics, alongside the calculations for mining them.  WhereToMine.com (WTM) mashes up data from a number of sources, including coinchoose.com, cryptsy.com and bitcoincharts.com. It includes data points such as difficulty, and the coin reward per block. But it has some other functions, including a sparkline showing the historical profitability of a particular coin compared to Bitcoin.  Of particular interest is the built-in calculator, which takes hash rate inputs for both the SHA–256 algorithm underpinning Bitcoin (and derivatives such as Freicoin), and the alternative Scrypt algorithm, used by Litecoin, Feathercoin and others. Entering your hash rate calculates the likely coins per day that you can expect for each alt-currency, along with the equivalent fiat currency value on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.  Other calculation sites will often offer more detailed data, such as rates of return on hardware investments and offsets for power consumption. However, these are generally dedicated to particular coins. This aggregated site offers a quick and easy view across a range of alt-currencies, leaving users to make their own adjustments for extra environmental data.  At least one other mining ROI aggregator is building more inputs into its calculator. Dustcoin.com has a mining section that takes the power consumption (in watts) used by a rig, along with the local power cost, and spits out a set of calculations with that factored in. However, it offers just 24 coins in its analysis, compared to WhatToMine.com’s 33.  How reliable are these aggregator sites? Calculating mining return is an imprecise art at the best of times. Early on, WhatToMine.com was predicting a $14 per day profit mining WorldCoin (WDC), said one poster on bitcointalk.org, arguing that this was wildly off.  To be fair, some have pointed out WDC fluctuations before. But De Angelis admits that variation among mining pools (which are more or less mandatory for any serious miner) can be a confounder when calculating the returns on investment, because each pool has its own characteristics. So the site comes with a disclaimer.  “I have found that this information depends on the pool and the miners involved in it,” he said. Some have different rates of stale shares, which are redundant blocks, shared after they have already been solved. “I’d like to get this information together at some point so that I can work it into the calculations, but I have to pull from many sources to do so.”  Given the potential for miscalculation, it’s useful to compare aggregator sites where possible. Mining Litecoin at 290 Khash/sec (the projected rate for an AMD 5850 GPU) will earn you $1.42 in Litecoins, according to WTM. Dustcoin predicts $1.39 at the time of writing. The predicted coin yield per day is the same, meaning that the difference is down to the exchange rate.  There is currently no revenue model for WTM, although De Angelis is working on ideas. And he isn’t much of a miner himself at the moment. “I’m in the process of building my first rig, but right now, I just use a laptop for some really pathetic CPU mining,” he joked. The few Google ads that he currently places on the site are more profitable than his miner.  But others are throwing all the computing muscle that they can at different altcoins. Sites like this will become increasingly important as ASIC miners hit the scene and scoop up large proportions of the hashing share. They will leave other users out in the cold, looking for other coins with lower difficulties to mine.  “I have yet to own or see an ASIC miner,"" De Angelis said. “In theory, they will be very profitable for those that own them and that will make it unprofitable for those that don’t. However, with all the altcoins, there are many other places to mine.”",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MINING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/05/wheretomine-highlights-rich-altcoin-deposits,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/552ace5114442349a166200330f4f453b341e9c0-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
