The token is inexorably climbing up the price charts while other tokens struggle to keep their heads above water. The crypto is steadily gaining, testing new highs after its yearly low in June when its price dipped below $50. The Quant blockchain was a project geared toward solving the issue of interaction among multiple blockchains. Since its inception in 2018, the token began an upward climb from below $1, culminating in an all-time high just below $400. This unprecedented event in the history of Quant took place in September 2021. Quant soared 200% from $187 to $490 on the month, a spike that analysts attribute to three factors.

42411366,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIqO,1664028900,"Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don’t Care Who Made It","Sometime around the nadir of the coronavirus pandemic, a plumber tugged on the mask hanging under his nose and told me with a straight face that the billionaire George Soros was responsible for his having to wear it.  If a friend said something so preposterous I would laugh and say “GTFO.” But in that moment I felt nothing but gratitude and respect toward the man who was fixing my toilet.  However far-fetched or risible, his interpretation of world affairs was irrelevant to our interaction. All that mattered in this situation was his competence as a plumber.  I forgot that story until recently, when I sat down to write about Urbit, and realized I would have to address – trigger warning, grab your puppies – the matter of its creator, Curtis Yarvin.  Urbit is an open-source software project that seeks to return networked computing to its peer-to-peer roots. Yarvin came up with the idea more than a decade ago and launched it in earnest around 2013. He is far more famous – or infamous – for his elliptical political writings, under the pen name Mencius Moldbug. I’m not going to try to summarize those. Plenty has been written already. Suffice to say Moldbug is a (self-styled) reactionary.  Yarvin left Tlon, the company he founded that spearheads Urbit development, in 2019. Yet any time journalists pay any attention to developments in Urbit, we feel obligated to spend at least a paragraph all but apologizing for Moldbug’s monarchist musings.  I’m sick of it.  Guilt by association is bad enough when it’s leveled at people, and maybe stupider when applied to inventions.  Urbit holds promise as a platform that could disintermediate the Silicon Valley behemoths that have made the internet a living hell. As discussed in a separate article published today, developers are finally shipping usable apps but must overcome serious challenges to garner adoption, not least of all a clunky user experience. (Hence the wry community meme, “Urbit: Give it a second.”)  Read more: Urbit Courts DAOs, Crypto Teams in Quest to Make Internet P2P Again  Yet just as the interminable gossipy parlor games about Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity have little if any bearing on the cryptocurrency’s utility or long-term value, Urbit should be evaluated on its own merits.  Critical distance  Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood mogul, behaved like a pig. ""Pulp Fiction,"" a film he financed, remains an all-time banger. Buy the DVD used if you don’t want any of your money to land in his bank account.  Rocker Ted Nugent has said some inappropriate things. His 1978 double-live album still shreds, and you can download it as a torrent.  Heck, the girl-group impresario Phil Spector was convicted of murder and the oldies stations still play “Be My Baby.” FM radio doesn't cost a dime.  Ezra Pound’s loathsome views about the events of his day did not make him any less of a poet. Nor did they make him any less correct when he said, “The bad critic criticizes the poet, not the poetry.” His work is in the public domain.  See a pattern here? One can appreciate a work without liking or endorsing its creator. (The reverse might sometimes be true: pop star Rick Astley seems like a lovely guy, but there’s a reason his biggest hit is a perennial internet punchline.)  As it is for music, film or poetry, so it is for technology. Software can and often does have bugs or viruses, but it doesn’t transmit cooties.  If you don’t like it, fork it  I can foresee a few objections to this line of reasoning that are a tad more sophisticated than “eww, Yarvin’s icky.” One could argue that unlike purchasing a secondhand Blu-Ray, participating in Urbit enriches Yarvin because he holds a lot of the namespace, or virtual real estate, which would gain in value if the network took off.  If that’s your only dealbreaker, remember that no one can stop a rival from copying the open-source code to create a parallel network in which Yarvin has no stake. (Pitches have been made.) Call it Burbit or Gurbit or Nurbit. So it’s theoretically possible to reap the benefits of Urbit without indirectly lining Yarvin’s pockets. Granted, it can be hard for a “fork” project to catch up with the original protocol’s network effect, as we’ve seen with the blockchains that splintered off from Bitcoin and Ethereum, or splintered from the splinters.  If you're reading CoinDesk, chances are you hold some cryptocurrency. When you buy BTC or another digital asset you are arguably benefiting existing holders, at least a few of whom may well have done much worse things than writing offensive blog posts. Does that make you want to sell? Really?  The power of exit  A stronger counter-argument might be that Urbit is not just a coincidental creation of an authoritarian thinker but an attempt to apply his political ideas to the digital realm. Those who make this case like to point to the network’s hierarchy of “ships.”  In Urbit’s quirky taxonomy, an individual user’s personal server and ID is known as a planet. Each planet is issued by a star, which in turn is issued by a galaxy. For example, my planet, ~fodrex-malmev, was spawned by the star ~litzod in the ~zod galaxy. (The Martian-sounding naming convention is one of Urbit’s many eccentricities, which are endearing to me but are liable to bewilder everyday users.)  The owner of a galaxy can issue (then sell, or give away, or keep) up to 225 stars and the owner of a star can issue (then sell, or give away, or keep) up to 65,535 planets. Once a planet is yours, though, it’s yours.  A planet costs about $40, versus thousands for a star and hundreds of thousands for a galaxy. Even $40 might sound steep considering a typical social media or email account gives you similar functionality for free – until you remember the old adage that if you’re not paying for it, you are the product. Adding a nominal but nonzero cost to an identity is intended to deter spam and misbehavior.  (Planets can issue subordinate identities called – you guessed it – moons, which they can revoke at any time, a potentially appealing concept for parents struggling to regulate their children’s screen time. There are also free disposable identities called comets, the equivalent of a Twitter account with an egg avatar and no followers. Comets cannot spawn moons, and some chat groups on Urbit won’t admit them.)  A criticism sometimes leveled at this setup is that it’s a digital form of feudalism, and thus somehow reflective of Moldbug’s admiration for monarchy. The system definitely creates scarcity. The number of galaxies is capped at 256, which works out to 4.3 billion possible planets, on a literal planet whose population is almost twice that number.  Unlike a medieval serf, however, a planet owner wields the power of exit. For example, she can always relocate her planet – including her data and social graph – to another star, provided that star is willing to accept it.  “These relationships are entirely voluntary,” said Andrea O’Sullivan, a technology writer and early adopter of Urbit and, back in the day, Bitcoin. “Any Urbit ship can change its parent at will.”  Aside from creating parcels to subdivide, the main function of a galaxy is to route connections between peers on the network. Once connected, “the two ships can generally communicate with each other directly (barring some connectivity issue),” noted O’Sullivan (whose spouse works for Tlon). “In the future, this is being decentralized further: Stars will begin routing for previously unknown peers.”  As a result, no planet is permanently tied to its issuer. “If your star or galaxy isn't a great router, you can pick a different one,” O’Sullivan said. “It does not own your data or your identity, only you do.”  The other function of these virtual celestial bodies is to transmit software updates. By default, each ship receives such updates from its parent. “Changing this is as simple as clicking a button in the interface or issuing a command in the terminal,” said O’Sullivan. “You could receive software updates from any other ship on the network, it need not be a star or galaxy.”  Crucially, planet owners can also vote with their feet when it comes to hosting. Technically advanced users can host ships on their own machines; neophytes may feel more comfortable paying a provider like Tlon to host them. But they can fire the provider at any time.  To be sure, the convenience of centralized hosting means sacrificing some degree of control. You have to trust the hosting service to delete your data after you leave, much like cryptocurrency investors who store coins on exchanges have to trust those intermediaries to guard (and not steal) their assets. But once you’ve moved your data, you can easily pick up computing where you left off with a new host or on your own computer without having to rebuild your social connections or reconstruct your content.  “It's just a key and a file and a program. That's it,” said Galen Wolfe-Pauly, Tlon’s CEO. “It's not like some bulls*** ZIP file of a bunch of different files that Google or Facebook will give you, which is completely useless without Google's infrastructure.”  So whatever Moldbug wrote about slavery (I don’t have enough time or Ritalin to read the post in which he allegedly justified it), the system he designed is enabling something arguably close to the opposite in cyberspace.  “The creator of Urbit would have to be the dumbest authoritarian ever,” said O’Sullivan. “It is designed to bake sovereignty in. The network could be populated by only Moldbug Haters clubs and there's nothing he could do about it.”  See what I did there  Hover your cursor over your browser tab and you'll see a slightly different version of the headline from the one at the top of the web page. That’s the “meta” title, optimized for search engines (and let’s be honest, it’s really optimized for one engine, Google’s). Notice how I shoehorned the accurate but tangentially relevant phrase “Thiel-Backed” in front of “Urbit.”  The billionaire Peter Thiel is a famous and controversial figure whose name is undoubtedly searched more than “Urbit.” Like Soros, he writes checks to a lot of people. Thiel has invested in Tlon and at least one other Urbit ecosystem startup, Hypertext Vienna. That’s why I crammed his name into the meta field, in order to throw off a pheromone that would arouse Google’s algorithm.  I am disgusted at myself for doing this.  But I have to, in order to minimize the risk of this piece disappearing into a black hole. And the fact that this thirsty, pathetic pandering is practically a job requirement for my profession, even if I can at least relegate it to the back end of the content management system (CMS), is symptomatic of a bigger problem with today’s internet – one that Urbit, commendably, aims to solve: the outsized power of the giant platforms.  “Like everything else on Urbit, creator content goes directly to the people it’s supposed to go to,” wrote Noah Kumin, author of a forthcoming book about Urbit, in a blog post last year. In other words, content is delivered in a peer-to-peer manner rather than through the servers of a large platform that can arbitrarily extend or curtail a creator’s reach. “No middlemen, no MEGACORP data mining, no capricious terms of service, no obscure algorithms determining what gets seen and what doesn’t.”  (Of course, without a bullhorn like Twitter or Google, writers or artists must find their audience the old-fashioned way, through word of mouth, but there is a rudimentary search engine on Urbit as well.)  Urbit isn’t a blockchain (though it uses an Ethereum smart contract to track ownership of identities). But it’s one plausible path toward Web3, the decentralized internet that many people in the blockchain community aspire to build.  One of Urbit’s most charming features is the “calm engine” found on the system preferences menu. Instead of nudging you to turn on push notifications, instead of trying to keep you glued to your device, this dashboard does the opposite, presenting a series of toggle options to make the online experience less “engaging” (which increasingly seems like a euphemism for “addictive”).  The calm engine hints at a possible future where the machines work for us, not vice versa.  Getting there will be an uphill battle. Wolfe-Pauly cites growth over recent years in the user bases of privacy-preserving browser Brave, tracking-free search engine DuckDuckGo, encrypted email service ProtonMail and private messaging app Signal as evidence that despite the stereotype of an apathetic public, consumers indeed care about digital sovereignty. I hope he is right. But the torrid growth of the invasive and illness-inducing TikTok, particularly among the young, suggests things are going the other way.  It’s easy to sneer at Urbit for its ties to Yarvin, its nerdy nomenclature and its unusual approach to programming (instead of progressing from version 1.0 to 2.0 and so on, core parts of the infrastructure go backwards toward zero, at which point this code will be deemed final; the idea is to make any ship durable and usable for decades even as apps are updated at higher levels of the stack). In a world where the deck is stacked in favor of hyperstimulation and learned digital helplessness, the Urbit community’s efforts to humanize computing may, ultimately, make no difference.  But to borrow from an old song, at least they are trying. What have you done?

While that’s small by crypto industry standards (Messari’s Mainnet conference in New York drew more than 3,000 this week), it’s nearly double last year’s attendance. Reflecting the technology’s cachet among the online intelligentsia, the technical talks will be accompanied by a poetry reading and a panel discussion featuring novelist Walter Kirn, internet historian Katherine Dee, filmmaker Alex Lee Moyer and podcaster Anna Khachiyan.  The new startups have raised millions of dollars, which again might sound like chump change from a crypto perspective, but was “unthinkable until about a year ago,” said Tim Galebach, founder of Uqbar Network, one of the newer players on the scene. The number of developers in the ecosystem is now in the “low hundreds,” Galebach estimated, up from dozens a year ago and “less than a dozen, if that” in mid-2020.  Urbit, which has its own programming languages and operating systems, was conceived more than a decade ago by an engineer named Curtis Yarvin, who is better known for his controversial political blogging. (The relevance of those writings – or lack thereof – will be discussed in a separate article to be published shortly after this one.)  Read more: Urbit Is Web3, Weird and Wonderful and I Don’t Care Who Made It  One of Urbit’s defining features is data portability. Rather than entrusting their data to faceless unaccountable corporations, users store it on a personal server that also supports the apps they use and serves as their digital identity. Technically savvy users can run their Urbit virtual machines on their own hardware, and the less sophisticated can pay third-party providers to host their “ships,” as these servers are called.  The big idea is to claw back power for individuals who have increasingly relied on the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter to mediate their online interactions.  If present trends continue, ""we end up in a future where companies control everything about the way we compute,"" said Galen Wolfe-Pauly, CEO of Tlon, in his prepared remarks for a keynote address to be delivered Saturday morning at Assembly. “This just doesn’t make any sense.”  He offered an alternative vision for the next 50 years. “We're going to enter into an era where computers are something we can trust completely.” For example, one day, it may be possible to upload your genome to a computer and to not worry about the security of your personal information because the app analyzing the genome is on the machine, not some faraway server. It’s a concept “to actually be excited about it … and think ‘wow, I’m going to learn something from this,’ rather than sending my genetic material to a company and not knowing what's going to happen to it,” he said.  But Urbit has to start somewhere. That somewhere appears to be crypto, where the Urbit community finds a lot of kindred spirits.  Urbit’s pitch to DAOs  These two worlds have collided before.  ""Urbit was the first use case of Ethereum to do something that the network couldn't have done before,"" Michelle Lai, one of the first hires at crypto custodian Anchorage, said in an interview. It was a point echoed by Lane Rettig, someone who spends most of his time in the world of Ethereum but has been following Urbit for the past couple of years.  Before Urbit IDs were tracked on Ethereum through the Azimuth smart contracts, Urbit names were kept ""on a spreadsheet on Galen's computer,"" Rettig said.  Now, to varying degrees, Urbit’s startups are courting decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) – nominally leaderless online investment collectives – along with other crypto teams, to be early adopters of their products.  They’re framing Urbit as a platform that can host interoperable applications to replace products like Discord, Telegram and Signal – a collaboration platform tailor-made for the blockchain industry’s innovators and tinkerers.  While Tlon is best known for having built most of Urbit’s core, the company has branched out into user-facing products and plans to unveil at Assembly an upgraded version of Landscape, its user interface, which it refers to as an operating system (OS) comparable to MacOS or Windows.  In an interview, Wolfe-Pauly gave several reasons why a crypto team in particular would appreciate sovereignty over data that would otherwise be exposed to a centralized provider. These include the risks of front-running by platform employees and removal of a project by the company.  “If there’s a lot of money involved, do I want to be sharing alpha on a platform [where] I know someone could read my messages?” he said. “Do I want to be putting a lot of energy into the research that I share there, knowing that my Discord might go away?”  Another pitch is that Urbit software can coordinate this confusing patchwork of tools relied on by DAOs and like-minded groups within a one-stop shop.  “The DAO problem is that you have all these different services, all these different UXs all across the internet and you have to have a dozen browser tabs open and flip between all these things,” said Trent Gillham, founder of an Austin, Texas-based startup called Holium, which will announce its own Urbit-based OS at Assembly.  “All the tools are so disjointed. The context-switching is just too much,” Gillham went on. “Being able to have one common foundation for the entire DAO … is going to be the thing that makes DAOs more effective.”  Julie Fredrickson, a managing partner at Chaotic Capital, a VC firm that invests in DAOs, confirmed that fragmentation is a pain point. “DAO tooling is a hodgepodge mess of workflows,” she said. “There’s no ‘one ring to rule them all.’”  Beyond communication, Uqbar Network is trying to position Urbit as a locus of smart contract development. At Assembly, it will announce a testnet (an experimental environment for unfinished software) of its execution engine, which Galebach describes as a ""couple-click experience."" Uqbar's offering will also include a ZK-rollup, a mechanism for running smart contracts on Ethereum in a way that strengthens privacy and cuts the time and cost of transactions.  “We’re going for a very user-friendly type thing,” Galebach said, “which in a crypto context is something Urbit makes it easier to provide. … You’re sort of operating in one world, for both us designing the system [and] people programming on it.”  Galebach was quick to acknowledge the irony of his statement. “It’s kind of funny because I think people think of Urbit as being somewhat hard from a UX perspective.”  They certainly do.  ‘Still pretty janky’  Justin Murphy’s passion for Urbit stems from his own experience building a small business selling online courses over the last three years using disjointed Web2 technology.  “Why do I need 10 different SaaS [software-as-a-service] apps that I pay $30 a month to just to glue these different data sources together in a smooth way?” the podcaster and writer said. “It was this absolutely painful morass that was really expensive and just mentally torturous, trying to connect these things through these third-party providers.”  After doing some research, Murphy said, in March 2021 he had an epiphany. “If Urbit wins, if Urbit becomes what it wants to be, everything I’m doing with my community and my content would be 100x easier and faster and more powerful. And once it integrates with crypto, there’s going to be financial liquidity on top of it all.”  “If” is an important word, however. Apart from being far from a household name, the Urbit network faces a challenge familiar to many crypto applications: an often clumsy and frustrating user experience. Messages sent through the network can take as long as 30 seconds to post, for instance.  “It’s still pretty janky,” Murphy said. When asked what he saw as the biggest risk to the project, he said, “My number one fear is that forever Urbit is always just a little too janky. You can't set the probability of that to zero.”  According to Galebach, ease of use is closer than many Urbit participants realize.  “The stuff that you would see as clunky as a user is often [there] because the core base isn’t fully ready to support making an easy UX,” he said. Urbit “just needs that little bit of extra work so that people can make these very smooth user experiences that are very stable.”  Nevertheless, he called that work urgent.  “The risk is a timeline risk,” Galebach said. His concern is that “stuff that should take one and a half years takes five. Even that might not be existentially threatening to Urbit. But whenever you extend those timeframes, pretty much only bad things can happen.”  Wolfe-Pauly at Tlon sounded a bit more Zen about the matter, but acknowledged the need to improve runtime.  Read more: Bitcoin Sign Guy Is Back, Bringing Sound Money to Urbit's 'Sound Computer' (2020)  “We're working on it,” he said. “There's literally one person that we fund who works on that stuff. I would love for it to be five people. We can't afford to do that.” He noted that the Urbit Foundation has existed for only a year, and said its task in coming years is to find ways to fund more infrastructural work while the ecosystem’s companies focus on making money.  Lehman, at the nonprofit, agreed that core development, traditionally Tlon’s bailiwick, is “looking like it’s going to be the foundation’s next challenge.  “Starting next quarter, we'll be figuring it out and having a lot of discussions … and throughout next year, figuring out how we can coordinate the ecosystem to tackle projects on the kernel,” he said.  As that happens, developers continue to expand Urbit's functionality. This week, an early Urbit adopter known as ~doplur unveiled an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on Urbit that uses its ID system like blockchain wallets, with the aim of courting DeFi users to the platform by distributing $URBIT tokens to all Metamask users.  ""There is a lot of capital on Ethereum,"" doplur said. ""If Urbit is going to be a serious player in crypto"" then it's going to have to learn to speak ""the language of DeFi."" Not everyone involved in Urbit liked the idea, however, which was unfinished at launch and harkened back to the scam-filled days of initial coin offerings in 2017 with its white paper and airdrop.  This only goes to show some of the growing pains Urbit will go through as it continues to expand and gain adoption. Not everyone will like what ends up being built on or using Urbit, as is the nature of ""open source, public infrastructure,"" Wolfe-Pauly said.  In the meantime, the next version of Landscape that premieres at Assembly will be much easier to use, with a front-end interface “comparable to a centralized experience,” said Marisa Rowland, Tlon’s head of product.  “Urbit and Tlon are about to be widely accessible to all,” she said. “We’re about to be able to onboard many, many more. It’s definitely a turning point.”  UPDATE (Sept. 24, 2022 16:15 UTC) – Corrects description of Uqbar testnet and Galebach's first name.

With the rise of the Web3 space and online crypto gambling, Metamask managed to fill in a gap that brings both sectors closer to one another. Crypto casinos are taking more to integrate the Metamask wallets on their websites for gambling activities. Using a decentralized Web3 wallet like this ensures that users of these gambling platforms are able to enjoy features that are not available on more conventional online casinos. Why Metamask Gambling Is Better One drawback of conventional casinos is the arduous sign-up processes that are usually associated with them. However, casinos had started to move towards accepting crypto deposits and withdrawals, which, over time, had required less stringent sign-up processes. But even this was not a seamless process. This is where Metamask gambling enters the picture. Metamask is a Web3 wallet that allows users to interact directly with cryptocurrency networks. It had started out on the Ethereum blockchain but had since expanded to include other blockchains such as BSC, Avalanche, etc. It comes in the form of a browser extension and mobile application from which users can directly connect to Web3 websites. It is also an easy-to-use hot wallet where users can receive coins by simply copying their addresses to forward to the sender. Given this, Metamask has found a natural home in the online gambling industry.

The company has surpassed many renowned technology heavyweights to release the first ever batch of 3nm ASIC miners. Bitramo&apos;s ultra-powerful Ramo1, Ramo 2, and Ramo X mining rigs are more profitable compared to any other product, offering 100% return on investment within just one month. ASIC or Application Specific Integrated Circuit miners are more efficient compared to GPU miners because their internal circuits are designed to carry out the specific task of crypto mining. The mining efficiency of Bitramo miners is boosted further by their extraordinary hash rates. Interestingly, so far, no other company has been able to match the hash rates offered by Bitramo. Hash Rates of Bitramo Miners Bitcoin Litecoin Ethereum Monero Ramo 1: 360 TH/s 30 GH/s 2 GH/s 2MH/s Ramo 2: 750 TH/s 70 GH/s 5 GH/s 5 MH/s Ramo X: 2250 TH/s 210 GH/s 15 GH/s 15 MH/s As a result of these hash rates, Bitramo miners are capable of processing a considerably higher amount of data in any given time. By using higher computational power while processing transactions in a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency network, miners are able to earn higher profits compared to other miners.

42422277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jUdh,1663985055,California 'BitLicense' Bill Vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom,"Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a crypto licensing and regulation bill seen as a possible West Coast version of New York's ""BitLicense"" on Friday.  BitLicense is a business license for digital currency activities in New York that's issued by the state's Department of Financial Services.  In California, Assembly Bill 2269, which was sponsored by Assemblyman Tim Grayson (D-Vallejo), would have created a licensing regime for anyone seeking to facilitate crypto transactions, similar to how money transmissions are overseen by the state's Money Transmission Act. It was one of eight bills Newsom vetoed Friday. He signed 21 other bills, addressing issues ranging from crossing signals to cybersecurity to infrastructure.  ""On May 4, 2022, I issued Executive Order N-9-22 to position California as the first state to establish a transparent regulatory environment that both fosters responsible innovation, and protects consumers who use digital asset financial services and products – all within the context of a rapidly evolving federal regulatory picture,"" Newsom wrote in a message explaining his veto. ""Over the last several months, my administration has conducted extensive research and outreach to gather input on approaches that balance the benefits and risk to consumers, harmonize with federal rules, and incorporate California values such as equity, inclusivity and environmental protection.""  It would be ""premature"" to create a licensing regime without considering feedback from this executive order, Newsom wrote. He also pointed to the possibility of future federal legislation or regulations.  The California Assembly passed the bill last month. If it had been signed into law, it would have required California-licensed entities to interact only with stablecoins issued by banks or otherwise licensed by the state's Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (the ban would have been phased out by 2028); forced stablecoin issuers to remain fully backed by reserves (at least an amount equivalent to the number of stablecoins in circulation); and set up a licensing and examination regime for crypto companies.  ""A more flexible approach is needed to ensure regulatory oversight can keep up with rapidly evolving technology and use cases, and is tailored with the proper tools to address trends and mitigate consumer harm,"" Newsom wrote in his letter.  Newsome also noted that the new licensing and regulatory regime would require a multimillion-dollar loan, which hasn't been accounted for in California's annual budget process.  ""I am committed to working collaboratively with the Legislature to achieve the appropriate regulatory clarity once federal regulations come into sharper focus for digital financial assets, while ensuring California remains a competitive place for companies to invest and innovate,"" he concluded.  In a tweet, Grayson said he will ""continue to work to protect California's consumers,"" noting that the Assembly had ""overwhelmingly"" voted in favor of the bill, which received 71 yes votes, zero no votes and nine abstentions.  ""The cryptocurrency market is under-regulated at best and deliberately rigged against everyday consumers at worst,"" he said.

Fidenza #726 last sold on June 14, 2021, for 1.2 wrapped ether (WETH) (approximately $3,098) and Fidenza #18 sold on July 15, 2021, for 8.5 ETH (approximately $16,294).  The transactions bumped the project's market cap to 90,609.30 ETH (about $121 million) and helped raise its floor price to 94 ETH (approximately $116,154).  In a show of prosperity, three more NFTs were purchased by the same wallet within 17 minutes on Thursday morning, each selling for at least 98 ETH (approximately $125,244).  Another NFT – Fidenza #136 – was transferred to wallet 808450 on Friday afternoon, leaving the well-to-do investor with eight Fidenza NFTs totaling 689.95 ETH (approximately $910,271).  Separately, wallet 0x9B67e bought Fidenza #4 for 94 ETH ($124,268) on Thursday, contributing to a 781.25 ETH (approximately $1.03 million) pump into the project over a 48-hour period.  So, what led to the sudden surge of interest in the algorithmic-based art project? It's unclear, though Twitter user Jollytime.eth speculated in a series of tweets that the NFTS may have been purchased by an investment firm linked to Leslie Alexander, a successful bond trader and the former owner of the Houston Rockets.  The thread also noted that Daryl Morey, former general manager of the Houston Rockets, is a major crypto and NFT advocate and spoke to CoinDesk in June 2021 about his ability to sniff out trends. Neither Alexander's firm CEAS Investments nor Morey could be reached for comment.  At the time of writing, the project's total volume is 51.5K ETH, or approximately $68.2 million. Notably, Art blocks, the Ethereum-based NFT creation platform behind Fidenza, now ranks above other popular NFT collections including Doodles and CryptoPunks in terms of sales volume, according to Crypto Slam.  In August 2021, Fidenza #13 sold for 1,000 ETH, or about $3.3 million – the highest Art Blocks sale to date.",POSITIVE,ETH,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/09/24/tyler-hobbs-fidenza-nft-project-gets-1m-pump-over-48-hours,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2593af994d6bdae1079aea0e07928ee6cc62d7e4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
