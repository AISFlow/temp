42426893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxP1h,1463438000,Bitcoin Price Tests $460 But Fails at Upward Climb,"The price of bitcoin tested resistance at $460 over the weekend ending 15th May, but failed to break through what could prove to be a key level going forward.  Overall, the digital currency’s price fluctuated close to $460, a figure which has not been surpassed since 10th May, reaching as much as $458.87 on Sunday, 15th May, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Further, a series of near misses in attempts to build momentum above this mark suggests that $460 could become a key benchmark for the price moving forward.  For instance, bitcoin's price opened at $455.75 on 15th May, briefly falling below $455 when it reached a low of $454.91 between 12:15 and 12:29 UTC. For the remainder of the day, prices stayed between $455 and $460, breaking through $458 to reach a high of $458.65 between 17:45 and 17:59 UTC, but upward movements remained elusive.  The digital currency continued to linger above $458 for much of 15th May, reaching $458.69 between 19:30 and 19:44 UTC before closing at $457.99 during the time between 19:45 and 19:59 UTC. Bitcoin prices proceeded to stay below $458 for the next few hours, before hitting a high of $458.08 between 21:45 and 21:59 UTC.  As the 16th May session began, bitcoin prices opened at $457.85, but have since retreated lower to a press time value of $454 as the day's trading nears a close.  Continued stability  Though traders may not have observed any sought-after gains, the weekend showed bitcoin is continuing its recent stability.  Bitcoin prices have been relatively flat in the last few weeks, fluctuating largely between $450 and $460 during the seven days through 13th May and between $445 and $455 the period before.  Although the week ending 29th April saw bitcoin surge above $470 and below $440, the digital currency has mostly enjoyed a comparably calm period over the last few months, with CoinDesk's State of Blockchain Q1 2016 showcasing that the quarter was among the least volatile for the currency in recent years.

42426876,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOVh,1463430274,Presidential Cybersecurity Panel Hears Blockchain Testimony By IBM,"A panel on national security and cyberspace appointed by President Barack Obama heard testimony on blockchain technology from a representative of IBM earlier today.  Held in New York, the meeting brought together the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity, formed in February by executive order and featuring among its membership retired General Keith Alexander, the first chief of the US Cyber Command.  Other members include MasterCard president and CEO Ajay Banga, Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan; Georgia Institute of Technology; professor Annie I Antón; and Microsoft corporate vice president of research Mike Lee.  In remarks  , IBM blockchain chief Jerry Cuomo said that the technology has ""tremendous potential to help transform business and society"", going on to suggest that in response, some – particularly in the public and private business sectors – have thus far remained on the sidelines.  Cuomo went on to say:  ""We applaud judicious caution, but, at the same time, we believe that organizations and institutions that don’t quickly assess the potential of blockchain and begin experimenting with it risk falling behind as the world undergoes what we see as a tectonic shift.""  IBM is one of a number of existing companies and startups working under the Hyperledger blockchain project banner, overseen by the nonprofit Linux Foundation. A number of members, including firms like Intel and JPMorgan Chase, have already submitted detailed proposals to the project.  During the appearance today, Cuomo advocated for the government to encourage applications in the areas of identity, transaction security, data provenance and intelligence sharing, ultimately calling on the US to take an active role in a changing technology landscape.  ""While government should not seek to control these new financial systems, it has an important role to play in helping them to take off and in safeguarding them,"" he said, adding:  ""We need to create a new social compact, where business, with input from government, architects the future of financial services.""

42426895,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxP5h,1463424707,Bitcoin Startup Blockchain Releases Code for 'Thunder' Payment Channels,"Bitcoin startup Blockchain has released the first version of a payments channel prototype that finds it moving its research efforts into how transactions on the bitcoin network can be made faster and more effective into the public eye.  The startup, which has raised $30m in one public round of funding, announced the alpha release of the ThunderNetwork today. Best described as a Blockchain-led effort into the implementation of payment channels, the technology seeks to allow bitcoin users a way to conduct off-blockchain transactions that settle against the bitcoin blockchain at a later date.  Given the sometimes high cost of settling against bitcoin’s blockchain, which can fluctuate (sometimes greatly) with demand for block space, the ecosystem has long sought to bridge bitcoin’s ability to be denominated into units as small as one one-hundred-millionth of a bitcoin with the fact that fees to settle such transactions against the blockchain are generally prohibitively higher than such values.  To date, the most prominent effort to bring payments channels to the bitcoin network has been the Bitcoin Lightning Network, an open-source project that has since coalesced into a startup called Lightning, which boasts some of the community’s more notable developers.  Still, Blockchain CEO Peter Smith sought to stress that the announcement represents a significant step forward for the bitcoin network given that the technology is useable at a limited scale today. Further, while spearheaded by Blockchain, he emphasized that ThunderNetwork can now be built on by the wider community of bitcoin developers.  Smith told CoinDesk:  “Thunder is already open-sourced. It’s more functional today [than other versions of lightning networks], because it’s the first network of this style that’s settled back to the main blockchain.”  In a demonstration of the network and its capabilities, Blockchain detailed how Smith and ThunderNetwork lead developer Mats Jerratsch tested how the tech can be used for person-to-person transactions.  The technology has already received widely positive feedback, with Twitter mentions even from innovators in the private blockchain side of the ecosystem weighing in on the significance of the release.  This enthusiasm was palpable in the startup’s announcement of the news, with the company writing:  ""This is a big deal and we’re excited about the work ahead.""  Comparisons to Lightning Network  Announced last August, the Thunder Network is intended to be a “low-trust solution” to payments channels, one that used mostly tools available to bitcoin developers.  At the time  , lead developer Jerratsch contrasted this with Lightning, which he characterized as a “no trust” way to achieve the same functionality. These differences can be seen in the design of ThunderNetwork released, as Blockchain is the only company that runs nodes on the network.  Nodes will route transactions using encrypted onion routing, with transactions moving through multiple nodes without any information about the individuals involved being disclosed to these entities. “It will go from my node to your node, to another person’s node, the basic routing methodology,” Smith said.  The official blog post provided more clarity, indicating that at each hop, the status of the payment will be renegotiated until the channel is closed and ultimately settled.  In interview, Smith sought to position ThunderNetwork as something that can work in conjunction with any implementation of payments channel technology for the bitcoin network.  ""I think it’s complementary to any lightning network,"" he said.  Protocol changes needed  Perhaps most notable about the release is that Blockchain still needs a few changes to be made to the bitcoin protocol so that Thunder transactions can settle against the blockchain.  The first, CheckSequenceVerify (CSV) was recently merged into Bitcoin Core but is awaiting further development as OP_CSV. Secondly, implementing Thunder will require the merging of SegratedWitness, the long in-development scaling solution that would alter how transactions are stored by the bitcoin blockchain.  Today, Blockchain said the network is ""suited for transactions among a trusted network of users"", while cautioning that it should not be used for real payments.  As for how ThunderNetwork fits into Blockchain’s business strategy, Smith was less clear, though its blog post hinted the startup is currently seeking to expand its team of developers.  Smith concluded:  ""As the tech matures, we’ll have to see what makes the most sense for it as a product. It’s very early, very raw technology.""

42426884,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOhh,1463421831,R3 Bank Partner Northern Trust Details Four Internal Blockchain Tests,"Back in January, Chicago-based asset management firm Northern Trust was part of a group of international financial institutions to complete a blockchain test with the R3CEV banking consortium.  The firm, which has $900bn in assets under management, has since gone on to replicate that test for an internal proof-of-concept, and added three new proofs-of-concept to its ongoing body of work centered on the technology.  While Justin Chapman, global head of process management for the firm, says the proofs-of-concept are part of a larger effort to meet both internal and customer demands, he explained that there was justification to be cautious.  Chapman told CoinDesk:  ""[Blockchains] aren't going to be applicable to every market and every function. What that does is give us a better idea of how we participate in the ecosystem.""  Building from the test  In January, Northern Trust was one of 11 companies to conduct a distributed ledger test built on a private version of the Ethereum blockchain. The group included banks such as Barclays, Credit Suisse and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, among others.  Northern Trust first joined the consortium of more than 40 financial institutions in December of last year.  Chapman said one of Northern Trust’s proof-of-concepts constituted a test of how both cash and securities transactions can be enhanced using the same functionality achieved during that R3 test.  ""We’ve mimicked that internally,"" said Chapman, who helps oversee the firm’s blockchain research. ""It’s sort of the building block for how the underlying work flows.""  In addition, Northern Trust has built one proof-of-concept that shows how operational accounts can be created by way of a blockchain. Another explores the potential interoperability between Northern Trust, regulatory bodies and other financial institutions connected via a theoretical network.  A fourth experiment involved customer identification requirements during account creation. Designed to help streamline the identification of clients across different institutions, this particular concept ""proved to be a very successful use of the technology,"" according to Chapman.  Though Northern Trust worked with ""a number of market partners"" on the identification test, Chapman said non-disclosure agreements prevented him from revealing those partners.  Culminating effort  Northern Trust began looking into blockchain technology 18 months ago, according to Chapman, and in the last three months the company has begun seeing significant levels of interest among its client base, both in terms of learning about the technology more broadly as well as exploring specific applications.  While some of those interested parties have also expressed a willingness to participate in future tests, Chapman said the short-term benefits of the technology appear to be largely limited to cutting down on paperwork associated with asset management.  Industry-level change, on the other-hand, he says, won’t likely come about for another decade.  Chapman concluded:  ""What it really does is let you reimagine the way the market works [in a way] that should remove the friction for the way we do business.""

42426881,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxOdh,1463416061,Gatecoin Claims $2 Million in Bitcoins and Ethers Lost in Security Breach,"News emerged last week of yet another security event in the digital currency exchange ecosystem, this time impacting a Hong Kong-based service involved in the sale of assets related to Ethereum-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).  As reported  on Friday, Gatecoin experienced a cyberattack on its hot wallets that resulted in the loss of funds. A new update from the exchange team indicated that as much as $2m was lost, confirming rumors that circulated soon after the hack became apparent.  Gatecoin has claimed that it lost as much as 185,000 ethers and 250 bitcoins, an amount worth roughly $2.14m at press time. The exchange further said that it believes the hack first began on 9th May, and that it continued over the following three days.  While details remain unclear – Gatecoin has said that it is conducting an internal review of the incident – the company suggested in a statement on the hack that its process for storing funds offline had also been compromised.  Gatecoin said in a statement:  ""We have previously communicated the fact that most clients’ crypto-asset funds are stored in multi-signature cold wallets. However, the malicious external party involved in this breach, managed to alter our system so that ETH deposit transfers by-passed the multi-sig cold storage and went directly to the hot wallet during the breach period. This means that losses of ETH funds exceed the 5% limit that we imposed on our hot wallets.""  The timing of the hack was notable given the ongoing crowdsale for TheDAO, an organization using Ethereum-based tokens to vote on and fund development proposals. To date, that effort has raised approximately 10.72m ETH, worth nearly $120m at the time of this writing.  Gatecoin was one of several exchanges offering purchases of those tokens, and in the aftermath of the hack says that it will build a portal for withdrawing DAO-related tokens in the next two weeks, as well as fiat currencies.  No indication was given as to when withdrawals of bitcoin and ethers will be processed.  The Gatecoin incident represents the latest cybersecurity event in the exchange space, following hacks on ShapeShift and Cointrader, among others.

42426896,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxP3h,1463411126,Identity Startup Netki to Launch SSL Certificate for Blockchain,"With websites operating under the constant threat of attacks, users have long been accustomed to looking for a little green lock in web browsers, signaling an SSL certificate, to ensure that the site is secure.  Today, SSL is used for transmitting sensitive information over the Internet, and it has long been a significant driver of e-commerce. Involved in this process are protocols including the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), as well as certificate authorities (CAs), entities that issue digital certificates to organizations or individuals.  Now, digital identity startup Netki has announced that it is releasing what it considers to be the first digital identity certificate akin to the SSL for the blockchain in a bid to replicate both this technology and its top-lever services on the blockchain.  In interview, CEO and co-founder Justin Newton expanded on the vision for the product, which follows a wallet naming service it introduced last year.  He explained:  ""What we did is we took a look at the ecosystem and saw that everyone was doing a good job of doing KYC (know your customer) on their own customers, but blockchains in general don’t have a really great way of knowing who your counterparty is. That has some usability issues because you like to know who you’re transacting with.""  Newton pointed to the regulatory reasons why such a functionality could prove useful for those executing blockchain-based transactions. In particular, Newton cited FinCEN's travel rule, which ""requires all financial institutions to pass on certain information to the next financial institution, in certain funds transmittals involving more than one financial institution"".  Under the travel rule, the identities of all participants involved in digital currency transfers greater than $3,000, including the money service businesses (MSBs) such as wallet providers and exchanges and the actual sender and receiver of the funds, must be known.  Part of the problem is that MSBs have to worry about sending money to nations that are sanctioned under the auspices of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). ""They keep us from transacting with ISIS,"" Newton explained.  Newton cautioned that many companies in the digital currency industry are potentially at risk of violating OFAC rules, which harms the ecosystem in two ways. The first is that current companies could deal with significant regulatory risk.  ""It’s also preventing traditional financial institutions from being able to connect or interact with the open blockchain,"" he argued.  Building on BIP70  On the bitcoin network today, a piece of code called BIP70 handles a similar function, allowing spenders to obtain signed payment details from those who receive transactions.  But, part of the problem is that BIP70 wasn’t built to support the rules required by FinCEN for these large transactions, Netki argues.  In a presentation at Consensus 2016, Newton explained that the existing payment flow, BIP70, only allows for a certificate from the wallet provider of the recipient to be sent. In the slide above, this means that when Alice sends Bob an invoice, that is the only time identity is exchanged.  To get around this problem, a team of developers, including Netki's Newton and Matt David as well as Breadwallet's Aaron Voisine and James MacWhyte, submitted an updated proposal called BIP75.  According to the Git, this solves two important problems. The first is that it allows the sender of a payment request to voluntarily sign the original request and provide a certificate to allow the payee to know who they are transacting with.  “This allows the exchange of identity information to be optionally two-way,” Newton explained, adding:  ""Before a transaction occurs, the receiver can know who the sender is and the sender can know who the receiver is and their service provider can provide any required AML checks that they need to form before the transaction occurs.""  Essentially, both the sender and receiver of the payment request – and their corresponding MSBs – can voluntarily hand over the necessary identification to ensure that all parties involved are legally allowed to send and receive payment.  Newton explained that BIP75 is already implemented in Netki’s open-source software, Addressimo, and that he expects that implementation in wallet software to commence over the next few months.  A blockchain-agnostic certificate authority  The second problem that BIP75 solves allows for Netki and other service providers is ensuring user privacy.  According to the authors, BIP75 ""encrypts the payment request that is returned, before handing it off to the SSL/TLS layer to prevent man in the middle viewing of the Payment Request details"".  This point is critical for the whole process, because Netki doesn’t believe that the identification should actually be on the public ledger.  Newton explained:  ""We wanted to be sure that this all happened at the application layer rather than the blockchain protocol layer because we didn’t think it was right to build any identity into an open permissionless network.""  Instead, Netki will seek to act as a certificate authority similar to how Symantec sells SSL certificates to domain name holders. When a MSB acquires a digital identity certificate for itself and its users, the name, address and verification level (aligned to the risk or value of the transactions) is built into the certificate.  When a transaction is made, the MSBs on both sides send identity certificates and compare the information through their own AML checks. If both sides have a small green lock, the transaction is secure and compliant. Newton explained that one certificate would contain both the MSB and client information, but in the future, there would be a separate certificate for the MSB and client.  But not storing information on a public ledger is also necessary for the world that Newton believes is coming.  Netki is taking a blockchain-agnostic approach to the roll out of this digital identity certificate the same way it did with its wallet name product. Specifically, users can use one of the wallet names to receive payment in bitcoin, tether and ethereum so they don’t have to create multiple payment addresses.  With that in mind, Newton explained that they created ""one digital identity certificate that works across all blockchains so you don’t have to revalidate across every chain"".  He continued:  ""One of the things about the way we built the solution with identity not stored on the blockchain, is that one identity certificate can work across every blockchain you work on. As we start to go into a world where we see that most people will be operating on more than one public or private blockchain, we see that this provides more flexibility than a siloed identity system that requires you to re-verify yourself.""  In the future, users will be able to utilize a single certificate across all the chains they work on, verifying their identity when and where it is needed.  Acceptable certificates  During the identity workshop at Consensus 2016, Newton, who first presented this new product, explained that trying to create an entirely new certificate program is incredibly difficult.  ""You can’t walk into a government office and just tell them to get rid of their ID system and trust you,"" he explained.  Recognizing this, Netki opted to go with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority that is already widely understood and accepted worldwide.  ""One of the other things is we leveraged an existing digital identity standard that actually has legal basis and case law behind it. That has been enshrined in some international treaties. This is already an internationally recognized form of digital identity,"" Newton said.  According to a white paper published by Entrust, ""the bridge CA provides trust paths between principal Certification Authorities for trust domain PKIs [public key infrastructures]"".  In the case of the Federal Bridge, ""it does not provide a root of trust, but instead links together existing trust infrastructures"".  By building on top of the Federal Bridge CA, MSBs don’t have to worry about whether the certificate provided by Netki is acceptable from a regulatory perspective because they already have years of experience using it for their businesses.  While Newton couldn’t yet offer a precise cost for the certificate, he did suggest that the two-year certificate for validated identity wouldn’t be cost prohibitive for individuals or their MSBs.  ""In most cases, where a MSB is involved, we anticipate that the cost won’t show up as a direct cost for the consumer. Since it’s only needed for transactions over $3,000, if you look at the cost, it could be comparable to one wire transfer fee, and the certificate can be used for all transactions for the following two years,"" he said.  Netki is pushing toward launching a pilot in the next couple of months and Newton expects that the full product will be available to all consumers by the end of 2016.

42426897,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxP7h,1463405575,The Top 5 Takeaways from CoinDesk’s State of Blockchain Q1 2016,"The first quarter of 2016 saw a number of notable changes in the blockchain industry, the most obvious and contentious of which may have been the evolving language used to describe the industry itself.  Once termed the ""bitcoin industry"", such a definition no longer seems adequate in describing the breadth of innovation being pursued by industry innovators on technologies that increasingly diverge from the original implementation of blockchain technology, bitcoin.  In addition to the entrepreneurs building on the bitcoin blockchain, the quarter provided ample validation for alternative blockchain-based projects, ranging from the expansion of permissioned distributed ledger efforts to the launch of Ethereum, an alternative public blockchain that enables functionalities like smart contracts.  As a result, CoinDesk introduced its latest State of Blockchain report with a new taxonomy and conceptual framework for looking at the industry, one that positions the ongoing innovations in private blockchain technology and public blockchains as comparable to intranets and the Internet, respectively.  The shift was in line with many major developments for the quarter, which saw bitcoin steadily grow its hashing power and user base while blockchain technology solutions for the financial industry stole a majority of the spotlight.  1. VC interest rebounds  Following three quarters of declines in both total industry funding and average deal size, the blockchain industry saw a reversal of this trend in Q1.  VC firms invested $160m in blockchain ventures during the quarter, up from $26m the previous quarter. Further, average deal size rose from $2.6m to $11.4m. Overall, the figure arguably represents the strongest quarter for funding in more than a year.  The $160m figure is higher than four of the five previous quarters, with Q1 2015 being the exception, a total that includes all of the $116m in VC funding raised by 21 Inc, though this capital was likely raised over a longer period of time.  Elsewhere, there were other strong indications that, while the number of investments is less frequent, the startups that are raising funds are having more success.  The quarter’s largest funding round belonged to Digital Asset Holdings, which pulled in more than $60m (the exact total remains unknown) from an all-star cast of financial institutions. The figure dwarfed the highest total from Q4 2015, when Align Commerce raised $15m.  2. Blockchain funding spikes  Venture capital also showed a clear preference in Q1 for startups that are offering blockchain-based services for technologies other than the bitcoin blockchain.  Of the $160m invested in Q1, only 16% went to startups providing services specifically for the bitcoin blockchain, with 84% invested in startups working on permissioned blockchain efforts or both permissioned and public projects.  This was a sharp contrast from the three previous quarters, when bitcoin funding topped the money raised by more general blockchain startups.  However, it remains unclear if the data should be interpreted as a sign investors are bullish on private blockchains and bearish on public offerings like Ethereum or bitcoin.  With many of bitcoin’s infrastructure providers already well-funded, it remains possible that a similar seeding is underway as new entrepreneurs seek to apply the technology to the business problems of financial incumbents.  3. Ethereum’s big boost  Spurred by high-profile trials of its technology at major banks as well as the formal launch of its production platform, Ethereum was among the big winners in Q1.  While this has yet to be reflected in investments in startups building on the decentralized application platform, the enthusiasm is most visible in the rising price of ether, the token used to power applications on the network.  The price of ether rose more than 1,000% over the course of the quarter, and though its market has calmed somewhat in recent weeks, major exchanges are proving increasingly inclined to support the ecosystem's traders.  Most recently, Gemini, the New York-based digital asset exchange founded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss added ether to their platform, making it the only digital asset offered alongside bitcoin.  The arrival of ether as an investment of interest to traders is also significant for the wider digital currency ecosystem, providing evidence of the claims that bitcoin could eventually spur the creation of an entirely new asset class.  4. Media interest in blockchain  While the verdict is still out on which versions of blockchain technology will become the most widely adopted, the media has shown a clear interest in placing permissioned blockchain platforms at the forefront of coverage.  Mainstream media interest in blockchain increased in Q1 2016, with The Financial Times, Sina The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal all running more stories on the topic.  This contrasted with stories on bitcoin, as all three media outlets ran fewer articles on the subject in Q1 than they did in Q4 2015.  As with the VC investment, the impact or genesis of the trend remains unclear.  One possibility is that the change is a reflection of online searches.  Google queries for “blockchain”, for example, rose 32% over the quarter, a shift that may have shifted how media outlets are positioning their coverage of industry developments.  5. Regulators bang blockchain drum  The prominence and interest of blockchain solutions was also underscored by the actions of prominent global regulators and public officials in Q1.  In total, representative of the US Federal Reserve governor, US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) all made statements indicating they would seek to support innovations in the industry this quarter, while providing words of caution about challenges that may lie ahead.  The most vocal was CFTC commissioner J Christopher Giancarlo who made several prominent appearances at industry events, including a speech at the DTCC’s Blockchain Symposium in which he called for regulators to pursue a “do no harm” approach to developments in the industry.  Giancarlo would go on to appear at a panel at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2016 conference, where he would echo these remarks onstage alongside former CFTC commissioner Mark Wetjen and Ben Lawsky, the former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).
