The Easton, Md.-based company, backed by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, also expects to be able to successfully build out over 400 megawatts of mining facility in 2023, raising its hashrate to 12.1 to 17.2 EH/s.  The miner reiterated its expectations of reaching 800 MW and 23 EH/s of mining capacity by 2025.  The Bitcoin network’s total hashrate was 209.7 EH/s as of March 16, according to Glassnode data. By comparison, Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest bitcoin miners, said it sees reaching a hashrate of 23.3 EH/s by early 2023.  For this year, TeraWulf is expecting a total of 210MW of power capacity, but notes the company could expand to raise power capacity to 235MW if the macroeconomic and capital markets improve.  “Our focus in 2022 remains on continuing to build out our Lake Mariner facility in New York and Nautilus Cryptomine in Pennsylvania, ensuring we are well positioned to create as many plugs as possible to take advantage of significant Infrastructure and supply chain constraints facing the market,” CEO Paul Prager said in the statement.  The company has raised a total of about $295 million to date and said it continues to take “an opportunistic approach” to raising capital.

While Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others have seen some gains, the price of VET continues to trend downwards. Related Reading | VeChain Records 7% Profits And It Could Outperform ETH, Here&apos;s Why As of press time, VeChain trades at $0.048 with an 8.9% and 34% loss during the past two weeks and 30-days, respectively. However, the cryptocurrency could be sitting at crucial levels and poised for major price appreciation. Analyst Justin Bennett claims this upcoming VET&apos;s price rally could push the cryptocurrency up 40% off its current levels. On the weekly chart, the analyst identified a setup from back in 2020.

The analyst recommended his audience to &apos;take everything with a grain of salt&apos;.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin held steady above $40,000 as several altcoins surged.  Insights: Taiwan surprises with interest rate hike.  Technician's take: BTC's price range could persist, although there is less chance of another major sell-off.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $40,950 -0.3%  Ether (ETH): $2,815+2.2%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Algorand ALGO +3.4% Smart Contract Platform Solana SOL +3.1% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP +2.5% Computing  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Polkadot DOT −1.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −1.2% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin Cash BCH −0.6% Currency  Bitcoin holds steady as some altcoins surge  Bitcoin (BTC) floated just short of the $41,000 level for much of U.S. trading hours on a day in which several major alternative coins held starring roles.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading a little under $41,000, roughly where it stood 24 hours ago when it surged past the psychologically important $40,000 barrier. That climb came as Asian equities markets opened seemingly tied, initially, to China's decision to support its real estate and tech industries to calm investors grown skittish over a regulatory crackdown and faltering economic growth. Asian markets on Thursday continued to rally.  Ether (ETH) was changing hands at around $2,800, a roughly 2% gain over the past 24 hours. Most other major cryptos were in the green over the same period, some significantly so. The tokens for Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL)were up over 8% and 5% at one point. Bitcoin, which was up for parts of the day, had fallen about 1% amid light trading.  Bitcoin's price diverged from the performance of equities markets, which enjoyed a good day, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 all rising over 1%. The increases followed strong gains a day earlier in all three indexes.  ""Bitcoin is struggling to follow the move higher in stocks,"" said Oanda Americas Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya in an email.  Moya said investors were inclined to believe that stories of Russians ""rushing to crypto markets to evade sanctions and minimize exposure to rubles were overdone."" Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin said the company had ""not seen evidence"" of such a trend.  Bad news continued to pour in from Ukraine, with continuing civilian casualties amid Russia's ongoing bombardment of major cities. A day after U.S. President Joe Biden promised to provide $800 million in military equipment and related support to Ukraine, the U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to halt normal trade relations with Russia. Prices of Brent crude oil roared back past $100, underlining the concerns of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates 25 basis points to curb rising inflation. The current 7.9% consumer price index in the U.S. is the highest since the 1980s.  Moya struck an optimistic note about bitcoin's prospects as long as investors remain willing to accept a degree of risk. ""Bitcoin’s long-term outlook is still upbeat and should be supported if risk appetite is not subject to any de-risking movements on Wall Street,"" he said.  Markets  S&P 500: 4,411 +1.2%  DJIA: 34,480 +1.2%  Nasdaq: 13,614 +1.3%  Gold: $1,937 +0.5%  Insights  Taiwan's surprise interest rate hike  Taiwan’s central bank announced late Thursday, to the surprise of many analysts, that it would be raising interest rates by 25 basis points.  This was a real wild card to many, because a survey of economists by Bloomberg had 21 out of 29 economists predicting no change, with the 0.25% raise only predicted by two of the 29 surveyed.  All this comes as Taiwan’s GDP growth is expected to continue to be historically strong 4.5% forecast for this year.  Taiwan’s surprise decision to raise rates likely comes as its central bank tries to avoid being labeled a currency manipulator by Washington, D.C., for undervaluing its currency to boost exports against its tech-heavy competitors including South Korea and China.  Ironically, Taiwan is more of a currency manipulator than China because of regular, undisclosed interventions in the foreign exchange market by the central bank to control the appreciation of its currency. If the Taiwan dollar were to weaken this next quarter as the U.S. raises rates, that might fuel the currency manipulator argument and attract unnecessary attention.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Testing Resistance Near $40K; Support at $35K-$37K  Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover around the $40,000 price level amid choppy trading conditions. The cryptocurrency faces strong overhead resistance, which could stall the recent upswing in price. Still, lower support at $35,000 and $37,000 could stabilize pullbacks into the Asia trading day.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart is approaching overbought levels, similar to what occurred earlier this month, which preceded brief pullbacks in price. On the weekly chart, however, the RSI is rising from oversold levels, decreasing the likelihood of a significant price sell-off.  Typically, BTC consolidates for about two months following an extreme upswing or downtrend. That means the current trading range between $30,000 and $40,000 could persist until a decisive breakout or breakdown occurs.

But this limited move means inflation will slip away and slide upwards again. The commodity chaos unleashed by the conflict in Ukraine, is set to feed through to consumer prices, and unwelcome energy bills are already poised to land on mats in April. The Bank is now predicting inflation rises to 8% in April and remains there for the rest of the quarter. It’s also expecting another peak in October, when the energy price cap rises again.""

42411472,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONYl,1647554214,The Fight Against Inflation Has Begun and Bitcoin Is Ready to Help,"Hello! Helene Braun here. If you haven’t heard it already, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate hike sprint has begun, so make sure to pay off your credit card debt ASAP.  Wednesday, the Fed confirmed what has long been anticipated by traders and economists, or the “fed bringing a water gun to an inflation war,” if you ask Anthony Pompliano. In a statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank’s monetary policymaking body, said it would lift the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points, to a 0.25%-0.5% target rate.  No surprise here. Fed Chair Jerome Powell already hinted at rate hikes at the FOMC’s March meeting and earlier this month, during a testimony before two congressional panels. Powell reiterated how strongly he feels about a quarter-percentage point increase, which gave traders plenty of time to price in a hike and weaken the effect of Wednesday’s decision on asset prices. Wall Street doesn’t like to be surprised, and the Fed doesn’t like to surprise Wall Street.  It’s not only traditional bankers who are carefully parsing the words out of Powell’s mouth; crypto traders are listening, too. Some crypto bros believe bitcoin (BTC) to be a hedge against inflation because it can’t be manipulated by an FOMC-type body.  But recent bitcoin movements don’t back this theory. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down nearly 30% over the last year, while inflation has been climbing to a four-decade high. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Monday that in times of high inflation it’s best to put your money in “physical things.”  He might be right. Traders want to store their money in a safe haven asset that shows high levels of stability. However, with bitcoin’s volatile history, investors might prefer to go with the traditional alternative: gold.  “Inflation still has less influence on bitcoin’s price than other speculative factors. … The idea that bitcoin is an inflation hedge has really not been proven yet, it’s still kind of somewhat theoretical,” said Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.  But the Fed’s decision certainly had an effect on bitcoin. The cryptocurrency briefly dipped to $39,513 after the decision but then quickly rebounded, climbing as high as $41,454 on Wednesday and trading slightly below $41,000 on Thursday morning.  Messari founder Ryan Selkis seemed very bullish after the Fed news, tweeting a picture that seemed to imply that bitcoin would stay over $40,000 for a while.  You can think what you want about the correlation between bitcoin and inflation. In the end, bitcoin is a lot of things to a lot of people, and that’s what makes it exciting to watch.

At the start of the year 2021, the Total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications was used to be around 18 billion dollars. Currently, TVL in DeFi applications is around 200 billion dollars, which is more than 10x of the TVL of January 2021. Total unique DeFi wallets are 4.3 million right now, more than 4x the unique DeFi wallets of January 2021. Various DeFi applications provide financial services like lending &amp; borrowing, trading, prediction markets, yield farming, etc. Still, there are only a few million DeFi users, and the Anchor protocol of Terra Ecosystem wants to change it. Team of Anchor Protocol believes that a saving product is required for the mass adoption of DeFi applications. Anchor is a saving protocol that offers low-volatile yields on deposits of Terra Stablecoins. The Anchor interest rate is powered by staking rewards from Proof of Stake blockchains, and therefore more stable rates can be expected. Anchor Protocol makes a money market between a lender and a borrower. Lenders can earn stable yields by depositing their Stablecoins while borrowers can borrow stablecoins on their stakeable assets. According to the protocol-defined borrowing ratio, borrowers can lock their bonded assets (bAssets) as collateral and borrow stablecoins.

The expansion comes as the crypto trade association, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C., is taking steps to get more involved in regulation at the state level.  New York has emerged as the center of the U.S. crypto industry, but regulatory challenges including the BitLicense – a special license required to do business as a crypto company in New York that is difficult and expensive to obtain – and ongoing efforts at the state level to stop crypto mining in the state, have been a challenge for many companies seeking to do business in New York.  John Olsen, who has been hired to lead the Blockchain Association’s New York office, told CoinDesk educating state legislators is his first priority.  “We are here to start establishing a presence, forming relationships and educating legislators and policymakers about blockchain and the cryptocurrency industry,” Olsen said.  Lack of education, according to Olsen, is the biggest threat to New York’s crypto industry.  “We have existing legislation right now in the form of a moratorium bill which would ban crypto mining in New York for three years,” Olsen said. “I think that’s actually gained more momentum than it should have, because there’s no one really from the industry advocating the benefits of both blockchain and crypto.”  Before his appointment by the Blockchain Association, Olsen served as senior vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association, a since-dissolved lobbying group based in Washington, D.C. that advocated for Web 2 companies including Alphabet's (GOOG) Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), now Meta.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/17/dc-lobbying-group-expands-to-new-york-state-capital,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0dea4315b9293d900f39054d4e98627e140f25f4-2400x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2dDZh,1647549122,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Stabilizes as Altcoins Take the Lead,"Bitcoin (BTC) held steady around the $40,000 price level on Thursday while several alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) took the lead.  The rise in altcoins over the past few days suggests a greater appetite for risk among crypto traders. BTC and ether (ETH) were up 2% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 20% rally in PancakeSwap (CAKE). But there were some misses, especially in ApeCoin, the token linked to the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible token (NFT) collection, which dropped as much as 80% on Thursday.  Despite occasional rallies and crashes, it appears that major cryptos (large market capitalization) such as BTC and ETH are stabilizing after a volatile past few days.  Global equities are also higher, especially in Asia, after China's government pledged support for its stock market on Wednesday. Some analysts expect China's central bank to maintain low interest rates this year, which could keep the economy afloat despite the rise in COVID-19 cases and geopolitical woes.  And on the macro front, analysts expect limited upside for the U.S. dollar, which could be positive for bitcoin over the short term.  ""The U.S. dollar has appreciated since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, which is not a surprise given that the greenback has a track record of appreciating in response to geopolitical events,"" MRB Partners, a global investment research firm wrote in a report. ""However, this strength has generally been followed by a consolidation phase.""  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $40,827, +0.15%    ●Ether (ETH): $2,824, +2.96%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4,412, +1.23%    ●Gold: $1,936 per troy ounce, +1.49%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.19%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time. Bitcoin is the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX); Ether is the CoinDesk Ether Price Index (ETX); Gold is the COMEX spot price. Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Bitcoin's trading activity remains relatively low across major exchanges, according to CoinDesk data.  The recent peak in BTC volume was seen on Wednesday when the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike triggered 5% price swings. Still, trading activity has been low relative to prior volume spikes such as the price sell-off in late January and the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war in late February.  Critical levels  Some analysts have increased their price targets for bitcoin, while others remain cautious because of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical risks.  ""The Fed rate hike was not damning enough to worry crypto investors, hence solidifying renewed buying spirit,"" Alexander Mamasidikov, co-founder of mobile digital bank MinePlex, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Mamasidikov expects selling pressure to subside toward the end of the second quarter, and has a price target at $50,000 for BTC.  Still, bitcoin will need to make a decisive break above the $40,000 psychological barrier to trigger an increase in buying activity. So far, volatility hasn’t been particularly high ""taking into account a barrage of largely negative news over the past few days with COVID-19 cases rising and China’s Shenzhen province going into lockdown,"" Mikkel Mørch, executive director of ARK36, a crypto investment fund, wrote in an email.  Generally, the narrative of bitcoin as a safe haven and store of value has been consistent across some analyst commentary despite the recent decline in a risk-off environment, similar to what occurred in 2018 and 2020.  Despite short-term stabilization, bitcoin's market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap remains elevated this year. Typically, BTC outperforms (declines less) in a down market because of its lower risk profile relative to altcoins.

GameStop (GME) said in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that it intends to launch a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace by the end of July.  In February, GameStop, one of the original meme stocks, said it would be partnering with layer 2 system Immutable X for the launch of its NFT plans. In its earnings release, GameStop said the partnership would provide it with up to $150 million in Immutable X IMX tokens upon achievement of certain milestones.  GameStop also noted that it had hired dozens of people in Q4 with experience in areas including blockchain gaming, e-commerce and technology.  Overall, the game retailer reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $1.94 per share versus the consensus analyst estimate of a gain of $0.85, according to the three analysts polled by FactSet, and quarterly revenue of $2.25 billion versus the analyst estimate of $2.16 billion.  Shares of GameStop fell about 10% in post-market trading on Thursday.  GameStop said on its earnings call that it sees long-term potential in the NFT market. ""We recognize that our special [connection] with gamers provides us a unique opportunity in the Web 3 and digital asset world,"" one of its executives said on the call.  In its February announcement of the Immutable X partnership, GameStop said it expects its NFT marketplace will include “billions of low-cost, in-game assets that can easily be bought and sold,” specifically mentioning digital real estate and in-game skins.  Shares of GameStop surged in early January after the Wall Street Journal first reported on its plans to build an NFT marketplace and establish cryptocurrency partnerships.

42423675,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2dDXh,1647546209,Why This 111-Year-Old Investment Firm Is Launching a DAO,"Bessemer Venture Partners announced last week it had committed $250 million to invest in Web 3 projects, making it the latest venerable venture capital firm to increase its focus on crypto.  However, the Bessemer announcement was unique in two key ways: the capital wasn’t from a crypto-specific fund and the firm concurrently launched a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  Sequoia Capital and Bain Capital recently announced large new funds specifically dedicated to investing in crypto projects. Bessemer instead made its $250 million commitment from the firm’s $2.5 billion global growth fund.  “We’ve always had flexibility from our main funds to be able to invest across roadmap areas of all types,” said Bessemer partner Ethan Kurzweil in an interview with CoinDesk. “And so there’s really no need for us to raise a dedicated fund.”  But it was the DAO angle that really stood out. Bessemer, a firm that launched 111 years ago as a family office, made its crypto move more distinct – and perhaps more puzzling – with the launch of BessemerDAO.  “We wanted to provide portfolio services in a new way, both to our founders as well as other founders that we may invite into the DAO,” said Kurzweil. “We figured this was the most crypto-native way to provide portfolio support that we could think of as opposed to just taking our venture style and force-fitting it into crypto.”  Read more: Bessemer Commits $250M to Web 3, Launches DAO  But what does it really mean?  Kurzweil said there are five core components of what Bessemer hopes the DAO will do and how it will provide portfolio support for founders and companies: talent introductions, business development through networking, community, tokenomics and, eventually, an education track around investment themes and areas of innovation.  The BessemerDAO Discord channel opened last Thursday and started on-boarding members. The DAO is a token-gated community, with Bessemer granting every member invited to the Discord a special non-fungible token (NFT) that provides access.  “We want to set up as flexible a structure as possible. There will be a token that everyone gets for being in [the Discord], but then we’re going to see how the incentive structures evolve from there,” said Kurzweil.  The DAO isn’t decentralized from launch with the Bessemer team in charge of setting things up, he added.  “There’s a centralized group of people that come together to instate it, give it a purpose, invite the initial cohort of people and get the community going. And then it takes on a life of its own,” said Kurzweil.  The DAO could eventually have a fund or pooled capital to contribute to various projects, said Kurzweil. He said he doesn’t know when or if this could happen, but Bessemer would “love to help in democratizing private markets, and we’d be fully supportive of that.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/17/why-this-111-year-old-investment-firm-is-launching-a-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa70d3e42c6032c42081682d857d77f5e1b0ee70-4500x2100.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Traditional markets and cryptocurrencies both sold off in the immediate aftermath of Wednesday’s rate hike announcement by the U.S. central bank, but recovered those losses and more by the end of the day.  Speaking at the post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand a number of rate hikes this year, and doesn’t see a recession on the horizon.  “I think that the result of this FOMC meeting is bullish for the market in the short-term, as the market gained clarity on the Fed raising rates and there were no big surprises,” said Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at U.K.-based GlobalBlock. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the Fed's monetary policymaking body.  Motiriou, however, does worry that rate hikes initially may not do a lot to cool inflation, setting up markets for more pain if the Fed feels the need to get more aggressive in its money tightening policy.

The &apos;all exchanges reserve&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin stored in wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means the supply on exchanges is rising as investors deposit a net amount of coins. Such a trend may be bearish for the price of the coin as holders usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes. On the other hand, the reserve&apos;s value decreasing implies that a net amount of Bitcoin is exiting exchange wallets at the moment. This kind of trend when sustained over a period can prove to be bullish for the coin&apos;s price as it may be a sign that investors are accumulating.

Optimism is a layer 2 scaling solution built on the Ethereum blockchain that uses a transaction execution method called optimistic rollups to improve throughput and lower transaction fees while still maintaining the security properties of the underlying blockchain.  Optimism has about $363 million in total value locked (TVL) on the platform, according to DeFi Llama data.  A16z led Optimism’s $25 million Series A round last year. At the time, Partners Chris Dixon and Arianna Simpson praised Optimism’s “exceptional team, carefully designed developer experience, major scaling benefits, years of research and testing, and full composability.”  Last summer, a16z launched what was then the largest fund in crypto industry history at $2.2 billion. Paradigm topped the figure with its own $2.5 billion fund launch in November.

Arthur Hayes Says,"Bitcoin could have a bigger role in the international board as superpowers compete for dominance over the financial system.

As Gold Rises, So Will Bitcoin… In a recent post from BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes, there is a prediction for Bitcoin for the coming years, and a declaration with potential implications for the whole world: the financial system supported by oil and dollars came to an end. Otherwise known as &apos;Petrodollars&apos;, the term describes the way our current financial ecosystem is supported by the exchange of the U.S. dollar for this commodity, the world&apos;s main source of energy. Big oil producers accept this currency, almost exclusively, for their products. This gives the U.S. dollar a prime position in the financial system, contributing to its global reserve currency status. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is another major component of that system. For some, Bitcoin is a direct competitor and a threat to this status quo.

42423674,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2dDbh,1647536440,Coinbase Adds Solana Tokens to Self-Custody Wallet in Non-EVM First,"Coinbase’s (COIN) self-custody crypto wallet added Solana ecosystem tokens Thursday in an expansion of the MetaMask competitor’s coverage scope.  Solana program library (SPL) tokens – Solana’s version of Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens – are now the first non-Ethereum-compatible crypto asset on Coinbase Wallet. The browser extension and app was previously limited to Ethereum Virtual Machine networks such as Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche.  Solana’s addition has the primary effect of greenlighting this blockchain’s ecosystem of token-linked lending, trading, governance and stablecoin projects for deposit. It follows Coinbase’s opening of trading last month for two such projects: Bonfida and Orca.  In a blog post shared with CoinDesk, the crypto exchange pledged more Solana integrations are coming soon, including support for Solana-based non-fungible tokens (NFT). Also upcoming is the ability to plug Coinbase Wallet into Solana decentralized applications (dapp).  “You can store, send and receive Solana tokens now. Dapp connections, trading and NFTs are coming soon,” a banner within the app said Thursday.

The highly anticipated meeting had been concluded, coming out that the Fed had increased interest rates by 0.25%. Ethereum has responded positively to the news and had rallied out of the slump it had been in since the last dip. Now the digital asset sits above $2,700 but it is still far from stable at this price point. What The Rally Did Ethereum&apos;s rally on Wednesday was a welcome one, showing more bullish tendencies towards cryptocurrencies following the Fed&apos;s decision. After completely smashing the $2,522 resistance point, the digital asset is on to test much bigger resistance points. This resistance being mounted by bears just below $2,800 has seen ETH ricochet back down.

It is now trading above the 20-day moving average, meaning sentiment towards purchasing the asset at these prices is shifting towards the positive. Indicators point towards significant support forming for the cryptocurrency just above the $2,600 level. But at its current price, the next resistance point lies at $2,839.

The partnership launches a ""PancakeSwap Mini-Program"" on the Binance app, which is the first decentralized finance (DeFi) project on Binance’s mobile platform, according to the press release. The Mini Program will start rolling out Thursday and eventually be available to all users of the app.  The idea behind the launch is to give Binance users easy access to PancakeSwap through the Binance app, lowering the barrier to DeFi. Binance has also announced a DeFi wallet within its app, allowing users to transfer funds and use decentralized applications (dapps) such as PancakeSwap.

While Coinbase’s NFT business hasn’t officially launched for users, CEO Brian Armstrong said during the recent earnings call the market was ripe. As far back as last autumn the company reportedly had more than a waiting list of 1 million customers for its NFT marketplace. The major competitor is OpenSea, which has first mover advantage and user familiarity.  In Todaro’s base case scenario, Coinbase’s NFT platform would have similar fees to competitors at 2.5%, volume of $1.5 billion and post-annual revenue of $450 million. In an aggressive bullish scenario, Coinbase might push fees to 3%, see volume of $3.5 billion and add as much as $1.26 billion in revenue.  For perspective, Coinbase in 2021 had total revenue of $7.4 billion.

The round was led by FTX Ventures and Three Arrows Capital, with the raise representing FTX Venture’s first investment in a zero-knowledge project. Other participants include Alan Howard, Amber Group, Blockchain.com, Brevan Howard, Circle Ventures, Finality Capital Partners and Pantera.  “The main opportunity here is to be able to program with zero knowledge for regular developers,” Mina Foundation CEO Evan Shapiro said in an interview with CoinDesk.  He added: “Historically, this hasn't been possible. You had to be a cryptographer that also happened to be super good at the kinds of programming you need to work with zero-knowledge proofs. What makes this exciting is any developer who knows JavaScript can now work with ZK proofs.”  Shapiro declined to share the price at which the tokens were sold or the percentage of the Mina Foundation treasury the round represents.  Grant program  According to Shapiro, the network soft-launched in December 2021, and the team has been slowly raising production ever since.  “The main function of the raise is to increase our capacity to give out grants to proposals that can help support the protocol,” he said.  So far, “1,100 or so” grantees have received funds, and the team saw over 100 applications for its “ZK Bootcamp” application development program, of which the foundation selected a dozen to nurture.  An identity solution, multiple games and a “highly scalable layer 2” system count among the first cohort, and Shapiro said he expects to see many of them reach production within the next six months.  Other promising zero-knowledge applications include “a [decentralized finance] app that has a form of identity of private [know your customer],” private decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) transactions and memberships, and private non-fungible token (NFT) ownership – all of which are frequently requested features among users and developers.  “This is a special moment where zero-knowledge proofs are becoming something that people can generally use, and not just select developers.

42423670,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2dDNh,1647532806,Katie Haun’s New Fund Joins $10M Round for Polkadot Lending Protocol Moonwell,"As Polkadot brings its hub-and-spoke vision for the future of crypto to the fore, investors are pouring money into the network’s decentralized finance (DeFi) building blocks.  Lunar Labs is the latest team to emerge, announcing Thursday a funding round of $10 million to fuel the development of Moonwell Artemis, a collateralized lending protocol for Polkadot’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)–compatible Moonbeam parachain.  The funding round, which was co-led by Hypersphere Ventures and Arrington Capital, is one of the first to feature participation from ex-Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Katie Haun’s new venture fund. Big names including Lemniscap, Robot Ventures and Signum Capital, among others, were involved.  Moonwell Artemis will work similarly to lending products like Aave, MakerDAO and Compound by allowing users to lend crypto and take out over-collateralized loans. The formula has proven successful in DeFi, with Aave, MakerDAO and Compound attracting $12.06 billion, $15.84 billion and $6.89 billion in crypto deposits, respectively.  Polkadot, which describes itself as a layer 0 network, makes it easy for layer 1 parachains like Moonbeam to securely communicate. This means users of Moonbeam – and therefore Moonwell Artemis – can easily transfer value across Polkadat networks without relying on problem-prone cross-chain bridges.  Since Moonbeam is EVM-compatible, users of Ethereum, Fantom and other EVM-compatible chains will be able to interact with Moonwell Artemis using familiar tools like MetaMask.  As for why one might want to borrow crypto against high collateral, Luke Youngblood, who left Coinbase (COIN) to co-found Lunar Labs, gives the example of paying rent.  “It’s great to be able to take out stablecoins and pay bills in the real world without having to sell some of your crypto,” Youngblood told CoinDesk, “especially if you have the long-term view that crypto is going to be worth more tomorrow than it is today.”  Moonwell Artemis is not set to launch until April, but Lunar Labs is already piloting its lending protocol on Moonbeam’s Kusama-based sister chain, Moonriver. (Polkadot projects typically launch first on Kusama, Polkadot’s canary network, which is used to test out new features but has emerged as a valuable ecosystem in its own right.)  The pilot lending protocol, Moonwell Apollo, launched on Moonriver on Feb. 10 and has already amassed $230 million in total value locked (TVL).

42423657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2dCzh,1647531388,Sen. Warren Announces Sanctions Compliance Bill for Crypto Companies,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) announced Thursday a new bill to block cryptocurrency companies from conducting business with sanctioned companies.  The Digital Assets Sanctions Compliance Enhancement Act, introduced with Sens. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and others, would allow the U.S. president to add non-U.S.-based crypto companies to sanctions list if they support sanctions evasion.  ""This is a bill that would authorize the president to sanction foreign cryptocurrency firms that are doing business with sanctioned Russian entities and authorize the Secretary of Treasury to act,"" she said.  According to a draft of the bill, the presidential administration would be tasked with identifying ""any foreign person"" who operates a crypto exchange or otherwise facilitates digital asset transactions who has also supported sanctions evasion by Russian individuals named to the Office of Foreign Asset Control's sanctions list.  Moreover, the U.S. president could sanction these exchange operators unless there was a national security interest in not doing so.  The U.S. Treasury secretary could also require that crypto exchanges operating in the U.S. not conduct transactions for, or otherwise work with, crypto addresses belonging to people based in Russia if this is deemed to be in the national interest. The Treasury secretary would have to report to Congress about this decision.  The bill seems to extend beyond just Russian sanctions. Another provision would authorize the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to identify users transacting with more than $10,000 in crypto.  ""Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network shall require United States persons engaged in a transaction with a value greater than $10,000 in digital assets through [one] or more accounts outside of the United States to file a report,"" the bill said.  The Treasury secretary would also be tasked with identifying exchanges that could be at ""high risk for sanctions evasion"" or other crimes, and reporting these entities to Congress.  ""Any exchange included in the report may petition the Office of Foreign Assets Control for removal, which shall be granted upon demonstrating that the exchange is taking steps sufficient to comply with applicable United States law,"" the bill said.  Warren announced the bill during a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee on how crypto might be used for illicit finance.  Prior to the announcement, Warren asked Chainalysis' Jonathan Levin about how easy it might be for Russian oligarchs to evade sanctions using cryptocurrency.  Levin, responding to a hypothetical put forward by Warren, said it would be difficult for an oligarch to hide even relatively small sums of money ($100 million worth) because of the different blockchain tracking tools that exist.  Mixing services, chain hopping and splitting large sums of crypto into smaller sums in different wallets would not help an oligarch hide their activities, Levin said.  ""I'm actually surprised by your answers since you charge a lot of money to untangle and track assets through the system and the system keeps developing more ways to obscure that money,"" Warren responded.

The token was airdropped to Bored Ape NFT owners this morning after being announced yesterday as a part of a larger ApeDAO campaign, but holders quickly selling the coin have sent its price plummeting.  The token has fallen from its highest price of $39.40 to a now stable $8.90, trading for as low as $6.48, according to CoinMarketCap. The total market cap for the token now sits at a whopping $2.4 billion, making it currently the 49th-largest coin.  If earlier airdrops are any indication, however, that ranking isn’t likely to stick.  Owners of Bored Ape NFTs were airdropped 10,000 ApeCoins a piece, with 15% of the total supply being available to claim this morning.  Of the remaining supply, 47% will be sent to the Ape DAO treasury, 16% to parent company Yuga Labs, 8% to the BAYC founders and 14% to launch contributors.  The floor price for a Bored Ape NFT briefly fell to 79 ETH (roughly $220,000) following the airdrop but has since rebounded to 90 ETH (roughly $250,000).

Called DCLiquidity, the new business wing aims to guide early-stage founders through the sometimes thorny technical, tokenomic, economic and legal mazes that precede even pre-seed funding rounds. Following the launch, it will make a market for the project’s token until liquidity builds naturally.  “Until then, you’ll need someone like us just to make sure that a normal trader will look at your product and say, ‘Hey, listen, there’s enough organic [liquidity] – be it order-book depth or tight spreads – for this to be worth my time to trade,” said Arpan Gautam, Dexterity Capital's head of business.

Larger competitors run similar token-startup consulting services. The thinking goes: it pays to hire someone who knows someone – be they market makers, exchanges or venture investors – if you are a pre-launch founder.

The effort comes hot on the heels of Yang’s first foray into DAOs – last month, he announced Lobby3, a new organization advocating for Web 3 policies in Washington, D.C.  In recent months, the proliferation of DAOs has seen the adoption of use cases ranging from social clubs to investment syndicates to crowdfunding vehicles. It appears Yang’s GoldenDAO and Lobby3 are now pushing DAOs into the realm of social activism.  GoldenDAO’s site was revealed Wednesday, coinciding with the one-year anniversary of the Atlanta spa shooting that killed eight people, including six Asian Americans.  GoldenDAO says its mission is to “collectively advance AAPI solidarity and empowerment through real world events and gatherings, and web3 infrastructure and initiatives.”  The group has identified seven broad initiatives for boosting the AAPI community, which include combating social injustice and hate crimes, destigmatizing Asian mental health issues and uplifting Asian culture and art.  Interested individuals can join GoldenDAO by purchasing a membership non-fungible token (NFT), with public minting slated for March 31.  The public mint includes 2,000 NFTs sold via last price Dutch auction, with prices starting at 1.28 ETH (approximately $3,600 in today’s ether prices) and decreasing to 0.88 ETH (approximately $3,350).  In addition, 888 NFTs will be offered in a whitelisted presale next week at 0.8 ETH each (approximately $3,000) for “individuals who show commitment to GoldenDAO initiatives.” An additional 200 NFTs will be reserved for individuals and partners who “show long-term commitment to GoldenDAO initiatives.”  This puts the total supply of GoldenDAO’s initial NFT drop at 3,088 and could put up to $9 million in the project’s coffers.

Popular wallet profiler and analytics platform Nansen announced on Thursday that it has expanded its coverage to Terra, now the sixth blockchain the service analyzes.  The coverage comes at a time when Terra is emerging as a DeFi powerhouse and its native token, LUNA, is bucking wider market trends.  Terra is currently the second-largest chain in terms of total value locked (TVL) at $25.6 billion, comfortably outstripping Binance Smart Chain’s $11.9 billion. Likewise, LUNA is up 65% on the month, while ETH has fallen by 5%.  Part of the popularity of the chain is attributable to its high performance. Per a press release provided to CoinDesk, “research from Nansen shows that the total number of transactions on Terra hover around 50% of Ethereum’s total transactions while gas fees paid are between 0.2%–0.6% of that paid on Ethereum.”  However, detractors say that much of the volume that Terra has attracted is due to Anchor, a stablecoin minting protocol that yields over 19% to depositors.  The protocol is often referred to as pyramidal or “ponzinomic” in nature, and high-profile Twitter personalities have been engaging in bets about the price of LUNA in part as a proxy for Anchor’s success.",POSITIVE,ETH | LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | LUNA | SPONSORED | BNB,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/17/nansen-adds-terra-for-on-chain-analytics-as-home-of-luna-grows-as-defi-hub,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1d7d76ad75863a9670c69fa5938bbc71336e7905-5760x3840.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) and seven other members of Congress have sent a letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler asking for answers around the probing of crypto companies. The letter was dated March 16 and posted on Twitter by Emmer.  The questions asked were about the SEC’s use of authorities in its Division of Enforcement and Division of Examination to obtain information on digital asset and blockchain firms.  ""It appears there has been a recent trend towards employing the Enforcement Division's investigative functions to gather information from unregulated cryptocurrency and blockchain industry participants in a manner inconsistent with the Commission's standards for initiating investigation,” the Congress members wrote.  The members said they had reason to believe the requests might be at odds with the Paperwork Reduction Act and noted that “federal agencies must be good stewards of the public’s time, and not overwhelm them with unnecessary or duplicative requests for information.”  The letter then asked a series of 13 detailed questions about document requests the SEC has made of cryptocurrency industry participants, the number of questions in them and how much time companies were given to respond to them. They also asked what the expected compliance costs were to respond to these requests.  “Crypto startups must not be weighed down by extra-jurisdictional and burdensome reporting requirements. We will ensure our regulators do not kill American innovation and opportunities,” Emmer wrote in a tweet accompanying the letter.  The congress members called for their queries to be answered no later than April 29.  The letter’s other signees were Rep. Darren Soto (D-Fla.), Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.), Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.).

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin held above the $40,000 level on Thursday amid a broader uptick in global equities as the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) hiked interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday as expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the U.S. economy was “very strong” and could handle monetary tightening, causing a jump in equities. Meanwhile, the Bank of England holds its monetary policy meeting today, and is expected to raise interest rates to their pre-COVID levels.

Market Moves  By Shaurya Malwa  The U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday as expected.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the U.S. economy was “very strong” and could handle monetary tightening, causing a jump in equities. Meanwhile, the Bank of England holds its monetary policy meeting today, and is expected to raise interest rates to their pre-COVID levels.  U.S. futures shed 0.51% in European trading hours while crude oil jumped 4% to near $100. Europe’s Stoxx 600 rose 0.22%, while Asian markets added a second day of gains with Hong Kong’s Hang Sang index rising 7% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 increasing 3.46%.  Bitcoin added nearly 4% over the past 24 hours to trade at $41,640 before traders took profits. Ether added 4.7% to weekly highs of $2,790, while Terra’s LUNA lost 0.6% in 24 hours.  Investors tied ether’s gains to successful testing on the Ethereum network ahead of its move to a proof-of-stake network.  “Ethereum showed bullish movements on the back of its successful merge on the Kiln testnet, a fundamental milestone in its path toward the transition to proof-of- stake in the course of the year,” said Fabio Pezzotti, founder of crypto investment firm Iconium, in a Telegram message. “We expect the main assets to gain momentum amid positive developments regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine, which would likely revert the bearish trends of the last few months,” he added.  Meanwhile, some analysts said strength in bitcoin was buoyed by positive sentiment for the asset among traders.  “Since the last days of February, there has been a solid support line on the declines under $38,000,“ explained Alex Kuptsikevich, market analyst at FxPro, in an email to CoinDesk. “And this is bullish strength, reflecting that long-term buyer interest has migrated from $30,000 to $38,000 due to inflation and geopolitical tensions.”     Latest Headlines  EU Regulators Warn Consumers That Crypto Assets are 'Highly Risky'  Crypto Miner Hut 8 Reports Surprise Q4 Loss, Shares Fall  Eqonex Appoints Former Head of Binance UK Jonathan Farnell as CEO  Bitcoin Holds Above $40K After Fed Hike, Avalanche’s AVAX Leads Gains Amongst Crypto Majors  Bitcoin-Focused VC Stillmark Hires Former Google X Engineer Vikash Singh  We Voted on It, and You’re Fired.

Market leader OpenSea supports Ethereum, Polygon and Klatyn. It added Polygon-based NFTs last October.  Rarible’s expansion to other chains has been at a steady clip since the site’s launch in early 2020, integrating with Flow last June and Tezos in December. Rarible also launched a messaging feature in November.  That hasn’t done much to boost sales volume, however, according to blockchain data compiled by DappRadar. OpenSea has seen $414 million in weekly sales over the most recent seven-day period; Rarible has only seen $383,000.

42435249,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBvCZb,1647522016,A MetaMask Founding Architect Is Building an Interoperable ‘MetaMetaverse’,"At a time when the definition of “the metaverse” is often dumbed down to fit the broad parameters of a corporate marketing strategy, MetaMask founding architect Joel Dietz is building out the vision of a Web 3 purist.  The project, known as MetaMetaverse, has brought Dietz out of what he called “crypto retirement,” a yearslong period where he stepped away from the space after building the ConsenSys-owned Ethereum wallet as a part of its original development team.  Now he’s been lured back by the new ambitions of the space, and a concept of the metaverse that reminds him of the early days of building Web 3.  “It’s even a sense of personal responsibility, to be working on this,” Dietz told CoinDesk in an interview. “A lot of early Ethereum people had this very utopian vision for what the internet could be, and I don’t want to say they got distracted, but now with the metaverse it feels like we’ve gotten back to that.”  What makes Dietz’s metaverse a “meta” metaverse (not to be confused with Meta’s metaverse) is its focus on interoperability. The digital ecosystem allows users to build projects on its virtual land using several different game engines, including Blender and Unreal Engine 5, used by Epic Games to run “Fortnite.”  The MetaMetaverse also comes attached to its own layer 1 blockchain, boasting a new programming language called “metametalang” that allows users to build out metaverse ambitions of their own.  The future is cubes  Dietz’s metaverse itself is centered around a coordinate system that maps experiences within the platform’s many cubes, which users themselves can essentially own as virtual land.  Inside the cubes are more cubes, and within them, more cubes. It creates what Dietz calls “the Alice in Wonderland effect,” where space can be embedded inside itself, and users can shrink themselves to experience it.  The programming language can be used for “running games and simulations inside of [the cubes], and mapping parallel realities,” all in a natively cross-chain environment, according to a press release.  The platform itself is still in development, and the team has yet to announce its first public land sale for the initial “Mars” universe. Dietz envisions MetaMetaverse eventually functioning as a compliment to existing platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox, ultimately being a less restrictive and more interoperable canvas for developers to build out projects of their own.  “I’m a geek, I need to work on things that are really interesting to me. And building a language for the future of the metaverse that can map all realities, including parallel realities, I’d say that’s pretty cool,” Dietz said. “And potentially very profitable as well.”  MetaMetaverse raised a $2 million seed round in December 2021 backed by Polygon Studios, DAO Maker and Ghaf Capital.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MANA | MATIC | SPONSORED,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/17/a-metamask-founding-architect-is-building-an-interoperable-metametaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d2b223da07d34a3aa5b8a099b7991881f9d6ad0-1920x1277.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42435242,wOc5H8d0GcW5NDeNpBvBuR,1647521796,Bank of England Raises Interest Rates Back to Pre-Pandemic Level of 0.75%,"The Bank of England (BOE) lifted its main bank rate by 25 basis points to a pre-pandemic level of 0.75%, raising the rate for the third consecutive meeting as it battles surging inflation.  The vote by the U.K. central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was 8-1, with Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe voting to hold rates steady as he expects sharply higher commodity prices will put a big dent in consumer demand. Last month, the vote to raise rates had a slimmer majority at 5-4.  Policymakers now expect inflation to peak in the second quarter at 8%, up from their previous estimate of 7.25%  The policy statement, however, leaned dovish, suggesting consensus expectations for the central bank to bring its bank rate to 2% by year end might have gotten ahead themselves. ""Some further modest tightening might be appropriate in the coming months, but there were risks on both sides of that judgment depending on how medium-term prospects evolved,"" the MPC said. That quickly sent the British pound lower by about 1% versus the U.S. dollar and the euro.

42411505,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOOCR,1647521400,What Advisors Can Do During a Bear Market,"Financial service professionals got really excited in 2021. For many of us there was a new asset class called crypto, and it had all the makings of an explosive new niche.  Crypto offered new technology with intriguing narratives. There were easy on-ramps for retail investors, many of whom took it upon themselves to start investing. It included the allure of younger investors and celebrities.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  We saw so much hype and media attention, huge price appreciation to all-time highs and all new memes, heroes and villains.  Then the prices stopped going up and they fell – sometimes violently. The advisors who helped clients invest were now fielding questions about the value and wondering if they had made a mistake.  Was it all too much hype? Are we just in a bear market? And how do advisors talk to clients about crypto now?  When the prices drop, the naysayers and told-you-soers make their opinions known. This is a great time for advisors to evaluate, or re-evaluate, crypto as a part of their practice. How do you go about this determination?  1. Get educated  You may have gotten a quick education on bitcoin (BTC) last year, just so you could hurry and get your clients invested. Of course, all those quick investment theses were easy and made sense when everything was moving up.  Now is a good time to learn more about many of the new subjects pertaining to digital assets.  These include security and safety of wallets and custody as well as security of the underlying networks. You can also learn about some of the upcoming changes to networks like Bitcoin, so you’re prepared to better understand some of the potential demand.  2. Explore new narratives  The world, and therefore macroeconomic factors, is always in flux, and the world is a very different place than it was in mid-2021. Post-COVID-19 reopenings, inflation, supply-chain issues, world conflicts, unrest and revolution are creating new narratives and investment theses for bitcoin and other crypto assets. This is a good time to test your own investment theses and see what might drive or change prices.  Markets like this are also a good time for the builders developing the decentralized ecosystem. Remember, there may be other investment narratives besides just a store of value. Other tokens represent governance, value accrual or utility. Take this time to learn what is being built, and determine how you might look at investments for the future.  3. Catch up on regulations  Regulators here in the U.S. and all over the world have been at work putting out opinions, and enforcing new laws. With some of the hype dying down, it might be time to get more familiar with the current laws and regulations for your country and state.  An even better use of your time might be to read about where regulators might go with enforcing new laws, and research any ongoing actions. This will help you as you establish your practice, including having to make decisions about what services to offer and how to do so. It will also make you more confident when offering crypto-related services to clients, as you can speak to regulatory-based objections.  Sign up for State of Crypto, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter examining the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.  4. Evaluate new options  During the run-up of crypto prices, many custodians, fund companies and projects were able to spend money on infrastructure. This has led to a slew of new offerings and custodial options. If you started your crypto practice with a certain set of offerings – such as custody, management, funds —based on availability at the time, you might want to look at new options now.  If you have not yet started in crypto because there weren’t easy options, you might want to reevaluate the advisory or custodial choices available.  Moving forward  Remember, crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) represent a new financial ecosystem. Just because the price of the tokens are down doesn’t mean the entire system being built is not moving forward.  The recent crypto executive order from President Joe Biden made us feel more comfortable with the idea that crypto and digital assets are here to stay.

42411477,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glONlz,1647521400,Understanding the Technology Behind Decentralized Exchanges,"Financial advisors are very familiar with traditional finance and how the industry works. Registered investment advisory firms are clients of custodians like Fidelity, Schwab and IBRK that have relationships with exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.  Individual securities transact on exchanges, and portfolios of securities are held with custodians. Clients of firms have log-in access to the platforms built by custodians, and the advisors can manage those assets through the custodian. This is how the traditional financial system has worked for decades.  Decentralized finance (DeFi), however, is much different. It’s important that advisors understand this new system so that they will be prepared to explain it to clients and help make recommendations on crypto assets.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.  At the core of DeFi sit decentralized exchanges, or DEXs for short. (I wrote about the importance of DEXs in last week’s newsletter, for the second part of this continuing series on understanding DeFi.) DEXs facilitate the trading of digital assets for users around the world.  Unlike centralized exchanges like the NYSE, DEXs don't use the order book system, which has been used for decades and, to be quite honest, continues to work well today. The reason that DEXs don't use the time-proven order book system is because it requires a team of centralized individuals and technology to run. Instead, DEXs use smart contracts to facilitate trading. The smart contract that governs the trading on a DEX is called a liquidity pool.  Read the first and second parts of this series on understanding DeFi.  What’s a liquidity pool, exactly?  A liquidity pool is simply a pool of locked assets governed by a smart contract (or a piece of software code) that is used by the DEX to trade – often called “swapping” – crypto assets. Liquidity pools are crowdsourced, meaning the paired assets in the pool are not pledged by one single person or institution. True to the decentralized and grassroots style of crypto, liquidity pools come into existence from contributions made by the crypto community. Liquidity pools can be thought of as a giant pot of paired assets that facilitates swapping between currencies.  What are automated market makers?  Liquidity pools are governed by automated market makers, or AMMs, software code that governs and automates the process of swapping assets and providing liquidity and that allows digital assets to be traded on a DEX by using the liquidity pool. On platforms with AMMs, users don't trade with another counterparty (think of buyer and seller in the traditional order book system); instead, they trade against the pool of paired assets.  To understand AMMs, one must understand the mathematical formula that sits at the core of the AMM:  X * Y = k  In a blog post written by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, he proposed the AMM formula, and shortly after that, AMM protocols were born. In the formula, X represents Token A, Y represents Token B, and k represents a constant balance between the two tokens.  In a liquidity pool of two paired assets, if the price of X increases, the price of Y decreases, and therefore the constant, k, remains the same. Only when new assets are pledged to the liquidity pool does the total pool volume increase. This formula governs the liquidity pool and creates a state of balance between the prices of the tokens. Buying Token A will increase the price of Token A, and selling Token A will decrease the price of Token A. The opposite will happen to Token B in the liquidity pool.  Another component of AMMs is the arbitrage feature. These smart contracts are able to compare the prices of paired assets in their own pools with those across the DeFi ecosystem. If the price varies too much, the AMM will incentivize traders to take advantage of the mispricing in the native liquidity and the outside pools, and with this incentive, the native AMM reaches equilibrium once again.  Understanding yield farming  Not only do AMMs incentivize traders to arbitrage cross-pool prices, but the actual liquidity pools themselves give participants an incentive to pledge assets to the pools. Yield farming is a popular way to generate income in the crypto ecosystem and offers an attractive opportunity for token holders to generate a return besides relying solely on price appreciation.  When an individual pledges paired assets into the liquidity pool, he begins to generate tokenized rewards. When a user wants to swap assets through a pool, the pool charges a small fee to the user in order to facilitate the swap. That fee is then paid to the individuals who have pledged their assets to the pool. This fee is often paid out as a liquidity provider (LP) token.  For example, a user may pledge assets to a liquidity pool on a decentralized exchange, such as PancakeSwap. The pledger will generate a yield on his pledged asset as determined by the AMM, and in exchange for providing liquidity, the user will be paid in CAKE, the native LP token that was created by PancakeSwap. The user can then sell his LP token for any other token he wishes.  What to be careful about  Caution is important when it comes to yield farming. New asset pairs, with very low liquidity, often incentivize individuals to contribute to the pool by offering a very high yield. Often these pairs and pools are new, and users face an increased risk of being a victim of fraud or theft. Most of the new pools provide an attractive way for malicious actors to perform an exit scam called a “rug pull.” This is a scam where project creators collect tokens from the community and then abandon the project without repaying the tokens.  Another form of risk is called impermanent loss, which occurs mainly during a period of high volatility, something quite common in cryptocurrency. When the price of one token in a pool moves significantly compared with the price of the other token and liquidity providers decide to withdraw assets from the pool, the individuals who have pledged assets may have less than their original contribution. If the liquidity provider decides to keep assets in the pool, it is possible that the liquidity value returns to break-even given enough time and given a decrease in volatility.  Navigating a new system  So how is an advisor supposed to navigate this entirely new system of asset swapping, decentralization and yield farming, and the associated risks? It’s important to know that the traditional financial system isn’t going away any time soon. However, the blockchain technology that powers DeFi is extremely appealing, for both users and providers in the finance industry.  Advisors need to understand how this technology works and be prepared to see the DeFi industry grow over the next few years. The improvements in efficiency and costs are appealing to consumers and will increase the user experience for our clients.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/17/understanding-the-technology-behind-decentralized-exchanges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3ca473d1ebb860450e5587b2ba0ac327f36ac0a-2400x3000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The regulators cautioned that crypto assets are ""highly risky"" and measures that don't exist in the EU now are needed to protect consumers.  The message was published by the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), which is made up of the European Banking Authority (EBA), European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA).  The group said that crypto investors must ""face the very real possibility of losing all their invested money if they buy these assets,"" adding that investors are privy to misleading advertisements, including those on social media and from influencers. It also warned that crypto investors ""should be particularly wary of promised fast or high returns, especially those that look too good to be true.""  This warning is based on previous similar messages from EU regulators, like the founding regulations of the ESAs, a joint-ESA warning from 2018, as well as a statement issued in March 2021.  ""The ESAs also warn consumers that they should be aware of the lack of recourse or protection available to them,"" the message read, adding that the proposed regulations for crypto in the EU is still moving through the union's legislative process.  The proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory package for governing digital assets passed through a parliamentary committee vote on Monday and is now moving on to the next stage of negotiations between EU governments before being eventually ratified.

The average analyst estimate pointed to earnings of C$0.17 ($0.13), according to FactSet data.  The miner said that the loss was primarily due to noncash revaluation loss on liability warrants of $114.2 million, which was partially offset by increased revenue.  Revenue more than quadrupled to C$57.9 million ($45.8 million) from a year earlier and was in line with analysts' average estimate.  As of Dec. 31, the company had a balance of 5,518 bitcoins with a market value of $323.9 million, which includes 2,000 bitcoins loaned as part of its fiat yield strategy.  The fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) was C$35.3 million ($27.9 million), which missed analysts' estimate of C$37.1 million ($29.3 million) and was up from C$30.7 million ($24.3 million) in the third quarter.  Hut 8's hashrate increased to 2.5 exahash/second (EH/s) by Feb. 28 from about 2.0 EH/s on Dec. 31.

Farnell is the former head of cryptocurrency exchange Binance's U.K. operations.  Digivault last year became the first crypto custody firm to win regulatory approval from the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  Last week, Binance launched fiat-to-crypto payments provider Bifinity, through which it will provide a convertible loan to Eqonex. A convertible loan is one that under certain conditions can be converted into an equity stake.  As part of the terms of the arrangement, Binance was given the right to appoint the CEO, chief financial officer and chief legal officer of Eqonex from within Bifinity.  Last year, Eqonex CEO Richard Byworth stepped down from the company as it held talks over a potential merger or takeover. Byworth was replaced by Chief Operating Officer Andrew Eldon on an interim basis, Eqonex said at the time.  As Digivault is an FCA-registered firm, the watchdog issued a statement acknowledging its awareness of Digivault's relationship with Binance. The FCA has previously voiced concerns about Binance.  ""The FCA did not have powers to assess the fitness and propriety of the new beneficial owners or the change in control before the transaction was completed,"" the agency said. It is unclear whether the FCA plans to take any further action.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the U.S. economy was “very strong” and could handle monetary tightening, causing a jump in equities. Meanwhile, the Bank of England will also holds its policy meeting on Thursday and is expected to raise interest rates to pre-COVID levels.  U.S. futures shed 0.51% during European trading hours ,while Brent crude oil futures jumped 4% to nearly $100 a barrel. Europe’s Stoxx 600 rose 0.22%, while Asian markets added a second day of gains with Hong Kong’s Hang Sang index rising 7% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 increasing 3.46%.  Bitcoin added nearly 4% over the past 24 hours to trade at $41,640 before traders took profits. Ether (ETH) added 4.7% to weekly highs of $2,790, and Terra’s LUNA lost 0.6% in 24 hours.  Avalanche’s AVAX rose over 11% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among major cryptocurrencies as Terra’s UST stablecoins were deployed on the Avalanche network. Users can now deposit, borrow and earn yields on UST deposits using Avalanche.  Investors tied ether’s gains to successful testing on the Ethereum network ahead of its move to a proof-of-stake network.  “Ethereum showed bullish movements on the back of its successful merge on the Kiln testnet, a fundamental milestone in its path toward the transition to proof-of-stake in the course of the year,” Fabio Pezzotti, founder of crypto investment firm Iconium, said in a Telegram message.  “We expect the main assets to gain momentum amid positive developments regarding a cease-fire in Ukraine, which would likely revert the bearish trends of the last few months,” he added.  Crypto market capitalization grew by 4% over the past day to $1.82 trillion. The Bitcoin Dominance Index rose 0.2 points to 42.8%. The Fear and Greed index – which calculates market sentiment – added 3 more points in the day to take the “fear” level to 27 suggesting improved sentiment among investors.  Meanwhile, some analysts said strength in bitcoin was buoyed by positive sentiment for the asset among traders.  “Since the last days of February, there has been a solid support line on the declines under $38,000,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a market analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “And this is bullish strength, reflecting that long-term buyer interest has migrated from $30,000 to $38,000 due to inflation and geopolitical tensions.  “Such a migration of the level of interest to long-term buyers fully reflects the price jump, which is the actual depreciation of the value of fiat currencies,” he added.",POSITIVE,AVAX | BTC,AVAX | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/17/bitcoin-holds-above-40k-after-fed-hike-avalanches-avax-leads-gains-amongst-crypto-majors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f8e1f1f3614c5fbecbef895ca6984e2b260e85c-1813x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411485,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOO98,1647479076,We Voted on It and You’re Fired: Welcome to the New World of DAOs,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) have existed for a few years, but they are only just starting to increase their impact on how the world’s organizations govern themselves. As DAOs spread, they will usher in a new way of working and a fierce new era of digital competition, and in doing so transform traditional organizations.  One of the first, most visible effects of DAOs will be the extreme transparency they bring to business operations. Almost any stakeholder in most DAOs can table a governance proposal and vote on it. More often than not, these proposals resemble shareholder resolutions for large enterprises, although they can get a lot more specific. Project teams have been summarily terminated, and individuals have been removed from their jobs for behavior outside of work.  Paul Brody is EY's global blockchain leader and a CoinDesk columnist.  The termination of a project team at an established DAO offers a good example of one such termination. Voters passed a proposal to end the budget allocation for this team because it had made no useful progress in a significant period of time. I tried to sort through the claims and counterclaims and wasn’t successful. The team had few clear, published success metrics, but the debate on the proposal ended up being highly subjective.  We remain in the early days of these kinds of governance battles, but my immediate takeaway was that if I was working for a DAO, I’d want to have clear metrics and good documentation. Such extreme transparency would help make people more responsive. A ruthless and never-ending feedback cycle is one of the reasons why ride-sharing services are consistently good, despite being crowdsourced.  Read More:What Is a DAO?  Not only will extreme transparency transform how people work, it will also transform competition. The product delivered by many DAOs is a protocol. And while software can be copyrighted, the underlying logic of protocols isn’t something you can hide. From incentive structures to key algorithms, nearly everything delivered by DAOs is fully public. That means that good ideas spread quickly and innovators build upon each other with speed.  The result could be a more ruthlessly competitive digital market than ever before. The permissionless, decentralized and interoperable nature of blockchain ecosystems means that companies have far less lock-in power over their clients. When a competing protocol or service is available and delivers a better result, market share changes may follow quickly. Recent developments in decentralized exchange markets shows that even small performance or cost improvements have turned market-share upside down. It will be remarkably hard for blockchain entities to coast into the future based on the strength of past work.  Changing governance  Another way in which DAOs are likely to transform organizations is by allowing for more engaged systems of governance. The ability to delegate voting power is a breakthrough because most stakeholders (and most shareholders in traditional companies) don’t have the time or the capacity to follow different issues that arise. With delegated voting, people can focus on specific areas or enterprises, leading to higher levels of engagement.  In democracies, Fortune 500 companies, blockchain DAOs, and other large organizations, few stakeholders actually contribute thoughtfully to governance. This isn’t a moral failing; rather, it’s a practical challenge. For example, I own shares in S&P 500 index funds but I couldn’t possibly track the range of open issues at even a fraction of companies in the funds.  Read More: From DOH! to DAO: The Rise of Decentralized Organizations  I prefer to delegate my voting rights to experts. I also prefer to assign my votes to people who care about the same issues I do including fossil fuels and equal opportunities. I want my shareholder voice to count more than it does today.  All this isn’t entirely new ground. Partnerships, co-ops and collaborative governance models, among other organizations have been around for a long time and have their merits. Partnerships and co-ops tend to endure a long time and they don’t seem to fall victim to empire-building CEOs or giant egos when people get to debate and vote on big issues.  Partnerships already have a powerful staking model. Trust me, borrowing several hundred thousand dollars to buy into a partnership is as valid as any other staking methodology. The difference is that new digital voting tools and delegation capabilities make being a partner or stakeholder a more practical, scalable option than in the past.  Sometimes, you need new technology to make old ideas powerful again.
