42398776,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZV6,1445986810,"MasterCard, CIBC and New York Life Join DCG Funding Round","Payments giant MasterCard has been named as one of 11 investors in Digital Currency Group's (DCG) new funding round.  The undisclosed raise, announced today, attracted support from billion-dollar brands across multiple sectors including Canadian bank CIBC, insurer New York Life and TransAmerica Ventures, the VC fund owned by Aegon and TransAmerica.  It marks the first investment in the bitcoin and blockchain sector for all but four of the firms involved.  DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert said in a statement:  ""It is our mission to accelerate the development of a better financial system, and we’re excited to be doing it together with a fantastic group of visionaries.""  Others in the round include healthcare/FinTech fund Oak HC/FT, Chain investor RRE and Bain Capital Ventures, the VC arm of asset management firm Bain Capital.  ""Unique position""  DCG  was created earlier this year when Genesis Global Trading and Grayscale Investments – formerly under the SecondMarket umbrella – merged with Silbert's seed fund, the Bitcoin Opportunity Corp (BOC).  Having backed 57 companies in 18 countries, the company has by far the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the sector.  Silbert – whose first company, SecondMarket, was acquired by NASDAQ Private Market last week – told CoinDesk DCG will invest in a further 10 to 20 companies in 2016.  In turn, his company is hoping to use its ""unique position"" in the industry to foster collaboration between entrepreneurs, investors and – crucially – legacy institutions, who are seeking answers about blockchain technology's disruptive potential.  Georg Schwegler, the CEO of TransAmerica Ventures, told CoinDesk his firm had joined DCG's round to get a broad overview of goings on in the space.  ""Instead of investing in single companies in that space, we wanted to have access to a larger ecosystem on a global basis,"" he said.  Schwegler went on to describe the flexibility blockchain technology affords payment processes as ""phenomenal"".  Silbert told CoinDesk the firms involved had expressed interest in following up with investments or collaborations in individual startups:  ""For many of our new investors, this is their first investment in the bitcoin/blockchain space ... A number intend to co-invest with us and many have already started conversations with our 57 companies regarding partnership and investing opportunities.""  Growing legitimacy  TransAmerica's Schwegler told CoinDesk that it's interesting to see more and more financial incumbents recognise the potential of the blockchain:  ""The encouraging part is that a lot of finance companies – banks and insurance – are becoming aware of the advantages of the technology finally.""  The funding news marks the latest in a line of announcements that speak to the growing legitimacy of blockchain technology in the traditional payments arena.  Last week, American Express was named as one of the investors backing Abra, the remittance app run on bitcoin's blockchain, in its $12m Series A.  A month ago, Visa and Capital One backed Chain's latest round of $30m, as did French telecom giant Orange SA, Nasdaq and Citi Ventures.

42398794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZjr,1445977285,Visa Debuts Bitcoin Proof-of-Concept for Car Leasing,"Visa and DocuSign unveiled a new proof-of-concept this week that leverages the bitcoin blockchain for recordkeeping.  The project, outlined in a 26th October blog post and debuted at Money20/20 in Las Vegas, focuses on digitizing the process of leasing a car. Bitcoin transactions are used to create a digital fingerprint for each vehicle, with new transactions published throughout the leasing process.  ""From the driver's seat, the customer then chooses the lease options for the car – low, mid or high mileage, for example and DocuSigns the leasing contract right there and then. This is all in turn updated on the blockchain,” the post explains.  “They then choose their insurance options in the familiar way – evaluating by coverage, deductible and other factors,"" it continues. ""They would again DocuSign the agreements, and the blockchain would again be updated.”  Visa is involved through its technology innovation arm, which has been working with bitcoin and the blockchain for months. The company is also an investor in DocuSign.  Other elements of the proof-of-concept involve Visa’s credit cart network and some of DocuSign’s document management technology in a bid to connect the leased car and further digitize the leasing process. DocuSign released a YouTube video that shows a step-by-step demonstration, including instances in which information is published via the bitcoin blockchain.  DocuSign and Visa did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42398775,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZS9,1445965536,Nasdaq to Unveil Blockchain-Based Platform,"Nasdaq is set to unveil its new blockchain-based platform, which will facilitate share transfers and sales on its private market.    The firm's demonstration of the new platform is expected to take place at the Money 20/20 event in Las Vegas today.  A company-issued statement said Nasdaq Linq – first announced in May – would include Chain, Change Tip, PeerNova, Synack, Tango and Vera as its first private company clients.  Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq CEO, said in a statement:  ""We are extremely encouraged by the initial demand for Nasdaq Linq from these innovative, first-mover companies, and the validation it represents of our application of blockchain technology ... blockchain applied to the private market is innovation built on top of innovation, and carries with it the opportunity to forever alter the future of financial services infrastructure.""  The platform was developed by Nasdaq's in-house technologists in collaboration with blockchain technology startup Chain – which recently closed a $30 million funding round with support from Visa – and contributions from global design and innovation firm Ideo.  Adam Ludwin, Chain CEO, said: ""We are excited to leverage Nasdaq Linq to issue and manage our company's securities in a more efficient and transparent way.""  The news comes after Fredrik Voss, vice president and head of blockchain strategy at Nasdaq, spoke to CoinDesk about the group's crypto-related strategies earlier this month.

42398785,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZbz,1445962265,Digital Currency Pyramid Scheme Operators Jailed in Spain,"A Spanish court has remanded in custody the alleged operators of a pyramid scheme that used a fake digital currency called 'unete'.  Temporary imprisonment pre-trial is typically set as a precaution to avoid defendants from fleeing or destroying necessary evidence during a case.  The court documents, dated 21st October, state that Jose Manuel Ramirez Marco and Maria del Pilar Otero Sanchez are both suspected of fraud, participating in a criminal organisation and money laundering.  Spanish police first arrested 20 individuals in connection to the pyramid scheme in July, estimating that 50,000 victims had been defrauded worldwide.  Launched in 2013, the Unetenet scheme, which promised investors as much as $1,300 in weekly returns, gained traction among investors through its promotional events and sales pitches.  According to documents seen by CoinDesk, victims have been defrauded of over $31m (€28m).",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/27/digital-currency-pyramid-scheme-operators-jailed-in-spain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32230ed96e331bdce532a2cc0afaf677004df0ee-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZgu,1445959161,8 Companies That Have Filed Crypto Patents,"Just yesterday, CoinDesk reported eBay had filed two cryptocurrency-related patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) – the agency responsible for issuing patents and registering product and intellectual property trademarks.  In so doing, the online giant joined a slew of crypto and non-crypto companies which have also filed applications in an attempt to protect their products.  Often a topic of contention in the largely open-source bitcoin community, CoinDesk has rounded up some of the most high profile patent submissions revealed to date.    1. 21 Inc  The best-funded company in the space filed two patent applications with the USPTO, one of which was for a digital currency mining circuitry. The patents were published by the agency on 15th October.  Submitted in April last year,the patents listed the inventors as Matthew Pauker, co-founder and chairman at 21 Inc; Nigel Drego, co-founder and chief architect; Veerbhan Kheterpal, president and co-founder; and Daniel Fir, co-founder.  ""The present invention relates to mining of digital currencies such as cryptocurrencies,"" reads the filing, which goes on to state: ""Mining circuitry and mining operations described herein may be used for any digital medium of exchange such as digital currencies, credits, rewards, or points.""        2. Coinbase  Just last month, CoinDesk reported that San Francisco-based firm Coinbase had filed nine bitcoin patent applications with the USPTO.  Submitted in 17th March 2015, the filings included patent applications for various bitcoin products including a hot wallet, an instant exchange (launched in June), a bitcoin exchange and a bitcoin tipping button.  Coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong took to Reddit to defend the company's decision to file for patent protection.  Speaking to CoinDesk at the time, he said:  ""While it would be irresponsible for Coinbase not to apply for patents (we need to protect ourselves from larger companies engaging in patent warfare), we can certainly commit to not using patents offensively against smaller companies.""      3. Bank of America  Bank of America's patent application for a wire transfer system that would leverage cryptocurrency technology also made headlines last month.  Filed on 17th March by the US financial services giant, the filing sets out to garner protection for a system by which electronic funds could be transferred between customer accounts using blockchain technology as the payment rail.  Commenting on the purpose of the invention, its authors Thomas Edward Durbin and James Gregory Ronca wrote:  ""Enterprises handle a large number of foreign wire transfer requests on a daily basis. As technology advances, foreign transactions have become more common. For some customers, it may be desirable to conduct a foreign wire transfer in less time than what current foreign wire transfer systems allow.""        4. BitGo  A patent application filed by BitGo caused concern among crypto enthusiasts and prominent industry figures, prompting bitcoin multisig wallet provider to address the issue on its blog:  ""Today we're excited to announce BitGo's decision to internally adopt the Innovators Patent Agreement (IPA), a framework for patent assignment that allows engineers, designers, and other employees to retain control of patents stemming from their inventions. BitGo has no issued patents as of today, but intends to use the agreement if and when any patent may be issued.""  The IPA – pioneered by Twitterhttp://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/software/innovators-patent-agreement-twitters-defensive-patenting-strategy in 2012 – BitGo added, stipulates that patents must be used for defensive purposes only, ""meaning that patents awarded to employees cannot be used in offensive litigation without permission from the investors themselves"".        5. MasterCard  Last year, global financial services giant MasterCard filed a patent to be able to incorporate bitcoin into the design of a proposed online shopping cart which would be rolled out on a global scale.  Speaking to CoinDesk at the time, a MasterCard representative said: ""Every day, we look for ways to bring additional convenience to consumers when they shop. This application is just one example of that – exploring how to create flexibility in how a consumer would fund a shopping cart purchase.""  The patent, MasterCard added, should not be perceived as support for bitcoin:  ""The application was filed to protect our intellectual property and does not indicate a commitment to one idea or concept.""        6. Amazon  E-commerce giant Amazon was awarded a bitcoin-related cloud computing patent which outlined the use of digital currencies as payment for cloud computing services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) – the company's cloud-computing platform that, according to the company's CEO Jeff Bezos, is a $5bn business and growing fast.  As reported by CoinDesk at the time, Amazon's patent award came after the company publicly stated it was not interested in accepting digital currencies, despite its perceived competitor eBay hinting at integrating bitcoin payments.        7. Western Union  Colorado-based remittance giant Western Union's patent award in April 2014, was subsequently followed by reports that suggested the company would have a claim to the exchange of alternative currencies.  Although it fails to mention bitcoin, the filing reads:  ""Alternative currencies are an emerging trend. Some alternative currencies have been created in response to a lack of long-term confidence in monetary methods of exchange; some as a community hedge against inflation; others merely as a medium of exchange between members of a physical or virtual community, among other reasons.""        8. IBM  IBM filed a patent application to track the value of digital currencies in 2012.  Made public in 2013, IBM's application states:  ""The ability to validate and authenticate digital tokens across the lifetime of any particular token will bolster trust and viability, allowing e-currencies to operate across disparate economic systems, fostering easier participating alongside sovereign currencies and non-standard currencies.""

42398790,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZht,1445948114,BitFury Announces 'Record' Immersion Cooling Project,"Bitcoin's biggest miner, BitFury, says it is launching the world's largest two-phase immersion cooling project.  As part of its new $100m data centre in the Republic of Georgia, the firm will cool more than 40MW of processing power in 3M's engineered 'Novec' fluid.  Masterminded by Allied Control, the immersion cooling startup BitFury acquired in January, the project will help the miner reduce energy costs as it continues its rapid expansion.  BitFury CEO Valery Vavilov said in a statement:  ""We’ve taken many steps to optimize our infrastructure for securing the blockchain and blockchain transaction processing ... These experiences and technologies could be useful for next generation data center constructions of high performance computing and supercomputing.""  Phase one is on track to achieve a power usage effectiveness (PUE) score of 1.02 – meaning that for every 1.02 watts the centre takes in, 1 watt is transferred to its equipment. According to a 2014 survey, the average reported by data centres is 1.7.  Bitfury, which is also bitcoin's best funded miner, has two other facilities, a 20MW centre in Gori, Georgia, and another in Iceland, with a PUE of 1.05. Last week it mined 16.6% of bitcoin blocks, nearly double rival KnCMiner.  Cool solution  With a deflated bitcoin price and increasing competition, running costs are more important for miners than ever. While power is often the biggest overhead, cooling equipment that runs 24/7 is another.  In an interview last April, Allied Control's vice president of engineering, Alex Kampl, told CoinDesk immersion cooling, while costly, is a perfect fit for the bitcoin mining industry:  ""Passive 2-phase immersion cooling is extremely promising, but miners are probably the only ones with the density, flexibility and the need for rapid deployment to use it here and today.""  The process works by immersing hardware in a liquid with a very low boiling point. Once heated, the liquid will evaporate, pulling heat away, then condense and drip back into the tank. 3M claims it can reduce costs by 95%.  Fluids aren't the only choice for industrial-scale bitcoin miners seeking to cool their equipment, however.  In September, KnCMiner opened an 18,000-sq ft facility in northern Sweden that keeps temperatures low via Arctic air pumped in by giant fans. It is said to run on Europe's cheapest electricity.  Farms assembled in remote areas in China – such as HaoBTC's – favour ventilation fans and wet corrugated paper.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/27/bitfury-announces-record-immersion-cooling-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d7555aaa879d72d326bde24f202556998a3e1e66-1500x651.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
