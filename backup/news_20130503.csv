42376452,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AdyD,1367603863,BitcoinATM plans to offer bitcoins on the spot,"Bitcoins aren’t easy to buy; especially if you don’t have an existing bitcoin account. BitcoinATM hopes to change that with its new bitcoin cash machine.  The first machine was unveiled on Thursday in San Diego, with BitcoinATM founder and CEO Evan Rose promising that the ATMs will help spearhead widespread adoption of bitcoin.  ""Bitcoin is inherently technical, it’s somewhat difficult to buy, it's very difficult to exchange bitcoins for hard currency,"" Rose said in a presentation to reporters. ""The solution we've come up with, in the very familiar ATM platform, accomplishes all three of those bottlenecks.""  The ATMs allow three different types of transactions. Users with bitcoin accounts can use cash to buy bitcoins, and the ATMs can also be used to convert bitcoins into hard currency. There's a catch, though. Because bitcoin transactions require network confirmation, it takes about 10 minutes to process the cash. Customers can monitor the status of transactions on their smartphones.  The ATMs also allow users with no bitcoin account to create a new bitcoin address on the machine, Rose said.  ""We print out the public receiving address and the private key to receive those funds,"" he explained. ""Anyone with cash can buy bitcoins and hold them in your hand with a paper wallet.""  Rose continued, ""We've come up with an elegant solution that allows your average person who has no prior knowledge of bitcoin to really delve into the market.""  Thursday's event was a demonstration only -- the machines won't be hitting the street for three to six months, Rose estimates.  But he's optimistic, noting the company is currently in talks with large ATM operators.  ""There are a lot of ATMs out there,"" Rose noted. ""A switch could be pulled overnight and they would be bilateral market makers for the bitcoin economy.""  Asked about recent guidance on the use of bitcoin from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Rose said the company is moving ""slowly and cautiously to ensure adherence to regulations."" He added that BitcoinATM's goal is to team up with existing ATM providers who already have money transfer licenses in place.",POSITIVE,없음,BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/03/bitcoinatm-plans-to-offer-bitcoins-on-the-spot,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/751722b562e010c98c225773e5bbed0c5eab1fc9-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424851,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWnvh,1367589612,"Tax, zombies, Churchill and flying fingers: The CoinDesk Weekly Review","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review -- a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host ... John Law.    --------------  Is Canada trying to become the first hipster nation? Not only has it demonstrated its geek cred by putting the International Space Station on its new $5 note -- thumbing its nose at the old colonial master, which decided to show the UK’s thrusting 21st century nature by putting Winston Churchill on its new fiver -- it’s also come out with the first official taxation guidance for digital currencies. Which boils down to: pay up.    It’s a bit more complex than that. If you’re using your digital currency to buy actual stuff, then you’re bartering -- there’s tax law for that already -- and if you’re speculating, then capital gains rules apply. Nothing new here. Move along.      Which has got the ice hockey jockeys plenty of column inches, so job done. In terms of the whole tricky business of defanging the big scary monster of an electronically tradable currency that leaves no trails for the taxman to follow, not so much. Like many a digital currency player, it seems the Canada Revenue has spotted the chance to skim some buzz from the current e-currency fever without being too clear about the hard questions. (Canadian banks, however, are less keen to dabble.)      Should the rest of the world take heed? John Law notes only that the slang term for the Canadian dollar is the loonie. It’ll take more than a few tons of orbiting hardware to change that.      ------      Zombie bitcoin mining. There’s a phrase that would make absolutely no sense in the deep past -- say, 2010 -- but might instead be a brand new crime. An unnamed rogue employee at online gaming company, ESEA, illicitly deployed internal software to the company’s 500,000-strong client base. Instead of using every available gigahertz in the service of blood-soaked virtual violence, those clients’ computers spent spare time doing the calculations that create bitcoins. A bad thing, apparently. The chancer skimmed off just shy of $4,000, which has presumably been docked from his or her pocket money.    John Law isn’t quite sure what crime has been committed here, since most of the time the hardware in a gaming computer sits idle and nobody actually lost $4K. The closest he can come is the old offense of “abstracting electricity,” which used to be thrown at phone phreakers in the UK when they tampered with the GPO’s clockwork telephone exchanges, but even that won’t fly in the US. It’s true that when otherwise-idle bits of hardware start thinking furiously, they do take a lot more power, which the hapless gamers would have to pay for, but how many watts does each bitcoin take to generate?  Like so much digital currency rumination the truth is very hard to find, but according to this profit calculator (“Nothing guaranteed”), it’s around a kilowatt per coin -- and our mystery guest managed to mine probably one block of 25 coins, or one per every 20,000 users. Which cost them a few millicents apiece. (Other sources are less sanguine, suggesting up to a quarter of the face value of a bitcoin goes in mining electricity. In which case that’s a thousand dollars across half a million people, or half a cent apiece. If you don’t like any of those numbers, feel free to pick your own.)    Given that nobody’s gone to chokey over LIBOR, that’s going to be a hard case to prosecute. On the other hand, if an enormous number of users with top-end gaming rigs can generate only that little e-cash, either ESEA’s code was tosh-on-a-stick or it’s going to be a long time before Joe Punter gets rich from the sweat of his silicon.      But it is quite pleasing to think that if it does become a crime for third parties to make your computer run useless code, the likes of Oracle, Microsoft and Apple will be eating quite a lot of porridge.      ---------------    If digital currency is keeping the great and the good awake at night, then the combination of digital currency and mobile phones should create more wide-eyed twitching than Missouri’s annual output of crystal meth (which really is eye-opening). Mobile phones have already spawned their own unregulated currency in much of the developing world, where pre-pay credits are negotiable instruments, and every retail bank on the planet is lumbering towards some sort of electronic mobile wallet. Mobiles are the perfect platform for free-form money, combining tons of powerful processing with connectivity, security, low cost and -- let’s face it -- the sort of warm symbiotic attachment to the average human only previously achieved by the tapeworm.  Moreover, people trust them. For everything. So, the regulators of the world are faced with a few billion people already equipped and primed for mobile currency -- all it will take is one good app, and everyone from Aunt Ethel to Al Qaeda can dabble in digital coinage. The only reason that we don’t already do most of our banking on our mobiles is the glacially slow rate at which regulators and banks innovate ... but that does not apply to currencies like bitcoin and it certainly doesn’t apply to the flying fingers of the world’s hungry young mobile app producers. They’re already at it ... and thanks to that old global internet, even if the US decides to ask its geeks to lay off, the apps will pour in from every other country capable of feeding and watering a five-strong programming team.    John Law is reminded of the very early days of the internet, which effectively deployed itself around the world before anyone official worked out what was happening. It’s far worse now we’re all connected and you can get a new app into millions of phones within hours of uploading it to an app store. If you think bitcoin’s causing a ruckus now, then -- in the words of Bachman Turner Overdrive -- you ain’t seen nothing yet.      Sleep well.    ---------------    John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

Sites any serious bitcoiner will likely want to bookmark include:  Bitcoin.org  The original bitcoin client, bitcoin.org includes an introduction to how bitcoins work, definitions of essential bitcoin vocabulary, links to bitcoin specifications and charts, and information for individuals, developers and businesses.  Bitcoin Foundation  The Bitcoin Foundation states its primary goals as helping to standardize, protect and promote the bitcoin system:  “As the bitcoin economy has evolved, we have all noticed barriers to its widespread adoption – botnets that attempt to undermine the network, hackers that threaten wallets, and an undeserved reputation stirred by ignorance and inaccurate reporting.  “To us, it became clear that something had to be done. We see this foundation as critical for bringing legitimacy to the bitcoin currency. Only then can we increase its adoption and positive impact on the world’s finance.”  Bitcoin Forum  An active discussion site for all things bitcoin, the Bitcoin Forum features information for beginners, general discussions, boards focused on the bitcoin economy, areas for technical support and project development, mining help and local boards for speakers of Chinese, Spanish, German, Hebrew, French, Italian, Korean and other languages.  Mt. Gox  One of the oldest bitcoin businesses, Mt. Gox is a trading platform that continues to handle the lion’s share of all bitcoin trades. It enables the global purchase, exchange and reselling of bitcoins in multiple currencies. It also provides tools to enable merchants to accept bitcoin payments through their websites.  Bitcoin wiki  This wiki provides information for the bitcoin community in a format similar to that of Wikipedia. In addition to articles on hundreds of bitcoin-related subjects, the wiki also offers information in multiple languages, links to local bitcoin meetups, technical articles and best practices, and links to various bitcoin forums and chatrooms.  Howtobitcoin.info  This helpful site provides links to bitcoin software providers, charts, web-based wallets, stores, social media, videos and resources such as Satoshi Nakamoto’s original paper describing the Bitcoin protocol.  Blockchain.info  Blockchain.info is a “bitcoin wallet and block explorer.” Owned and operated by the UK-based Qkos Services, Blockchain.info provides data on the most recently mined blocks in the bitcoin blockchain, charts on the bitcoin economy, stats and resources for developers.  Bitcoinx  Bitcoinx.com provides a tool that’s especially helpful for would-be bitcoin miners: a profitability calculator that takes into account current bitcoin mining difficulty, bitcoins per block, mining hardware costs and other factors to determine approximately how much someone could potentially earn each day by mining bitcoins.  Bitcoinx.com also offers market charts, a blog and performance/price information on bitcoin mining hardware and software.  We Use Coins  WeUseCoins is a site “dedicated to making bitcoin more accessible to beginners.” It provides basic startup information for individuals and merchants who want to join the bitcoin economy, a mining guide and additional resources in Chinese, French and German.

Mt. Gox  and CoinLab, headquartered in Seattle, entered into an agreement in November 2012 regarding bitcoin purchase, sale and exchange services for customers in the US and Canada. Under the agreement, CoinLab was to provide Mt. Gox with financial and investment partnerships in the US. In return, Mt. Gox agreed to have CoinLab handle all of its North American bitcoin transactions.  In its complaint, filed Thursday in US District Court in Washington state, CoinLab alleges that Mt. Gox continued to market to customers in North America and did not provide CoinLab with the data and service access it needed to fulfill the terms of the agreement.  ""What tipped us into filing was our complete inability to get Mt. Gox to deliver on the few simple things left that were needed for customers to move over en-masse; we were often left just apologizing to our alpha customers while their own businesses suffered,"" stated CoinLab CEO Peter Vessenes. ""I'm just not willing to put any of our customers in that position -- if we can't do a good job for you, I won't promise that we can.""  In a brief statement released by Mt. Gox early today, CEO Mark Karpeles stated, ""As we have just now received the  complaint, neither Mt. Gox nor our legal team can make any official comment on the matter at this time, but we take this very seriously and will respond appropriately and quickly once we have had time to review it.""

Earlier this week, the academy uploaded seven instructional videos about bitcoin onto its Finance and Capital Markets section. (The videos also appear on Khan Academy's YouTube channel.) Ranging in length from 10:14 to 12:14, all the videos are presented by computer security and cryptography expert Zulfikar Ramzan.  Currently the chief scientist for the cloud technology group at Sourcefire, Ramzan previously worked with Immunet, Symantec, DoCoMo Labs and Alcatel-Lucent. He earned a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The new Khan Academy titles include:  Bitcoin - Overview  Bitcoin - The money supply  Bitcoin - Transaction block chains  Bitcoin - Proof of work  Bitcoin - Transaction records  Bitcoin - Cryptographic hash function  Bitcoin - Digital signatures  In the overview video, Ramzan focuses on the details of how a single transaction works, rather than attempting to summarize the workings of the overall bitcoin system.  ""The bitcoin scheme is fairly involved ... ,"" he explains. ""(T)he best way to really wrap your head around a scheme like bitcoin is to really suspend belief for a bit and get exposed to all these relevant details.""  The posting of the new Khan Academy videos was met with a lot of enthusiasm from the bitcoin community.  ""Awesome!"" noted Bitcoin Forum member Mike Christ. ""I was already a fan of Khan academy, but this is great. Reaffirms the fact that bitcoin is only going to get more and more popular.""  ""I’ve been saying for a long LONG time now that education is past due for a serious overhaul, and Khan Academy has been the front-runner in the race for education’s future,"" wrote David Perry, author of the Coding in my Sleep blog.

Reddit's bitcoin fans  also expressed excitement, though it was somewhat tempered by Ramzan's use of technical terms that ""average people"" might not understand.
