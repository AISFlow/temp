BIS – considered to be the central bank's central bank – will publish those two chapters this weekend on June 17, the institution announced this week. The full report will be published on June 24.  The upcoming report will follow the bank's most recent quarterly review, which warned that ""many cryptocurrencies are ultimately get-rich-quick schemes.""  The review stated:  ""What makes currencies credible is trust in the issuing institution, and successful central banks have a proven record of earning this public trust. The short experience of cryptocurrencies shows that technology, however sophisticated, is a poor substitute for hard-earned trust in sound institutions. ""  Similarly, BIS touched on the topic in an opinion piece written in part by Markets Committee chair Jackqueline Loh in March. The piece claimed that public cryptocurrencies are not feasible options for a cashless society, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  By the same token, the bank has claimed that digital currencies issued by central banks could carry unwelcome side-effects, such as making periods of financial instability worse by helping banks' clients funnel their money from their accounts more quickly.  ""A general purpose CBDC could give rise to higher instability of commercial bank deposit funding. Even if designed primarily with payment purposes in mind, in periods of stress a flight towards the central bank may occur on a fast and large-scale, challenging commercial banks and the central bank to manage such situations,"" BIS stated at the time.

42380857,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zlJJ,1529086069,"Quantstamp Defends QSP, Says Dollars, Ether Accepted Out of 'Necessity'","A week after Quantstamp community members began accusing the smart contracts auditing startup of undermining the value of its $65 million token, the company responded with a statement on Thursday.  As previously reported by CoinDesk  , for at least the past week, Quantstamp token holders have been alleging that the company misled them by accepting U.S. dollars and ether, rather than its token, QSP, as payment for its auditing services.  According to the company's published materials, customers are meant to trade QSP to pay for, receive and improve verification services within the Quantstamp network.  The company told CoinDesk that the community's concerns stem from a lack of clarity regarding the difference between two of its projects and admitted that the community's frustration has indicated that Quantstamp ""need[s] to do more"" to clarify the distinction.  The products in question are, on the one hand, an auditing protocol outlined in its white paper and under development. The other one is a ""web product"" which it currently uses for audits.  ""The Quantstamp web product is separate from our protocol that adheres to the vision outlined in our white paper and is still under development,"" the company said.  The startup added that its move to accept ETH and USD for its services doesn't diverge from its white paper, and said the alternative payments were also necessary due to restrictions on its token sale. Namely, because U.S. and Chinese buyers were excluded from participating.  ""While Quantstamp has accepted QSP, USD, and Ether, the latter two are only accepted for our current offerings and out of client and customer necessity, as not everyone is currently capable of acquiring and using our token,"" Quantstamp said.  The company declined to comment on CoinDesk's inquiries pertaining to the percentage of audit reports they completed in exchange for USD or ETH.  Questions over audits  Community members also raised concerns last week over the company's use of open-source technology in the 489 audits it claims to have completed to date.  The company told CoinDesk it is using a combination of ""proprietary and open-source software"" in its web product ""with the sole purpose of increasing accessibility for non-technical users"" such that it can target both the crypto community and the financial services industry.  Quantstamp co-founder and CTO Steven Stewart took to Medium on Thursday where he sought to clear up investors' confusion over the functions of the company's web product and its protocol.  ""The web product is a proof-of-concept user-interface for requesting security audits of smart contracts and viewing descriptive reports. … that permits small payments of QSP,"" Stewart explained. ""Under the hood, the web product is intended to include and build upon smart contract analyzers such as Oyente (an open-source tool).""  The protocol, in contrast, will make use of a decentralized network of computers to verify smart contracts, and Oyente is one of the options the company is considering using as an analyzer for it.  Quantstamp intends to connect the web product with the next iteration of its protocol, scheduled to be completed by the end of August, according to Stewart's post.

42380836,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zi5H,1529085935,Proposed Ethereum Roadmap Would Activate Its Biggest Upgrades Together,"The developer team behind ethereum is considering possible changes to a planned rollout of new technology upgrades.  Addressing rumors that such plans are now under review, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin told a meeting of the platform's open-source developers Friday that the idea is that the team might seek to alter the sequence in which Casper and sharding, perhaps its two most-anticipated updates, are activated.  Rather than releasing sharding and Casper separately, Buterin said, new advancements in research might enable both upgrades to activate together. (The idea is Casper might be released on a sidechain, or shard, rather than as a smart contract, as previously proposed).  ""This is a substantial reworking of the intermediary steps in the roadmap, but of not the final product,"" Buterin said.  Casper, ethereum's long-planned consensus algorithm proof-of-stake, promises to be more energy efficient and egalitarian than its current proof-of-work system, while sharding could hold the keys to scaling the system to a massive number of transactions. In this way, Buterin stressed that, if enacted, the technologies would combine to create a version of the protocol that could be orders of magnitudes more efficient.  Buterin said:  ""This design can basically scale up to the theoretical maximum.""  As detailed by CoinDesk, the current version of Casper (Casper FFG) is being tested in the form of a smart contract, named EIP 1011, on ethereum software clients. However, a result of today's meeting, such development could cease in favor of the new design.  ""As someone who has been working on this, it took a second to digest and to be comfortable moving forward with, but I am totally okay with this, and think it gets us where we want to be sooner rather than later,"" author of EIP 1011 Danny Ryan said in the meeting.  In light of the news, ethereum developers also appeared open to the idea the platform's next hard fork, named Constantinople, might not include any Casper-related changes.  Rather, a hard fork will likely occur within the next five months, that focuses on ""improvements that we have smoothed out and ready to go, unrelated to that,"" ethereum developer Nick Johnson said.  Key advantages  According to Buterin, combining the shift with sharding would come with several advantages.  ""The development of the one system will be much more directionally en route to what we expect the final later stage sharding system to look like,"" Buterin said.  Plus, by bringing the first version of Casper onto a shard, the deposit required to participate in securing the network will be reduced significantly, from 1,500 ETH, Buterin's most recent estimate, to 32 ETH.  Due to this lowered figure, Buterin said, ""regular individuals participating in staking directly becomes much more viable."" Buterin also said that the new model would allow Casper to go live without disturbing the ethereum blockchain itself.  ""The Casper component is somewhat more separate from the main chain. That means it can be developed less intrusively in some ways, it can be developed as a separate chain and can have its own rules,"" Buterin said. ""There's a much clearer wall between those systems.""  Sharding developer Justin Drake echoed these points.  ""It allows to unlock new functionality which radically changes the performance properties of the design,"" Drake said.  Drake also mentioned that there are security advantages for the new system. For example, such a system would allow for an ""atomicity"" between nodes on Casper and sharding, increasing the security of both systems. ""You can't be a casper validator without also being a sharding validator,"" Drake said.  The developer continued to state that there are advantages to bridging the Casper research team and the sharding team together.  He said in the meeting:  ""In general, there will be more unity between Casper and sharding, and the teams lobbying these projects. I think that's good, there will be more networks effects there.""

The film, entitled Crypto, will feature Russell as well as Alexis Bledel, Jeremie Harris and Luke Hemsworth, among others. The Hollywood Reporter notes that the film focuses on a young anti-money laundering agent, played by Beau Knapp, who returns to his hometown in New York to investigate a case of corruption and fraud. Russell is playing the father of Knapp's character, according to press materials.  Crypto's producers are calling it ""a thriller in the vein of The Firm and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" – but with a decidedly cryptocurrency-focused twist. The film was written by Carlyle Eubank and David Frigerio.  ""Cryptocurrency has captured the attention and imagination of consumers and entrepreneurs all over the world but has never been explored in film in such a nuanced and exciting way,"" Jordan Yale Levine, one of the producers for Crypto, was quoted as saying.  The independent film is currently shooting in New York with a release date not yet announced.  Crypto may be one of the most high-profile films to date to center on the world of cryptocurrencies. Last year, it was reported that the Coen brothers – the filmmakers behind movies like The Big Lebowski and No Country For Old Men – were working on a movie about the Silk Road, the now-defunct dark market that used bitcoin as its central currency.  Yet Crypto is far from the first movie to hone in on a cryptocurrency theme.

It was announced Friday that the Lantmäteriet has passed the testing checkpoint with the aid of a number of partners. These include financial firms SBAB Bank and Landshypotek, blockchain startup ChromaWay, tech consultancy Kairos Future, real estate search portal Svensk Fastighetsförmedling, telecom Telai Sverige and IT firm Evry.  The group of companies, in sum, provided different elements that, combined, formed the components of the blockchain pilot. For example, Telia and Evry helped verify a live transaction between a buyer and a seller, according to statements. A live demonstration conducted this week included client-side verification of government-approved digital signatures and the final exporting of necessary legal contracts.  Those involved with the initiative said that the smart contract which facilitated the transaction is compliant with European Union laws and regulations, including the GDPR privacy rules.  ChromaWay chief executive Henrik Hjelte said in a statement that ""in a distributed environment such as a blockchain, you cannot have a central server for verifying identities, it all has to be based on signatures and verified by the user.""  Project lead Jörgen Modin added:  ""Although the project uses centralized ID services, that is those approved by the government, in a blockchain environment these signatures must be put under the same scrutiny as everything else, and hence we do verify in each and every client all the way up to the root certificate.""  The project began early last year, when the Lantmäteriet authorized the partnership with ChromaWay and other firms to explore how private blockchains can carry out property transactions, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

On Thursday, the SEC's director of corporation finance William Hinman notably said that, based on his understanding of ""the ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.""  The news was today welcomed by Chris Concannon, president and COO at Cboe, who said in a statement that the exchange is ""pleased with the SEC's decision to provide clarity"" around the issue – a cloud that has been hanging over ethereum since April, when a former regulator suggested that ether and the Ripple-linked cryptocurrency XRP were both securities.  Concannon continued to say:  ""This announcement clears a key stumbling block for ether futures, the case for which we've been considering since we launched the first bitcoin futures in December 2017.""  In previous comments this past December, Concannon also suggested the Cboe might also launch bitcoin cash futures sometime in the future.  Ethereum futures are already live on another platform - the U.K.-based startup Crypto Facilities launched the product last month. Crypto Facilities is notably a partner with CME Group, and is powering the latter's Ether Reference Rate Index. A similar bitcoin index helped CME launch bitcoin futures last year.

42380842,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8ziBZ,1529067023,What Crypto Thinks About the SEC Saying Ether Isn't a Security,"""Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.""  So said William Hinman, director of the division of corporate finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at a Yahoo! All Markets Summit event in San Francisco yesterday. As you might expect if you've been following 2018's regulatory drama, the online crypto community subsequently exploded with commentary.  The big deal? The implication is that the world's second-largest cryptocurrency isn't currently running afoul with the law (at least now), and that the SEC may be preparing to soften its approach to the sector in general.  That's just the tip of the iceberg though, and immediately blog posts started springing up opining on the subject.  Advocates for cryptocurrency took it as an affirmation of their views on securities law, while legal experts who expected the SEC to come down swiftly on the industry were more bewildered.  ""The SEC has just abdicated responsibility for enforcing securities laws in the United States,"" or so wrote blockchain entrepreneur and U.K. lawyer Preston Byrne.  The serious responses  Still, the real ramifications aren't exactly known.  Hinman's statements, while instructive, don't represent a ruling. As a spokesperson for Coin Center told CoinDesk, it's best seen as ""a speech by the director of the division that most directly makes policy dealing with this question.""  Byrne also pointed out to the investors that it is still too early to celebrate.  The takeaway from this side of crypto Twitter? Compliance is a long game. Plan accordingly.  And there's definitely merit to this view.  In his full remarks, Hinman also explained how the SEC might make such decisions, and he didn't exactly say there wouldn't be any enforcement.  That said ""instructive"" might be the right word.  As New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper reminded us, even if we didn't get a ruling, we did get a window into SEC thinking on the issue that goes a bit beyond what they've issued before.  Still, to some, this left a feeling that following the law wasn't the best choice.  Time To Party? (!)  Nevertheless, crypto Twitter didn't pass up the chance to party, a sentiment that was largely influenced by market performance.  The price of ether surged immediately following the news about 8.8 percent, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, as did many other coins. Not such a surprise given most tokens are now issued on top of ethereum.  Still, even bitcoin's price rose on the news, a development that put a stop to what was otherwise a dreary Wednesday in the normally irreverent land of crypto Twitter.  In a word, a wave of bullishness passed through the internet.  Some, however, took the takeaway a bit too far.

The Missoula County Commission held a public hearing on Thursday aimed to decide on a proposed one-year suspension of new mining initiatives, but postponed the ruling as it was decided that more information is needed to address relevant concerns, according to the Missoulian.  While supporters of bitcoin mining farms argued that such operations created jobs for local residents, others expressed concerns the noise generated by bitcoin mining may undermine local property values and that excessive energy consumption could cause hikes in electricity rates, the report states.  Following the hearing, county commissioners Jean Curtiss and Cola Rowley noted that more education and outreach would be needed before issuing the moratorium, as the committee still doesn't fully understand ""all the impacts in the future or the long game.""  The proposed suspension notably comes a year after the Montana became the first state in the U.S. to provide public funds to a bitcoin mining farm in a bid to boost employment opportunities.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the state government awarded a grant of $416,000 to Missoula County in June of last year to support a mining project called Spokane.  Like the neighboring state of Washington, Montana has been an attractive base for bitcoin mining operations due to its cold weather, which reduces the need for artificial cooling of mining rigs, and more affordable power costs, the report said.  Yet, recently, officials from two counties in Washington state – Mason and Chelan – said they have temporarily stopped taking in new applications from bitcoin mining projects due to the spiking electricity demands associated with such operations.

42380829,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zhwT,1529062206,Walmart Patent Eyes Crypto Payments for Power Supply Precision,"Retail giant Walmart is exploring a way to let households manage their electricity bills using cryptocurrency – a concept it says could potentially lead to increased efficiency and lower prices.  According to a patent application filed by Walmart in December 2017 and revealed on Thursday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the company is developing a system that would connect household devices and electricity providers over a public blockchain.  Walmart envisions that the system would let users prepay a capped amount of cryptocurrency to cover the expected electricity demands for specific devices.  Since the requirements would be visible on the public ledger, energy providers would be able to accurately allocate the required electricity to the household. Each transaction would also be recorded on the blockchain.  As the cycle goes on, the user's demand and consumption history would be traceable and transparent, and could be used to make more accurate requests for supply. Further, if the actual usage of a specific device is more than is prepaid for, other devices can lend their budgeted electricity, while excess electricity would be credited to next cycle.  Walmart explained that the effort comes as a way to address a growing difference between energy provided and that actually consumed, an imbalance that leads to spiking electricity costs.  The patent filing states:  ""Currently, energy providers deliver energy to locations that inefficiently use the energy, which leads to increased energy costs for consumers. The increased costs result from various appliances and devices that consume energy at higher levels than the appliance or device may actually need to function or perform certain tasks.

42380840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8ziAJ,1529057418,Bitcoin Price Recovery In Play If Key Support Holds,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still in recovery mode, but the bulls must keep prices above key support seen just below $6,500 to maintain momentum, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency clocked a high of $6,736 on Bitfinex yesterday amid signs of a bear breather. However, bargain hunters were short in supply and prices fell back below $6,600 at 01:00 UTC today. Bitcoin has spent a better part of the last seven hours trading in the narrow range of $6,550 to $6,620.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $6,590 – up 7.2 percent from Wednesday's 18-week low of $6,109.  While it is too early to call a bottom, the nascent recovery shows promise, with bitcoin holding well above the former support-turned-resistance of $6,425 (April 1 low).  As per the charts, though, an unexpected break below $6,480 could pour cold water on the optimism and signal a resumption of the sell-off.  Hourly chart  The chart shows BTC has created a bear flag – a bearish continuation pattern. A break below $6,480 (flag support) would mean the corrective rally from the recent low of $6,109 has ended and the bear market has resumed.  Such a bear flag breakdown, if confirmed, would allow a sell-off to $5,750 (target as per the measured height method, i.e. pole height subtracted from breakdown price).  That target looks feasible when viewed against the backdrop of bearish long-term technical setup. Further, the 7 percent recovery from the recent lows has lifted the relative strength index (RSI) well above oversold region (below 30.00) providing scope for further sell-off.  What's more, the RSI is teasing a break below the ascending trendline (bearish signal).  Clearly, the odds are high that corrective rally could fall apart below $6,480. Meanwhile, the upside is seen gathering traction if BTC finds acceptance above the immediate resistance of $6,619 (dotted yellow line in the hourly chart).  View  Bear flag breakdown (a move below $6,480) would imply resumption of the sell-off and could yield a drop to $5,750.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 (February low) would only bolster the already bearish long-term technicals and open up downside towards the $5,000 mark.  On the higher side, acceptance above $6,618 could bring a climb towards resistance located at $6,900 (June 11 high) and $7,000 (psychological mark).

42380869,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zi41,1529053229,Felines to Futbol: NFTs Are Crypto's Hottest New Buzzword,"The World Cup may be completely analog, but don't tell that to crypto developers.  Soft launching now, a new company called CryptoStrikers is entering the so-called ""crypto collectibles"" market with tokens commemorating the stars of this year's World Cup. The thing is the tokens it's offering aren't the same you'll see listed on a popular market index like CoinMarketCap.  Rather, CryptoStrikers is the latest example of something called an NFT, or a non-fungible token, a term that just might be becoming the buzziest product category in blockchain today.  That's because while they first got noticed when CryptoKitties went viral, NFTs continue to garner attention from entrepreneurs. Validating that idea, Status, one of last year's biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) has backed the company behind CryptoStrikers as the first inductee in their new accelerator.  ""By providing radical transparency of ownership and authenticity through the use of smart contracts, CryptoStrikers has enhanced the experience of collecting sports cards,"" Status's Ben Morris told CoinDesk.  And it's not just digital sports cards, just like it wasn't only about digital kittens, that makes industry stakeholders salivate over NFTs.  Whereas one bitcoin is effectively the same as any other bitcoin (they are fungible), each NFT token is unique and as such, may be valued differently by the market. Each token (whether it represents a cat or a soccer player) has different attributes that its home website's software uses to generate the look of its avatar – including hair color, nose shape, outfits, age and rarity.  Because NFTs have specific qualities that should play to people's interest in real-world collectibles, crypto insiders hope they can bring the general public into the ecosystem.  They've already done so somewhat, a point investor Arianna Simpson of Autonomous Partners spoke to in a Q&A on Token Daily in April.  ""I actually believe Cryptokitties are a widely misunderstood phenomenon,"" she wrote, adding:  "" I believe gaming and non-fungible blockchain-based assets will be some of the first consumer applications that really hit mainstream. It's also incredibly cool that something like 25 percent of their user base are people who had never held ether before.""  Amitt Mahajan, cofounder of NFT online marketplace Rare Bits, agrees.  ""People's relationship with digital items is about to change,"" he said, pointing to the fact that digital books and movies people buy online can't then be resold or traded because of their strict licensing.  ""What that means is you've truly never owned anything online,"" he continued. ""When CryptoKitties came out – which is kind of the canonical example of NFTs – users realized that too.""  More mechanics  And each time an NFT has blown up, it's adapted the model by adding a new mechanic.  To game makers, ""mechanics"" are an action the rules of the game allow players to take. For example, in the card game ""Go Fish,"" asking for a card from your opponent would be a mechanic. The most interesting games tend to mix up a few mechanics that can combine in surprising ways.  While we're just in the earliest days of NFT game play, already the industry has iterated on the simple mechanics of holding the tokens. For instance, CryptoKitties allows users to breed their cats, creating a new, unique kitten with a mixture of attributes from its parents.  Crypto All Stars  , a collectible token game where players ""owned"" avatars of famous people in the industry, had a snatching mechanic. If someone bid a price 20 percent more than the last person had paid, they got the token whether the previous owner liked it or not (although the previous owner got a profit, too).  And CryptoStrikers has its own compelling mechanics.  Currently, CryptoStrikers offers two different packs of four cards. The standard pack sells for 0.025 ETH and will go off the market on July 15. The premium pack (there are only 500 of these packs available) is more likely to contain very rare cards and went up for sale on May 14 for 0.05 ETH.  Intriguingly, on Thursday, it was also offering standard packs in exchange for CryptoKitties, though this offer was only good for a limited time. That may have been because creators were trying to signal that their project has similar significance to the original ERC-721 token, whose cute cats made ethereum almost unuseable in December.  But above that, CryptoStrikers adds a mechanic whereby users don't know which cards they will get in their purchased pack, just like with physical sports cards. And as their real-world counterparts, CryptoStrikers has built a trading platform into its website that allows not only for trading between cards but also selling the cards for ETH.  CryptoStrikers declined to comment to CoinDesk.  User builds  But building out new mechanics doesn't have to be relegated only to the game's developers.  Because NFTs are decentralized, the codebases are open-source and can be used by other entrepreneurs or enthusiasts to create new user interfaces or game play on top of it. For instance, entrepreneurs took CryptoKitties code and built two separate applications for the fluff balls – KittyHats, which allow users to purchase accessories to adorn their kitty and KittyRace, a race car game that allows the kittens to take the driver's seat.  One way to start envisioning the future of NFT is by looking at the evolution of trading card battle games.  Magic the Gathering is a wildly popular collectible card game of monsters and mages on paper decks. Its creator, Wizards of the Coast, released the first set in 1993 with a ruleset for playing the game, but it wasn't long before fans started developing their own games with the cards.  Then Blizzard released Hearthstone in 2014, a super popular digital card game played over the internet. It shares a lot of characteristics with Magic but, because it's computerized, it can add fun effects and interactivity that Magic can't. Yet, because it was created by a centralized company, cards can't leave their initial platform and users can only play the games its makers provide.  Several NFT providers have begun iterating on this idea.  According to Status's Morris, CryptoStrikers seems headed in that direction.  ""As an open source project, we really liked their vision of having the community build their own games and applications on top of their platform,"" he said.  And another company, Myethereum, is in that arena as well.  Speaking about Myethereum, Devin Finzer of OpenSea, another NFT marketplace, told CoinDesk:  ""There's a card game that I think a lot of people are excited about. Their vision is: 'We want to build the ability of anyone to build a card game on top of it.'""  And user experience  Still, most NFT enthusiasts agree that the industry has a long way to go when it comes to user experience.  The interfaces for these games are buggy and confusing. In purchasing two standard CryptoStriker packs to test out the game, I found that moving them to auction was slow and cumbersome, taking a surprising number of steps that burned a lot of ether in gas fees.  And user experiences like this can break a game.  ""The niches or the industries that best take advantage of the NFTs will be the ones that make the user experience seamless,"" Harrison Hines of the forthcoming token offering platform TokenFoundry told CoinDesk, adding:  ""You're going to need to disguise all the unfun things about blockchain.""  But that's also more about the ever-evolving decentralized application (dapp) layer that's being built on blockchains.  And currently that's still not exactly the vision everyone expects. Even with a significant amount of initial buzz, these projects haven't succeeded in garnering the user base that more traditional apps have, plus apps have struggled to keep the users they do entice occupied.  As we previously reported, the biggest dapps aren't that big.  Status, which is sort of like a WeChat for ethereum users, plans to chip in to making NFTs more user-friendly by incorporating the technology into its platform, according to Morris. So, for example, Status users will be able to give and receive NFTs over chat, which could really advance the trading aspect.  But even more forward thinking is Hines, who imagines a future where every Instagram photo is an NFT and its owner can earn revenue when other's license it. On top of that, celebrities and brands could sell updateable photos, building an ongoing relationship with fans and limitless upselling opportunities.  Imagine, Hines said, if Justin Bieber sold an NFT photo of himself on an app, and then the fan who owned it met him in real life and got him to ""sign"" that photo.  ""Now you can update it so his autograph is forever tied to that item,"" Hines said.  But there's a lot of technology, especially scaling technology, that needs to be built between here and there.  ""If Beyonce released a backstage pass NFT, ethereum would crash overnight,"" Rare Bits' Mahajan said, concluding on a more optimistic note about how much more interesting the space can get:  ""Our view on it is this is: We built Ebay and there's no Pez dispensers and Beanie Babies yet.""

On Thursday, the Economy and Information Committee, an economic development agency that forms part of the Chongqing government executive body, published five measures the city will take to advance blockchain tech in the area.  Apart from attracting more specialized talent with additional funds, the notice said it will focus on building a blockchain ecosystem, which most notably included ""establishing a blockchain digital asset exchange.""  With that wording, the effort was initially anticipated by the Chinese crypto community as being a government-backed cryptocurrency exchange, and was then circulated as such among local media and on social networking platform Weibo.  Later on Thursday, however, the notice was deleted from the agency's website. The reason, as suggested by local reports, being that the central government ordered the suspension of the project as it could conflict with the existing ban on cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs).  Subsequently, the Chongqing city government's official website republished the same statement early Friday morning – including mention of the ""blockchain digital asset exchange.""  Asked about the rumored suspension and whether the mulled move is to build a cryptocurrency trading exchange, a government official from the agency told CoinDesk they were not authorized to reveal further details.  Then, Friday, a local news source cited information from the government indicating that the digital assets may not be the same as ICO tokens or cryptocurrency. Instead, the blockchain digital asset exchange seems to be a platform that facilitates exchanges of ""non-standard assets"" that are digitalized through blockchain technology. As such the platform would not be open to the public, the report said.  According to a definition by China's Banking Regulatory Committee, non-standard assets refers to securities that can take the form of letters of credit, credit loans, etc. They may be exchanged among institutions, but are not tradable on a secondary stock exchange.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, several Chinese private commercial banks have already started piloting a blockchain-based system to transfer transactions of letters of credit on a consortium blockchain.

The relatively-young initiative began in April 2018, when McCombs held its first blockchain conference with roughly 300 participants, he said.  Notable guests included Goldman Sachs senior fintech equity researcher Jim Schneider, IBM Global Blockchain Services' Jason Kelley, Dell's Radia Perlman, Ripple director of corporate payments Ryan Gaylor and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Dave Hirsch.  Fracassi said there will be another conference in 2019.  According to the Blockchain Initiative website, its purpose is to ""support faculty and graduate students research on blockchain,"" as well as ""teach students the main concepts related to blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital payments."" The initiative also intends to facilitate relations with industry and media organizations.

42380837,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8zi6X,1529035220,A Real-Time Battle Over Trashy Art Is Becoming a Big Deal for Bitcoin,"A bird? A plane? No, that's just a giant penis spouting flaming bitcoin.  Such is the canvas at Satoshi's Place, a web app that allows savvy users to create digital pictures by sending small amounts of bitcoin. In the weeks since its release, the graffiti tool has become the site of territorial battles of pixel-space, with tribes of every description, from national flags, to cryptocurrency insignias, to companies, all competing for a patch of digital property.  Created by a developer who goes by the handle ""Lightning K0ala,"" the project is inspired by Reddit's massive multiplayer art experiment, ""Place,"" a three-day effort in collaborative drawing that garnered hype in 2017 (called, among similar sentiments, ""the iconic picture of our time"" by Paste Magazine).  But while participants on Reddit's r/place had a time constraint – users had to wait between five and 20 minutes before submitting a new pixel to the board – at Satoshi's Place, the limit is only how much bitcoin users are willing to fork over.  A pixel on Satoshi's Place is priced at one satoshi, or 0.00000001 bitcoin. And for 0.01 bitcoin, around $65 at current prices, users can take over the entire board, all by using a newly live payments technology for bitcoin called the lightning network.  According to data provided by the app's creators, there's been nearly 3,000 paid invoices running across the lightning network, for more than 8 million painted pixels, garnering the attention of about 10,000 unique daily visitors to the site.  ""Satoshi's Place has been the first app that has gained wider attention from the community,"" said Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs, a startup building a user implementation of lightning.  And as users compete for art real estate with their wallets, according to advocates, the quickly shifting cultural depiction of cryptocurrency enthusiasts demonstrates not only how Lightning can free the bitcoin blockchain from its scalability constraints, but also how technologies like these could eventually outpace traditional financial systems.  As such, even with many laughing at the 13 penises that adorned the website on Monday, Satoshi's Place isn't all crypto memes and minds in the gutter.  ""It shows that bitcoin is, in fact, scaling and increasing the use cases the network can support,"" Casa engineer Jameson Lopp told CoinDesk, adding:  ""It proves the power of microtransactions – it's not possible to use traditional financial networks to create pay-per-use systems like this that are metered at the sub-penny level.""  And echoing something similar, litecoin creator Charlie Lee took to Twitter to call Satoshi's Place lightning's ""first killer app.""  Serious fun  Sure enough, many believe the artboard touches on something very important.  Citing the use of microtransactions within the game (one satoshi is worth a fraction of a fraction of a cent), Jeff Gallas, an early participant of the artboard and founder of lightning startup Fulmo, emphasized how such an application is currently unique to the lightning network.  Indeed, the popularity of the artboard brings to mind other successes in blockchain-gaming history, such as SatoshiDice or ethereum's Cryptokitties, but with one important exception.  As bitcoin developer David A. Harding pointed out, while both of these examples led to near-crippling blockchain congestion, Satoshi's Place has been imperceptible on the bitcoin blockchain itself.  ""Since [the game] has become popular, I haven't observed any meaningful change in the volume of bitcoin transactions,"" Harding said. ""This suggests that lightning network payment channels are working as their advocates expected in increasing the capacity for small and casual bitcoin payments.""  In other words, due to the nature of lightning, whereby payments are pushed off the blockchain into payment channels that don't require miners validating transactions, the large number of transactions from Satoshi's Place doesn't encumber the blockchain in any way.  ""The entire point of lightning is these apps can be built in a scalable way,"" Stark told CoinDesk. ""We can already process many thousands of transactions per second on lightning and some estimates even go up to the millions.""  According to Harding, the artboard's success is good news for adoption, because as Satoshi's Dice and CryptoKitties demonstrated in the past, lighthearted blockchain games can do a lot for attracting newcomers to the space. Plus, Harding finds it encouraging that even though lightning is still in an early phase – it's still possible to lose funds on the network, for example – it's already being used recreationally.  He continued:  ""I think it bodes well for that future adoption that, even in these early days of end-user lightning network software development, people find the [lightning network] user experience satisfactory enough that they can spend hours engrossed in a game like Satoshi's Place.""  The battlefield  But not only does the artboard display the power of lightning, it also casts light on the perpetual war the crypto industry is in.  ""Due to the space scarcity (and lack of a market pricing mechanism), we end up seeing territory battles as folks defend 'their pixels' against others who wish to overwrite them,"" Lopp said.  Many startups are competing for space on the board to display advertising, but there are other, more political battles playing out on Satoshi's Place as well.  ""There are advertisements interspersed with reproductions of art, but I think the more interesting aspect is the crypto memes that are unique to this space,"" Lopp told CoinDesk.  For example, as the lightning network was formulated in response to bitcoin's scalability concerns, many of the drawings have depicted leading figures in the bitcoin scaling debate – Roger Ver for instance.  ""In the first days, the main topics on the website were bcash and penises,"" Jeff Gallas, an early participant of the artboard and founder of Lightning startup Fulmo, told CoinDesk.  But as bitcoin cash, the rival cryptocurrency that split from bitcoin this past August, logos appeared to take over the site, the word ""cash"" was changed to ""trash,"" then finally ""bitmain trash"" (referencing the mining hardware giant's role in the controversy).  Ver, a bitcoin cash enthusiast, even took a jab at the project on Reddit, sarcastically calling it a ""great example of the maturity level of many lightning network users."" The comment was met with surprising feedback, as bitcoin cash users suggested creating another rivaling graffiti app with one user claiming that the bitcoin cash version would be ""a bit nicer with a canvas than drawing penises and denigrating another coin.""  ""It's an interesting way to gauge the general sentiment of the community with regard to certain entities and concepts,"" Lopp said.""It's a new example of digital scarcity that is simultaneously a proof of the unique applications that lightning network enables. Also, the anarchic nature of the internet makes it attractive to graffiti of all kinds.""  Sure enough, there is some anarchy afront. According to Lightning Koala, users have already figured out how to hack the software, creating scripts to upload images and overlay jpegs on top of pixels.  Summing it all up, Stark said:  ""Basically, we are keeping bitcoin weird.""
