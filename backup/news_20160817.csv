42399280,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijek,1471477846,Bitfinex Recovers Bitcoin Volume But Perception Battle Rages On,"One week after losing more than $60m in a high-profile hack, Bitfinex is once again one of the largest bitcoin exchanges by US dollar volume.  The Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange led its competitors in USD/BTC trading over the last week, grabbing more than 20% of the market. In total, it transacted 58,700 BTC (roughly $36m) during the seven days ending 20:45 UTC on 17th August, Bitcoinity data reveals.  While this figure puts Bitfinex ahead of all other exchanges in terms of USD/BTC trading volume, analysts were split on whether to view the development as a sign the company had recovered.  Market observers told CoinDesk the activity could either be interpreted as evidence of the exchange's resilience, or as a signal that accountholders were seeking to recoup funds while it was still operational.  Cryptocurrency investment firm founder Jacob Eliosoff, for example, told CoinDesk:  ""A lot of the activity is likely related to people withdrawing their holdings out of fear. Withdrawal-driven volume isn't actually reassuring.""  However, Eliosoff was not alone in voicing his concerns about this activity. To some, the robust trading activity in the wake of the still unsolved attack is a cause for concern.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged trading platform Whaleclub, asserted that the volume was likely driven by the uncertainties facing accountholders.  ""Much of the volume in the days following the hack consisted of traders selling their USD to BTC to be able to withdraw relatively quickly,"" he said.  Solvency concerns  Bitfinex's perception perhaps took the biggest hit from avid bitcoin traders.  At press time, informal investigations into Bitfinex's solvency were still ongoing on social media, as were calls for the exchange to be more transparent about its financial issues in the wake of the attack. Bitfinex did not respond to requests for comment today.  BTC VIX, an admin at bitcoin trading club Whale Club, provided similar input on volumes, stating that concerns like these caused to Bitfinex experience an inevitable ""mass exodus"" as accountholders took funds that had been locked up for almost a week.  After withdrawing their funds, Bitfinex’s accountholders went into ""wait and see mode"", he said.  While some Bitfinex accountholders may be waiting on the sidelines to see whether the exchange’s platform works, other analysts have raised the question of whether the exchange will even remain solvent.  Tim Enneking, chairman of digital currency fund EAM, told CoinDesk:  ""I’m not convinced the exchange will survive.""  Debt tokens  One major implication of whether the exchange remains open long-term is the value of the Bitfinex token, a blockchain-based asset representing debt in the exchange that was given to customers.  Issued on 7th August at $1 per BFX token, the value of the digital assets has since fluctuated wildly, rising from a low of $0.26 at 09:00 UTC on 12th August to a high of $0.44 at 06:00 UTC on 15th August, figures provided by leveraged trading platform BitMEX reveal.  Arthur Hayes, CEO of BitMEX, emphasized that he believes the value of the token, and the figures on the index his firm has created to track their value, are likely to continue fluctuating due to lingering questions about their worth.  ""Bitfinex has published no public data about their financial health, so traders are either wildly bearish or bullish on Bitfinex's future prospects,"" he said.  Eliosoff also spoke to the uncertain nature of the token. No details as to the total number of tokens issued have yet been provided by the exchange.  ""Does it represent a genuine claim on future Bitfinex earnings?"" he wondered. ""What's their plan to pay back holders? Will courts and regulators let the BFX plan proceed, or will they step in with some other process like bankruptcy?”  He is certainly not the only one to voice concerns about Bitfinex’s decision to issue these tokens. In recent weeks, legal experts have continued to speak openly about the uncertainty over their legal status and concern about the exchange's liability for its actions.

42399273,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijTv,1471459840,Ethereum Prediction Market Service Takes First Steps With Beta Launch,"A new prediction market platform is set to go live on the ethereum network this week.  Called Gnosis, the project will allow users to wager on future events by asking and answering questions about the outcome of sports games or elections. However, the platform's creators envision Gnosis one day serving as a platform for a wide range of user-created prediction markets.  An example touted by the team is a sample platform called Hunchgame, which would see Gnosis being used as a basis for a prediction market centered on celebrity gossip.  One of the more experimental use cases for public blockchains, decentralized prediction markets combine new technology with an old concept, one that in the past has seen centralized versions shuttered by governments or unable to hit critical mass due to regulatory restrictions.  The idea is that by using a decentralized network and uncensorable money, the experimental efforts can continue without outside interference. Prediction market advocates also see the platforms as an opportunity to surface information that otherwise might not be made public for use by academics and decision-makers.  With the launch, Gnosis will join Augur as the latest effort to create a decentralized prediction market. As Augur has already launched in beta and held a crowdsale, some observers view the two companies as rivals.  But, there are aspirational and technical differences between the two platforms. For example, questions are resolved by oracles on Gnosis and Augur in different ways.  While Augur uses many oracles to determine the outcome of an event, Gnosis uses a mechanism whereby only one or a few oracles provide the outcome, a feature they say will lead to faster validation.  If any one oracle disagrees with the conclusion, the decision falls to a pool of oracles to decide as a ""last resort"".  Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann further says that Gnosis boasts features Augur doesn’t have, such as a long-term plan for incorporating futarchy, an experimental form of government that uses prediction markets.  Launch details  Gnosis began working on ethereum earlier this year, but would pull back the project to an internal test network to experiment with a new system.  This time, they are launching with a revised version, one where content isn’t so tightly controlled by administrators.  If the ""market"" is built around the question, “Will Hillary Clinton win the 2016 presidential election?"", for example, oracles settle on the final answer and provide validation of the outcome.  Gnosis decentralized autonomous strategist Matt Liston told CoinDesk:  ""Anyone can sign up to use the oracle marketplace. That's a very, very big thing. And now anyone can now make markets. Before, these were admin features.""  For the launch, Köppelmann said that his team has prepared questions to test on the network, including those centered on topics in recent bitcoin news.  Proposed questions focus on what will happen to Bitfinex, the bitcoin exchange that was hacked earlier this month, and when much-anticipated bitcoin features such as Segregated Witness will be released.  But users can submit any question that they are curious to see answered by a pool of betters.  As for whether Gnosis can grow to become the first widely used example of a decentralized prediction market, this remains to be seen.  While promising, the concept has its detractors. Prediction markets pioneer Robin Hanson, for instance, has said that the reasons that these betting markets haven’t been adopted on a wide scale are perhaps more complicated than industry innovators believe.  While possibly useful, he remains uncertain as to whether they will necessarily address the lack of widespread adoption of prediction markets that has been historically observed.

42399268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijPz,1471449448,Gartner: Blockchain Tech Hits Hype Cycle Peak,"Blockchain has hit the peak of its hype cycle according to Gartner.  That's the key finding from a new report, issued this week, that asserts the emerging technology is at a stage in its development where users and the public are suffering from ""inflated expectations"" about its benefits.  Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, connected homes and smart robots were other technologies included in this category.  But if that sounds negative, Gartner’s report also projects blockchain will come to be ""transformational"" across a variety of industries, and it forecasts that this transition is only between five and 10 years away.  The report reads:  ""As a portent for the rise of the programmable economy, the potential of this technology to radically transform economic interactions should raise critical questions for society, governments and enterprises, for which there are no clear answers today.""  Gartner goes on to estimate blockchain is now being used by ""less than 1%"" of its total audience, and predict that the technology will advance most quickly in the manufacturing, government, healthcare and education sectors.  Notably, Gartner discusses bitcoin, calling it ""the only proven blockchain"".  For the report, ""blockchain"" is defined as a term relating to a ""diverse collection"" of distributed ledgers based on other foundational technologies.  Ultimately, the report ends on a cautionary note, recommending firms looking to invest in the technology take the time to understand issues surrounding blockchain governance, an issue it highlighted as a ""critical factor"" for adoption.

42399266,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijO1,1471443526,Bitfinex: Cause of Bitcoin Hack Still 'Unknown',"Nearly two weeks after losing more than $60m in customer funds, Bitfinex reports it has not yet identified how the theft was carried out.  In a statement released earlier today, the exchange reported it had hired Ledger Labs, a blockchain consultancy previously contracted by ShapeShift following its own cybersecurity problems, to both investigate the theft as well as perform a balance sheet audit.  Bitfinex further said that it is ""reassessing"" storage options in light of the hack. The incident would force the exchange to impose a 36% haircut on customer holdings, a move that continues to stoke controversy.  For now, Bitfinex has suspended its use of tools provided by security partner BitGo and has begun utilizing a hot cold wallet set up to maintain funds. As part of that reassessment, Bitfinex said that it is currently storing most of its funds in so-called cold wallets – accounts that are not connected to the Internet.  The company also responded to criticisms circulating via social media alleging it had not contributed funds to help fuel the recovery.  The exchange said in the statement:  ""Management has committed all reserves of the business with a view to making our customers whole. Moreover, any principals and employees of the business with any property on Bitfinex were subject to the loss allocation... We assure everyone that we feel the loss acutely, both as a company and as individual customers.""  Elsewhere, Bitfinex acknowledged that it ""held back certain amounts"" to pay for security and financial audits, as well as a security system rebuild.  The exchange said some of its reserves would also be devoted to repurchasing digital tokens issued to customers to make up for losses.  ""We are actively engaged with efforts to convert certain qualifying token-holders to shareholders of Bitfinex and to redeeming the remaining BFX tokens through a combination of new capital and earnings,"" the company said.

42399276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijYq,1471436462,Overstock's New Blockchain President to Accelerate 'Fight Against Wall Street',"After 14 years working with Overstock.com, the e-commerce giant's chairman of the board was asked to leave the room during a board meeting last month.  For Jonathan Johnson, who had previously served in leadership roles, including a stint as Overstock's CEO, it was an unusual moment. Johnson had just finished an unsuccessful bid to become the governor of Utah, and his future at the company was now in the board's hands.  But the board would return with good news, ultimately deciding to offer Johnson the chance to take over as president of Overstock subsidiary Medici and formally lead its efforts to reimagine finance using technology inspired by bitcoin.  In Johnson’s first interview since taking the reigns, he explained that his goal for the company and its blockchain projects isn't to change what CEO Patrick Byrne set in motion when he became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin, but to accelerate it.  Johnson told CoinDesk:  ""We worked together shoulder to shoulder in the fight against Wall Street manipulation. I'm not here to change the course, I'm here to give it more focus and more attention and to help accelerate the process.""  Changing roles  This shouldn't come as a surprise to those familiar with Johnson's work.  Hired in 2002 to serve as the company’s general counsel, Johnson quickly moved through the ranks to become the fifth member of its executive team. During this time, he would help lead Byrne’s widely covered charge against Wall Street trading practices.  Johnson was president of Overstock in 2014 when the company decided to first support bitcoin, and he says his interest in the disruptive power of the technology has only increased.  As president of Medici, Johnson plans to help steer the direction of tØ, a blockchain post-trade settlement platform of which Overstock owns an 81% stake.  Johnson will also oversee management of startup investments including Bitt, which earlier this year launched an encrypted version of the Barbados dollar; and digital record-keeping startup, Peernova; both of which Overstock owns a minority stake in.  If these projects seem a far cry from traditional retail fare, Johnson is enthusiastic about the challenge.  ""I’d been in the selling sheets and toasters business for years, but the idea of being part of something as disruptive as Medici really got me excited,"" he said.  Changing industries  But Johnson's tenure could ultimately prove a pivotal one for the project.  While Medici has been working with regulators to create an alternative to traditional financial institutions, those very institutions are now looking to adopt the same technology through pilots and proofs-of-concept.  Overstock, however, has a lead out of the starting gate. In December 2015, the SEC approved tØ’s amended S-3 filing, giving it the ability to issue public securities using blockchain technology.  To stay competitive in the increasingly diverse space, Johnson says he plans to continue Byrne's history of having a dialogue with SEC chair Mary Jo White and other regulators.  ""We’re not going to build something and hope that it doesn't get regulated out of use,"" he said. ""I don’t want to say we’ll be working hand in glove, but close to that.""  Big news on this front could also be on the way. Earlier this month, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne told investors to expect n ""historic"" announcement regarding Medici in September. Though Johnson said he couldn’t elaborate on the nature of the announcement, Byrne told CoinDesk he was ""impatient"" for the company to ""pull the trigger"".  However, he said he's confident Johnson’s will be the right executive to do just that.  Byrne concluded:  ""We’re long-term partners. For him to step in, like this is kind of a dream.""

42399283,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbijdl,1471433453,Why Ethereum Classic Must Die,"Jacob Eliosoff is a computer programmer and former Wall Street quant who runs Calibrated Markets LLC, a cryptocurrency investment firm with holdings in BTC and ETH.  In this opinion piece, Eliosoff discusses why he believes the ethereum community needs to unite around one implementation of the protocol, and why he believes it should be the version that opted for a controversial fork.  The ongoing ethereum classic drama is yet another illustration of the great irony of cryptocurrency – a technology invented as a way to form consensus keeps facing its greatest threat from the inability of its communities to form it.  When there's a fork, it's important for the community to choose wisely between the two branches. But it's also important, often more important, for the community to converge on one branch.  In a case like ethereum, which now has two competing versions, ethereum (ETH) and ethereum classic (ETC), not converging will do more harm than converging on the inferior branch.  We've reached the point where there are only two realistic outcomes for ethereum: a bifurcated project, confusing users and developers, or convergence on the ETH chain.  Fork or not?  During the original fork debate, I saw legitimate arguments on both sides, though no clinchers. I wasn't an investor in The DAO, which struck me as doomed from the start, and saw no need to rescue its backers. Concentrating 4.5% of all ether in the hacker's hands wasn't ideal, but didn't seriously threaten the network either.  The most common anti-fork argument is that fiddling with the ledger sets a bad precedent. This is true. But how bad? It's not like if this one sticks, we're all doomed to a future of hard forks any time the FBI asks or one of the admins loses a few coins.  Whichever branch wins out, this fork has been messy enough that no one is keen to go through another one anytime soon.  I agreed with Cornell researcher Emin Gün Sirer and others that ethereum was a young technology still very much at the dress rehearsal stage. Even if you want a future of 100% self-driving cars, you have to expect the occasional manual override early on.  Many questioned the financial incentives of Ethereum Foundation members who had bought into The DAO, but as Alex Van de Sande wrote, they had a vastly larger stake in ethereum's success than in The DAO. And meanwhile, there was amazingly little coverage of the fact that the hacker had a $60m stake in stopping the fork!  Even now, the hacker's stake is worth $7m on the old chain, $0 on the forked one. It would be quite a surprise if he or she hadn't been pushing ETC behind the scenes.  So, you can argue that ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin forced the fork through, or that ETC is a hacker-backed scam. I'm happy to leave these all-too-typical conspiracies to Reddit.  The fact is that there were many smart, sincere people on both sides of the fork debate, and that none of their arguments either way were overwhelming.  Harmful hard forks?  There's even a sense that July's fork set a good precedent.  I don't think anyone disputes that more hard forks will be needed, in both ethereum and bitcoin, better to get the hang of them now while the stakes are low.  And to those who say, 'Only for technical improvements, never to revert a hack', I question your imagination.  What if The DAO had attracted not 15%, but 60% of all ether, and the hacker had drained not a third but all of it? What if some malware spread widely across wallets or miners, giving a hacker control of 50+% of all ether? What if a similarly large theft resulted from exploiting a bug not in ethereum itself but in third-party software it's built on – say a compiler or operating system bug?  Of course, part of the answer is we should make the network robust against these attacks. But part is also, shit happens, and situations may arise where a fundamentalist attitude to hard forks is counterproductive. The bar for non-technical hard forks should be very high, but it will always exist.  Bitcoiners should watch the schadenfreude. Clearly this fork has been a mess, but that's not due to a hard vs soft fork distinction.  It's true that a soft fork, once widely adopted, avoids the bifurcation seen here: nodes that refuse to upgrade just see their blocks rejected, rather than spinning off a separate branch. But it's equally true that a soft fork which is not widely adopted can also result in a bifurcated chain. The reason this doesn't normally happen isn't technical, it's just, 'Why would anyone want to mine or transact on a minority chain?'  'Hard forks are dangerous' would seem to be the wrong conclusion here. In particular, a bitcoin hard fork would probably look very different.  One, it would come with months' rather than days' notice (avoiding, eg, Poloniex's out-of-nowhere decision to list ETC). Two, bitcoin's miners would be much more likely to settle on one chain or the other as a group.  The real risk comes from forks, hard or soft, that the community is significantly divided about. When an urgent situation demands a decision before the community can reach agreement, the solution is not to avoid forking (that was inevitable, given the level of disagreement), but for the community to debate, listen and settle on a majority chain quickly.  Given how long bitcoiners have been bickering about 1MB, if ethereum can overcome its current split by December, I'd even call this hard fork a success.  Should we stay splintered?  Some say, why not have two chains? Choice! Diversity! I could not disagree more profoundly with this for reasons any active developer of an ethereum-based project will understand. It's like wanting the choice between Blu-Ray and HD DVD.  There's certainly some benefit in having different technologies with different approaches, like bitcoin and ethereum. But, being forced to choose between implementations of the same technology is a huge headwind for the community.  It would be painful enough in bitcoin, with every website, service, user and developer having to make sure all parties coordinated on which variant to use. But it's vastly worse for ethereum, which is trying to build a true ecosystem of stateful, interacting smart contracts.  One of my greatest worries for cryptocurrencies has been that usage would become fragmented across competing implementations this way. Take what we saw in chat protocols over the last 20 years: IRC, ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger, Gchat, WhatsApp, Viber... Anyone who's tried, for example, to collect all their chat logs in one place can attest to the frustration caused by this maddening multiplicity. And through it all we had the shining contrasting case of SMTP, the one true email protocol.  Imagine if email were as bifurcated as chat! That's my nightmare for cryptocoins.  So you can say, 'The principle behind ETC outweighs the pain of maintaining two ethereum blockchains'. But frankly, anyone who says 'There is no significant pain in having two chains' is just not a serious engineer.  How bad is the pain? Well, what's your goal? If you’re a technophile, more chains is great – better chance of finding one that ticks all your ideological checkboxes. If you're in it for short-term trading profits (certainly your right), two chains may present some opportunities. And of course for the popcorn-munching, told-ya-so bitcoin crowd, the more ethereum fragments, the better.  My goal is different: I want a tech that's not just decentralized and censorship-resistant, but widely useful and widely used. For that goal, two chains are a mess.  As Linus Torvalds said of his creation:  ""We're not masturbating around with some research project. We never were. Even when Linux was young, the whole and only point was to make a usable system. It's why it's not some crazy drug-induced microkernel or other random crazy thing.""  Beyond two chains  Moving forward takes us from technology to community dynamics.  I do wish the informal vote had been better and sooner publicized, but there was real-time pressure. If a majority had opposed the hard fork, then I (and, per Van de Sande and others, Vitalik & co) would have gone along with it. But in fact, a strong majority favored the fork: even ETC's first promoter, Arvicco, acknowledged that.  With ETH holding the support of a large majority of the community, the lead developers, and 80+% of both market cap and mining power, ETC becoming dominant is just a fantasy.  The only realistic outcomes here are either two chains persist, inconveniencing users and developers, or ETC fades to <5% and we move on. It's just a question of how long.  Technologists are prone to overrate the importance of pure technical merit. The greatest tech projects – the moon landings, the Internet, C, Linux, etc – were above all pragmatic, collaborative human organizations. In particular the IETF, the group that brought us the Internet, has been guided by what they call rough consensus: ""strongly held objections must be debated until most people are satisfied that these objections are wrong"".  Some ideological or technical objections are certainly worth holding up consensus for: many aren't. Internal strife has now become the number one obstacle to both bitcoin and ethereum (and cryptocurrencies in general) – not scammers, not governments, not poor scaling: well-intentioned but uncompromising, black-and-white ideologues.  The practical question right now is whether the principled appeal of keeping the unforked chain alive, as a minority branch, outweighs the practical drawbacks of forcing developers and users to juggle two parallel worlds. I have no doubt how this choice would be handled by the IETF (thank God we ended up with only one Internet!), the creators of Unix (which disastrously splintered between AT&T, Sun, BSD, etc), and other engineering role models.  Unfortunately, consensus comes less naturally to the cryptocurrency crowd.  I'm well aware that some believe passionately that the fork went against everything ethereum stands for (I can't wait to read their thoughtful and constructive comments below). I respect their view, but I don't hope to convince them.  The ones I'm addressing are the majority who, whatever their fork preference, recognize that there were reasonable arguments for both chains. To those who believe this, I say: help ethereum move on by putting your capital and your mining power where the future is, ETH.  A matter of time  What will happen from here? The most likely outcome is that ETC will continue to bounce around between 5% and 30% of ETH's price, then fade over the next 3-6 months as projects continue to build on the ETH chain.  Without animosity, this is what I hope for.  If the ETH/ETC split becomes permanent, it will certainly be a drag on ethereum, but probably not a fatal one. But the broader risk is stark. If we keep failing to build the rough consensus that's served communities like the IETF so well – with the compromising that entails – then the technology we love will never reach a wider public.  We'll have a Plan 9, not a Linux. And the blame will be not on ""centralists"" or the ""legacy fiat system"", but on our own failure to collaborate.
