33734970,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642792,1726698622,Solana (SOL) Could Crash 40% If It Stays Below $140 – Top Analyst Shares Insights,"Solana (SOL) faces significant risk as the broader cryptocurrency market rebounds from local lows, yet SOL struggles to break above the crucial $140 resistance level. This underperformance has raised concerns among investors, with many worried about Solana’s inability to keep up with the market’s recent surge. Related Reading: XRP ‘The Safest Investment To Make 100% ROI’ – Former Asset Manager Shares Price Targets Some analysts are even predicting a deep retrace to its yearly low of around $78 if the price continues to lag. Despite holding relatively well during Bitcoin’s and other altcoins’ earlier crashes, Solana’s current price action suggests that the risk of a correction is growing. If SOL fails to break above $140 and align with the market’s recovery, it could face a steeper downturn. While Solana previously weathered market turbulence better than some of its peers, there’s a growing belief that now may be Solana’s turn to experience a significant fall. Investors are keeping a close eye on upcoming movements. Solana Struggling To Keep Bullish Momentum Solana (SOL) has retraced over 7% this week, while many other altcoins surged, posting double-digit gains. This raised concerns among investors, who fear SOL might follow the same trajectory many altcoins experienced in recent months. One prominent analyst and former asset manager, Amdtrades, with over 9 years of experience, shared a technical analysis of Solana’s price action, highlighting some concerning price targets. According to Amdtrades, Solana is at a crucial crossroads. If it fails to break past the $140 resistance level—a fundamental price point that once served as strong support—a deep correction could follow. He noted that the first key level to watch is $115, which could trigger further downside if breached. After that, SOL could drop to $100; in a worst-case scenario, it may fall as low as $78. If it drops to the lower prices, it would represent a 40% correction from current levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12? The risk of Solana hitting these lows remains high, especially if it continues to struggle while other cryptocurrencies recover. However, Amdtrades also emphasized the potential for a rebound. Should SOL break and hold above $140, it could spark a recovery and possibly reverse the negative trend. Investors are now carefully watching these levels to see if Solana will face a deeper pullback or find the strength to regain momentum. SOL Price Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $130, a crucial level that could determine its next move. After testing the $140 resistance, the price faced a 7% rejection, raising concerns among traders. The $140 mark coincides with the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $139.26, a significant technical indicator that had provided support since October last year but has now flipped to resistance. This reversal has created added pressure on SOL bulls to regain control. SOL must break above this EMA and reclaim the $140 level for a bullish reversal. If bulls succeed, it would clear negative market sentiment and likely trigger an aggressive 20% surge toward the next supply zone around $163. However, failure to reclaim these levels could lead to a more bearish outcome.

The SEC's complaint alleged that Rari co-founders Jai Bhavnani, Jack Lipstone and David Lucid “falsely told investors that the Earn pools would automatically and autonomously rebalance their crypto assets into the highest yield-generating opportunities available when, in reality, the rebalancing mechanism often required manual input, which Rari Capital sometimes failed to initiate.” The Earn and Fuse pools, ""which functioned like crypto asset investment funds,"" breached federal securities law by selling interests in both pools and selling the Rari Governance Token, the complaint said. What's more, Rari and its co-founders ""misleadingly touted the high annual percentage yield that investors would earn, but they failed to account for various fees and, ultimately, a significant percentage of Earn pool investors lost money on their investments,"" the SEC further alleged. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Rari's co-founders agreed to civil fines, permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and equitable officer-and-director bars against the co-founders for a period of five years.

33732762,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642814,1726693254,SUI Climbs 36% Amid Bullish Breakout – Is $1.50 The Next Target?,"SUI has made some gigantic moves recently, posting strong bullish signals. In the last week, SUI registered an impressive 33% rally, pushing the price up to $1.18 at press time. This is getting people wondering whether the token is preparing for a longer ascent, as many are waiting for key levels that might influence the situation. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $92,000 ‘Bounce’ In 3 Months, Analyst Predicts Price forecast for the altcoin predicts significant increase in the next few months. A strong upswing could propel the SUI to soar by 245% in the following three months. The price chart of SUI shows a sequence of higher highs and lower lows, which confirms this view—textbook evidence of optimistic momentum. SUI has gradually climbed from a low of $0.60 early this year, passing through several resistance zones along the way. Bullish Trend Signals Strength SUI’s price movement indicates that bullish sentiment is gathering steam. The token’s capacity to breach resistance zones points to perhaps more fuel left for the rally. Market observers are closely monitoring the next significant resistance level at $1.2047. Should SUI exceed this barrier, the following targets should lie between $1.50 and $1.80. While the support held high at $1.125, a firmer layer of support is observed at $1.045. The battle is on between the bulls and the bears, but the momentum seems to be on the side of the bulls. What would be the final test is whether they can push SUI past these resistance levels to trigger another round of buying. Volume And Open Interest On The Rise Supporting the bullish outlook is the increase in volume and open interest. Data from Coinglass shows the trading volume of SUI has risen 3.25% to $1.83 billion while open interest is up 11.85% at $331 million. This rising trade volume indicates growing interest in this token,. With the increasing engagement, people seem to have big confidence in the short-term prospects of SUI. With these uptrends, the market sentiment is going strongly on a roll to sustain this rally. Technical signals and trading activities are showing good numbers for SUI bulls. Price Predictions Show Optimism The three-month prediction on price for SUI is quite optimistic. Analysts predict the coin rising 245.86% over the next three months. This would signify a massive rise from its present levels, indicating important momentum to be seen within the market and investors. Further ahead, the six-month projection is estimated to increase by 180.47% while the one-year outlook will hike by 166.62%. Related Reading: The Sandbox (SAND) Sets Sights On 1,111% Growth Amid Crypto Market Pressures These numbers suggest that SUI might continue posting steady gains in the medium and long run, despite being traded at 228% below estimates in the next month, suggesting optimism is still around it. Investors are waiting and on the lookout for when SUI will cross past these key levels, which may unlock and open up better prospects for the future. The coin is drawing further attention as it moves with bullish technical signals coupled with increasing volume and positive price forecasts. It may be about to embark on a protracted rally considering the current position of the token, where it has managed to breach the strong resistance levels of around $0.016.

Jai Bhavnani, Jack Lipstone and David Lucid, the platform's co-founders, also settled charges with the SEC, the regulator announced Wednesday.  Rari offered Earn and Fuse pools, ""which functioned like crypto asset investment funds."" It violated federal securities law by selling interests in both pools and selling the Rari Governance Token, the SEC alleged.  Rari's co-founders told their investors that the Earn pools automatically rebalanced its holdings ""into the highest yield-generating opportunities,"" but this process was actually manual and Rari did not always rebalance the pools, the SEC said.  ""The SEC also alleges that Rari Capital and its co-founders misleadingly touted the high annual percentage yield that investors would earn, but they failed to account for various fees and, ultimately, a significant percentage of Earn pool investors lost money on their investments,"" the agency said in a release.  Rari offered unregistered broker services through the Fuse platform, the SEC alleged.  As part of their settlement, Rari's co-founders agreed to fines and five-year officer-and-director bans, though these are subject to court approval. Neither the co-founders nor Rari admitted or denied the allegations in the settlement agreement, which is standard.  Rari Capital Infrastructure, which the SEC said took over from Rari in 2022, also settled unregistered securities and broker charges, agreeing to a cease-and-desist order.  ""We will not be deterred by someone labeling a product as 'decentralized' and 'autonomous,' but instead will look beyond the labels to the economic realities, as we did here, and hold the individuals behind crypto products and platforms accountable when they harm investors and violate the federal securities laws,"" said SEC San Francisco Regional Office Director Monique Winkler in a statement.

This significant price increase is anticipated to surpass Bitcoin’s current ATH, which jumped above $73,000 in March 2024. At the time, the trigger to Bitcoin achieving its March ATH was the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the subsequent large-scale demand. This time, BTC is expected to reach a new ATH, catalyzed by a confluence of factors, including the fact that Q4 of all Bitcoin halving years is typically seen as a bullish period for the cryptocurrency. Before this attack on the ATH in October, Poppe revealed that Bitcoin may experience a “sweep of the liquidity” as well as a short period of consolidation. The analyst highlighted that September remains a significantly weak month for Bitcoin, characterized by price declines and volatility. However, he has forecasted that BTC could witness a clear breakout to the upside above $62,000 by the end of the month, or in early October. As of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,471, marking a 3.76% price increase in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Next Three Months Seen As Bullish Period For BTC Bitcoin has been in a long downtrend, with Q3 seen as one of its most bearish periods this year. Despite the cryptocurrency’s price crash and previously persistent declines, analysts highlight that the coming months will be significantly bullish for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 Crypto analyst, Crypto Rover disclosed on X that September has historically been the worst month for Bitcoin, however, he believes Q4 is set to be the best. Other analysts like ‘Stockmoney Lizards’ foresee Bitcoin hitting a whopping $100,000 price target by year’s end, with expectations that Q4 (between October to December) would significantly push the cryptocurrency to the upside.

42417199,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTGwf,1726685052,"Arthur Hayes: 'If They Go 50, That Will Be a Nuclear Catastrophe for Financial Markets'","BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes, sat down with Markets Daily host Jennifer Sanasie and Bradley Keoun, CoinDesk’s Managing Editor of Tech and Protocols, to share his insights on whether a Fed rate cut of 25 or 50 basis points could lead to financial turmoil or a short-term rally. He also explores the potential ramifications of government spending, inflation and the reliance on fiat currency systems across major economies, and the dynamics of bitcoin in relation to traditional markets. The following transcript has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  Jenn Sanasie:  The Federal Reserve meeting is happening today in the United States. What do you think we're gonna see and how's it gonna impact markets?  Arthur Hayes:  So, the question is whether they're going to do 25 basis points or 50 basis points. I, at a high level, think that they should not be raising rates. I believe that the U.S. economy is quite strong. If you've seen the GDP prints over the last eight or nine quarters, it's been consistent growth. The U.S. government continues to spend an insane amount of money, which is keeping economic growth at a very fast pace. And, obviously, that helps with the re-election chances or election chances of Kamala Harris and her running mate which I think is the goal of the current Democratic administration. So, the Fed cutting rates, when you have massive government spending, you have inflation that's above their target – I think it's a mistake. Inflation is going to accelerate into the fourth quarter if they decide to continue cutting rates. And, I think that the response is going to be if the markets start to falter, they're just going to do more of it and they’re going to make the problem even worse.  So, if they do 25 or 50, the markets react the opposite of what they believe. I think everyone believes that the markets are going to go up. If the more they cut, the more the markets go up with stocks, bonds, cryptos, all that kind of stuff. I actually take a contrarian view that, you know, the more they cut, the more the markets are going to dislike that. Maybe one or two trading days after the fact, but they're not going to learn their lesson. They're just going to keep doing more of it. So we're going to get a very quick, cutting cycle, so that's my view.  Sanasie:  Dig a little bit deeper into that. Let's say they cut rates. How do you think the markets will react? And, more specifically, how do you think the crypto markets will react?  Hayes:  So I believe, and I've written extensively about this, that the most important macroeconomic variable is the dollar-yen exchange rate. And so, the dollar exchange rate weakened a lot because the BOJ cut rates at zero or negative, and the Fed and every other major central bank raised rates starting in March of 2022, so the differential widened a lot. The dollar-yen went to about 162 on the top side. And then a few things happened. The Fed signaled that it was ready to start cutting rates in the summer of this year. And the BOJ indicated that it would start raising rates and it did raise rates 15 basis points on July 31. And, we saw in the subsequent week, markets were down 10% around the world.  If the Fed's gonna do 25 or 50 or however many basis points, it's gonna go down. And now in the subsequent meetings, it's gonna continue to narrow that differential. Dollar-yen will continue to strengthen, the yen strengthens, the actual nominal value goes down, and people continue to unwind positions, which removes leverage from the system, stocks go down, and I think yields go up. I think crypto, sort of TBD.  Keoun:  And so what do you think about Bitcoin? Does that decoupling happen right away or does it happen some other time?  Hayes:  I don't think it happens right away. I think if we get sort of a massive sell off, people sell what they can, not what they want. Bitcoin is a very liquid asset. People have a lot of illiquid assets on their books, especially if you're an investment manager. So if you have some bitcoin, you dump it. If the basis comes down even further than where it is today, sort of that's the difference between Bitcoin and futures contracts. You see large hedge funds like Millennium and these shops who put on this basis trade, starting with the ETF launch earlier this year. They unwind those positions and sell bitcoin spot into very illiquid markets. So I think Bitcoin goes down with the rest of the markets. But quickly, as we sort of see a financial collapse in the early stages, bitcoin will say, ‘OK, I believe that the markets will respond positively to more printed money.’ [Treasury Secretary] Janet Yellen and [Fed Chair] Jay Powell can’t afford a financial collapse a few weeks before the election, especially if they want Harris to beat Donald Trump.  Keoun:  And not to dial it in too much, but bitcoin is currently right around 60 grand. You know, if we get 50, where does Bitcoin go? If we get 25, where does Bitcoin go? Do you have that specific prediction?  Hayes:  I think 25, no, unchanged, not much is going to happen. I think everyone expects 25. I think if they go 50, that will be a nuclear catastrophe for financial markets. One or two trading days after the effect, you'll see a massive rally and everything because everyone believes that the more they cut rates, the better. But I actually think it points to a deeper rot in the global financial system. And that will come through in much more depressed prices after the fact.  Sanasie:  Samson Mow was on Markets Daily recently and predicted that Bitcoin could hit a million dollars in 2025. That video saw a lot of reaction from the CoinDesk audience, a lot of engagement. What do you think of that prediction? Could it hit a million dollars next year?  Hayes:  Sure, but I don't think it will. I still have a million dollar price target. I'm more of a 2026, 2027 sort of person. Next year, we really get a ramp up in fiscal spending regardless of who wins the U.S. election. And if the U.S. dollar declines a lot, then China has room to enact stimulus as well and keep the yuan stable. And then you have the rest of the major central banks following in the footsteps of the Fed. They look at the Fed; they're easing so we can ease too. We can do as much as the Fed is and our exchange rate isn't going to get trashed. And so that's what I think happens once you get the new president, whoever it is in the U.S. because both Harris and Trump are committed to spending lots of money. Trump is committed to cutting taxes and Harris is committed to welfare payments.  Keoun:  Arthur, I was listening to a podcast you were on not too long ago, and you were talking about how you think that this cycle is the one where I think your terminology was the sovereign debt breaks. And, I'm curious, when you talk about a cycle, what is that cycle that we're in right now? How long is that cycle?  Hayes:  I don't know how long the cycle is, really. It depends but I believe that. If you think about the global reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, and all the wars and all the spending that needs to happen to keep the system intact, we're at this precipice where you can go either way. You could have a sort of massive austerity, massive deleveraging, maybe a revolution, or the authorities can try to keep things stable by fixing the price of government bonds and printing as much money as possible to placate their electorate, whether that's in the United States, that's in the EU, that's in China, that's in Japan.  Every single major economic block or country runs a similar sort of fiat-fractional-based financial system, regardless of whether they're democratic, autocratic, communist, capitalist, whatever. Those are all smoke screens. At the end of the day, everybody prints money. Everybody has a fiat fractional banking system. Everybody needs inflation. Everybody needs to take their savers wealth and steal it. So, that the government can afford its spending programs, whether that's to fund wars or that's to do green new deals, or it's to onshore production or it's climate change policies or it's welfare payments to the poor individuals who are losing out in sort of this economic transformation, AI and all this kind of stuff. There's so many reasons why the government needs to spend money and not try to tighten its belt and restore confidence in these fiat currencies that we exist with.  Keoun:  The question is, you know, can they continue to just keep things going?  Hayes:  Sure, and Bitcoin can go to a million, to $10 million. Bitcoin's what, $1.7 trillion market cap. It's magic internet money that was created out of thin air, you know, starting in 2009. Bitcoin is the antidote to what has happened. Yes, okay, they've printed a lot of money globally, the U.S. being the most egregious with it. And, the reaction has been Bitcoin. And we have this cryptocurrency ecosystem that has thrived based on all this printed money. And we have all these different types of assets that are created and have value because we have such a fucked up financial system. So, I say they're getting away with it. Bitcoin's a smoke alarm. It's telling us that there's something wrong here.  Sanasie:  When you look at the crypto markets, when you look at the commentary around crypto markets, I know you create a lot of your own content, you participate in a lot of content like this podcast, what are people not talking about enough?  Hayes:  Patience. I think everyone is thinking, Bitcoin needs to go to a million dollars today, next year, because I took a bunch of leverage or my whole net worth is in this particular cryptocurrency. And they hear the things, the imminent collapse, all the debt. They're asking well, why isn't it happening yet? Why not now? I see all these things. I believe what you're saying. It's super fucked up. Politics is fucked up. Finance is f##ked up. And why isn't Bitcoin responding? Or why isn't the crypto that I own responding? And I think it's just patience, right?  It's been a little over a decade and we've created this entire new financial ecosystem. We have millions of people around the world who have Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, whatever wallets. It's a very successful financial experiment to date, but it's not going to just all of a sudden just go to some ridiculous value just because you have a lot of leverage or you bought a lot of it yesterday. So, I think patience is something that people need to understand because if you believe in the math, and the law of compounding interest, then it's inescapable. The system must print money, must debase the currency to attempt to survive, and every other major civilization has done the same thing. And at the end of the day, inflation is hoisted upon the people and some sort of revolution happens. So the history is 100 for 100. Just wait.  Keoun:  Arthur, just to get into one of the specific market factors that have emerged this year, which is all these ETFs. You were actually, you previously traded ETFs at Citigroup. So would love to hear. And again, I was just listening to this other podcast where you were talking about kind of the role of the market makers and that dynamic, but curious, just generally speaking, what is your kind of big take on what are the implications of now ETFs being kind of a major factor in this market?  Hayes:  So I think at the end of the day, ETFs are for people who want the price performance of Bitcoin. They don't want to own Bitcoin. They don't want to be their own financial institution. They want to outsource that to Larry Fink, BlackRock and all these other major institutions, which is fine. Bitcoin can do whatever you want with it.  What does that mean? You're a passive investor and you're not actually using the protocol. So if we take this to the extreme and every single Bitcoin is owned by BlackRock or a similar sort of institution, then the network goes to zero because no one's actually using it. So the reason why Bitcoin has value is because we use it. It's not like gold. I can hold gold in a vault for returning it's still gold, so the chemical property of being gold. If I don't do anything with the bitcoin, then the miners don't get paid and the network dies. And that's a fundamental, very nuanced difference between Bitcoin and gold, which I think is not a problem today. It could be a problem in the future. But at the end of the day, if you're thinking about why now, why did BlackRock get in their ETF approval in six months and the Winkle Clowns couldn't get one in 10 years?  Right? Live in New York. They're both billionaires, both very rich. Why weren't they given one and BlackRock was given one in six months? Well, at the end of the day, you want the same financial institutions to control the wealth that can ultimately be appropriated by the government at the flick of a switch. BlackRock is just another arm of the U.S. government, just the same as any other large Chinese asset managers in the arm of the Chinese government.  Sanasie:  If people don't use Bitcoin, it goes to zero. It doesn't function the way in which everyone who operates in this industry wants it to function. Talk to me about what could happen in the future there. If this happens, comes to fruition, people aren't using Bitcoin, what does that problem look like?  Hayes:  It looks like revenue for miners goes down. It looks like how do they afford the capex? Difficulty adjusts, that kind of thing. I mean, I think it's a very long tail sort of situation if we don't have any use cases for Bitcoin. And obviously that's sort of why I love Ordinals and Bitcoin layer 2D files, these sort of things. Like let's pay the miners, let's do something with this thing and create some usability for people so that...people are using it, people are spending money, and we sort of take this problem and remove it as a problem from the future.  Keoun:  You've done some really interesting things this year at Maelstrom, which is your family office, your investment fund, right? And you launched this Ordinal's Inscription series, the Airheads, which is hilarious, by the way.  Hayes:  Thank you. I guess I'm a flexi -coiner, an avid sh&t-coiner. But if I think about the taxonomy of how I look at crypto, Bitcoin is money. No other crypto is money. It's the hardest money that we've created in human history. Bitcoin cares about the security of the network. Bitcoin cares about an immutable blockchain. Ethereum is not money, regardless of what people say.  They decided not to be money in 2016 when the community allowed a hard fork to happen to pay back the DAO hack folks. Ethereum wants to be the best decentralized computer ever. And it is so far. I put Solana in that camp. Obviously I'm a big Aptos person right now. They're also trying to enter this sphere. And then you have a lot of other applications.  They want to do something on one of these networks, decentralized finance is something I'm very passionate about because I believe that the rest of the world should have access to financial products at the ease of going on the internet and clicking a few buttons, which is not really the case for most people out of the United States and Western Europe. They have pretty fucked up financial systems. That's why DeFi makes sense for those folks. So I like all this stuff. It's all an experiment.  You know, some things are 10 years old, 15 years old Bitcoin, and other things are less than a year old. But we're trying to sort of create a completely new system and give anyone with an internet connection a choice of how they want to save, how they want to invest, how they want to express themselves culturally over the internet.  Keoun:  And for your NFT collection, like why you chose to go in now on Bitcoin, Ordinal's inscriptions, what was that? What was the thinking there? Or what's your goal for that project?  Hayes:  So we're an investor in Oyl Wallet and there are...  Keoun:  Yeah, yeah, I met one of their guys, by the way, at Bitcoin Nashville at the party at the Parthenon, talked with him for a while. But anyway, go ahead.  Hayes:  Yeah. So we're an investor in this wallet and how do we create some buzz about Ordinals? Well, let's do an Ordinals drop. Now I just don't want to do another, you know, PFP 10 ,000 AI generated collection. We've done that to death. So what can we do that is specific to Ordinals that you can't do this on any other protocol? So that was something to do the recursive inscriptions. We want to show artists and creatives, look at what we've done here. I actually don't care what happens to the price of these things. I just want to see people be inspired to do other things, show the capabilities of the Oyl wallet. Here's what you can do with this and show the capabilities of ordinals. What sort of creative minds can create something completely unique that can only exist on ordinals that further.  Keoun:  Okay, got it. Yeah, that's really funny.  Hayes:  That's really the goal. I mean, of course, I hope that all these airheads are super, super valuable in the future, but really the goal is to inspire others to do other sorts of derivative works using Ordinals and inscriptions.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/18/arthur-hayes-if-they-go-50-that-will-be-a-nuclear-catastrophe-for-financial-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1553f01f5c49692da84a6ed2aa9e5bd29d8a935-1600x1067.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Following the announcement, the markets reacted with notable volatility. Bullish Outlook For Bitcoin Just moments ago, the Fed disclosed its decision to reduce the federal funds rate by 0.50 percentage points (bps) for the first time in four years, marking a pivotal shift since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This adjustment lowers the target range to 4.75% to 5%, down from 5.25% to 5.5%, which had been in place since last July—the highest rates seen since 2001. Related Reading: Massive Bitcoin Rally Predicted For Next 6 Months After Fed Rate Cut Analysts had widely anticipated this cut, with some, including crypto analyst Doctor Profit, asserting that a 50 bps reduction would be bullish for Bitcoin and the wider digital asset ecosystem in the short term. Market expert Michael Van de Poppe has also indicated that volatility is likely to increase for both Bitcoin and Ethereum following this event, but in the end, this would potentially drive prices higher. BTC’s Reaction To Fed’s Rate Cut Following the Fed’s announcement, Bitcoin has exhibited considerable volatility, marked by aggressive price movements. Currently trading around $60,180, the cryptocurrency has faced fluctuations, dipping about 1% after peaking near $62,000 on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Toughest Time Over: Why Q4 Could Be A Game-Changer As investors digest the news, it remains to be seen how the market will stabilize in the coming days.

Fed members expect median benchmark rates to come down to 4.4% by year-end.  Markets' appetite for risk assets would be key to watch , analysts say  The U.S. Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark fed funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75%-5% on Wednesday, marking the first rate cut in four years after the central bank's most aggressive hiking cycle.  ""The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,"" the press release said. ""The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.""  Fed members expect median benchmark rates to come down to 4.4% by year-end, reflecting some 50 bps more cuts in the next two Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, according to the Fed's quarterly economic projection. That's up from only one cut projected in June.  ""The U.S. economy is in a good place and our decision today is designed to keep it there,"" Powell said during the press conference following the meeting. He said that the unemployment rate standing at ""anywhere in the low-4% is a good labor market,"" and he doesn't see any evidence that the ""likelihood of a recession or downturn is elevated."" He added that the Fed is still not declaring victory over inflation, and further 50 bps should not be considered as ""the new pace"" for further rate cuts, reiterating the Fed's data dependent approach.  In the minutes following the FOMC decision, the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} shot up 1.2% to $61,000, then fell below $60,000, mostly flat over the past 24 hours. U.S. equities erased all their early gains on the Fed decision, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 closing the session lower by 0.3%. Gold first surged to hit a new all-time high over $2,600, then retraced to end the day in the red.  Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) tumbled to 100.3, its weakest level since July 2023, then shot back up to 101. It's a key metric to watch for gauging risk asset prices, according to CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten.  Cryptocurrency-related stocks also gave up their gains. MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares gained 1.5% through the day, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and investment firm Galaxy (GLXY) were flat to negative, similarly to most bitcoin miners including Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platform (RIOT).  ""The Fed has given the market what it was looking for with the bigger 50-basis point rate cut,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group. ""Our concern from here will be the market’s ability to continue to feel good about buying risk assets on future accommodative Fed gestures now that the accommodation has been priced to this extent.""  Crypto correlations with broader risk assets surged to their highest levels in roughly 18 months, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, noted in an email. This highlights how macro has been an increasingly important factor, especially during regime shifts like the one we're witnessing now,"" he said.  Markets universally expected looser monetary policy from September as Chairman Jerome Powell said at last month's Jackson Hole symposium that ""the time has come for policy to adjust"" with cooling inflation and rising unemployment rate. Traders, however, were divided on whether the Fed would lower rates by 25 bps or opt for a larger, 50 bps cut. Prior to Wednesday's decision, the market priced in 40% chance for a smaller and 60% probability for a bigger cut, the CME FedWatch Tool showed.  The uncertainty laid the groundwork for a volatile session. Crypto market maker Wintermute predicted 2%- 3% price swings for bitcoin in either direction following today's decision.  Arthur Hayes, BitMEX co-founder and Maelstrom CIO, said in an interview with CoinDesk that the Fed's rate cuts might crash markets due to narrowing borrowing rate differentials between the U.S. dollar and Japanese Yen. This would lead to investors unwinding their yen-based carry trades en masse. Notably, the same dynamic triggered the August 5 crash for stocks and digital assets, which briefly pushed BTC below $50,000.

Here’s what this could mean for the memecoin, based on past pattern. Dogecoin Miner Supply Has Been Going Up For A While Now In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the role of the miners in the different cryptocurrency markets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. The indicator of interest here is the “Supply held by Miners,” which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total amount of tokens that the miners of a network as a whole are carrying in their balance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Toughest Time Over: Why Q4 Could Be A Game-Changer When the value of this indicator goes up, it means the miners are receiving net deposits into their wallets right now. Such a trend implies this cohort may be in a phase of accumulation. On the other hand, the metric registering a decline suggests these chain validators are withdrawing a net number of tokens from their balance, potentially for selling purposes. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Supply held by Miners for Bitcoin over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Supply held by Miners and the Bitcoin price has shown some correlation during the past year. As Santiment has explained in the post: When miners choose to hold onto their coins rather than selling, it’s often a sign that they expect prices to rise, which can create positive momentum in the market. However, when they start offloading large amounts, it can put downward pressure on prices. Most recently, the BTC Supply held by Miners has been on the rise again after plunging to relatively low levels earlier. Thus, it would appear that these chain validators may be accumulating once more, which can be bullish for the asset. The relationship that miners show to the BTC price is similar to many other cryptocurrency networks. However, that is not the case with meme coins like Dogecoin. According to the analytics firm: If it’s a very speculative-driven asset, you can often pick up an inverse indication between what miners are doing and where the altcoin is going price-wise compared to Bitcoin. The inverse relationship is visible in the below chart for the Dogecoin Supply held by Miners. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Dogecoin Supply held by Miners had plunged back in January, but what followed this selloff from the miners was a sharp surge in the DOGE/BTC ratio. Related Reading: Altcoin Watch: Mega Whales Are Taking These Alts Off Exchanges Over the last couple of months, the chain validators of the asset have seen their supply register a rapid increase. Given the inverse relationship the metric and the price tend to follow, however, this accumulation could be a bearish sign for the asset. DOGE Price Dogecoin had made recovery beyond the $0.107 mark earlier, but the memecoin has since gone downhill as it’s back at $0.100.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network news  Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss with their father, Howard (Winklevoss family)  OF COURSE THERE'S A TOKEN. Former President Donald Trump's much-anticipated announcement of a new crypto company, World Liberty Financial, did not disappoint. At least, it didn't disappoint traders on the Polymarket prediction-betting site who had wagered that the project would announce plans to launch a token. The project's team – the Republican candidate's sons Don Jr. and Eric spoke during the X Spaces discussion – was unequivocal that there would be a token, with the ticker WLFI. After a two-hour-plus session that included lots of yuks and crosstalk, however, it was less clear what the company will actually do. The most definitive account came from CoinDesk reporters including Sam Kessler got his hands on a draft white paper revealing that World Liberty Financial might closely reveal a DeFi project called Dough Finance that failed to gain traction and was hacked for $2 million. Both Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, who were responsible for Dough, confirmed their involvement in World Liberty Financial via their appearance on the X Spaces. The lead moderator of the session, Rug Radio's Farokh Sarmad, expressed astonishment that the elder Trump even showed up – given a schedule packed with rallies, debates, stump speeches, golf and an attempted assassination in Florida the previous day. Politico Morning Money called out the ""risks Trump is taking by embracing a business venture his sons are launching less than 50 days before the election."" Eric Trump said on the session that decentralized finance needed to be easier to use for regular people, noting the extreme difficulties he encountered when ""looping Ethereum on Aave,"" the biggest DeFi lending platform. There wasn't much discussion of the risks of hacks, exploits and single points of failure that serve as the starting point for a lot of foundational conversations about blockchain-project architecture. Eithan Raviv, CEO of Israeli crypto-recovery firm Lionsgate Network, emailed The Protocol to say that ""the major security concerns with this project include a lack of transparency, unclear asset protections and heightened cyber risks due to the high-profile individual involved.""  SILENT TREATMENT? Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote on X that he will avoid any mentions of those projects that aren't decentralized enough. To merit any ink, they have to at least meet a decentralization threshold known as ""Stage 1,"" under a hierarchy he laid out years ago in a blog post. “Starting next year, I plan to only publicly mention (in blogs, talks, etc) L2s that are stage 1+,” Buterin wrote. “It doesn't matter if I invested, or if you're my friend; stage 1 or bust.”  PIG BUTCHERING CRACKDOWN: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed suit against three individuals and five companies for allegedly operating pig butchering scams – a type of confidence-enabled investment scam in which fraudsters befriend victims over text-based social media apps, gain their trust and convince them to invest large amounts of money in fictitious crypto platforms before stealing their funds and disappearing. Separately, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) announced sanctions against one of Cambodia’s wealthiest businessmen for allegedly playing a role in serious human rights abuses – including human trafficking and torture – tied to a pig butchering scam operation headquartered in the Southeast Asian country.  Bhutan, a Himalayan nation with fewer than 1 million people, has accumulated over $780 million in bitcoin, representing nearly a third of its GDP. ""Unlike most governments, Bhutan’s BTC does not come from law enforcement asset seizures, but from Bitcoin mining operations, which have ramped up dramatically since early 2023,"" according to Arkham, a blockchain-analysis platform.  Howard Winklevoss, father of the famous crypto twins, is donating $4 million in bitcoin {BTC} in a first-of-its-kind donation to Grove City College, where he developed an interest for sound money and the Austrian school of economics that also later influenced Satoshi. Winklevoss told CoinDesk that he first learned about the principle of sound money at Grove City College while studying under Hans Sennholz, a free-market, Austrian-School economist and professor who had studied under Ludwig von Mises.  Ethereum Devs Poised to Split Blockchain's Next Big Upgrade, 'Pectra,' in Two  The latest Ethereum upgrade is partly named after Electra, one of the ""seven sisters"" in the star constellation known as Pleiades, shown in an artistic rendering here inside the ring of circles. (Wikipedia, modified by CoinDesk using PhotoMosh)  It's only been six months since Ethereum, the dominant smart-contract blockchain, had itslast major upgrade. But there are so many developer priorities for what to tackle next that there's a growing realization they can't all happen at once.  So now, Ethereum developers are considering dividing the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade into two parts.  Pectrawas on track to be Ethereum’s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork, in this case, is the technical blockchain term for the software upgrade.), But some developers argue that the entire package of new features has become unwieldy, and they have expressed a desire to split it due to its complexities, and the risk of doing too much, too fast.  During anAll Core Developers call last week, Ethereum developers started to play with the idea that splitting the hard fork into two might be feasible.  EF DevOps Engineer Parithosh Jayanthi, who was one of the core developers pushing to split Pectra, told CoinDesk over Telegram that “we’re talking about splitting it into two forks, mainly to reduce the risk of a bug and to enable faster shipping of both forks.”  Click here for the full article by Margaux Nijkerk  Money Center  Fundraisings  Vanishree Rao, founder and CEO of Fermah (Fermah)  Fermah has announced its $5.2 million seed round, co-led by the a16z CSX fund and Lemniscap.

MARA's HODL strategy involves holding BTC for value appreciation while mining and selling Kaspa to cover operational costs, despite increased mining costs post-BTC halving event. The firm faces challenges as a late entrant in the data center cooling market and may struggle to gain significant market share with its dual immersion technology. I rate MARA as a SELL with a price target of $10.62/share due to added risks from the HODL strategy and potential difficulties in new ventures. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is positioning itself beyond their single-revenue stream of mining and selling BTC. The firm is actively seeking additional avenues as BTC becomes less profitable as a result of the April halving event and the higher global hashrate, pushing the firm into other related areas, such as data center cohosting with AI inferencing, infrastructure integrations that resemble their own spin on Super Micro Computer’s ( SMCI ) business, and partnering with municipalities for providing heat generation as a result of BTC mining. Given the potential headwinds at play as the firm transitions their strategy, I recommend MARA with a SELL rating with a price target of $10.62/share at 2x Price/BTC value. MARA Operations Management announced their initiative to reinstate their BTC HODL strategy once used in early 2021 during the height of the BTC craze prior to the crypto winter that occurred in the subsequent year. TradingView BTC had since recovered and peaked just shy of $75,000/BTC, a major run-up since the decline experienced in 2022. Though BTC has since come off its March highs, the market mechanics have shifted from a more volatile asset that remained out of most investors’ reach to an institutionalized asset that can be held in every retirement account through major brokerages as a result of the launch of BTC ETFs. I believe that the launch of BTC ETFs has led to more stability in the cryptocurrency, which is potentially one of the factors that has led management at MARA to reinitiate their HODL strategy. As announced in q2’24, MARA purchased $100mm in BTC and will no longer sell mined BTC as part of their HODL strategy. Corporate Reports Another factor may be margins as a result of the halving event. Though it shouldn’t be considered a 1:1 metric given the hosting services tied into the costs, the average mining & hosting services cost per BTC produced increased from $17.71/BTC in q4’23 to $32.09/BTC in q1’24 and $45.62/BTC in q2’24. Depending on management’s hosting initiatives going forward, this cost per BTC may decline back to around q1’24 levels as the firm delineates from that line of work. CoinMarketCap To offset the loss of revenue production as a result of MARA’s HODL mandate, management is mining Kaspa at an 80% margin. Kaspa is a much smaller coin at $4b in market cap with an average daily trading volume of $60mm. According to CoinMarketCap , Kaspa has a max supply of 28.7b coins with 24.7b currently in circulation, leaving roughly 4b of the coin left to mine. Accordingly, Kaspa is relatively correlated to BTC, offering similar exposure to the BTC market with improved margins. As part of MARA’s HODL strategy, holding BTC with the hopes of price appreciation while selling mined Kaspa to offset mining and operating costs can potentially provide certain value to MARA. TradingView My final thought on MARA’s HODL strategy is that the firm may be positioning itself to compete with the BTC ETFs, such as iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), VanEck Bitcoin Trust ( HODL ), or Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ( BTC ). Arguably, MARA may be competing closer to MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), whose initiative is to purchase and “HODL” BTC with the expectation of price appreciation. Given MARA’s $2300mm debt offering in August to purchase $249mm in BTC and $345mm in equity sales to acquire $100mm in BTC in July, the firm is beginning to resemble the leveraged strategy that MicroStrategy is touting. Corporate Reports Comparing MARA’s BTC mining operations in 2024 to 2023, it is clear that the halving event has significantly impacted operations despite the infrastructure challenges faced in q1-2’24. I have reason to believe that management has realized that pure BTC mining is becoming less and less sustainable, leading to the diversification of revenue streams. Looking to additional revenue streams MARA is seeking to take on, there may be some uphill challenges that the firm may be faced with being a late mover. Starting with infrastructure, MARA is seeking to enter the data center cooling space to compete with direct air and liquid cooling. Management discussed in their q2’24 earnings call that they will be seeking to enter the market with their two-phase immersion cooling system as a competitor to direct liquid cooling. Accordingly, the immersion systems boasts 2-4x the power density of competing cooling systems and require upwards of 75% the space in the data center. Management also suggested that the firm may enter the server rack space as well, competing with firms like SMCI and now Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) with their recent acquisition of ZT Systems for full-stack design. Corporate Reports MARA will also be users of their infrastructure for mining operations. This may play into their goal of co-investment in new data centers to host AI inferencing in addition to their BTC mining in order to act as a load balancer to AI applications. This may play out to MARA’s benefit given the heightened demand for AI factories for training and inferencing; however, I do not believe that the bottlenecks are the data centers themselves but sourcing all the materials in order to construct the data centers. Given that Oracle Corp . ( ORCL ) is constructing 100 new data centers for AI training and inferencing in partnership with Microsoft ( MSFT ), there may be a crowding out effect amongst the hyperscalers as MARA attempts to become a new entrant. A co-investment will likely be driven regionally and will likely be driven by enterprises or 2 nd & 3 rd tier hyperscalers as the majors will likely prefer to leverage their own data center. Lastly, MARA launched a pilot in Finland to leverage their digital compute assets to offer a low-cost alternative to district heating by converting clean energy into heat on-site. I believe that this feature poses as a strong business case as an alternative to conventional heating given the amount of heat mining machines generate. This is essentially replacing an electricity-to-heat conversion with an electricity-to-BTC mining-to-heat, allowing for the power conversion to be utilized to mine both BTC and generate heat as opposed to just generating heat. At of q2’24, MARA has launched 2MW as it pertains to the project in Finland that is capable of warming a town of 11,000 residents using their digital asset computing. Management anticipates increasing capacity to 4MW by the end of the year. MARA Financials Corporate Reports MARA did run into a few challenges in q1’24 that bled into q2’24 as it pertains to power transmission and unexpected equipment failures at 3 rd party operated sites. As a result, production was significantly impacted by both these factors and the April halving event. MARA also faced headwinds due to the increased global hashrate. The firm also faced cost headwinds as a result of higher hosting and energy costs as the company deploys and energizes mining rigs in both existing and new facilities. For e2h24, I’m forecasting the firm to improve their daily production as the infrastructure challenges are resolved; however, given that BTC will be held and put sold, revenue may experience a modest sequential decline in eq3’24. I believe that the new HODL operating structure will result in higher mining & hosting costs with a moderation of revenue as the firm seeks to hold BTC. Management suggested in the q2’24 earnings call that a $10,000 price change in BTC will result in a ~$200mm impact on earnings due to their HODL position. I believe that this will result in revenue reaching $625mm in eFY24 with an aEBITDA margin of 58%. I’m forecasting diluted EPS to come in at $0.14/share for eFY24 as e2h24 margins will offset the positive net income generated in q1’24. Risks Associated With MARA Bull Case With the popularity of holding BTC in retirement accounts and the reinitiation of their HODL strategy, MARA is positioning itself to act as a BTC proxy to compete with the likes of BTC ETFs and MicroStrategy as a leveraged BTC holding company. If the price of BTC appreciates going forward, MARA will be in a strong position to sell BTC at a profitable rate. MARA is also diversifying their revenue streams in heating and infrastructure, allowing for the firm to realize more durable and sustainable earnings going forward. Bear Case MARA is a late entrant in the infrastructure space and may not realize the level of market share necessary for their dual immersion technology to be profitable. Despite BTC being more widely held across retirement funds, the risk of a sell-off still remains prevalent given that BTC may be used for raising cash. This may be driven by the investments’ volatility and lack of income generation when compared to defensive stocks. According to Coinspeaker , BTC ETFs experienced a $1.2b outflow between August 26, 2024 through September 7, 2024. Bitcoin ETF Fund Flows Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports Do note that my valuation summary includes the $300 in debt, the total BTC holdings as of their August 31, 2024 mining update, and the current value of BTC. Corporate Reports MARA’s shares trade at a 3x premium to their total BTC holdings. This compares to MSTR’s premium of 1.87x. The ultimate question when considering an investment in MARA is whether the firm’s BTC mining operations deem a higher multiple when compared to a firm that engages in HODL’ing BTC. I believe that given MARA is transitioning their operations from generating revenue through the mining and sales of BTC to alternative avenues, MARA’s financial position may modestly decline in the near-term, resulting in the firm turning to the debt and equity markets to raise capital to both sustain operations and purchase more BTC. Given this factor, I rate MARA with a SELL rating with a price target of 10.62/share at 2x price/BTC value. My rationale for the SELL rating is that MARA is adding an additional risk factor to their operations by holding BTC for value appreciation as opposed to mining BTC to generate revenue. Though this strategy may play out in the long run, I believe there are more appropriate avenues to investing in BTC, specifically the BTC ETFs. In addition to this, MARA’s alternative strategies net of Kaspa may not play out due to the firm being a late entrant and the decline in the renewable energy story .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721901-mara-holdings-turning-into-a-leveraged-bitcoin-fund?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33727651.jpeg

42417206,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTTH0n,1726678926,"SEC’s Crypto Record Rebuked by Ex-Commissioner, GOP Lawmakers in Hearing","The Securities and Exchange Commission was mostly a punching bag for witnesses in a House Financial Services Committee hearing hosted Wednesday by its crypto subcommittee.  Daniel Gallagher, a former SEC commissioner, recounted Robinhood's difficulty in trying to comply with the agency's views on crypto and argued the regulator has ignored its own authority to do something more to establish digital assets rules.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was hammered for two hours in a congressional hearing on Wednesday in which the witness list predominantly included agency critics, including former Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, who is now at Robinhood.  In a preview of what could come when all five SEC commissioners – including Chair Gary Gensler – face a full hearing of the House Financial Services Committee on Sept. 24, the agency took a rhetorical beating from most of Wednesday's witnesses, all the Republican members and some of the crypto-friendly Democrats on the subcommittee holding a hearing entitled, ""Dazed and Confused: Breaking Down the SEC’s Politicized Approach to Digital Assets.""  Gallagher, who is a senior lawyer at Robinhood Markets and whose name has been circulated as a possible agency chair if Republicans retake the White House next year, recounted a ""very frustrating"" situation in which his company was rebuffed in an effort to register with the SEC for crypto activity and has recently received a notice that the agency is weighing an enforcement action ""on our very compliant Robinhood crypto offering.""  Read More: Robinhood Joins Coinbase in Saying It Tried to 'Come In and Register' Like SEC Wanted  ""We have to look over our shoulder left and right because of this regulatory uncertainty,"" Gallagher said, arguing that the agency has deliberately ignored a legal authority that would have allowed it to engage in some initial rulemaking even before Congress weighs in.  ""Ultimately, it will be up to Congress to rectify the commission's failure to act to register both tokens and platforms and to provide clarity for those which do not require registration,"" Gallagher said. ""Only Congress will be able to truly provide the necessary long term regulatory clarity for digital assets, but nothing is stopping the commission from moving now to provide tailored relief that allows firms to register, even if provisionally, and continue to innovate in the meantime.""  Lawmakers questioned the uncertainty over the compliance status of Prometheum Inc., the SEC's first special purpose broker dealer for crypto, which recently opened its crypto securities custody operation. They also questioned witnesses on the meaning of the SEC's recent admission in its legal dispute with Binance that it erred in using the confusing shorthand term ""crypto asset security,"" which wasn't meant to suggest that crypto tokens themselves are securities.  Democrats spent much of their time underlining the extent of fraudulent activity in the industry. Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) also criticized former President Donald Trump's family crypto project, World Liberty Financial. The congressman suggested its intent to retain 20% of its tokens for insiders seems designed to get around the proposal in a prominent legislative proposal, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), in which projects with less than 20% of internal ownership can be considered decentralized.  Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), one of the panel's most colorful and vocal critics of the crypto industry, also targeted Trump.  ""He's announced that he is now the chief crypto advocate,"" Sherman noted. ""So on the one hand, he has all that power given to them by the Republican Party. On the other hand, he's trying to make billions of dollars for advocating crypto. That's a conflict of interest that makes Clarence Thomas look like Mother Teresa,"" he said, in a reference to the recent scandals tied to Supreme Court Justice Thomas.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | BNB,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/18/secs-crypto-record-rebuked-by-ex-commissioner-gop-lawmakers-in-hearing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ec2daf716989ef0f02fdc50055d80fa34476f5a-4207x2366.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33726191,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721890-cony-this-high-yield-one-trick-pony-only-needs-to-finish-the-race?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1726677583,CONY: This High-Yield One-Trick Pony Just Needs To Finish The Race,"Summary I recommend buying COIN for growth and CONY for income, as CONY generates high-yield income from writing covered calls on COIN stock. Despite COIN's price volatility, CONY's monthly high-yield distributions offer a compelling income opportunity, especially for those reinvesting distributions as prices drop. Single issuer risk is a concern, but CONY's strategy of generating income from options premiums mitigates losses, making it suitable for income-focused investors. Positive Wall Street ratings and potential regulatory clarity in the crypto market further support my bullish outlook on COIN and CONY. Now that I am back from a short vacation to my niece’s wedding in Carmel-By-the-Sea, paid for by the passive income that I get from my Income Compounder portfolio, I am catching up on some of my investments. One of my mentors on Seeking Alpha is fellow contributor Steven Bavaria , who writes about income investing being like a horse race, where you only need to choose the horses (stocks or funds) that will finish the race. You don’t have to pick the winners by guessing right (i.e. guessing the right price at the right time to both buy and sell the stock) like you have to do with growth stocks that may or may not keep going up in price after you buy it. As long as the stock/fund (horse) keeps on paying income each month (runs the race) you will come out a winner in the long run. And there is no need to “eat your seed capital” by selling shares of a growth stock (i.e. capture capital gains) in order to collect that income, as Bavaria explains in his recent article . One pony that I have placed my bet on for the income it generates is a high-yield income fund, YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY). Like other YieldMax funds including YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NVDY), which I previously covered in July, CONY generates option income from writing covered calls against a single underlying security, which in this case is Coinbase Global (COIN). The biggest risk to funds like NVDY and CONY is the single issuer risk, as described on the fund website. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security COIN, may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. The Fund’s strategy will cap its potential gains if COIN shares increase in value. The Fund’s strategy is subject to all potential losses if COIN shares decrease in value, which may not be offset by income received by the Fund. The Fund may not be suitable for all investors. Like NVDY, the CONY fund does not own shares of COIN directly. As a result, the price action of CONY follows the COIN stock price up and down but rises less during growth periods and falls further during downside moves. For example, in the past six months COIN has declined by -31%, but the price of CONY has declined by -52%. Seeking Alpha However, the difference in total return between the two over the same period is reversed when you account for distributions paid out by CONY over that 6-month period, with CONY down only -22% compared to COIN at -31%. Seeking Alpha That is because CONY pays out monthly high-yield distributions based on options premiums from writing covered calls. At the current price and distribution rate based on the most recent payout, the yield for CONY is over 100%. The distributions paid over the past 6 months amount to $10.3958. So as long as you did not sell any shares of CONY over the past six months, instead of losing 30% of your value, you would have gained over $10 per share in income. YieldMax This is a concept that does not fit well with many conservative investors who never wish to see an unrealized loss in their portfolio, but for income investors such as myself who live off of the passive income and are able to reinvest a portion of that monthly distribution into more shares as the price drops, CONY now offers an opportunity to buy or add while the price is down. Derivative Risk and Bitcoin Some analysts caution that CONY is a derivative investment that invests in a stock that it does not own and the reference stock, COIN, is essentially a derivative investment too, dependent on the cryptocurrency market . My thesis is that even if the price of COIN should continue to fall from its current levels, CONY will continue to generate income each month that it can distribute to shareholders as long as traders are still buying and selling COIN stock. The forward yield is likely to drop a bit due to variations in monthly call premiums, but even if the distribution gets cut in half from current levels, it still justifies the investment in CONY in my opinion. Because unless COIN files for bankruptcy and the stock becomes worthless (the horse fails to finish the race), CONY will continue to pay out distributions each month even if the price keeps dropping. To be a responsible analyst, I should include some additional background information regarding Coinbase, cryptocurrency risks and opportunities including Bitcoin, Ethereum and others, and other background information that may be pertinent to a CONY recommendation. Clearly, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the leading cryptocurrency and the one most closely followed. Anyone following BTC knows that it has struggled to maintain the $60k level for the past few months. In fact, as I am writing this article on September 17, 2024, BTC has just breached the $60k level again for the first time in 3 weeks, lifting other crypto-tied stocks like COIN. As the price of BTC and other cryptocurrencies rise again once the Fed announces the long-awaited reduction in interest rates, my belief is that the COIN will also reverse its downward price trend as it closely follows the price action of BTC. In fact, we are already starting to see that reversal in price action as can be seen in the 6-month price comparison of BTC and COIN. Seeking Alpha Coinbase Ratings and Outlook Wall Street analysts generally give a Buy rating to COIN, and those ratings have improved since July as the price of COIN has retreated. Seeking Alpha This further solidifies my belief that CONY will be able to continue to generate high-yield income for the foreseeable future based on options premiums from call writing on COIN stock. Other SA analysts have a more mixed opinion of COIN; however, one recent review suggests that COIN is now a Strong Buy and a great stock, no matter who wins the election. In addition to the positive Wall Street ratings, the SA Quant system gives COIN an A- in Profitability. Seeking Alpha Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results Although the past performance of any investment is important to understand and should be reviewed, there is no guarantee that it will continue into the future. In the case of CONY, the past performance is shown on the fund website and is worth reviewing if you are considering an investment in the fund. Since inception in August 2023, CONY has generated a cumulative return of about 75% at market price and about 76% over the past one-year period, although that one-year return has been tempered by a barely positive 6-month return (as of the end of August). YieldMax This really demonstrates to me that it is important to look for good buying opportunities if you are interested in a fund like CONY. You must also be willing to accept the risk that the price that you paid for CONY may decline substantially and may not recover. An investment in CONY does assume that BTC and other cryptocurrencies will continue to appreciate, however, the income generated from options writing is not dependent on further price increases. Another potential catalyst for COIN (and thus CONY) is the potential for additional crypto legislation in the US, similar to what is already enacted in Europe and other parts of the world. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, more legislation will lead to more capital flowing to COIN. When we meet with our institutional clients, and they're holding 1% to 2% of their portfolio in crypto and we say, what would it take for you to get to 10% or 20%, they all say, regulatory clarity. Concerning legislation, Armstrong stated: “If we get legislation passed in the US similar to how it's already been passed in Europe and other places. I think we'll see a huge inflow of capital,” speaking at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference. This bodes well for the future of the COIN, no matter who wins the election, because more legislation is inevitable as bitcoin and other cryptos mature. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC in January of this year stimulated the crypto market initially, followed by later approval of Ethereum ETFs in July (which had less of an impact). It would appear that uncertainty over the US election results along with a lack of clarity around interest rate reductions has led to fear in crypto investing in August and September, causing the price of COIN to drop back to prices below where the stock traded at the beginning of this year. However, it appears now that COIN has consolidated around the $160 level and CONY has bottomed out at about $12. Recommendation: Buy COIN for Growth and CONY for Income I started a position in CONY in my own Income Compounder portfolio a few months ago and have been adding as the price has dropped. It has now become one of my largest income holdings, along with NVDY. I remain convinced that COIN has good potential for long-term growth and price appreciation, and I look forward to collecting monthly high-yield income based on the options premiums that CONY collects based on its call writing against COIN stock.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721890-cony-this-high-yield-one-trick-pony-only-needs-to-finish-the-race?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33726191.jpeg

This bullishness bled to the altcoin market, prompting many tokens to follow the trend. Nervos (CKB) is one of those tokens that experienced astonishing growth with a 120% uptick, outperforming the broader market. Related Reading: Avalanche Revenue Nosedives Over 40% In Q2 – Impact On AVAX Price Although CKB’s gains in the short term have been great, the long-term implications of such price movements are still important for investors and traders. The market’s current bullishness might continue for the broader community, but CKB’s performance long-term might be in question. Nervos: Breakthrough Halted By Resistance The token has gained control of the $0.015 support level for an attempted breakthrough on the $0.0198 resistance. However, the latter has held its ground against the bulls in the short term, potentially putting the gains made in the past few days in jeopardy. CKB’s position in the short term is threatened by this rejection as the token’s trajectory might push CKB well below its $0.015 support level. If this occurs, it will represent a sudden flip in the short-term outlook of investors and traders. The relative strength index (RSI) gives a clue as to where the token is heading. As of writing, the RSI points to a majority bull market for CKB, pushing the narrative that the token will continue upward. It also shows that the momentum of CKB’s market is on the side of the bulls. If the token continues to get rejected by this crucial resistance level, the token’s momentum will eventually side with the bears flipping gains to losses. Once this occurs, CKB’s trajectory will touchdown on $0.0114 in the short term.

This move indicates a cautious approach in the market, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to announce its latest interest rate decision later today by 2 pm ET Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Reveals Key Insights into Bitcoin’s Bull-Bear Transition Phase The Looming Rate Cut And The Beforemath So far, current market sentiment points towards a 50 basis-point rate cut, a significant change from the usual monetary policy. This would be the first-rate reduction in four years, causing market participants to brace for potential volatility. Zimmerman noted that CME traders have notably increased their short positions by 5,500 BTC over the past two days, pushing futures premiums to a nine-month low. This trend suggests a shift towards bearish sentiment on Bitcoin in anticipation of the FOMC’s decision. Additionally, the CME futures market is reflecting fears of heightened volatility, similar to what occurred following the recent US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. According to Zimmerman, the “downward sloping futures premiums” on CME, now below 5% for the first time since January 15, indicate “hedging against potential risks” associated with the FOMC meeting. Implications Of Interest Rate Cuts On Bitcoin Zimmerman pointed out that although rate cuts usually relief market conditions and may enhance liquidity for risk assets like Bitcoin, worries about a possible economic downturn remain. The analyst mentioned that the anticipated 50 basis-point cut has amplified these concerns. Historical precedents show that such a significant reduction, like those in 2001 and 2007, heightened recession fears. Currently, with real interest rates at their cyclical highs and inflation cooling, the Federal Reserve may consider swift cuts to reach a “neutral rate”—a rate that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy, Zimmerman suggested. The analyst added, noting: “Currently, 125 basis points in cuts are expected by the end of the year.” Currently, Bitcoin trades at $59,415, at the time of writing down by 2.7% in the past day. Despite the bearish sentiment from CME traders, several analysts are optimistic that the fed rate cut will be positive for Bitcoin.

42407575,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZucad,1726676489,Fair AI: Why Everyone Should Profit From the AI Boom,"Fair AI is the only viable solution to combat the growing risks of Big AI. As we speak, the world’s largest tech companies are building powerful AI-enabled applications. Of course, AI is laden with economic opportunity; but it presents looming existential threats as well. The market is dominated by companies like Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia — many of whom have long histories of user data exploitation.  These companies will benefit financially from the vast troves of user data that will power their LLMs. The end users — you and me — won’t see a dime of that financial gain. As AI replaces everyday jobs at an accelerated pace, users being compensated for their data contributions will grow more and more important.  The financial opportunity of AI needs to be distributed in a way that is available, balanced, and equitable — but still competitive. In other words, it’s time for Fair AI.  Big AI is exclusive and exploitative  At its core, AI is a data play. Whoever owns the data owns the future of AI. For the last 25 years, the world’s biggest tech companies have sourced our data, largely free to use it as they wish with vague terms and conditions conveniently dangled in front of us just before the dopamine hit of a product purchase. Big Tech is now transforming into Big AI.  AI has now placed a premium on data. More valuable than ever, the gathering, scraping, and exploitation of users’ data by these tech behemoths will only accelerate. Just recently, Adobe faced global backlash after instituting “Terms and Conditions,” giving them the rights to use all creative work from users of their products, and are now urgently backpedaling (PCMag). Importantly, Adobe did not have plans to compensate a creator if their work was used by an LLM to inform a generative AI output.  This world — in which data’s financial opportunities incentivizes companies to hoard more and more without an eye towards user privacy or creative sovereignty — is undeniably a dangerous one. It’s a world in which all the issues of today’s tech monopolies are amplified a hundred times over under the economic forces of AI and data.  The knee-jerk reaction might be to “turn off the faucet” — to deny any company from ever using user data. But the future is not one in which user data will never be used. AI is inevitable, and it is imperative that instead of stopping AI, we redirect its course towards something more sustainable, equitable, user-centered, and properly incentivized.  The data that AI is trained on comes from the millions of people interacting daily with online applications and services. This data should be monetized by those contributors — in other words, by you. We call this Fair AI — and we believe it is not just a good thing to have in AI; we believe it is fundamental to ensuring that as AI transforms our society, it does so to the benefit of everyone.  The world needs fair AI  Fair AI is the amalgamation of technologies and economic incentives that, together, ensures AI evolves in a way that is beneficial to everyone who enables or uses it. There are some core principles to Fair AI — ownership, permission, and fair compensation. Specifically, fair compensation for the contribution of data, compute, and content to datasets. Consider this example -- a user could give permission to contribute their data from their social profile – say, Twitter/X. This is not dissimilar from the process that happens when you give certain applications access to your calendar. These contributions create new datasets for developers to use that belong outside of what's publicly available and because of this, that person contributing their data to then build a more robust AI ecosystem, would then receive compensation in the form of an on-chain asset. This type of contribution is distinctly different from the current direction of Big AI. You are not compensated when the decades of your Google Search activity is used by Gemini to inform a generative output for another service.  Decentralized technology is critical to achieving Fair AI. Only through an open and secure network like a blockchain can we ensure that user data can be permissioned, tracked, revoked, and yet still leveraged by powerful LLMs. When you take into account the native incentivization of blockchain networks, you introduce the most powerful and resilient feature of Fair AI: returning value to the people responsible for contributing that data in the first place. Apps are already being built on top of blockchain that enable users to contribute their data to decentralized LLMs and earn in the process.  There are many blockchain solutions that are powering decentralized AI as momentum picks up, as highlighted by VanEck's recent report stating that the global Decentralized AI market is expected to grow to $10.2 billion by 2030. Crypto solutions like on-chain data markets, decentralized identity, zero-knowledge proofs, and on-chain AI governance are driving the projected growth of this space, reflecting the rising demand for decentralized systems that provide users with greater economic benefits for their contributions. When implemented, these solutions help create a more equitable and fair AI economy.  Fair AI, however, does not just make today’s AI more equitable. It also makes it more powerful for the AI era. Unlike data sourced from closed apps or held on closed LLMs, data on open networks is not separated by silos. Any data that has been made available by the contributor can be leveraged, meaning AI developers can theoretically access even greater troves of data to train LLMs. Effectively, the world’s data is available to them, rather than just the dataset from a community of app users.  The permissionless nature of blockchains also fuels more AI innovation at a global level, because any developer can tap into any permissionless dataset. Lastly, the monetization element of Fair AI incentivizes the creation of higher-quality, higher-value, real-time datasets. If people know that certain data is valued more by the market, they will endeavor to deliver that data to the open market — ultimately creating a more robust, complete, balanced data ecosystem.  AI is inevitable, but its exploitation does not have to be. Fair AI is the only viable, realistic pathway for us to continue innovating AI while curtailing the more sinister risks it poses when it remains in the hands of a few tech giants. By supporting Fair AI and those pursuing it, we can create a future not just where the economic benefits of AI advancement are accessible to everyone, but where the AI solutions are even more powerful than those we imagine today.

While a solid start, we could have a more lasting impact if we also focus on education through the workforce.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, companies began moving away from outdated operational technology and embracing the benefits of the World Wide Web and email en masse. Transitioning from fax to email and filing cabinets to cloud storage, those who lived through this technological revolution can remember the arduous onboarding and clunky changeover. Over recent years, employees across all industries have been keeping up with the rapid changes taking place, such as incorporating instant messaging, generative AI, time tracking, multi-factor authentication — the list is endless. But we are so eager to forget the lessons learned and our impressive agility when applying it to Web3, which in turn has neglected the growing gap between Web3 novices and Web3 experts, as well as those interested and those skeptical of the budding industry.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Until recently, Web3 felt like a niche interest. If you didn’t work for a blockchain protocol, you were relatively insulated from the industries’ happenings. But now, as mass adoption of Web3 technology quickly approaches, it’s becoming less of a vertical, spanning its wings across all industries with everyone needing to get on board and up to speed.  The key isn’t just to focus on onboarding customers; it’s also about successfully equipping employees with the knowledge and tools they need to thrive in this decentralized era. Companies have invested so much on education with a focus on trading, but have not turned their attention to the portion of the workforce that remains unfamiliar with the technology that will be responsible for creating, facilitating, communicating and operating Web3 products and services.  The growing relevance of web3 in the modern workforce  By 2030, the blockchain market isprojected to reach a staggering $1.4 trillion, indicating that decentralized technologies are rapidly becoming essential infrastructure across industries. As Web3 begins to saturate the market like Web2 once did, companies have to start closer to home when it comes to education.  According to LinkedIn’s 2023 Jobs Report, blockchain skills saw a 300% increase in demand year-over-year. However, the talent pool remains focused on technical roles, leaving a significant gap in positions requiring non-technical Web3 knowledge such as sales, marketing, HR, communications, and business administration.  Consider the various operational shifts Web3 demands. Data management, for example, transitions from centralized databases to blockchain-based decentralized ledgers, requiring employees to understand distributed storage and encryption protocols. Similarly, the shift from traditional digital identity verification to self-sovereign identities necessitates a rethinking of how companies manage user data. Even marketing and communications techniques are shifting away from social and traditional media.  The solution moving forward  These changes are inevitable, but many companies are struggling to keep up with the rate of change or are apprehensive to dive in head first, due to a lack of current internal knowledge and knowledge within external talent pools.  Rather than waiting for the perfect hire who has been entrenched in Web3 since its inception, companies should invest in upskilling their existing workforce. A poll from a 2023 study by Casper Labs showed that over 87% of businesses were looking to invest in and incorporate Web3 solutions into their business models.  To bolster the next generation of talent and prepare current employees for the transition, companies need to take action as soon as possible. In the immediate term, creating internal positions for Web3 educators is one pathway for companies to begin their integration. This means hiring people who already have a specific Web3 background to educate current employees, or budgeting for courses and third-party vendors for the purpose of Web3 education.  On a longer-term trajectory, we need to go further back. This could mean facilitating partnerships with educational institutions to develop Web3-focused curricula in universities that could proactively start filling the talent gap, ensuring a steady pipeline of qualified candidates. On a grander scale, pre-collegiate education on the blockchain industry can also be a valuable resource, the same way basic coding classes are becoming a standard in secondary schools across the globe.  Due diligence for a promising future  With Web3 technology now influencing all industries across a multitude of roles, companies that want to remain competitive must build internal teams that can bridge the gap between traditional business functions and Web3 ecosystems.  The transition to Web3 in the workforce is taking place at this very moment but it won’t be seamless without a concerted effort from businesses, educational institutions, and policymakers. It is our responsibility as Web3 evangelists to ensure that all new and potential workforce members are equipped with the right tools and education to enter the space. Together, these stakeholders can build a robust Web3 education pipeline, ensuring that the workforce is ready for the decentralized future.

42407593,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZudKv,1726674905,Three Ways DeFi Will Revolutionize Financial Services,"It’s widely accepted that our current banking system has significant flaws. Beyond systemic and geopolitical risks — like restricted borders, time zone barriers, and central bank dependencies — there are challenges with bank wires, international settlements, and the inconsistent availability of credit. A fundamental issue lies in the mismatch between banks' balance sheets and their leverage. When a bank faces liquidity or insolvency issues, as seen with First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023, depositors risk becoming creditors in a bankruptcy unless the government intervenes — leaving taxpayers to cover the fallout.  This fragility has led to growing interest in decentralized solutions from both retail investors and institutions. By removing human error and poor decision-making from the equation, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offers a compelling alternative. We believe DeFi has the potential to fundamentally transform how we transact, bank, borrow, and invest.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Here are three emerging ways in which DeFi is poised to create a future where financial services are digital, open, always-on, and borderless.  1. Tokenization of real-world assets  The tokenization of real-world assets, such as real estate, fiat currencies, or bonds, is becoming a key trend. These tokenized assets can act as collateral in next-generation DeFi lending markets. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for instance, are considered pristine collateral because their use can be automatically governed by smart contracts without needing a third party, like a court, to adjudicate disputes.  Tokenizing physical assets like real estate or government bonds creates similar opportunities, although it requires oracles to provide real-world pricing and cash flow data. As this ecosystem evolves, individuals and institutions will increasingly use a broad range of tokenized assets to access lending services, unlocking liquidity and expanding borrowing options across global markets.  2. Always-on lending marketplaces  DeFi protocols are creating 24/7 marketplaces for lending, borrowing, and asset swapping. These platforms operate continuously, allowing users to lend assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC, and earn yield in return. In the future, we expect to see tokenized assets such as government bonds and real estate added to these pools.  Unlike traditional markets, where hidden leverage and rehypothecation, the risky banking practice of lending out your assets multiple times,can create systemic risks, DeFi’s transparent smart contracts ensure that collateral is clearly managed, reducing counterparty risks. A growing number of Bitcoin holders are utilizing technologies like wBTC (wrapped Bitcoin) to borrow stablecoins on markets like Aave without selling their Bitcoin, maintaining exposure to its price appreciation.  In this setup, loans are secured by digital collateral, and if the value of the collateral decreases, the borrower either adds more collateral or risks liquidation — ensuring a healthier lending environment without the opaque risks present in traditional finance.  3. Becoming your own bank  Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of DeFi is the ability for individuals to become their own banks. Throughout history, we've seen multiple banking crises — from the savings and loan crisis to the 2008 financial meltdown, and most recently, the 2023 crisis caused by rising interest rates. Historically, during times of instability, savers moved their wealth into physical cash outside the banking system.  Today, DeFi offers a modern solution. Advanced multi-party computation (MPC) wallets allow users to store and manage their assets securely, with on-chain verification ensuring they retain control. Individuals can now store value in stablecoins, invest in digital assets, and access decentralized lending and borrowing services — all without relying on traditional banks.  With tools like separately managed accounts (SMAs), users can hold their assets in their own digital vaults, free from the balance sheet risks of banks. This level of autonomy mirrors traditional financial strategies but extends them to the realm of crypto, giving people unprecedented control over their financial future.  Conclusion: A decentralized future  In the coming decades, DeFi will become the backbone of financial services. The term ""DeFi-based banks"" may fade away as it becomes the standard infrastructure for financial services. In this world, tokenized real-world assets will unlock new possibilities for borrowing and lending, decentralized platforms will provide always-on banking services, and individuals will have the power to be their own banks — maintaining full ownership and control over their assets.  If we want a future where financial services are transparent, secure, and democratized, we must pay attention to the innovations taking place in DeFi today.

San Francisco-based Dragonfly has raised $250 million thus far with the target of doubling this figure by Q1 2025.  Crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital aims to raise $500 million for its fourth fund, which will target early-stage projects, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.  San Francisco-based Dragonfly has already raised $250 million and is looking to double that figure by first-quarter 2025, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.  Dragonfly closed its third fund, worth $650 million, in April 2022 shortly before the onset of the crypto bear market. The cryptocurrency industry bore the shock of the Terra ecosystem's collapse that May, followed by the sudden capitulation of crypto exchange FTX six months later. The ensuing crypto winter made for a challenging investing environment across the industry.  While the fourth fund's target is more than 20% smaller than its predecessor's, it remains a sign of the VC sector's bullish sentiment.  The company declined to comment when contacted by CoinDesk.

33723874,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721856-bitcoin-more-reserve-asset-than-global-currency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1726672070,Bitcoin: More Reserve Asset Than Global Currency,"Summary I argue Bitcoin is more likely to mature as a global reserve asset than a global currency, due to its deflationary nature and users holding rather than spending it. On-chain data shows declining liquid supply, stagnant transactions, and a decrease in active addresses, supporting the view that Bitcoin is not being used as a daily transaction medium. Historical events, like the 2018 Bitcoin Cash hard fork, reflect the community’s preference for Bitcoin as a reserve asset over a global currency, reinforcing my thesis. Despite some risks, including the unlikely scenario of a hyper-bitcoinized world, I remain bullish on Bitcoin as a high-risk asymmetric bet with significant upside potential as a global reserve asset. In my last article , I argued how Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) represented an asymmetric bet with an expected value between $40,000 and $100,000 per Coin, and a potential upside of $650,000 per coin. A few readers reached out, arguing how my bull case was relatively modest, as Bitcoin could mature to a far larger extent than “simply” replacing gold. In this new article, I will deep dive on the reasons why I see Bitcoin maturing as a potential global reserve asset, but not as a global currency. I will present my case by analyzing Bitcoin’s technical properties, recent on-chain data and its history. Thesis: all points at Bitcoin potentially maturing as a global reserve asset - not a global currency A key debate in the Bitcoin community concerns whether Bitcoin should be considered a new type of global currency, a reserve asset, or both. I am firmly convinced Bitcoin, at its current stage, is going to play a role as a potential global reserve asset. Conversely, I do not see it as maturing into a global currency used for frequent commercial transactions. My rationale is primarily based on Bitcoin’s scarcity, which makes it deflationary. Basic macroeconomic theory suggests that a deflationary currency is not ideal for daily transactions, as people tend to hoard money when they expect it to appreciate in value over time, reducing their willingness to spend. More on the principles behind this human behavior later in the article. My perspective is further supported by on-chain data showing that Bitcoin’s liquid supply has been declining since 2021, indicating in my view that users are increasingly choosing to ""HODL"" rather than spend. Additionally, metrics like the number of daily transactions and active Bitcoin addresses have been stagnant or declining for the past few years, reinforcing my view that Bitcoin is not becoming a global payment system or currency. Finally, Bitcoin’s history shows that the community has largely rejected the notion of Bitcoin as a primary global currency. The 2018 Bitcoin Cash hard fork, which aimed to position itself as a currency for everyday transactions, has since lost relevance compared to Bitcoin and now competes with numerous altcoins in the global payment space. However, I don’t see these trends as bearish for Bitcoin. On the contrary, I continue to view Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet on becoming a new global reserve asset, consistent with my previous thesis. For this to materialize, widespread mass adoption is unnecessary—only a few large institutions need to adopt and utilize Bitcoin. Clarifying what I mean with “reserve asset”, “currency” and “reserve currency” Before developing my thesis, I think it’s important to clarify some of the terminology I am going to use in this article. I define “reserve assets” as financial instruments that are stored by governments or central banks as part of foreign reserves. Type of reserve assets include gold and other precious metals, governmental bonds as well as fiat currencies, such as the US dollar. My definition of currency is a system of money that is used as a medium of exchange within an economy. In other terms, a financial instrument used for frequent commercial transactions between parties. I do not consider fiat currencies held as reserve assets by central banks as part of my definition of “currency”. Rather, I consider them a type of reserve asset. I see Bitcoin playing a role as a global reserve asset, partially replacing assets such as gold and the US dollar in its function of reserve currency, held by Central Banks worldwide. I do not see Bitcoin substituting currencies in their role as medium of exchange for daily commercial transactions. A deflationary currency is a bad currency (and a quick defense of Keynesian theory) Bitcoin has many characteristics that, in my view, make it technically a great reserve asset: durability, divisibility, fungibility, portability, verifiability and scarcity. It is exactly the latter characteristic, its scarcity, that I think makes Bitcoin inadequate as a global currency. A scarce asset tends to increase in value relative to other assets. That’s exactly what happened with Bitcoin: its value in US dollar (and any other currency) has increased dramatically since its conception and launch in 2009. Basic macroeconomic theory suggests deflation is a difficult phenomenon to face, as consumers tend to refrain from spending if they expect their currency to increase in value over time. This, in turn, creates issues with the broader economy as a large part of GDP is tied to consumer spending. Many people in the Bitcoin and crypto world reject Keynesian macroeconomic theory. For this reason, I want to spend a few paragraphs explaining why Keynesianism is often misunderstood by the crypto community and how its fundamentals - such as its rejection of deflation - are indeed solid and apply to Bitcoin. First of all, I believe many people associate Keynesian economics with uncontrolled public spending, strong government interventionism and a plea for high, sustained inflation. This is simply not true, as Keynesian economics argues in favor of fiscal discipline in times of economic expansion and disinflation (which is a reduction of the rate of inflation, not a reduction in price levels). Strong government spending is only recommended in times of crisis and for limited periods of time. The idea is the government should step in to absorb economic shocks, not run large deficit and increase spending at a time of economic expansion. Governments around the world at the moment are not practicing fiscal discipline, in my view - something I covered in a recent macro piece. On the contrary, I think they have resorted to sustained government spending and currency debasement as a way to avoid addressing structural issues. This is, however, far from something recommended by Kenesian theory. Another element that I think it’s often misunderstood about Keynesian theory relates to what it is based on. Fundamentally, Keynesian economics simply bases its assumptions on human behavior. Ultimately, whether or not readers agree with Keynes, the assumption that deflation is bad is rooted in basic human behavior. I believe it is reasonable to assume that people would not be willing to part ways with an asset, if they expect said asset to double in worth in one year time. I find this assumption to be difficult to disprove, whether or not that asset is a currency or a rare mineral, and regardless of the macroeconomic implications of people not spending their money. This is the fundamental reason why I do not see Bitcoin maturing into a currency used for everyday transactions and commercial relationships. People are simply not willing to part ways with what’s potentially the scarcest, best asset that humanity has ever conceived to buy bread or pay for a vacation. On-Chain data shows Bitcoin is not being used as a currency Readers who are not convinced about Bitcoin being deflationary based on its implied scarcity and macroeconomic theory, might reconsider their position after looking at on-chain data. I see a lot of data pointing at how Bitcoin users are not leveraging the cryptocurrency for commercial transactions. Rather, Bitcoin users are increasingly stacking Bitcoin and moving it to cold storage, something I see as a behavior consistent with my thesis. This is showcased by the Liquid and Illiquid supply chart shown below - with liquid and highly liquid Bitcoin fundamentally stagnant from 2015 until 2021, and declining since that time. BTC Liquid vs. Illiquid Supply (Glassnode) Furthermore, Bitcoin is disproportionately owned by a minority of people, known in the crypto community as “whales”. These users are not using Bitcoin for daily transactions, but rather are holding it in the hope it matures into a global reserve asset. The limited adoption of Bitcoin as a medium for daily transactions is evident in its transaction data, as shown in the chart below. From 2016 to 2022, the number of transactions remained largely stagnant, with a modest uptick in the past 2-3 years. Notably, even with this recent increase, the growth pattern is far from exponential. For a new global currency poised to replace fiat, one would expect a rapid, exponential rise in transaction volume. However, Bitcoin’s transaction growth has yet to meet these expectations. BTC: Number of Transactions (Glassnode) Even more interesting in my opinion, is the number of active Bitcoin addresses, which has been declining since its 2020 peak, as shown in the chart below. BTC Number of Active Addresses (Glassnode) This, in my view, shows that while transactions might be flat or slightly increasing, the number of users of the Bitcoin chain has actually been on a slight decline for the past six years. While the number of active addresses does not represent the exact number of users of the Bitcoin blockchain, I see it as a gauge of the adoption of Bitcoin as a technology. Bitcoin did experience a significant (almost exponential) increase in adoption in its first 8 years of life, but it has been stagnating since. This timing is not random, in my view, as it coincides with the hard fork between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, something I will cover in a few paragraphs. Why I don’t see On-Chain data as bearish in the context of my thesis Readers might think that a slowdown in Bitcoin adoption is bearish for the future of the cryptocurrency. Personally, I see adoption metrics as irrelevant to the asymmetric bet of Bitcoin maturing into a global reserve asset. A global reserve asset needs to be adopted only by a handful of institutions to be considered as such. These include central banks, governments, pension funds and a few large institutional investors. I see a bullish case for Bitcoin looking like a few hundred global institutions holding Bitcoin in cold storage, or using centralized exchanges like Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) or financial instruments like the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ). In this context, metrics such as the number of active addresses or the number of transactions are relatively meaningless. Few institutions would only use few hundreds addresses to hold and (rarely) move their Bitcoin. Similarly to gold, as long as few institutions adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset, that’s all it matters for my bullish scenario. Bitcoin Cash Fork: when the Bitcoin community voted against BTC as a currency Readers that are not familiar with Bitcoin and its history might be interested in knowing that Bitcoin has gone through a significant hard fork in 2018, with Bitcoin Cash “splitting” from Bitcoin. A hard fork in cryptocurrency is a major change to the blockchain protocol that creates two separate chains: one following the old rules and one following the new. It occurs when a network upgrade is not backward-compatible, often to add features or fix issues, requiring users to upgrade to stay on the new chain. In the case of Bitcoin, the 2018 hard fork happened exactly because the community couldn’t agree on Bitcoin’s ultimate use case. Developers behind the hard fork argued for increasing the block size limit from 32 MB to 128 MB, believing that accommodating more transactions per block would improve processing times. Their stance was that for Bitcoin to fulfill its original vision as a global currency, the blockchain needed to evolve to handle higher transaction volumes efficiently. Since an agreement couldn’t be reached, developers ended up performing a hard fork and creating Bitcoin Cash , a ""spinoff"" of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has been the most successful hard fork of Bitcoin since its existence, with the cryptocurrency currently being in the top 20 by market cap. However, it still fell into irrelevance when compared to Bitcoin, and ended up competing with altcoins that position themselves as better ways of payment, such as, for example, Monero ( XMR-USD ). Today, Bitcoin Cash trades for less than $300 per Coin, compared to more than $58,000 for Bitcoin at the time of writing. I think the reason for the failure behind this project has a lot to do with the way Bitcoin matured in time, moving away from parts of the original ideas that its founder Satoshi Nakamoto outlined in its original white paper. Today, I think Bitcoin is seen as a global asset and hedge against inflation and currency debasement, not as a global currency anymore. Risk to my thesis: a hyper-Bitcoinized world would see BTC as a global currency I think the main risk to my thesis is the possibility of entering a hyper-bitcoinized world. This is a scenario where fiat currencies all but disappear, and Bitcoin becomes the hardest asset and the de facto global currency. I see this as plausible only in the event of a total collapse of existing institutions, such as governments, central banks, and the financial institutions that form the banking system. In such a scenario, Bitcoin might emerge as a global currency not due to its technical attributes making it a great global currency, but because of its scarcity and status as a global reserve asset. I view this scenario as bordering on science fiction and highly undesirable for humanity, as it would likely result in widespread poverty and a regression of hundreds of years in human progress. Furthermore, in such an apocalyptic setting, a currency dependent on the internet may struggle to function, potentially leading the world to revert to gold or other physical trinkets for daily transactions. Nevertheless, this is a scenario that is sometimes outlined by people in the Bitcoin community and I will concede that in such a situation, my thesis would prove incorrect - and Bitcoin would mature to the point of substituting all fiat currencies. Conclusion As a Bitcoiner, I remain a believer in fundamental Keynesian macroeconomics, which I find to be misunderstood and often unnecessarily criticized by the Bitcoin community. Keynes died in 1946, 25 years before the US abandoned the gold standard and 63 years before the introduction of Quantitative Easing. Keynes advocated for fiscal discipline in times of economic strength, something that I think has been forgotten by today’s politicians. I don’t think Keynes would approve of the way his theories have been weaponized or used to justify reckless government spending. Ultimately however, at its core Keynesian macroeconomics is funded on principles of basic human behavior. With these principles in mind, I believe that a deflationary, ever-appreciating currency with limited transaction capacity is not fit as a global currency. People simply would not be willing to spend a currency for daily needs, if they have the reasonable expectation it will appreciate in time. Instead, Bitcoin should be seen as a superior store of value. In this context, I remain bullish on Bitcoin and reaffirm my investment thesis: it represents a high-risk asymmetric bet with the potential to mature to $650,000 per coin. I recognize that this perspective goes against some of the principles Satoshi Nakamoto outlined in the original whitepaper , but I consider that a positive development. One reason for my optimism about Bitcoin is the vibrant community supporting it. In my view, the disagreements among developers about how the blockchain should evolve are a strength of Bitcoin.

The FTM price recovery is thanks to Fantom’s fundamentals, which have sparked a positive sentiment among investors. What Is Driving The FTM Price Recovery Fantom’s price recovery is mainly driven by its bullish fundamentals, especially the imminent launch of the Sonic network. In a recent blog post, Sonic Labs announced that Sonic’s launch is scheduled for November/December 2024. Investors consider Fantom’s transition to Sonic bullish, which explains why they are investing in the FTM ecosystem ahead of the launch. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Enters Stage 3 That Will Trigger 4,500% Rally To $15 According to the announcement, the layer-1 network Sonic will be EVM-compatible, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) built on other EVM chains to be integrated into the network easily. The network will provide a secure gateway to Ethereum through its layer-2 network. The post also claimed that Sonic will provide the “fastest settlement layer for digital assets with over 10,000 TPS and one-second confirmation times for transactions ” upon launch. This feat will set a new standard in the blockchain space and put Sonic ahead of its competitors. Meanwhile, following Sonic’s launch, there will be an airdrop, which will cause more liquidity to flow into the Fantom ecosystem and further spark the FTM price recovery. The Sonic Foundation will airdrop 190 million S tokens out of its 500 million treasury to Fantom users. It is worth mentioning that FTM holders can swap their coins 1:1 for the S token, Sonic’s native token, upon the launch of the new layer-1 network. Meanwhile, the S token will not experience any inflation in the first six months, which is positive since investors can rest assured that there won’t be a supply shock following Fantom’s transition to Sonic. Other bullish fundamentals sparking the FTM price recovery include the fact that Andre Cronje, Sonic Labs’s co-founder, will build new decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives, with 90% of gas spent said to be going back to applications and developers. The Charts Also Support Fantom’s Bullish Fundamentals Crypto analyst Jagoilio recently highlighted how the charts support the FTM price recovery, with the coin likely to rise higher. He stated that Fantom has moved past its bearish trend and is now looking to break its diagonal resistance. He added that this presents the notion that the crypto is enforcing a bullish market structure and seeking a higher high. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 The analyst expects Fantom to enjoy a massive price rally in the fourth quarter, especially following the Fed rate cuts and the US presidential elections. Jagoilio went as far as asserting that FTM can outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum. He also claimed that Sonic will become the supreme layer-1 solution and outperform Solana. According to data from CoinMarketCap, FTM is trading at around $0.57 at the time of writing, up over 9% in the last 24 hours.

The Fed will likely cut rates on Wednesday, starting the so-called liquidity easing cycle.  The Federal Reserve will likely cut interest rates this Wednesday for the first time since 2020, ending the most aggressive monetary policy tightening in decades.  According to several observers, including Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer of Maelstrom and co-founder of BitMEX, the impending low interest rate environment is likely to curtail demand for tokenized Treasuries or digital representations of U.S. treasury securities that can be traded on the blockchain.  However, stablecoins could cushion the negative impact on Treasury and money market tokens, according to Alexandre Deschâtres, head of business development at Libeara, a tokenization platform incubated by SC Ventures, offering tokenization solutions designed to create security tokens to empower clients. SC Ventures is a subsidiary of Standard Chartered.  ""The $170 billion stablecoin supply represents a dry powder that can be channeled into money market tokens and Treasury tokens, potentially providing a cushion from the negative impact of Fed rate cuts,"" Deschâtres told CoinDesk during the SC Ventures' media event on the sidelines on the Token2049 conference in Singapore.  According to Fed funds futures, the market is currently pricing 100 basis points of rate cuts this year, which means the benchmark borrowing cost will drop to 4.5% by the year-end. Still, that is an attractive yield compared to passively holding stablecoins, Deschâtres quipped.  Last month, Paris-based Kaiko data said the market for tokenized Treasuries will remain active while real or inflation-adjusted interest rates remain stable.  The market cap for tokenized Treasury products has surged from $100 million to over $2 billion since early January, predominantly due to elevated interest in the U.S., according to data source rwa.xyz. BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund has attracted over $500 million in inflows. The Fed's steep rate hike cycle that began in March 2022 also catalyzed demand for the dollar-linked stablecoins.

42407576,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZucdw,1726670071,The Fed Will Tell Us Soon If Bitcoin Is at a New Baseline,"The anticipation of a Fed rate cut today in crypto and wider investment markets is palpable.  The decision could potentially be a substantial 50bps “statement of intent” cut (currently priced around a 60% likelihood). Such a move could show us where the new baseline for bitcoin – and consequently much more of the crypto market – now lies.  There’s a lot of noise in crypto markets at the moment, particularly around bitcoin. Traders are likely to react to the news of a Fed rate cut with some retrenchment, as short-term market dynamics filter out. This is particularly driven by investor concerns about the direction of travel of the U.S., and global, economy.  But let’s see the forest for the trees. Markets are always noisy in the short-term, so inflow and outflow trends over a short horizon should be taken with a significant pinch of salt. It is the longer-term implications of the narrative around easing monetary conditions that lend themselves to a fresh bull cycle for bitcoin, ether and the rest of the market.  In the past, bitcoin has correlated somewhat to major tech indices such as the Nasdaq. Looking at medium- and long-term trends, both have broadly moved in line with monetary conditions. In the past decade, this has been evermore the case as investors hunt for yield in lower-rate environments.  But this doesn’t always map perfectly. The recent all-time high (ATH) for bitcoin, for instance, was resolutely secular – i.e. it didn’t come in the wake of easing monetary conditions. The ATH happened in direct opposition to the generally accepted cyclicality of higher-risk assets such as bitcoin.  It is an understated fact that this counter-cyclical ATH is the first in the history of the world’s biggest crypto asset. This suggests that, once the market has shaken out the short-term volatility, we could be at a new baseline for the crypto asset, particularly as rate cuts now look set to power the market forward o.  What is critical from an investor point of view is that such assets are extremely forward-pricing. Money chases risk assets for the promise of future earnings. That means markets don’t necessarily react to diminishing economic circumstances. But they do tend to move (albeit more ponderously) as monetary conditions change.  This is what makes the rise this year of bitcoin to a new ATH even more notable. In effect, it is not doing what monetary policy conditions say it should be doing. So, what has happened? In short, ETFs have happened.  This non-cyclical, “secular” trend is likely driven by a major reallocation of capital that the arrival of ETFs has precipitated. In effect, the addition of ETF streams of income to bitcoin as an asset class have freed up enormous institutional and retail pools of capital looking for a home – irrespective of the monetary conditions.  As a result, the fundamentals of the market really do look different currently, and this could take investors into whole new frontiers in terms of price and adoption dynamics.  Obviously, nothing is ultimately guaranteed, but there is certainly something notable happening in the market that has not taken place before.  Remember crypto had, until 2022, never functioned inside a higher-rate environment. It has now had two years in that new phase.  TradFi capital shifts  Bitcoin isn’t the only crypto market that has experienced a secular run this year. Tokenized assets are booming as TradFi investors wake up to the potential of the market. With major underpinning assets such as bitcoin and ether driving the market and adoption, the opportunity for smaller projects as the “rising tide lifts all boats” is huge.  What is different now from past market cycles, which mirrors bitcoin, is the secular shift of TradFi capital. Again, this isn’t about growing an asset per se, it is about reallocating capital out of TradFi infrastructure and into digital on-chain environments.  This is a trend that is very much marking a shift away from the ‘crypto winter’ in 2022 that set in as rates rose. Infamous crypto projects in that era often collapsed thanks to a lack of fresh liquidity – in other words, ultimately to tightening monetary conditions.  Anecdotally, we’ve seen interest from a new wave of retail investors, with notable high-net-worth and institutional uptake too. ETFs have given these TradFi capital pools access at just the right moment in monetary terms, to adopt new opportunities, be they bitcoin, gold or equities.  Of course, this all comes with the caveat that the Fed might surprise us with a more conservative decision. But easing monetary conditions, when they finally arrive for certain, are only going to fan the flames of this expansion. This bodes well for the years ahead as the sector goes from strength to strength.

Consumers are still reluctant to use central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), despite the fact that 94% of central banks globally are exploring using these cryptocurrencies, according to a survey by Germany's Deutsche Bank (DB).  The bank surveyed 4,850 consumers in Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. in March and July this year.  Cash is not going away anytime soon, according to the survey. A majority of respondents said they would prefer to use a debit or credit card than a CBDC, and 44% said they would rather use cash than a central bank digital currency.  ""While 59% of consumers believe that cash will always be relevant, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift toward digital payments, particularly among Gen Z,"" analysts Marion Laboure and Sai Ravindran wrote in the report published on Wednesday.

Concerns have emerged weeks over Tron founder Justin Sun's perceived influence in WBTC, spurring competitors to offer alternatives.  Chain-key bitcoin (ckBTC), a non-custodial Bitcoin token based on the Internet Computer blockchain (ICP), will soon bridge to the Cosmos ecosystem via decentralized exchange (DEX) Osmosis.  It's the ""first time a proven, secure, non-custodial BTC is coming to the Cosmos ecosystem,” according to an emailed announcement on Wednesday.  The development comes as more decentralized-finance (DeFi) developers are increasingly looking for ways to export bitcoin {{BTC}}, which has the largest market capitalization by far of all cryptocurrencies, at $1.2 trillion, to other blockchain ecosystems.  While Cosmos's ATOM token ranks as just the 19th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap in the CoinDesk 20 index, at $1.6 billion, the project occupies an outsize influence in the industry due to its architecture of affiliated networks – a blueprint followed by many other blockchains – and its technology has been used as the foundation for several major decentralized-finance (DeFi) projects.  Osmosis is partnering with ICP-built Omnity Network to provide a service for bridging non-custodial BTC into Cosmos.  CkBTC is a type of Bitcoin token which is pegged 1:1 to the value of BTC, allowing users to store their wealth in the world's largest cryptocurrency while putting it to work on other networks.  The most prevalent existing token of this ilk is Ethereum-based Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). However, concerns have emerged in recent weeks over Tron founder Justin Sun's perceived influence in BitGo, custodian of the underlying assets in WBTC.  Last month, BitGo proposed to share WBTC custody with BiT Global, an entity partially controlled by Sun, which raised concerns that the agreement would centralize too much control with BiT.  The fallout from that episode energized competitors offering alternative version of WBTC, including dlcBTC and Threshold's tBTCas well as ckBTC.

Jumps in Binance trading levels often signal a local market top, with bitcoin dropping shortly afterward.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}'s surge above $61,000 in the run-up to the U.S. open on Tuesday could signal a short-term peak in the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market value, if trading volume patterns on Binance are any guide.  The 6% jump during the earlier part of the day was notable because BTC has recently tended to decline immediately after the start of equity trading in the U.S., according to Velo Data. However, the factors contributing to the spike hinted at market volatility rather than sustained upward momentum.  That's illustrated by activity on Binance. A net $85 million in spot volume, the highest in more than three months, flowed into the largest crypto exchange by market value in one hour, according to cumulative volume delta (CVD) figures from Glassnode. CVD tracks the net difference between buying and selling volumes.  Surges in Binance spot volume have coincided with local market tops in the past. In fact, similar instances on Aug. 8, 15, 20 and 23 were all followed by a pullback in the price of bitcoin. True to form, the cryptocurrency has retreated below $60,000 following this most recent uptick.  This movement suggests that some traders are leveraging these price bumps to offload bitcoin at prices above what they paid. A full $750 million of bitcoin was sent to exchanges in profit from short-term holders, defined as investors who have held BTC for less than 155 days, the second highest amount since the end of August.  This strategy of profit-taking during temporary price increases, potentially indicates a more cautious outlook among big participants.  The market’s overheated state was also reflected in the rise of futures open interest (OI), a measure of total funds allocated in open futures contracts. According to Glassnode, over 8,600 new contracts, denominated in bitcoin, entered the market.  Large spikes in OI often signal new money entering the market, with traders using leverage to capitalize on short-term price movements. While this influx of capital may have contributed to bitcoin's rally, it also adds risk to the market, because heightened leverage can amplify both gains and losses, increasing the likelihood of volatility in the near term.

33721395,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642781,1726666245,Chainlink Signals Deeper Losses: Can Bulls Stage A Comeback?,"Chainlink is facing increasing bearish pressure as its price continues to edge lower, signalling a potential move toward the further downside. After a period of consolidation, the bears have regained control, pushing Chainlink closer toward the $9.28 support level. However, bulls may not be ready to give up just yet. With market sentiment fluctuating, the possibility of a bullish comeback looms on the horizon. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, we seek to determine if LINK is poised for a deeper decline or if bullish forces could reverse the current trend and drive the price upward. At the time of writing, Chainlink was trading around $10.59, marking a 0.10% decline over the past day. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization stood at approximately $6.4 billion, while trading volume exceeded $206 million, showing increases of 0.10% and 15.36%, respectively. Current Market Sentiment: Bearish Pressure Mounts On Chainlink On the 4-hour chart, following a successful drop below the $11 mark, LINK has continued to experience negative momentum, dropping toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). As the cryptocurrency approaches the 100-day SMA, it could either find temporary support or risk further declines if the bearish momentum continues to intensify. Also, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart, has dropped below the 50% threshold, now sitting at 42%. With the RSI attempting to move deeper into the oversold territory, it shows that bears are gaining control, and an extended decrease could be on the horizon if buying interest does not pick up soon. Related Reading: Is Chainlink (LINK) $12 Breakout Imminent? Data Reveals A Rising Open Interest On the daily chart, Chainlink is currently making a bearish movement, toward the $7.14 trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average. This movement underscores strong selling pressure and negative market sentiment, signaling a heightened risk of further losses. Lastly, the 1-day RSI reflects increasing pessimistic pressure on LINK, as the indicator has fallen to 47% after briefly crossing above the 50% threshold. This drop highlights mounting selling activity and signals a stronger potential for additional downward movement. Will LINK See A Recovery Or Further Decline? As the cryptocurrency approaches the $9.28 support level, which could spark a potential rebound, technical indicators like the RSI still point to strong selling pressure. If LINK fails to hold this level, a break below could result in persistent declines, potentially testing the $7.14 support level and even lower thresholds. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Could Drop To $8 If It Loses Current Support: On-Chain Data Reveals However, should Chainlink manage to hold above this crucial support level, it could set the stage for a potential upward move toward the $11.10 resistance. A successful breakout through this resistance could ignite a significant rally, paving the way for the price to aim for the next key resistance at $12.44. If bullish momentum continues to build, Chainlink may even reach higher levels, extending the rally beyond current resistance points.

The Hemi Network has been built on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.  The investment round was led by Binance Labs, Breyer Capital and Big Brain Holdings, the company said.  Hemi Labs, the team co-founded by legendary Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, has raised $15 million in investment to develop and launch Hemi Network, a layer-2 blockchain that has been built on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the company said on Wednesday.  The investment round was led by Binance Labs, Breyer Capital and Big Brain Holdings, Hemi said. Breyer was an early stage investor in Facebook (META), stablecoin issuer Circle and Spotify (SPOT).  Hemi is a single blockchain that is both a Bitcoin and Ethereum layer 2. It claims to combine the best characteristics of both networks, taking the security qualities of Bitcoin and blending them with the liquidity and programmability of Ethereum. A layer-1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain. Layer 2s are separate blockchains, built on top of layer 1s, that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and speed.  ""When it comes to the question of building a layer 2 on Bitcoin or Ethereum, the most compelling approach is to say 'both,' Garzik said in emailed comments. ""We're incredibly proud to have delivered a vision for the layer-2 space that has resonated so widely.""  The round also included participation from Crypto.com, Web3 Ventures, HyperChain Capital, Alchemy, SALT Fund, Kelly Investments, Sunflower Capital, DNA Fund, Gate Ventures, Quantstamp, TRGC, BTC INC, Artichoke Capital, Cypher Capital, SNZ Holding, C6E, IBG Capital, Protein Capital, MON Ventures, S5V, Impossible Finance, Jihan Wu, George Burke and Sonny Singh.

42407588,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZud7h,1726664400,The (Zero-Knowledge Proof) Singularity Is Near,"Slowly, then suddenly.  The journey to transformative breakthroughs often follows this familiar pattern and this month may well be remembered as an inflection point in the acceleration toward real-time proving of transaction validity for blockchains.  First, Polygon Labs went public last week with its purchase of Fabric Cryptography’s specialized chips – verifiable processing units (VPUs) – claiming a significant leap forward for zero knowledge (ZK) proving capabilities.  Then, in collaboration with Optimism, a leading layer-2 blockchain, Succinct Labs separately unveiled a framework to upgrade optimistic rollup chains in the OP Stack into a ZK rollup – in just an hour. Users will be able to withdraw funds sooner after a rollup, or batch of transactions, is recorded on-chain, because the dispute resolution period required with optimistic rollups is replaced with the certainty afforded by ZK proofs.  And this week, we had news from RiscZero on its plan to become the distributed verifiable compute layer for all blockchains.  Together this series of announcements reveals the acceleration of the ZK space toward true scalability, with better proving speeds and costs.  Fabric’s VPUs promise a remarkable boost, thanks to their custom architecture and cryptographic compute power. As a researcher, builder, and strategic investor in Fabric, I’m excited and eager to test the chips in the wild. But as an industry, we need to keep our eye on a bigger prize. Hardware acceleration is only one component of overcoming a broader, more complex challenge: achieving real-time proving for blockchains, a.k.a. proof singularity.  Proof singularity represents a critical milestone in the evolution of blockchain technology because it promises to eliminate the bottlenecks that hinder scalability, privacy, and interoperability across blockchain networks. By achieving real-time proving, applications can execute complex computations securely without exposing sensitive data, opening doors to use cases such as private transactions, confidential smart contracts, and highly efficient rollups. This transformation would not only enhance the user experience by significantly reducing latency but also drive broader adoption by making zero-knowledge technology practical for real-world applications, from decentralized finance to enterprise blockchain solutions.  The broader impact of proof singularity extends beyond individual blockchain networks, as it paves the way for a more interconnected and scalable Web3 ecosystem. As ZK proofs become faster and more efficient, cross-chain communication and interoperability can be greatly improved, enabling seamless, secure interactions between various blockchain protocols. This could lead to a paradigm shift where data privacy and security are inherently built into the infrastructure, fostering trust and compliance in industries that require rigorous data protection standards, such as healthcare, finance, and supply chain management.  Ultimately, proof singularity has the potential to redefine the foundational principles of blockchain technology, merging performance, security, and privacy in unprecedented ways, thereby driving the next wave of blockchain innovation.  Hardware acceleration: necessary, not sufficient  Against that ambitious backdrop, Fabric's VPU offers up to 900% increased big-integer operations performance compared to conventional GPUs. Polygon’s investment underscores a commitment to optimizing proof generation, betting on VPUs to enhance applications like Polygon zkEVM (a zero-knowledge version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine). However, while these numbers are great, many technical barriers remain to end-to-end, real-time proving, because big-integer operations are only a part of end-to-end proving time.  We know from experience that true real-time ZK proving cannot be realized through hardware alone. The industry’s approach must go beyond raw computational power, and should focus on a full-stack integration of hardware and software to address the range of challenges that stand in the way of seamless, real-time ZK applications.  A fully vertically integrated approach  Better zkVM architecture: Let’s rethink the zkVM architecture from the ground up: the current generation of zkVM is limited by many sequential components. We need to re-architect zkVM so that zkVM execution and proving can be done in parallel from start to finish.  Real-time proof aggregation: By incorporating this, the industry can address a key bottleneck often overlooked—verification cost and latency. Real-time proof aggregation allows cheap verification of proofs, on-chain, with minimal latency.  Hardware/software co-design: Real-time proving needs to leverage different kinds of hardware, for example, CPU, GPU, VPU, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), because each kind has different trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency. To fully realize the power of hardware, we need to co-design the hardware together with the software so that there is no leakage of performance or between different layers of the stack.  Bottom line  Polygon’s VPU investment signals an exciting step forward, but the journey to prove singularity will require more than hardware innovation. The true potential of ZK technology will be unlocked through a balanced combination of advanced circuits, optimized cryptography, and system-level breakthroughs. Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of ZK technology, striving to realize a future where real-time ZK proving is not just a possibility but a reality.  The race is on, and it’s about much more than faster chips—it’s about reimagining the entire ZK stack.

RIOT's interest in acquiring BITF makes tactical sense because BITF rivals CLSK (the sector's best) in several key areas while being priced 60% lower than CLSK. Despite BITF's competitive performance, BITF could only justify a 5% upside ($2.15 target) assuming a peak of $100,000 Bitcoin for the next 4 years, making RIOT's offer compelling and fair. BITF is unlikely to make it into our portfolio during a potential Bitcoin bull run by 17th October 2024. Introduction The Bitcoin mining market is a winner-takes-all market because the Bitcoin rewards are fixed. The side with the most network share (which is the capacity over the sum of the capacity of all other miners combined) wins (earns the most reward). Expanding organically (sourcing for power, leasing lands, building the infrastructure, purchasing the fleeting fleets, hiring, etc) is time-consuming at the very least. That is why the ability to acquire other Bitcoin miners is highly valuable. About half a year ago , we suggested how Bitfarms ( BITF ) could benefit from a potential sector-wide consolidation after the halving event occurred in April by acquiring other underperforming Bitcoin mining companies cent on the dollar. We cited BITF's ability to operate efficiently and maintain network share to maintain profitability, a feat few could achieve at the time. Specifically: BITF's cost basis is still relatively lower than its comps which positively contributes to its resilience. This resilience can help BITF outlast competitors and capture more network share. BITF can reverse its declining network share and further decrease mining costs if it can meet its 12 EH/s guidance . Fast-forward to today. BITF's capacity is nearing 12 EH/s guidance, and true enough, BITF has been able to stop any further decline since 2023Q2. This is a good performance, considering Marathon Holdings ( MARA ) is losing its network share advantage. Fig 1. Normalized Network Share Changes of Major Bitcoin Mining Companies (Author) Our analysis of Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) mentioned that its attempted acquisition of BITF makes strategic and tactical sense. In many ways, BITF is similar to CLSK in performance, while its market cap is less than half of CLSK's. But what about from BITF's perspective? Does it make sense for BITF shareholders to reject the takeover? How should it impact our investment thesis? This article aims to discuss the questions above and establish our investment thesis for BITF in preparation for a potential Bitcoin bull run by exactly one month. Similar Performance as Sector's Best, But At Lower Prices Firstly, BITFs are comparable to CLSKs in terms of cost efficiency. BITF's all-in cost basis per Bitcoin in 2024Q2 initially appears to be the highest at $142k. During the quarter, BITF incurred an operating cost of $87mil, which consists of $20.4mil electricity cost, $57.3mil depreciation cost, and $12.4mil SG&A cost, minus the sales tax recovery of $25.7mil pro-rated over 9 quarters. With 614 Bitcoins produced, this equates to $142k per Bitcoin. In April 2024, the Company received confirmation from the Provincial tax authorities that Canadian sales taxes paid by the Company from February 5, 2022 onwards are refundable Company BITF CLSK IREN MARA RIOT Cost Basis on Quarter 142,092.00 73,045.00 94,757.00 112,109.00 132,583.00 From the breakdown above, BITF's depreciation costs account for 65% of the total cost. However, we found that depreciation costs should be consistent across the sector; only the depreciation rate should vary due to varying accounting methods. For instance, CLSK and RIOT have the same purchase price of $16mil per 1 EH/s. RIOT recently reduced depreciation costs on paper by extending the expected useful life of its mining fleets from 2 years to 3 years . Effective January 1, 2024, the Company changed the estimated useful life of its miners and mining equipment from2 years to 3 years. Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, was $32.3 million and $59.3 million, respectively, a decrease of approximately $27.0million. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the estimated lives of our Bitcoin miners from 2 years to 3 years. Therefore, we've excluded depreciation cost in comps because BITF's high depreciation cost could be a side-effect of a more aggressive depreciation policy. After excluding depreciation cost, BITF's total cost basis dropped to $49k, rivaling even CLSK's best-in-class cost efficiency. Going back to 2022Q1, we can see that BITF's cost efficiency (excluding depreciation cost) was consistently among the lowest. Company BITF CLSK IREN MARA RIOT Cost Basis (w/o depreciation) 48,769.00 47,315.00 61,298.00 69,446.00 88,389.00 Fig 2. All-in cost basis per Bitcoin (excluding depreciation costs) of major Bitcoin mining companies (Author) Secondly, BITF is now comparable to CLSK in terms of capacity growth. Referring back to Fig 1, we can see that CLSK enjoyed a significant increase in network share thanks to its aggressive expansion efforts. As a result, we saw CLSK outperforming the market by a considerable margin but also extended into overvaluation territory. It may appear that we called the top on this one, but we felt that the odds were pointing to the downside at the time, nothing more. This series of price actions suggest that the network share gained by CLSK has been priced in and is now in the past. What counts are future performances because the stock market is forward-looking. With this in mind, even though BITF's network share remained flat from 2023Q1 to 2024Q2, BITF guided an 86% increase from August's 11.3 EH/s capacity to 21 EH/s by the end of 2024. This is actually one of the highest in the sector right now. A clear guidance with a defined timeline, this is what we like. The guidance timeline matters because valuations are based on assumed future capacity, and the guidance timeline dictates the time period required to achieve the assumed capacity. Guidance Timeline is crucial for our strategy, particularly because our strategy is considered timing the market. We're looking for Bitcoin miners to tilt (sell Bitcoins for Bitcoin miners) into when we receive the 2 confirmations for a Bitcoin bull run by 17th October. This strategy of tilting our crypto portfolio worked wonders for us in the past, such as with CLSK and BITF , all documented here on Seeking Alpha. We annotated (*) CLSK's and RIOT's capacity growth guidance to indicate the longer time horizon required to achieve their guidance. CLSK has higher growth guidance, but the timeline is unknown; RIOT has similar growth guidance, but it takes 5x longer to achieve (BITF's 1 quarter vs RIOT's 5 quarters). Table 1. Guidance and IBP of Major Bitcoin miners Company BITF CLSK IREN MARA RIOT Latest Capacity (Aug) 11.30 22.60 16.00 35.20 23.30 Guided Capacity 21.00 50.00 30.00 50.00 41.00 Capacity Growth Guidance 86% 121%* 88% 42% 76%* Guidance Timeline 2024Q4 ? 2024Q4 2024Q4 2025Q4 Current Market Cap 900 2,301 1,373 4,614 2,122 Adjusted Book Value 439 1,333 848 2,431 2,174 Cost Basis on Quarter 142,092.00 73,045.00 94,757.00 112,109.00 132,583.00 Cost Basis (w/o depreciation) 48,769.00 47,315.00 61,298.00 69,446.00 88,389.00 IBP 163,429 90,939 118,281 117,796 112,871 IBP w/o Depreciation 76,253 69,549 84,822 92,651 79,334 Two relevant expectations to this thesis are Bitcoin reclaiming ATH by 17th October and peaking at $100k by the end of March 2025. In CLSK's case, its current market cap of $2.3 bn may be justified with the lowest Implied Bitcoin Price ('IBP'; excluding depreciation cost) of $69k, assuming a 50 EH/s capacity. However, even if Bitcoin reaches $69k by 17th October, its current market cap of $2.3bn can't be truly justified yet because it has not realized its assumed 50 EH/s capacity. The same goes for RIOT. RIOT may have an IBP of $79k (similar to BITF), but its market cap still can't be justified when Bitcoin reaches $79k during the 2nd half of the Bitcoin bull market (October 2024-March 2025) because it has yet to achieve its assumed 40 EH/s capacity. In contrast, BITF is expected to achieve its guided 20 EH/s before Bitcoin reaches $79k before March 2025, justifying its market cap in a timely manner. Therefore, BITF presents the best upside potential considering both the timeline and IBP. In short, BITF can rival CLSK in terms of performance. The Implied Bitcoin Price ('IBP') is a valuation model we developed to account for both book value and profitability prospects. The IBP is the Bitcoin price that can justify a Bitcoin miner's current market cap assuming a 1x adjusted book value (excluding intangibles) + 5x earnings multiples. The lower, the better. This metric works because profitability must justify the premium on book value. For instance, we're observing an ongoing mean reversion of the price-to-book value ratio ('PBR') taking place (fig 3). The market is pricing the Bitcoin mining sector at around 2x PBR or a 1x premium. Hence, these miners must be able to provide the value of the 1x PBR premium through profitability. That's why the IBP is usually higher than the all-in cost basis per Bitcoin, except for when market cap is below book value (like in RIOT's current case) Valuations: RIOT's Offer Was Fair Our findings suggest RIOT's offer to wholly acquire BITF at $2.30 per share was fair. At our expected peak of $100,000 Bitcoin price, BITF's adjusted book value would be worth $477mil (Tangible assets + Bitcoin reverse valued at $100,000 per Bitcoin), up from $439mil from the current adjusted book value, relatively insignificant due to BITF having the lowest Bitcoin % over total assets (Fig 3; ignoring IREN, which never HODL). Fig 3. Value of Bitcoin reserves over Total Assets (%) (Author) Referring to Table 1, BITF's profit per Bitcoin mined is implied to be between $51k profit (ignoring depreciation cost) and $42k loss (assuming full official depreciation cost). Since depreciation cost is an actual cost and shouldn't be ignored, we only use the $51k profit per Bitcoin as a reference to compute BITF's highest justifiable intrinsic value. On the top end (at $51k profit per Bitcoin), assuming a 21 EH/s capacity at a 60% network hash rate growth rate, BITF's operational value at 5x earnings would be valued at $800mil. Combined with its $477mil book value, BITF can justify a $1.27bn market cap, or $2.80 per share (40% upside). For a more realistic estimation, we can use the sector's average of 33%. Data shows that the average % depreciation cost to total cost is about 33% (Fig 4). The implied BITF's all-in cost basis would be $69.6k, or $30.4k profit per Bitcoin. This then implies an operational intrinsic value of $475mil. Combined with its $477mil book value, BITF can justify a $950mil market cap, or $2.15 per share, which is today's price. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that RIOT's offer to wholly acquire BITF at $2.30 was actually fair. Fig 4. % Depreciation cost over Total Operating Cost (excluding impairment costs) (Author) Verdict Your Bitcoin outlook will ultimately determine whether BITF should accept RIOT's offer to acquire at $2.30 per share. This offer presents a 40% return payday based on May's share price. In comparison, our model suggests that BITF's valuation should peak at around $2.15 only, assuming a new ATH at $100,000 per Bitcoin for the next 4 years. By this standard, as shareholders, we would've accepted RIOT's offer. RIOT's offer looks even more compelling when factor in the probability that BITF's actual depreciation cost could be much higher than the sector's. This could explain the controversy surrounding BITF's poison pill event and proposed board shuffling. Based on the thesis presented in this article, BITF is unlikely to make it into our portfolio. Currently, we plan to tilt into CLSK and MARA if signs for a potential Bitcoin bull run emerge.

The integration of crypto payments with A.I. robots presents a futuristic growth avenue, highlighting Coinbase's innovative product development. Institutional demand for crypto is rising, evidenced by BlackRock's ETFs, but investors should be cautious of portfolio holdings and expense ratios. Despite sound fundamentals and product innovation, Coinbase's high valuation and income statement volatility pose substantial risks for investors. When you come for the throne, you better not miss. This goes both ways for Coinbase (COIN). The crypto leader is under constant warfare when it comes to regulatory and market forces. So before investing in the stock or community, there are a few things investors need to be aware of. First, there is tremendous volatility priced in. But also a ton more volatility, which has not been discovered. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and the alts are very liquid, so the market can move quick in either direction. Second is the upcoming election. Now, an election year tends to be very positive for all investors. Irrespective of your industry niche. But if you choose the right industry, you will earn alpha. In Coinbase's specific case, a new Trump administration would be very positive for the industry. While a Harris administration could increase regulatory hurdles. Below, I break down the different outcomes and what crypto investors need to focus on. How Crypto Will Be Used To Pay A.I. Robots An unsuspected but necessary development. I have been using every single A.I. tool. The new applications are exciting and have thousands of use cases. However, one use case I hadn't seen mentioned was the integration with robots. For example, Figure AI has integrated OpenAI into their humanoid robot. But what is not mentioned often is how we will interact with robots. Specifically, when it comes to delivering commands. Money, or crypto in this case, is one simple way to interact with computers. Via hardware and software. Which is why I was impressed when Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, published his first X article on the topic in late August. Robots (X.com) Before diving into A.I., Coinbase has one of the best product development teams in crypto. They move quick, experiment often and release fantastic products. I recommend following their other developments. The recent innovations in commerce are impressive too. Now back to robots. In the future, I think we will have 3-4x as many robots as we do humans. This includes cars, humanoids and robots. Many of these bots will have different A.I. software embedded into their hardware. They will be in multiple jurisdictions with a lot of moving parts. So to communicate effectively with them, we will need a more efficient command interface. The old banking architecture won't be effective here. The primary reason is fiat currency cannot deliver instructions. But crypto is embedded directly into some software applications. Giving many crypto infrastructure apps the upper hand here. I don't know if Coinbase will lead the effort, but it is great to see Armstrong publish his thoughts here. Coinbase is so large now that A.I. crypto payments will be only one of many new transactional revenue streams. An Electoral Impact on Crypto The most unexpected crypto event for me this year has been Trump's support of the community. He's taken two notable steps for the industry this year. First was speaking at the largest Bitcoin conference in Nashville this July. Initially, I think his plan was to gain exposure to an underrepresented crowd. At that moment, the Biden/Harris would not provide any support or opinion on the industry. So Trump got the first-movers advantage. Even Trump was surprised to learn the roaring support he received from the community. Especially when he announced the pledge to fire Gensler. Trump at Bitcoin 2024 (WSJ.com) Second was his recent X Spaces with a notable crypto investor, Farokh . Over 1.2m people listened in. Trump announced the launched of World Liberty Financial, a new crypto initiative. You don't need to listen to the two-hour podcast interview. But it is worth noting that Trump is bullish on the industry. X Spaces (X.com) If you are in the crypto community, you are familiar with the regulatory backlash the SEC has delivered. Most of it comes in the form of unclear and uncertain guidelines. Even as a former MIT Blockchain professor, Gensler refuses to provide clarity on regulatory security. Meaning he will not define what is or what is not a security. However, Coinbase is playing offense here. The team has a fantastic legal team led by Paul Grewal. Paul is working day and night looking regulatory contradictions between the courts. Below is one recent example. Paul Grewal posting (X.com) I am grateful Coinbase's legal team is doing this. Not only for shareholders but for the crypto community as a whole. In this particular case, the community needs an institutional leader like Coinbase to charge. The primary problem is, nobody has the firepower to combat with multiple regulatory agencies. It has bankrupted other companies in the past. Even in this case, Coinbase has spent ~$20 million on legal costs during the first six months of 2024. This keeps me bullish on Coinbase, even though there continues to be a dark cloud over the industry. BlackRock's Crypto ETF Performance One interesting point worth noting is the institutional demand for crypto has become real. BlackRock has two iShares ETFs I have been following this year: IBLC and IBIT. IBIT YTD Prices (Google Finance) But like many other ETFs, be careful what you purchase here. The portfolio holdings and expense ratio have a direct impact on your portfolio performance. For example, iShares Blockchain and Tech ETF ( IBLC ) and iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) are constructed very differently. I'll come back to why I like Coinbase most. But first let's look into these ETFs. IBIT is most aligned with the underlying holdings. It only has two positions: Bitcoin and Cash. Many institutions cannot buy crypto direct. Buying and managing positions on-chain has too much risk if you are not a savvy investor. However, it is worth comparing this Bitcoin only fund to their iShares Blockchain ETF. The holding structure and expense ratios are very different. First, IBLC has almost double the fee ratio of IBIT. And a very diverse stock portfolio. Many of the names like IBM and AMBA don't provide direct blockchain exposure. Investors are overpaying for misaligned allocations. iShares ETF holdings (Blackrock.com) Also, if you want to learn more about how Coinbase settles institutional crypto trades, read this post by Brian Armstrong. Coinbase post (X.com) Watch for New Regulatory Updates this Week If you are active in the crypto community, I recommend following a few of the accounts Eleanor mentions below. This session is happening offline on Wednesday, Sept 18th. You can find more updates from Robinhood and other experts on X.com later this week. Your Entry Point is Everything Although $COIN is nearing its YTD low, investors need to look beyond this. Coinbase has doubled since last September. Coinbase stock price (Google Finance) So far, I've highlighted a few bullish statements for the stock. However, not everything is rosy in the crypto economy. The number one risk for investors is your entry point. Specifically, when it comes to buying Coinbase. The real risk here is the volatility in the income statement. Coinbase income statement (Google Finance) Since 2019, Coinbase has made and lost billions of dollars. Fiat, not crypto. And today this stock at a $40b market cap with only $3b in revenue. Investors are paying a lot for future growth. A significant premium, to say the least. The number one problem here is the high likelihood investors will have a permanent loss of capital. In five years, the stock has dropped 52%. Even though revenue is up. And more importantly, the balance sheet is showing positive growth. Particularly, the custody assets which are reaching $200b now. Coinbase balance sheet (Google Finance) For me, this has become a conflicting story. Coinbase has built sound fundamentals compared to other crypto institutions and exchanges. Investors love the stock and continue pushing it upwards. Yet, the overvaluation is clear. In the last month, the stock dropped 21%. It will probably continue hovering between $160-180 per share up until the election. But the reality is, there are more reasons for the price to go down than up. Risk on, risk off. I am bullish on product development and expansions. But I think the price is too rich at the moment. Even if it dropped $40-50, investors will be overpaying this type of exposure. And remember, crypto is not in season right. A.I. has all the hype at the moment.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4721803-coinbase-is-the-new-payment-king?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/33720327.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,826.12 -0.65%  Bitcoin (BTC): $59,919.93 +1.38%  Ether (ETH): $2,307.97 -0.13%  S&P 500: 5,634.58 +0.03%  Gold: $2,578.13 +0.17%  Nikkei 225: 36,380.17 +0.49%  Top Stories  Bitcoin fell below $60,000 during the European morning ahead of a widely anticipated first interest-rate cut by the Fed in four years. Lower borrowing costs have historically been a bullish driver of risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Traders are currently pricing in a 65% chance of a 50 basis-point cut, which could actually have the reverse effect of sending a signal of concern about the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee's announcement is due at 2 p.m. Eastern time. Ahead of the decision, BTC is trading around $59,900, about 1.3% higher in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, has dropped by about 0.7%.  After ether's uninspiring performance in 2024, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency could be a contrarian bet into the year-end, according to Bitwise. ETH is little changed this year, while BTC is up 30% and SOL 31%. Nevertheless, Ethereum is the domain for the majority of stablecoins and 60% of all DeFi assets. ""Ethereum has the most active developers, the most active users, and a market cap that is 5X bigger than its closest competitor,"" wrote Matt Hougan, Bitwise's CIO. He compared Ethereum to Microsoft, in that there may be more excitement about newer companies like Slack and Zoom, ""but Microsoft is still larger than all of them put together.""  BitGo plans to introduce a dollar-backed stablecoin next year, differentiating itself in a crowded market by offering rewards to institutions that provide liquidity to the network. The stablecoin, dubbed USDS, will be backed by short-duration Treasury bills, overnight repos, and cash, like others on the market. It will be what BitGo calls the first open-participation stablecoin. BitGo's offering will differ from its rivals with a rewards-based approach, which incentivizes institutions providing liquidity to the USDS network by distributing a portion of the returns generated from its reserves. “At the end of each month, we generate some return from the cash being held in the underlying fund, and we will pass it back to the participants on a pro-rata basis, based on their custody of the asset,"" CEO Mike Belshe said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  The chart illustrates that Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, has seen its highest spot trading volume for bitcoin in three months.  Previous instances of Binance volume spiking on Aug. 20 and 24 both marked local tops in BTC's price.  This may point toward BTC stalling before experiencing a short-term pullback.  - James Van Straten  Trending Posts  Bitget, Foresight Ventures Buy $30M TON Tokens From Whales  Australia to Prioritise Wholesale CBDC Over Retail  Brian Armstrong, ETF Experts Shoot Down 'Paper Bitcoin' Rumors",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/18/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-drops-below-60k-ahead-of-expected-fed-rate-cut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d699cca82922daa89329c7ef3514f1b1cbc44e95-1958x718.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33719311,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642754,1726660831,Shiba Inu Eyes Explosive 430% Climb As Momentum Builds —Analyst,"Analysts have taken notice of Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently, which sees an unusual strength even when the greater crypto market gets into chaos. Optimism for the massive upswing in price came after a recent breakout from a falling wedge pattern. This technical development could be a sign of a downtrend turning into a bull’s market and could see a heavy price rise. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Action Hints At Explosive 7,000% Growth Technical Analysis Signals Potential Upsurge On 20 August, Shiba Inu came out of a falling wedge pattern–a sign that bearish momentum was dwindling. According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, this breakout is a highlight in his report. He believes SHIB can head straight for an enormous rally with a goal price in the region of $0.000081. That will amount to a solid 430% increase from its current level of $0.00001327. Even with recent market declines, the breakout above the upper trendline has kept SHIB consistent. Analysts are hopeful that as market conditions calm, this technical change points toward a possible rally. Santiment’s Take And SHIB Price Prediction On the other hand, though, investor sentiment sends out contrary signals. On-chain market intelligence platform Santiment says there is a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt for the Shiba Inu investors. The population of holders with less than 1 billion SHIB has fallen to its lowest since last November. There’s a pretty sharp drop in social media interest in SHIB, as well. This may also signify a more negative mood among investors in general. But the most recent estimate from CoinCodex indicates Shiba Inu’s short-term approach being more conservative. With SHIB, the negativity is reportedly low since it is predicted to drop to almost -0.46%. The October 18, 2024 amount will be $0.00001323. The current Fear & Greed Index of 45 reminds investors that fear is on the high end. The past 30 days reflect a pretty meager number of green days at 16 and volatility in terms of price stands at 4.52%. So, it goes without saying that the prognosis in recent times for SHIB has been mixed and uncertain. Related Reading: Avalanche Revenue Nosedives Over 40% In Q2 – Impact On AVAX Price Shiba Inu: Mixed Signals Optimism and caution appear to be mixed up with the current situation of the Shiba Inu. Market mood and the prospects over the short run are in a more pessimistic condition even as the technical indicators put forward the possibility of a strong rally ahead. These mixed signals should be carefully taken into consideration by investors and may want to sit back and wait for a few more such signs before going ahead to make investments. As always, it is good to be informed and cautious to pull through the uncertain times effectively.

The exchange segregates order matching and custody while promising security of both processes.  SINGAPORE — Two former Coinbase (COIN) executives unveiled TrueX, a cutting-edge, non-custodial exchange for stablecoin trading, during a side event at the Token2049 conference.  The exchange, founded by Vishal Gupta, former head of markets at Coinbase, and Patrick McCreary, a former software engineer at the Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange, is the flagship product of True Markets, according to an announcement shared with CoinDesk.  TrueX features a proprietary matching engine to efficiently match trading orders, secure segregation between execution of trades and asset custody, while promising seamless completion of transactions using stablecoins. Segregated execution means the exchange only facilitates trades. It does not control or hold the actual assets, which a regulated third-party custodian typically does.  The default settlement currency on the exchange is PYUSD, PayPal's dollar-backed stablecoin designed for payments and issued by Paxos Trust Company.  “Throughout the natural evolution of crypto markets, we've seen opportunities to make exchanges safer and more trusted,” said Gupta, who is also CEO. “Clients now demand the security of true segregation of execution and custody. Our team has worked diligently to meet these needs, leveraging the power of stablecoins to facilitate efficient liquidity and settlement solutions.""

42407581,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZuckY,1726660709,Fintech Giant Revolut Said to Be Planning Stablecoin,"A spokesman for Revolut said the company wants to expand its crypto offerings, taking a compliance-first approach to become a safe harbor for the entire crypto community.  Revolut, which snagged a U.K. banking license in recent months, would join other entrants to the stablecoin sector including PayPal, Ripple and BitGo.  Revolut, a London-based fintech company that offers cryptocurrency trading, intends to issue its own stablecoin, according to four people who have heard about the plan.  The company, which snagged a U.K. banking license in July and was valued at $45 billion earlier this year, is said to be quite far along in creating the stablecoin, according to two of the people.  Asked about its stablecoin plans, a spokesman for Revolut said the firm wants to expand its crypto offering, taking a compliance-first approach to become a safe harbor for the entire crypto community.  “Crypto is a big part of our belief in banking without borders and we have a clear mission to become the safest and most accessible provider of crypto asset services,” the spokesman said in an email.  The highly lucrative stablecoin sector, dominated by Tether's USDT with a market cap of about $119 billion, has seen a growing crop of new entrants. Circle’s USDC ranks second, at about a third of the size. Last year, payments service PayPal started issuing a stablecoin, with blockchain firms Ripple aiming to join in the coming weeks and BitGo announcing a planned introduction at Token2049 in Singapore earlier this week.  The tokens, whose value is pegged to a real-world asset, often buy government-issued debt to support their value. That provides a steady stream of interest payments to the companies, making them highly profitable. Tether reported first-half profit of $5.2 billion.  The trend may also be driven to some degree by incipient guidance on crypto-tokens coming out of Europe, in the form of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.  Revolut has allowed the buying and selling of crypto within its app for several years and launched a standalone cryptocurrency exchange for experienced traders in May.",POSITIVE,USDT,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | USDT,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/09/18/fintech-giant-revolut-said-to-be-planning-stablecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ca19b29e8ab173881d07a500314e2d207392d68-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This deal was not structured as a traditional VC investment, but rather a purchase from the token's largest holders  Crypto exchange Bitget and Web3 investor Foresight Ventures announced on Wednesday that they have increased their exposure to The Open Network (TON Blockchain) by $30 million through a deal with a number of unnamed whales of the TON ecosystem.  This investment wasn’t a traditionally structured deal where the investors buy tokens from the foundation that supports the blockchain, but rather direct purchase from TON whales a spokesperson confirmed.  “The investment is between Bitget, Foresight Ventures, and Toncoin holders. The TON Foundation is not involved in the deal. As TON foundation is actively supporting development and user adoption of the TON ecosystems, we will closely work with TON Foundation to boost the TON ecosystem,” a spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk by email. “All TON tokens acquired have a lock-up period and will be gradually released according to the vesting scheme to ensure that all parties are committed to the TON ecosystem for the long term.”  TON has been one of the year’s notable growth stories, thanks to its connection with Telegram’s nearly 900 million users. DeFiLlama data shows that TON’s total value locked exceeds $400 million.  In April, Tether expanded to TON to boost peer-to-peer payments on Telegram. Recently the total authorized USDT on TON hit $1 billion. While Telegram and TON aren’t formerly affiliated, the two share an ecosystem.  ""The surge of the TON ecosystem represents the biggest growth opportunity in the cryptocurrency market this year and in the next three-to-five years,” Forest Bai, co-founder and CEO of Foresight Ventures, said in a release.

42417219,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHrx,1726657200,"Ethereum Devs Poised to Split Blockchain's Next Big Upgrade, 'Pectra,' in Two","It's only been six months since Ethereum, the dominant smart-contract blockchain, had its last major upgrade. But there are so many developer priorities for what to tackle next that there's a growing realization they can't all happen at once.  So now, Ethereum developers are considering dividing the highly anticipated Pectra upgrade into two parts.  Pectra was on track to be Ethereum’s biggest hard fork to date. (A hard fork, in this case, is the technical blockchain term for the software upgrade.), But some developers argue that the entire package of new features has become unwieldy, and they have expressed a desire to split it due to its complexities, and the risk of doing too much, too fast.  During an All Core Developers call last week, Ethereum developers started to play with the idea that splitting the hard fork into two might be feasible.  EF DevOps Engineer Parithosh Jayanthi, who was one of the core developers pushing to split Pectra, told CoinDesk over Telegram that “we’re talking about splitting it into two forks, mainly to reduce the risk of a bug and to enable faster shipping of both forks.”  According to a report by Christine Kim, vice president of research at Galaxy Digital, the first part of Pectra would include Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) including EIP-7702, which aims to improve wallets – famously scribbled by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in 22 minutes. The second part would see EIPs aimed at upgrading Ethereum’s Virtual Machine, known as EOF.  On Thursday, Ethereum developers will decide in their upcoming All Core Developers Consensus layer call if Pectra will be split into two forks.  Possible downside  If developers agree on the split, the first package could come in 2025, as early as February.  Ethereum developers haven’t disagreed much with the potential of splitting the fork, though EF researcher Ansgar Dietrichs toldCoinDesk that one downside would be pushing EIP-7594, or PeerDAS, to the second package. PeerDAS aims to improve data availability on Ethereum, and with the delay in the feature going live, there might be slightly higher fees for layer-2 blockchains for the time being.  “PeerDAS is crucial to make sure L2s have more room for future throughput growth, so the sooner we ship it, the more certain we can be that we can support whatever throughput L2s might need over the next year,” Dietrichs told CoinDesk. “For now, we still have some room to go even before PeerDAS. So hopefully it won’t matter at all. Worst case, L2s will have slightly higher fees again for a few months while we wait for the second half of the Pectra fork.”  Dietrichs said that, ""Ultimately, I think a split is likely still the right decision.”  “I think everyone agrees that it's a really big fork, so a natural thing to do is just to break it into two,” said EF Researcher Alex Stokes on last week’s call, according to Kim’s report. “Generally, smaller forks are less risky.”  Read more: Ethereum Set for Overhaul of Crucial Programming Standard With 'EVM Object Format'",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | RESEARCH | FORKS,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/18/ethereum-devs-poised-to-split-blockchains-next-big-upgrade-pectra-in-two,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/52c71633671add5ee50ac715f2f835e76bab1353-1920x1081.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33716956,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642742,1726655416,Here’s What Dogecoin Whales Are Doing Following The Recovery Above $0.1,"The Dogecoin price recover came as a welcome sight to investors after the meme coin struggled around $0.09 for a while. Naturally, the move in the price has prompted movement among Dogecoin investors and the whales are not left out of this. As the price rebounds, these whales have increased their activity, moving billions of DOGE to and from their wallets. However, the net flow of these whale wallets paint a bearish story for the DOGE price. Dogecoin Whales Move Over $500 Million The large whale transactions tracked by the IntoTheBlock platform are transactions carrying $100,000 or more. These large transactions, although seeing a drawdown from the previous week’s figures, have maintained a reasonably high level. Over the last two days, the average number of whale transactions have come out to 800, showing that interest from the whales remain high. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Enters Stage 3 That Will Trigger 4,500% Rally To $15 While the whale transaction numbers actually saw a decrease between Sunday and Monday, going from 899 transactions to 818 transactions, the number of DOGE moved tell a different story. IntoTheBlock’s data shows that 5.19 billion DOGE were moved on Monday compared to 4.59 billion DOGE on Sunday. In dollar terms, this translates to $522.89 million compared to $499.99 million. Nevertheless, these numbers show an average of $500 million being moved by these whales everyday. As the Dogecoin price continues to recover, the whale transactions could balloon from here as investors move to secure their positions. Where Are The Coins Headed? The net flow data for the large whale wallets can tell us where the whales are moving their DOGE coins. This data tracks the inflow and outflows from the Dogecoin whale wallets, meaning how much is entering the wallets and how many coins are leaving. As a result, it can show if these whales are buying or selling at this time. According to the IntoTheBlock data, the inflows into the wallets have declined, while the outflows from these large wallets have risen over the last few days. Inflows dropped from 37.4 million DOGE on Sunday to only 115.11 million DOGE on Monday. This shows that the Dogecoin whales have not been buying as much DOGE during this time. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 In the same vein, outflows also surged from 18.37 million DOGE on Sunday to 107.71 million DOGE on Monday. This outflow trend suggests that Dogecoin whales are selling rather than buying. It explains the selling pressure on the coin over the last few days, making it hard to reclaim $0.1. However, net flow data, which shows the average of inflows and outflows, has remained almost flat. Nevertheless, the majority of Dogecoin holders look to be in it for the long term as 3.93 million addresses have held their DOGE coins for more than one year. 2.2 million addresses have been holding for between 1 and 12 months. This leaves only 113,660 addresses that have been holding for less than one month.

42417237,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXI4L,1726653987,Australia to Prioritize Wholesale CBDC Over Retail,"Australia's central bank said it will focus on a wholesale central bank digital currency.  A wholesale CBDC offers more promising benefits and fewer challenges than a retail version, Brad Jones, an assistant governor, said.  The Reserve Bank of Australia said it will prioritize work on a wholesale central bank digital currency over a retail version.  A wholesale CBDC is a digital token issued by central banks for use by banks and financial institutions, whereas a retail version is aimed at consumers and everyday transactions. Countries around the world have been examining CBDCs, the Bank for International Settlements found, including all of the G20 nations.  ""The RBA is making a strategic commitment to prioritise its work agenda on wholesale digital money and infrastructure – including wholesale CBDC,"" Brad Jones, assistant governor for the financial system, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""At the present time, we assess the potential benefits as more promising, and the challenges less problematic, for wholesale CBDC compared to a retail CBDC.""  Australia has been exploring the CBDC use cases for several years. In a Wednesday report, the central bank said it hadn't been able to identify a clear public benefit for a retail CBDC because citizens are well served by the current retail payments system.  ""Nonetheless, the RBA and Treasury remain open to the possibility that this assessment could change over time as potential benefits and costs are better understood, both internationally and in a domestic context,"" the statement said.  The country is committing to a three-year applied research program on the future of digital money in Australia. Next month, the central bank will launch the public phase of Project Acacia, which will explore opportunities to improve wholesale markets using central bank money through tokenization and new settlement infrastructure, the report said.  ""Our most immediate priority is to launch a new project with industry on wholesale CBDC and tokenized commercial bank deposits,"" Jones said in a speech. ""The focus will be on understanding how new ledger arrangements and concepts like ‘programmability’ and ‘atomic settlement’ in tokenised markets could unlock benefits for the Australian financial system and wider economy.""  The RBA and Treasury will also undertake some form of public engagement on retail CBDC in 2025 and carry out further research and experimentation in the coming years. A further paper from the RBA and Treasury will be released in 2027 that will examine the merits and potential form of a retail CBDC.",NEUTRAL,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | WALLET | RESEARCH,Camomile Shumba,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/09/18/australia-to-prioritise-wholesale-cbdc-over-retail,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c30252aca48682ad96e00009e7aa03d8c7a6d52e-7155x4025.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33714827,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642622,1726650030,Bitcoin Toughest Time Over: Why Q4 Could Be A Game-Changer,"An analyst has explained how the worst could be behind for Bitcoin, and Q4 may bring back bullish momentum if history is anything to go by. Q3 Has Historically Been The Worst Time For Bitcoin Investors In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards talked about how investors are going through the worst time for Bitcoin. Below is the table cited by the analyst, which breaks down the quarterly returns the cryptocurrency has seen throughout its history. As is visible, the third quarter of the year has generally been the worst time for Bitcoin throughout history, with average returns for the month standing at +5% and median ones at -4% For perspective, the second-worst performing quarter tends to be Q2, but its average and median returns of +27% and +7%, respectively, are still significantly better than Q3’s. Related Reading: Altcoin Watch: Mega Whales Are Taking These Alts Off Exchanges On the other side of the spectrum is Q4, the next quarter of the current year. Bitcoin has had its best periods this quarter, with average and median returns at +89% and +57%, respectively. “If you are still here, congratulations. You made it through the worst time to be in Bitcoin,” says Edwards in the post about BTC traders. “The best lies ahead.” Last year, the cryptocurrency enjoyed an uplift of almost 57% in this period. With Q3 fast approaching a close, it remains to be seen how the BTC price ends up performing in Q4 this time around. Speaking of historical patterns, on-chain analyst Checkmate discussed how the daily price performance distribution has looked across bear and bull markets in an X post. Here is the chart shared by the analyst: As displayed in the above graph, around 28% of bear market days have seen the asset trend higher than +1%, while about 38% have seen it decline by more than -1%. The remaining 34% of the days have seen the cryptocurrency remain within +1% to -1% of the previous day. During bullish periods, Bitcoin has spent 33% of the days witnessing a rise of more than +1%, while 26% registering a drop of over -1%. The asset has consolidated for the remaining 41%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Succumb To Fear As BTC Erases $60,000 Weekend Recovery The symmetry between the three types of days is interesting, but what stands out is how the distributions are almost the same between bear and bull markets. “Day traders are attempting to beat a three-sided coin, with a third of all days rallying, a third selling-off, and a third doing nothing,” notes Checkmate. BTC Price Bitcoin has shown a sudden burst of bullish momentum during the last 24 hours as its price has jumped more than 5%, reaching the $60,900 level.

Bitwise noted that the majority of stablecoins are issued on the Ethereum blockchain and more than 60% of all DeFi assets are locked on the network.  Ethereum is like the Microsoft of blockchains, the asset manager said.  Ether {{ETH}}, the second-largest cryptocurrency, seems to be liked by nobody right now, but the native token of the Ethereum blockchain's underperformance could reverse as the year draws to a close, Bitwise said in a report on Tuesday.  The asset manager noted that year-to-date ether is little changed, while bitcoin {{BTC}} is up 38% and Solana's sol {{SOL}} has risen 31%.  Ether's recent underperformance stems from risk related to November's U.S. presidential election, rising competition from Solana and other blockchains, challenged tokenomics and a mixed response to the introduction of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S., the report said.  Still, it's not all doom and gloom. The majority of stablecoins are issued on Ethereum, more than 60% of all decentralized finance (DeFi) assets are locked on the blockchain and the popular prediction market Polymarket also settles on the layer-1 chain, Bitwise noted.

""It's like the Microsoft (MSFT) of blockchains,"" Hougan wrote. Everyone wants to talk about about newer companies and their game-changing tech such as Google (GOOG), Slack (WORK) and Zoom (ZM), ""but Microsoft is still larger than all of them put together.""

Recently, data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed that the asset has recently exhibited a surge in transaction activity. For context, a rise in a crypto asset’s transaction activity typically indicates increased use and interest in that asset. In the case of Dogecoin, this can suggest higher demand, more user engagement, or growing adoption for DOGE. This heightened activity sometimes precedes major price movements, signaling potential market sentiment or liquidity changes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaking Out Of Monthly Downtrend: Can DOGE Reach $12? How High Is Dogecoin Transaction Rising? According to IntoTheBlock, Dogecoin processed 1.93 million transactions last week alone. This figure marks the highest weekly transaction count since early July, suggesting renewed interest and activity within the Dogecoin network. Although this rise in transaction activity is still below the peak observed in February, it indicates a positive trend that could potentially impact Dogecoin’s market performance. IntoTheBlock noted, “This uptick is a promising sign for the DOGE network.” So far, this increased transaction activity seems to have already translated into a positive price movement for the asset. Dogecoin has seen a 2.3% increase in the past day, reaching a trading price of $0.1015. This is a notable rebound compared to its price earlier this month when DOGE was trading at $0.09. Interestingly, while the rise in price performance has also boosted DOGE’s market cap, currently at $14.8 billion, the same can’t be said for the asset’s daily trading volume. Despite the price increase, DOGE’s daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend in recent days, plunging from more than $700 million last week to below $500 million. Regardless, the rise in transaction activity and price suggests a possible shift in market sentiment toward Dogecoin. This renewed activity could signal a resurgence in market interest, possibly laying the groundwork for further price gains shortly. Key Resistance Level to Watch Despite the ongoing positive indicators, Dogecoin faces a crucial test ahead. Prominent crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted in a post on X a key resistance level at $0.11 for Dogecoin, where approximately 23,400 addresses are holding around 31 billion DOGE. This level is significant as it represents a considerable concentration of holders who could potentially impact the asset’s price movement. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Trims Gains, Can This Key Support Hold Losses? According to Ali’s post, should Dogecoin break through this resistance, it could open the door for further upward momentum. However, if it fails to breach this level, it may indicate a period of consolidation or even a possible pullback.

42417215,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHnp,1726645872,"Fed Rate Cut Could Crash Crypto Markets, but Era of Central Banks Is Over: Arthur Hayes","The era of central banks is over, Hayes said ahead of an expected Fed rate cut Wednesday.  Ethena's USDe and Pendle's BTC staking could benefit from the impending low interest rate regime, Hayes said.  Demand for tokenized Treasuries, an interest-rate-sensitive product, could weaken if interest rates remain low.  Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer of Maelstrom and co-founder of BitMEX, has made a bold statement that risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, could crash a few days after the first Fed rate cut, which is expected to be announced on Wednesday.  The Fed is expected to announce its first rate cut since 2020 later today, kicking off the so-called liquidity easing cycle that has historically boded well for bitcoin {{BTC}}.  The impending rate cut, however, would add to the inflation problem and lead to yen (JPY) strength, causing broad-based risk aversion, Hayes explained in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk on the sidelines of the Token2049 conference in Singapore.  ""The rate cut is a bad idea because inflation is still an issue in the U.S., with the government being the biggest contributor to the sticky price pressures. If you make borrowing cheaper, it adds to inflation,"" Hayes said.  ""The second reason is that the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan narrows with rate cuts. That could lead to sharp appreciation in the yen and trigger unwinding of the yen carry trades,"" Hayes added.  Markets got a taste of the destabilizing effect of the yen's strength and the resulting unwinding of the yen carry trades in early August after the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark borrowing cost to 0.25% from zero. Bitcoin fell from roughly $64,000 to $50,000 within a week, CoinDesk data show.  USD/JPY is the only thing that matters in the short-term, Hayes said.  Most analysts expect the BOJ to increase rates further in the coming months as the Fed takes the other route. The divergent policy paths mean the yen could rally further, forcing investors to square off long positions in risk assets financed by the JPY-denominated loans.  Hayes sees interest rates in the U.S. falling all the way back to near-zero levels from the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%.  ""The initial reaction is going to be negative and the central bank's response will be to do even more [cuts] to stem the crisis. So, I think that cutting rates is a bad idea, but they're going to do it anyway, and so they're going to go to zero quickly,"" Hayes explained.  Ether bull run ahead  Near zero interest rates mean investors could look for yield elsewhere again, reigniting bull run in yield-bearing pockets of the crypto market like ether, Ethena's USDe and Pendle's BTC staking.  Ether {{ETH}}, which offers annualized staking yield of 4%, would eventually benefit from ultra-low rates.  Ethena's USDe, which uses BTC and ETH as backing assets, combining them with equal-value short perpetual futures positions to generate yield, and DeFi platform Pendle's BTC staking, which, as of last week, offering a floating yield of 45% stands to benefit as well, Hayes explained.  Meanwhile, demand for tokenized Treasuries, an interest-rate-sensitive product, could weaken.  The era of central banks is over  Over the past couple of years, Scottish market strategist Russel Napier has repeatedly said that advanced nation governments, focused on bringing down debt-to-GDP ratios, have taken control of the money supply, and central banks are fast becoming irrelevant.  Per Napier, governments will resort to targeted liquidity creations in sectors like manufacturing and re-industrialization while keeping inflation elevated.  Hayes believes the same and sees it as a positive development for the crypto market. Maelstrom is a crypto investment fund managed by the family office of Arthur Hayes.  ""I 100% agree with that prognosis. The era of central banks is over. The politicians are going to take over and tell banks to create liquidity in specific sectors of the economy,"" Hayes quipped.  ""So you're going to see soft and hard capital controls in different locations, which means that, crypto is the only asset that you can own that's globally portable and gets you out of that system,"" Hayes added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/18/fed-rate-cut-could-crash-crypto-markets-but-era-of-central-banks-is-over-arthur-hayes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1e19fea6516e0d2982a4f8b19325d1f78411ff1-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

33712322,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24164,1726643437,Bitfinex Alpha 122 | BTC có nguy cơ gia tăng biến động khi lãi suất dự kiến giảm 25 điểm cơ bản,"Tải full alpha Bitcoin vừa có màn lội ngược dòng ngoạn mục, tăng hơn 15% từ đáy 52.756 đô la, nhờ dòng tiền đổ vào ETF Bitcoin tăng vọt. Tuần qua, ETF BTC ghi nhận dòng vốn ròng 403,9 triệu đô la, đảo chiều sau thời gian dài bị rút vốn, cho thấy niềm tin của nhà đầu tư đang quay trở lại. Đợt tăng giá này chủ yếu do “cá mập” mua vào mạnh trên thị trường giao ngay. Trong khi đó, thị trường tương lai và thị trường vĩnh cửu lại khá “ì ạch”, chứng tỏ đà tăng hiện tại đến từ dòng vốn thật, không phải đòn bẩy đầu cơ, tạo nền tảng vững chắc hơn. Tuy nhiên, BTC đang đối mặt với ngưỡng kháng cự “cứng đầu” từ 60.500 đến 61.000 đô la, vốn là “chốt chặn” quan trọng từ đầu tháng 3. Dù dòng vốn vào ETF vẫn mạnh, nhưng có dấu hiệu chững lại khi CVD giao ngay – thước đo chênh lệch giữa lệnh mua và bán – đã đi ngang trong cuối tuần. Tuần này, thị trường có thể “dập dìu” vì nhà đầu tư đang hồi hộp chờ quyết định cắt giảm lãi suất của Fed. Dù cắt 25 hay 50 điểm cơ bản, nó đều có thể khiến thị trường “lên mây” hoặc “xuống vực”. Mối tương quan giữa Bitcoin và cổ phiếu cũng đang tăng lên, cho thấy biến động trên thị trường tài chính truyền thống có thể ảnh hưởng nhiều hơn đến giá Bitcoin. Bitcoin cũng đã “chia tay” với vàng, vốn vừa đạt đỉnh lịch sử vào tuần trước , cho thấy nhà đầu tư đang chuyển hướng sang tài sản trú ẩn an toàn truyền thống trong bối cảnh ngại rủi ro. Nhìn chung, giá tài sản vẫn bị chi phối bởi triển vọng lạm phát, vốn đã hạ nhiệt hơn vào tháng 8, với CPI chỉ tăng 0,2% trong tháng và 2,5% so với cùng kỳ năm ngoái, chủ yếu do giá năng lượng, ô tô cũ và xăng dầu giảm mạnh. Lạm phát có phần “cứng đầu” hơn , khiến Fed có thể thận trọng hơn về việc cắt giảm lãi suất, và chúng tôi dự đoán mức cắt giảm sẽ là 25 điểm cơ bản, thay vì 50 điểm cơ bản như nhiều người kỳ vọng. Tình hình này diễn ra trong bối cảnh thị trường lao động đang hạ nhiệt , với số đơn xin trợ cấp thất nghiệp ổn định, cho thấy nền kinh tế đang giảm tốc nhưng chưa đến mức đáng lo ngại. Bối cảnh lạm phát vừa phải và thị trường lao động ổn định này củng cố sự cần thiết để Fed hành động trước với việc cắt giảm lãi suất, thận trọng nới lỏng chính sách. Tâm lý người tiêu dùng cũng được cải thiện , thể hiện qua Chỉ số Tâm lý Người tiêu dùng của Đại học Michigan đạt mức cao nhất trong bốn tháng, phản ánh sự lạc quan nhờ lạm phát giảm và sức mua tăng. Khi Fed cân nhắc bước đi tiếp theo, cán cân rủi ro đang nghiêng về phía bảo vệ việc làm, khuyến khích đầu tư kinh doanh và mở khóa dòng tiền. Tin tức tiền điện tử nổi bật tuần trước là động thái quan trọng từ Vương quốc Anh khi giới thiệu dự luật tiên phong công nhận tài sản kỹ thuật số là tài sản cá nhân, theo luật pháp Anh. Sự phát triển này khẳng định vị thế dẫn đầu của Vương quốc Anh trong luật pháp về tiền điện tử toàn cầu. Ngược lại, cuộc tranh luận giữa các ứng cử viên tổng thống đã khiến nhiều người trong cộng đồng tiền điện tử thất vọng, vì nó không đề cập đến bất kỳ vấn đề nào liên quan đến thuế hoặc quy định của thị trường tiền điện tử. Và đó là Bitfinex Alpha 122. Chúc bạn một tuần giao dịch xanh nhé! Đừng quên theo dõi cộng đồng Bitfinex Vietnam tại Telegram , Twitter & Facebook để cập nhập các sự kiện và thông tin sớm nhất nhé!

42417223,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXHw5,1726642174,Bitcoin Holds Above $60K as Traders Warn of Sell-Off on 50 Basis Point Fed Rate Cut,"Bitcoin is trading above $60,000 as traders await announcements from the FOMC  The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of market performance, is up 1.1%  Bitcoin {{BTC}} held above $60,000 early Wednesday, after a brief tumble below the level in late U.S. hours, as traders around the globe await a U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting where chair Jerome Powell is widely expected to announce rate cuts.  BTC traded just over $60,300 at press time, up nearly 4% in the past 24 hours to extend weekly gains over 7%. Major tokens showed mixed movements, with ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain’s BNB and dogecoin {{DOGE}} rising under 1% and xrp {{XRP}}, Cardano’s ADA and Toncoin (TON) showing slight losses.  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens, rose 1.1%.  The FOMC is expected to release its statement and interest rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time later Wednesday. A pivot to lower borrowing costs has historically buoyed bullish sentiment among traders as cheap access to money spurts growth in riskier sectors.  Fed funds data shows traders pricing in a 67% chance of a cut that will bring rates in the 4.5%-5% range from the current two-decade high between 5.25% and 5.5%. A larger cut would see rates drop by half a percentage point, instead of the traditional quarter-point cut.  Traders on Polymarket are split between the possibility of a 100 basis points (bps) and 125 bps cut, giving both scenarios a 31% chance of happening.  However, some say a 50 bps cut could trigger a sell-off as it signals a worrying sign for the economy.  “The size of the rate cut matters because it could lead to different market reactions. While a 25 bps cut would likely boost markets, a 50 bps cut might signal recession concerns, potentially triggering a deeper correction in risk assets,” said Alice Liu, research lead at CoinMarketCap, in an email to CoinDesk.  ""If the rate cut is seen as a response to weakening economic conditions, it could raise concerns about future earnings growth, potentially leading to a short-term pullback in BTC and other crypto assets,” Liu said, adding that Q4 could bring a shift toward more stability after the U.S. elections.  “Historically, Q4 has often been a strong period for Bitcoin, and on average BTC has yielded 90.33% price increase in Q4 for the past 10 years,” she noted.  Speaking to Bloomberg at the Token 2049 conference in Singapore, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci predicts bitcoin will hit a record high on rate cuts and more clear rules in the U.S. around crypto. Scaramucci foresees the possibility of a 150 bps rate cut at the next Fed meeting.  Elsewhere in crypto, Sui is up over 7% based on continued positive market sentiment from USDC being launched on the platform as well as Circle enabling its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), which allows for cross-chain flows on Sui.

33711126,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642680,1726641027,"XRP To Have ‘The Mother’ Of All Bull Runs, Analyst Sets Double-Digit Target","The recent XRP price action has sparked a broader bullish sentiment among crypto investors and analysts. The cryptocurrency’s 10% surge in the last week has driven the price above levels not seen in nearly a month, continuing its green performance in most long-term timeframes. As a result, some market watchers have set their bullish targets for the cryptocurrency, claiming that the multi-year consolidation is coming soon to an end. Related Reading: LayerZero Surges over 7% As Bulls Ignite Fresh Rally, A $4.5 Breakout Looms? XRP To Reclaim $0.75? XRP’s price suffered a massive drop when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed its lawsuit against Ripple nearly four years ago. The SEC claimed that the company had illegally sold the cryptocurrency as an “unregistered security.” The crypto crackdown drove investors away from the token as uncertainty about the token’s status and the lawsuit’s resolution grew. However, Ripple’s victory against the SEC has sparked a bullish sentiment among users, reflecting on its recent price action. Investor and analyst CredibleCrypto deemed that XRP’s trajectory to a new all-time high (ATH) is a matter of “when” and not “if” after the court’s ruling. The analyst noted that the cryptocurrency has moved between the $0.40-$0.75 price range since March’s highs, only registering a “deviation” from this level in July. According to the investor, the deviation “forcibly pushed below the range low to trick breakout traders into buying/selling before price moves right back into the range and heads in the opposite direction.” Following the August ruling, the token has hovered between the $0.55 to $0.64 mid-range level but recently registered another “deviation” during the early September market retrace. This could suggest that XRP’s price is poised to retest the accumulation’s upper level. To the analyst, the token will retest the $0.75 resistance level before kickstarting its massive bull run. However, he noted that this scenario will likely only play out if Bitcoin (BTC) bounces to the $61,000-$62,000 price zone “relatively soon.” A Massive Breakout Eyes Double-Digits Credible Crypto also highlighted that XRP displays “The Mother” of all bullish patterns in the longer timeframes. Per the post, the token seemingly exhibits a multi-year bullish pennant pattern that could lead to a breakout. To the analyst, this “near 7-year compression will be coming to an end soon,” which could result in a “legendary” rally for the cryptocurrency. Moreover, he added that the breakout’s possible targets will surpass the $3.4 mark as it is set to make a new ATH at a “minimum.” After that goal, the trader stated that investors would be “looking at double digits” for the next targets. Similarly, Crypto Trader Mikybull noted XRP’s bullish pattern, asserting that it displays “one of the most bullish macro charts out there.” Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Consolidates: Time for a Fresh Comeback? Another analyst also suggested that XRP will be one of the top performers during the upcoming bull run. As October approaches, Charlie.eth considers that a “significant recovery seems likely,” which could lead to the mid-term target of $2.5 before aiming for a long-term target between the $10-$12 mark. At the time of writing, XRP’s price registers a 4% surge in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.58. The cryptocurrency also saw a 13.6% increase in its daily market activity, reaching a daily trading volume of $1.29 billion.

42417236,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTXI3J,1726636958,BitGo to Enter Stablecoin Market With Reward-Bearing USDS Coin,"BitGo says it is launching a stablecoin in January 2025  Called USDS this stablecoin will provide rewards to the institutions which power its liquidity.  SINGAPORE — BitGo plans to introduce a dollar-backed stablecoin next year, differentiating itself in a crowded market by offering rewards to institutions that provide liquidity to the network, the crypto custody firm announced at Token2049 in Singapore.  The stablecoin, dubbed USDS, will be backed by short-duration Treasury bills, overnight repos, and cash, like others on the market. It will be what BitGo calls the first open-participation stablecoin.  ""The main reason for launching USDS is that, while existing stablecoins serve a good function, we see an opportunity to create a more open and fair system that promotes innovation and, most importantly, rewards those who build the network,” CEO Mike Belshe said in an interview with CoinDesk before his keynote at Token2049. “A stablecoin’s true value comes from the people using it, the liquidity they provide, and the access points for interchange.""  A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset class, such as a fiat currency or gold, to stabilize its price. They are used widely in crypto trading and provide most of the liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi).  The biggest are tied to the U.S. dollar, a market that's dominated by Tether's USDT, with a market cap of about $119 billion. The No. 2, Circle's USDC, is about a third of the size.  BitGo's offering will differ from its rivals with its rewards-based approach, which incentivizes institutions that are providing liquidity to the USDS network by distributing a portion of the returns generated from its reserves.  “At the end of each month, we generate some return from the cash being held in the underlying fund, and we will pass it back to the participants on a pro-rata basis, based on their custody of the asset,"" Belshe said.  While this might sound like it is treading dangerously close to being a dividend and thus classifying the whole operation as an investment contract, Belshe says the difference lies in that it's not distributing the proceeds to the end user, but rather to the institutions providing the liquidity.  Other stablecoins have tried creating yield-bearing stablecoins and rewarding end users. But as a compromise, they've needed to exclude the U.S. from the available markets.  ""You end up with either the folks that opt into only the U.S. market, and then the folks that opt into only the non-U.S. market, like Mountain Protocol or Lift Dollar out of Dubai. They can't sell in the United States because they are a security,” he said.  BitGo plans to list USDS on all major exchanges and is targeting $10 billion in assets held within the stablecoin by this time next year.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/18/bitgo-to-enter-stablecoin-market-with-reward-bearing-usds-coin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eaaaffcb3095caf466d217c80468a6dfe1ede59c-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the crypto appears to be in a transitional phase, according to a CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym CryptoHell. CryptoHell has recently shared insights into Bitcoin’s current market cycle, providing investors with key indicators to watch during this period. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Heading For A Bear Market? Analysts Weigh In On The Price Struggles Understanding The Bitcoin Bull-Bear Transition Phase In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, CryptoHell revealed that Bitcoin’s bull-bear market cycle indicator from CryptoQuant has been a “reliable tool” for mapping out the crypto’s recurring trends. The analyst explained that the cycle alternates between overbought phases, termed “Overheated Bull,” and oversold phases, referred to as “Extreme Bear.” Adding more context, CryptoHell elaborated: The bull-bear market cycle indicator from CryptoQuant illustrates the recurring cycles of Bitcoin over recent years, highlighting movements between overbought phases (Overheated Bull) and oversold phases (Extreme Bear). Each bull market phase is followed by a bear market, demonstrating how market volatility and sentiment heavily influence Bitcoin’s price. The analyst added that as of 2024, Bitcoin is in a “transitional phase” as it shows signs of recovery from the previous bear market. However, the analyst stresses that it is unclear whether Bitcoin is poised to enter a full-blown bull market. Is Bearishness Over? Meanwhile, in another QuickTake post, CryptoHell highlighted an interesting point concerning Bitcoin, mentioning that although there appears to still be short-term selling pressure in Bitcoin, as data shows, some fundamental indicators present relatively positive signs for the Bitcoin market. For instance, selling pressure from miners and long-term holders remains low, suggesting that these market participants are not contributing significantly to the current volatility. Howvever, sentiment from institutional investors and the broader US market appear weak. This indicates that the overall mood among larger investors is not overly bullish at this stage. CryptoHell highlighted that technical indicators further support the notion of a potential short-term peak. The Stochastic indicator, known for identifying overbought and oversold conditions, points toward an overbought state, hinting at the possibility of a market correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price at Risk of Further Downside: Will Bears Tighten Grip? According to the analyst, volatility may continue as the market finds its footing, adding: Investors should remain cautious, as profit-taking and selling pressure are evident from several sources. However, there is still potential for a longer-term bullish trend if selling pressure eases and market sentiment improves.

33707316,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=642721,1726632037,Triple Bottom Formation: Is Ethereum Set For Major Upswing In Q4?,"The cryptocurrency market, led by the largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), surged on Tuesday to levels not seen in over a month in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) imminent announcement of its first interest rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite these expectations or what the outcome of the Fed’s announcement could have on the market, on Bitcoin Halving years, the fourth quarter (Q4) is usually significantly bullish for the two largest digital assets and the broader market. Exploring The Ethereum Price Performance Post-Bitcoin Halving Interestingly, Ethereum’s performance following past Bitcoin Halving events has displayed notable variations. Data reveals that in the year following the 2016 Halving, Ethereum experienced a 45% drawdown before embarking on a notable rally that culminated in a 3,400% increase. Similarly, after the 2020 Halving, ETH surged by 150% before rocketing to a 2,150% gain. However, since the latest Halving in April, ETH has mirrored Bitcoin’s volatility, encountering notable price fluctuations and establishing lower support levels. Related Reading: Altcoin Watch: Mega Whales Are Taking These Alts Off Exchanges The recent month has not been kind to Ethereum, marked by two significant crashes. On August 5, ETH retraced over 25%, plummeting to a six-month low of $2,110. The downward trend continued into September, with increased selling pressure leading to a drop from $2,800 to approximately $2,150 in just one week. Despite these challenges, analyst CryptoBullet remains optimistic about Q4’s potential for a turnaround. Notably, the analyst identified a “triple bottom” formation on the ETH/USDT daily chart see in the image below, reminiscent of price action observed in 2021. This pattern suggests that Ethereum may be poised for a rebound similar to that seen in 2021, when it surged from around $1,650 to its all-time high of $4,730. Yet, currently trading at approximately $2,330, Ethereum sits over 52% below its previous all-time high. ETH Price Analysis Predicting further price volatility for ETH on Wednesday ahead of the upcoming Fed rate cut, there are key levels to monitor. In the past week, ETH has established the $2,260 mark as a significant support level. This price point is crucial, as it could act as a buffer against a further decline toward $2,200 or even a retest of the next major support at $2,100. On the upside, the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) is currently positioned at $2,350, serving as a formidable barrier for Ethereum. This resistance level has been preventing the cryptocurrency from retesting the $2,400 mark in the near term. Related Reading: Analyst Identifies $0.75 As Most Crucial Target For XRP Price In The Campaign For $1 Should ETH manage to break above these resistance levels, bullish investors will set their sights on the next major resistance at $2,520. Just above this level lies another critical hurdle at $2,620, where the 200-day EMA is situated. This level has not been surpassed since July of this year, when Ethereum’s price fell below it, initiating the current downtrend.

Animoca has been looking at Hong Kong or the Middle East for the IPO but Hong Kong is where Animoca is headquartered.  Singapore – Animoca Brands is hoping to go public soon, but the final decision on the timeline is dependent on a key component, the ""market’s status, amongst other"" aspects, the Web3 giant’s chairman Yat Siu told CoinDesk in Singapore on Monday.  A major investor in the Web3 space, Animoca's plan to go public became known earlier this year but Siu said we had always wanted to do so.  A report in June said the location would be either Hong Kong or the Middle East.  Siu also appeared to lean toward Hong Kong as a “strong contender” because the company is headquartered in the city, Bloomberg reported.  ""It takes time,"" Siu told CoinDesk, indicating that settling in on a specific timeline was difficult owing to the number of factors involved.  “We are midway through the audit, which is a critical piece of the IPO (initial public offering) puzzle,” Siu told CoinDesk.  Australia’s DFK Collins is Animoca's auditor, Siu confirmed, as he stated the need for an audit is one of many confidence-building measures the market and institutions look for when a firm signals a desire to go public.  Animoca was once a public company in Australia but de-listed in 2020 because of regulatory concerns around crypto.  “It’s maybe not a surprise that our growth grew explosively at the time we were delisted because we were able to do many things that, frankly, we couldn’t do because there were things at the time that the ASX was not comfortable with and didn’t understand,” Siu told the Australian Financial Review in 2022.

According to the recent voting results, the community voted against its plans to extend its Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) grant. Arbitrum Holders Vote Against Synthetix Proposal The goal was to support the launch of Multi-Collateral Perps. The feature would have permitted traders to trade using margin with ETH, BTC, and USDx acting as collateral when initiating perpetual futures on Arbitrum via Synthetix perpetuals. Related Reading: LayerZero Surges over 7% As Bulls Ignite Fresh Rally, A $4.5 Breakout Looms? If the Arbitrum community had agreed, it would have allowed Synthetix to distribute 900,000 ARB as trading fee rebates. According to the Synthetix proposal, they intended to incentivize users and, thus, boost the active trading volume of Synthetix on the layer-2 platform. While novel and a net positive for Synthetix, the ARB community deemed the extension, which would have started from September 16 through November 16, unnecessary. Subsequently, 66% of all ARB votes were against this extension, and 9% supported this proposal. Now that ARB holders have rejected the extension, the launch of the Multi-Collateral Perps feature will face delays. For this reason, Synthetix users on Arbitrum would have to wait longer to trade trustless perpetual with the freedom to use various margin assets. At the same time, there are now reduced incentives to engage. Fewer users will be willing to trade on Arbitrum using Synthetix perpetual without the extension. Accordingly, this would negatively impact the DeFi trading portal. Combining the above, engagement on Arbitrum would be impacted as Synthetix traders, angling for the fee rebates sent from the 900,000 ARB, would withdraw. What’s Next? Will ARB Recover From Record Lows? In the future, it remains to be seen how Synthetix will proceed on Arbitrum, the largest Ethereum layer-2 by trading volume. As it is, the protocol might now have to explore other strategies to incentivize traders and launch the crucial Multi-Collateral Perps feature.

Will A 50bps Cut Spark A Bitcoin Bull Run? According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, markets are currently pricing in a 59% chance of a half-percentage-point rate cut and a 41% chance of a quarter-point cut. There’s an overwhelming expectation that by the end of 2024, the Fed could implement up to 100 basis points in cuts, with nearly 60% odds of 125 basis points. This suggests that investors anticipate at least one or two substantial rate cuts in the three remaining Fed meetings of the year, starting with this week’s announcement. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Competitor FLOKI Forms Falling Wedge That Could Trigger 54% Breakout The potential effects of a 50 basis point cut remain hotly debated within the crypto industry. Market expert Crypto Rover argues that such a cut could reignite a bull run for Bitcoin, stating that the conditions could lead to “super bullish” prospects. Similarly, analyst Lark Davis recalls how Bitcoin previously surged following past rate cuts, predicting that if history repeats, the next 6-12 months could see significant price increases for the largest cryptocurrency on the market. Optimism Vs Historical Caution In Crypto Market In addition to optimism and bullish expectations, other analysts express caution. EmperorBTC predicts an initial market pump following the rate cut, driven by cheaper borrowing costs. However, the analyst warns of profit-taking by short-term holders leading to a subsequent market dump, suggesting a “sell the news” scenario that could leave many investors disillusioned before the market stabilizes and resumes growth. On the other hand, technical analyst Justin Bennett offers a more cautionary historical perspective. He points to the market’s performance during the Fed’s rate cuts in 2007, when the Nasdaq 100 Index retraced significantly after the initial cuts, suggesting that the same pattern could emerge in 2023. Bennett’s analysis suggests that current market conditions may mirror previous downturns, calling into question the optimistic projections shared by some for the broader digital asset market.

In a similar vein, NewsBTC reported on Monday the analysis of crypto strategist Doctor Profit, in which he highlights a divided sentiment in the market regarding the rate cut, with equal chances of a 0.25% or 0.50% reduction. However, the analyst is leaning towards the larger cut, arguing that failure to take decisive action could lead to turmoil reminiscent of “Blood Monday” on August 5, when Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline to $48,900. Despite the divided sentiment in the market, Bitcoin has jumped from the $57,000 mark traded on Monday to a current price of $61,000, recording a surge of nearly 6% in a matter of hours in anticipation of tomorrow’s announcements.

This projected price increase is set to offer dedicated investors and holders a small window of opportunity to make gains from the popular altcoin. Cardano (ADA) Set Sights On $15 Price Surge Crypto analyst, Remi Benays has announced on X (formerly Twitter) that Cardano is at a crucial stage of this market cycle, characterized by potential price rallies to new all-time highs around $15. Sharing a historical price chart of Cardano, Benays highlighted a unique recurring bullish pattern in the cryptocurrency’s movements from 2018 till date. Related Reading: Binance Top Traders Go Short On Bitcoin At $60,000, What’s Going On? The analyst noted that from 2018 to 2021, Cardano experienced a period of severe price decline, followed by a period of consolidation, a fake bounce and ultimately a dramatic price surge. To be more precise, the cryptocurrency crashed by 98% between 2018 and 2019, then experienced a ghost chain fake bounce around 2020 and early 2021, and then exploded with an astonishing 18,000% gain after the Bitcoin halving event in 2020. Benays has identified a similar trend from 2021 to 2024. The analyst disclosed in his chart that ADA was down by a whopping 92% in 2023, before experiencing a double fake bounce around April 2024. Considering Bitcoin concluded its halving event on April 20 this year, the analyst foresees a mega pump to $15 for ADA by 2025. This substantial price increase would push ADA’s market capitalization to $500 billion from its current value of $11.9 billion. Moreover, it would represent a massive price rally of over 4,500% for the altcoin. While some may consider Benays $15 ADA forecast as overly ambitious, the analyst has envisioned an even more bullish scenario. He expects ADA to continue rising from his initial target of $15 to $31 by 2026. A rally to this substantial price level would place Cardano’s market capitalization at $1 trillion, exceeding the combined valuations of Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH). Analyst Offers More Conservative XRP Price Forecast Taking a more conservative approach, crypto analyst Sssebi has predicted a 20X to 30X rally for Cardano in the next 12 months. The analyst disclosed that Cardano is “exactly where it was last cycle around this time,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for a significant rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin At $0.1 Is A ‘Gift’, Falling Wedge Breaking Bullish To Send Price To $0.2 He projected that Cardano could potentially reach a minimum price level of $5 by 2025 and a maximum value of $10 at the top of the bull market. Currently, the price of ADA is trading at $0.33, reflecting a 2.58% decrease over the past week. A jump to $5 or even $10 would require the cryptocurrency to rally by approximately 1,415% and 2,930%, respectively.
