The live auction took place in New York and included pieces from the ""Grails"" collection. In total, there were 37 works from generative artists like Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs, Jeff Davis and more.  Highlights from this lot included Dmitri Cherniak's Ringers #879 (often referred to as ""The Goose"" for its resemblance to the bird), estimated to sell for $2-3 million. After back-and-forth bidding, it ended up selling for $6.2 million to notable NFT investor 6529. In a tweet following the sale, Sotheby's reported it was the second-highest sale of all time for a work of generative art.  3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies had purchased ""The Goose"" in August 2021 for about 1,800 ETH – worth roughly $5.8 million at the time. Michael Bouhanna, Sotheby's head of digital art and NFTs, told CoinDesk that the piece is a major highlight of Cherniak's portfolio and ""one of the most significant works from the generative art movement.""  In a statement, 6529 said that The Goose held cultural significance within the NFT community.  ""On-chain long form generative art is an act of faith by the artist and the minter. Once the algorithm is committed to the blockchain, nobody knows what outputs it will produce. The Goose represents this more clearly than any generative NFT. We could have run the Ringers mint thousands of times without producing anything like it again. The Goose has had a historic journey so far through key moments in NFT history and I suspect its journey has just begun.""  Other highlights included Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza #479, which sold for $622,300, Snowfro's Chromie Squiggle #1780, which sold for $635,000, Larva Labs' Autoglyph #218 and Kjetil Golid's Archetype #397, both of which sold for $330,200 each.Nearly all the NFTs in the auction sold for higher than their estimates.  Last month, Sotheby's began its multi-part sale of NFTs from Three Arrows' extensive NFT collection, formed as part of 3AC's asset portfolio primarily in 2021. The Singapore-based hedge fund filed for bankruptcy in July and its liquidator Teneo has outlined its intention to sell the expansive list of NFTs estimated to be worth millions in order to recoup funds.  In the first Grails auction, Sotheby's said it brought in nearly $2.5 million. Another group of works from the Grails collection was also recently sold privately for a combined total of over $3 million.  So far, the Grails collection liquidation sales have brought in nearly $17 million.  Sotheby's has said that the Grails collection contains ""some of the most significant digital artworks ever assembled.""  ""From groundbreaking works that have transformed the art world to culturally significant pieces, this collection is poised to redefine the way we think about and appreciate digital art,"" the website reads.

To be named the iShares Bitcoin Trust, the fund's assets are to ""consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust,"" according to the filing. That custodian will by crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), said the filing.  CoinDesk earlier on Thursday reported on BlackRock's intention to soon file for a bitcoin ETF.  Though approving a number of futures-based bitcoin ETFs, the SEC has notably rejected other fund management company attempts at opening a spot bitcoin ETF, including those from Grayscale, VanEck, and WisdomTree.  BlackRock, however, may not be as easy for the SEC to turn away. It's the world's largest asset manager with more than $10 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and the company and its CEO Larry Fink has political power to possibly match that of the SEC and its leader Gary Gensler.  ""The proposed ETF is benchmarked against the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate,"" said Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, a subsidiary of crypto exchange Kraken, commenting on the filing.  ""CF Benchmarks takes price data exclusively from cryptocurrency exchanges that adhere to the highest possible standards of market integrity and transparency. This protects investors as products benchmarked against it can then consistently and reliably track the spot price of the underlying asset,"" Chung added.  The move comes at a time when crypto industry is reeling from U.S. regulatory crackdown, which recently saw the SEC suing crypto exchange Coinbase and Binance. The market sentiment, following the filing of the ETF application by a TradFi giant, seem to have gotten a slight boost as the price of bitcoin is gained a bit on the news, rising to just shy of $25,600.  “BlackRock’s increasing engagement shows Bitcoin continues to be an asset of interest for some of the world’s largest financial institutions,” said Chung.

42420244,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaCcv,1686863085,"Bitcoin, Ether Move Toward Oversold Territory in Post FOMC Downturn","The post-FOMC decision performance of BTC and ETH has been lackluster, contrasting to the response in traditional finance.  Both assets have breached the lower range of their Bollinger Bands, while moving into technically oversold territory  Bitcoin and ether declined into oversold territory Thursday, following hawkish comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank halted its 14-month prescription of interest rate hikes.  The degree of hawkishness is open to interpretation, but here’s what we know:  The pause in interest rate hikes and maintenance of the 5.0-5.25% target rate was widely expected, and likely already priced into the market. The following changes from the FOMC’s March projections occurred.  The increase in the projections for Core PCE inflation and the Federal Funds rate are the most alarming.  The market appeared to react that despite recent data indicating progress, inflation remains too high and problematic. Chairman Powell echoed as much in his comments on Wednesday, reiterating a commitment to future monetary tightening, even while emphasizing economic “lags” as justification for the pause.  The analogy is akin to a driver taking their foot off the accelerator slightly, as they round sharp turns, but having no intention of braking, or changing course.  Bollinger Bands breach?  Bitcoin and ether sold off sharply with both assets breaching the lower range of their Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands are a technical tool that tracks an asset’s 20-day moving average and plots two standard deviations above and below.  Because an asset’s price is expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time, a breach of the upper or lower range is viewed as a significant event.  Both assets fell near or into “oversold” territory, as ETH’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell to 29, while BTC’s fell to 35.  RSI ranges from 0-100, with values above 70 indicating that an asset is overbought, and values below 30 implying that the asset is oversold.  Data from 2015 to present shows that BTC’s RSI has settled between 35 and 36 on 42 occasions with an average 30-day performance of -.01%. ETH’s RSI has settled between 29 and 31 on 24 occasions since 2017, with an average 30-day performance of -15% following.  The abrupt move downward runs counter to Thursday’s price action in traditional markets, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite rose 1%, 0.92% and 0.82% respectively, compared to declines in BTC and ETH prices.  The dispersion in performance could be due partly to the additional regulatory overhang impacting crypto markets, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), continues to eye crypto markets.

Bitcoin was recently trading at $25,239, roughly flat over the past 24 hours after spending most of Thursday in negative territory. On Wednesday BTC tumbled below this threshold for the first time since mid-March, according to CoinDesk Indices, as markets recoiled from a recommitment to monetary hawkishness from the Federal Reserve even as the central bank paused interest rate hikes for the first time in 14 months. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap had been traveling closer to $26,000 for weeks.  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was similarly sluggish to recently change hands at about $1,655, also about flat from Wednesday, same time. Similar to BTC, ETH hit a three-month low on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT stablecoin deviated from its $1 dollar peg early Thursday (ET) amid a sell-off on the popular Uniswap and Curve pools. USDT dropped as low as $0.9968, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token was recently trading at $0.999.  Read More: USDT Selling on Curve, Uniswap Spooks Traders Amid Bitcoin Drop  “This has been a very nervous time, with a lot of regulatory concerns now being compounded into concerns about Tether,” Riyad Carey, a research analyst at digital assets data provider Kaiko, wrote to CoinDesk in a Twitter message. “Its depeg this morning has severely rattled markets, given that its dominance has increased significantly in the past few months.”  Carey added: “It was yet another consequence of falling liquidity; a big reason for its depeg was the massive outflow of liquidity from the (Curve) 3pool.”  Among other cryptos with the largest market caps, MATIC, the token of the smart contracts platform Polygon, recently plunged more than 5%. The U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) mentioned MATIC among 19 cryptos in its lawsuits against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase last week. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently down nearly 3%.  Cryptos’ fade over the past two days continued its decoupling path from U.S. equities, which rose on Thursday as investors drew confidence from encouraging economic indicators, including a May retail report showing that consumers had boosted their spending for groceries and electronics, among other categories. The data suggested that the economy was not quickly headed for a feared recession. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 rose 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively.

Bhuvanagiri compared the current market climate to 2019. “Back then, we had big ups and downs within a certain range. Those who had remained on Crypto Twitter were going from slight euphoria to hints of depression, over and again. Then DeFi summer kicked off in 2020, and everything changed.”  He sounded a cautious note about rate hike uncertainties, declining economic growth and potential challenges for the banking sector – a toxic combination that could continue to unsettle crypto markets. “It’s not hard to imagine a scenario in which the markets essentially have to get juiced again,” he wrote. “For most market participants, then, the strategy is likely one of survival until the macro turns and during what will inevitably be a volatile half year or so.”  Read More: Crypto Trading Volumes Drop in Q2 to Yearly Lows",NEGATIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDT,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/15/bitcoin-regains-ground-to-reach-252k-but-investors-remain-jittery-about-us-economy-monetary-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b61069f626fd695dc6ec7e9d53bda84d5c261ce-1714x1056.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The artwork, often referred to as ""The Goose"" for its likeness to the animal, was the top lot during Sotheby's most recent auction of NFTs from the ""Grails"" collection seized from bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The piece was estimated to sell for $2-3 million.  After an energetic bidding war, the sale was met with applause in the room in New York City, as captured in a tweet by Garrett Skrovina:  The collectible was purchased by 3AC co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies in August 2021 for about 1,800 ETH – worth roughly $5.8 million at the time. Michael Bouhanna, Sotheby's head of digital art and NFTs, told CoinDesk that the piece is a major highlight of Cherniak's portfolio and ""one of the most significant works from the generative art movement.""  After back-and-forth bidding, it ended up selling for $6.2 million to notable NFT investor 6529. In a tweet following the sale, Sotheby's reported it was the second-highest sale of all time for a work of generative art.  In a statement, 6529 said that The Goose held cultural significance within the NFT community and is unique in its execution.  ""On-chain long form generative art is an act of faith by the artist and the minter. Once the algorithm is committed to the blockchain, nobody knows what outputs it will produce. The Goose represents this more clearly than any generative NFT. We could have run the Ringers mint thousands of times without producing anything like it again. The Goose has had a historic journey so far through key moments in NFT history and I suspect its journey has just begun.""  In total, there were 37 works for sale at auction from generative artists like Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs, Jeff Davis and more in the sale. Nearly all the NFTs in the auction sold for higher than their estimates.  So far, the Grails collection liquidation sales have brought in nearly $17 million.

In an executive vote concluded Thursday, the MakerDAO community ratified a proposal to increase the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to 3.49% from 1%, providing additional incentive for investors to hold and lend DAI instead of rivals like popular stablecoins such as USDC and USDT.  The decision happened as Maker – led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where MKR token owners can vote on proposals – is undergoing a major transformation, including rearranging the backing assets of the DAI stablecoin. The platform increasingly invests in real-world assets such as short-term U.S. government bonds to boost revenues, redistributing a part of it to users through the DSR.  Read more: Lending Platform MakerDAO Approves ‘Constitution,’ Moves Forward With ‘Endgame’ Plan  Hiking the reward is significant because it resets the baseline interest rate across the DeFi ecosystem, spurring higher yields from lending stablecoins while making leverage more expensive, according to Karpatkey, a treasury management provider to decentralized organizations.  It also underscores Maker’s strategic shift, Karpatkey said, because the proposal includes hiking fees on crypto assets to take out a DAI loan. “Originally a platform for leveraged long traders, Maker now positions itself as a bridge to real-world assets (RWA) yield,” said Karpatkey.  The decision will take effect on June 19.  Paxos Dollar out, Gemini Dollar cut  The executive vote also included a slew of other proposals that influence the composition of DAI’s backing reserve assets.  The community effectively ditched Paxos Dollar (USDP) from the reserve by approving a decrease in its debt ceiling to zero. The move has a substantial impact on fintech firm Paxos’ stablecoin, as Maker currently holds roughly half of USDP’s $1 billion supply.  The vote also ratified onboarding the BlockTower Andromeda RWA vault that would allow the additional purchase of up to $1.28 billion in U.S. Treasuries for the reserve, doubling down on giving traditional financial assets a bigger role in DAI’s reserve.  In a separate poll concluded Thursday, MakerDAO voters also favored curbing Gemini Dollar (GUSD) in the reserve to $110 million from $500 million.

42410403,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKFHc,1686859470,Every CEX Needs a DEX,"TDLR;  CEXs and DEXs are often seen as competitors, but can be complementary with a CEX running a decentralized backend to guarantee security, transparency and permissionless transactions  Centralized frontends are needed for users that can’t or won’t self-custody. Not everyone will use a DEX  On-chain transparency prevents shady issues related to misuse or commingling of funds, including outright fraud  A CEX allows frontends to run KYC/AML, filter tokens and take other compliance measures applicable to their jurisdictions and principles  A DEX is a backend that is always permissionless: it cannot be halted or censored by governments, whether for benign or malicious reasons  Infrastructure improvements mean DEXs can support assets from multiple chains — a key differentiator for CEXs in the past  It’s become very clear that centralized exchanges (CEXs) can no longer support crypto’s growth.  Sergey Gorbunov is the co-founder and CEO of Axelar. He led the cryptography group that build Algorand.  CEXs have lost billions in successive waves of attacks: external hacks (Mt. Gox), internal misuse of funds (FTX) and now, regulatory crackdown (Binance and Coinbase). Their decentralized counterparts, DEXs, defend against all three.  Still, CEXs remain vital for users that don’t want self-custody, and for operators who need jurisdictional compliance. To meet those needs and defend against the threats they face, CEXs now need a hybrid solution that integrates DEX technology. Specifically, they need layers of smart contracts that can be put on-chain as the backend to a centralized frontend.  This need is emerging just as new interoperability infrastructure makes this kind of integration possible. And it’s why I say, every CEX needs a DEX.  Background on DEXs & CEXs  The first DEXs emerged within months of the Mt. Gox hack being made public. They gained popularity as a way to stay safe and clear of CEXs, which were seen as “honey pots:” pools of money that are attractive to hackers.  Indeed, outside attackers lifted over $15 billion from Mt. Gox and generations of CEXs that followed, according to data through 2020. However, the successors matured, and the threat of such CEX “hacks” has greatly diminished. Today, CEXs handle 10 to 100 times the notional volume that DEXs traffic.  Of course, there are other threats besides “hacks.” FTX imploded after a cadre of managers commingled and seemingly lost billions worth of customer funds on an affiliated hedge fund. Binance and Coinbase, the two largest exchanges, face existential threats from the world’s most powerful financial regulator.  Amazingly, DEXs provide strong safeguards against all three of these threats: hacks, fraud and regulatory overreach. And for the first time, they can compete on a feature that until now has set CEXs apart: the ability to trade any token from any chain.  Binance realized this early and built its own decentralized blockchain and DEX. OKX followed soon after. Now, Coinbase has announced it is launching a layer-2 blockchain called Base. The fact that the largest CEXs are developing decentralized systems is telling: DEXs aren’t necessarily competitors to centralized exchanges; they are complements.  Here’s why every CEX needs a DEX (and vice versa):  DEXs are secure  Decentralization improves robustness against failure and attack. That’s the principle that drove the creation of the internet’s earliest iterations, in an effort to make computer systems resilient against nuclear attack.  The longevity and system reliability demonstrated by Bitcoin and Ethereum are also a testament to the robustness of decentralized approaches.  Decentralized approaches are the best way to protect systems against attack and failure.  CEXs are easy to use  In general, DEXs are more robust than CEXs, but historically they haven’t been able to compete on features – like trading tokens issued on separate blockchains. Interchain infrastructure improvements mean DEXs can now do that and handle transactions faster by scaling horizontally.  However, it may be DEXs’ core feature – their decentralization – that keeps many users away. Not everyone wants to manage their own private keys.  Whether measured in users or in dollars, mass adoption won’t be a reality without custodial (centralized) onramps.  DEXs are transparent  Of course, one of the most successful custodial onramps is well-known: FTX. Before its catastrophic failure, FTX was an astonishing success\.  The problem was, these users had no way to verify how FTX was using their money. They deposited funds for trading, income, etc.; but funds were gambled and lost.  See also: The Future of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in 2023 | Opinion  On a DEX, transactions are published on-chain. Users can verify the integrity of their deposits and see where they are being used. Funds can still be commingled, but it’s harder to hide that fact from users.  Not every transaction needs to be recorded on-chain. But a DEX running on the backend can provide periodic visibility into where funds are stored and how they are being used – whenever the CEX frontend “settles” to the backend blockchain on a regular basis. (This could be similar to the way a roll-up settles to its base chain.) Users can verify their funds are safe using a block explorer.  CEXs are compliant  On a DEX, integrating off-chain information can be difficult, requiring complex and fragile “oracles.” On a centralized exchange, it’s easy.  Centralized frontends can easily handle know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) processes, limit what tokens they list and apply other filters required by regulation. applicable to their jurisdictions and filter some tokens if they want. A single CEX, operating with a DEX on the backend, can in fact build multiple frontends to serve various jurisdictions.  It will be up to individual exchanges how compliant user experience (UX) can be integrated seamlessly with permissionless backend: probably different tiers of permissionlessness for different user requirements. This is not unlike the way financial institutions consume customized data feeds via an application programming interfaces (API) while individuals often use one-size-fits-all dashboards.  DEXs are permissionless  Since its genesis, cryptocurrency has been identified by its users and creators as a way to protect against governments that abuse or overuse their power. Governments have blacklisted bitcoin addresses, confiscated bitcoin troves and tracked users – but none has yet succeeded at halting the network.  Any backend that inherits bitcoin’s properties can never be stopped. Use of such a system will always be permissionless, i.e., without gatekeepers. This is why bitcoin is used under regimes both benign and malicious, for activities ranging from the dissident to the criminal, including law-abiding individuals simply warding off government incompetence.  For centralized exchanges, a decentralized backend serves the same function: a guarantee to users that no matter what action a government may take against the exchange operator itself, the pipes used to handle transactions are proof against overreach.  Composability, interoperability and horizontal scaling  For many true believers, decentralized exchanges have always been the dream: cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and should run over decentralized systems.  Still, in every wave of enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, CEXs have served as the onramps and primary interaction experiences for the majority of user traffic. There are two primary reasons why:  With a database to process transactions, CEXs offer greater and faster throughput; there’s no need to verify transactions over a more robust, decentralized network.  Similarly, a database in the middle makes it easy for CEXs to list pairs across various blockchains. DEXs have been limited to trading in pairs on the same blockchain. Something as basic in crypto trading as an ETH-BTC pair has been impossible.  Improvements in blockchain interoperability have changed the game for DEXs on both factors. Interoperability networks like Axelar that handle General Message Passing between blockchains are already allowing DEXs to offer cross-chain swaps.  On the backend, the same cross-chain capabilities mean that Web3 applications of all kinds can now scale horizontally. DEXs are avoiding congestion by building single-application “appchains” dedicated to their own throughput, or by selecting chains with the fastest throughput. These setups can now connect to users, assets and applications hosted on other chains.  See also: Osmosis Labs' Sunny Aggarwal: Why Appchains Are DeFi's Future  Interoperability clears the way for continued horizontal scaling: applications can migrate onto newer and faster blockchain technologies, as they emerge, without requiring their users to move.  Finally, and perhaps most promisingly, a DEX backend enables a CEX to compose with other builders, integrating features and network effects into new “super-app” products. Altogether, blockchain infrastructure is fast approaching a point where building decentralized applications is no longer a matter of principle, it’s a matter of competitive advantage and ultimately, survival.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Sergey Gorbunov,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/15/every-cex-needs-a-dex,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6b408e361b13952777cf7548fb68f34c13b023b0-2048x1367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
13843573,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538132,1686859226,"Bitcoin Holders Show No Panic Loss Selling, What Does It Mean?","On-chain data shows that Bitcoin investors aren’t participating in any significant amounts of loss selling right now. Here’s what it may mean. Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted Realized Loss Has Remained Low Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, coins transacted recently were mostly acquired close to the current spot price. The relevant indicator here is the “entity-adjusted realized loss,” which measures the total loss investors realize through their current selling. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each being sold to see what price it was bought at. If this previous price for any coin was more than the current spot price (that it’s now being moved at), then the coin’s sale is leading to the realization of a loss. Naturally, the coin would be moving at a profit in the opposite case. The indicator has “entity-adjusted” because it only counts transactions/sales between different entities rather than individual wallets. An entity here refers to a single or a group of addresses controlled by the same investor, as determined by Glassnode’s analysis. As transfers between the addresses of the same investor wouldn’t count as selling, it makes sense to filter such transfers out of the data for the realized loss.

The rally in the cryptocurrency’s price has taken place during this period, so it would make sense that investors wouldn’t have any need to sell at a loss while the surge has gone on. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Tether FUD Could Be Good For Bitcoin However, recently, things have been different. BTC has been going down during the past few weeks, but there has still not been any change in the indicator’s value. This is unlike what’s generally observed during drawdowns in the asset. Even earlier in the current year, when the rally had temporarily taken a hiatus in March and the cryptocurrency’s value had seen a deep plunge, there was an uplift in the realized loss, although not anything too significant. The recent low values are also despite the FUD that has spread around the sector following the SEC charges against Binance and Coinbase. In the past day, the market has again stumbled as the Fed has revealed its decision to pause interest rate hikes for now but has also communicated that more increases would be coming later in the year. Despite this fresh hit that the Bitcoin price has taken, the realized loss has still not registered any uptick, as its value is still just $91.3 million, significantly less than in past capitulation events. The fact that investors haven’t started selling at a loss would imply that there is still not enough panic in the market yet; investors holding at a loss are content to ride the current market phaseout.

Traditional financial institutions such as HSBC and Standard Chartered are finding themselves confronted with mounting pressure to adapt to Hong Kong’s desire to become a hub for crypto. According to an article on CoinTelegraph, both UK- based banks as well as the Bank of China, were pressured by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) in a May meeting to start accepting crypto companies such as exchanges, as clients. Embracing the Crypto Community The Hong Kong government's initiative to encourage major banks to accommodate cryptocurrency clients marks a noteworthy milestone in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. Recognising the demand for crypto-related services, the government appears to be looking to allow crypto-related companies to do their thing and continue to come up with innovations that can disrupt the existing financial system. Navigating Regulatory Challenges While the acceptance of cryptocurrencies presents exciting possibilities, it also poses regulatory challenges for traditional banks. Striking a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring compliance with existing regulations is a key consideration. The Hong Kong government's push for banks to embrace crypto clients is accompanied by a call for enhanced risk management and regulatory frameworks. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a secure and transparent environment that protects both banks and their cryptocurrency clients from potential risks. Embracing the Potential of Blockchain The Hong Kong government's push for banks to embrace crypto clients says much for China’s rethinking of the crypto digital asset economy. It also signifies a deeper recognition of the transformative capabilities that blockchain technology holds. Catalysing Global Innovation Hong Kong's proactive approach to embracing crypto and its encouragement of banks to accommodate crypto clients sends a resounding message to the global financial industry. By positioning itself as a progressive and innovative hub, Hong Kong aims to attract international businesses and investors who see the potential in crypto and blockchain technology.

42410396,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKEuT,1686858902,"Crypto Lobbyists Ask SEC for Info on Prometheum, the Mysterious 'Regulated' Crypto Firm","Blockchain Association lawyer Marissa Coppel announced this morning that the trade group had filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking records relevant to Prometheum, a crypto broker. Prometheum co-CEO and a founder Aaron Kaplan spoke before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, broadly in support of the Gary Gensler SEC’s positions on crypto regulation.  Given that Prometheum is not widely known, Kaplan’s appearance led to further scrutiny of the startup. Findings based on public records have since raised questions about the nature of Prometheum’s business practices and relationships.  Above all, many have questioned whether Prometheum has been accurate in presenting itself as a fully regulated crypto exchange, a claim that supports SEC Chair Gary Gensler's position that existing regulations are sufficient for regulating crypto.  “Previously, you could have argued is that there are regulations, but well, no one’s been approved, so maybe there is no path [under current rules],"" Prometheum co-CEO Aaron Kaplan told Coindesk last month. ""But now that Prometheum Capital has been approved, that argument is moot.”  Explaining further, Kaplan told CoinDesk in a statement on Thursday that ""Prometheum's affiliated companies are registered with the SEC and are FINRA members. Specifically, Prometheum ATS is an SEC-registered alternative trading system (ATS) that matches orders for buyers and sellers of DAS under the Federal Securities Laws (FSL)."" He also noted that ""Prometheum Capital, also a SEC registered and FINRA member broker dealer was recently approved to operate as a special-purpose broker-dealer meaning it is the first SEC registered custodian for DAS under the FSLs. FINRA is a self regulatory agency that regulates broker dealers.""  Despite this self-characterization, Prometheum is not currently operational, and there are major unanswered questions about its path forward.  Coppel said that the Blockchain Association’s decision to seek more information was driven by growing suspicions around Prometheum.  “In the midst of aggressive SEC enforcement, Prometheum [received] approval for first-of-its-kind Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD) for digital asset securities,” she wrote. Then “[t]he CEO somehow gets a seat in front of Congress and argues that Prometheum represents the compliant path for digital assets.”  But, Coppel continued, “Prometheum’s claims are nonsense and NOT evidence of a path to compliance … Prometheum’s ATS [alternative trading system] will not be able to trade any tokens – despite their claims to the contrary – unless projects first register with the SEC.”  Kaplan also told CoinDesk in a in a recent interview that it could not identify assets it intended to trade when it opened.  Coppel characterized these and other findings about Prometheum as “suspicious.” Some crypto leaders have speculated that Prometheum’s appearance before Congress represented a tactical effort to support the SEC’s positions in Tuesday’s hearing.  However, Kaplan remains confident in his company's regulatory approval. ""As for the Blockchain Association, we can't provide comment on their motivations but having passed the SEC and CFIUS reviews Prometheum is confident our organization has been vetted by relevant regulatory bodies,"" he told CoinDesk in the statement.  Crypto analyst Adam Cochran and venture capitalist Matt Walsh lit the fuse on suspicions about Prometheum with a pair of dives into public information about the firm. They included suggestions that Prometheum had obtained funding from unconventional sources, and had at one point planned to launch its own token.  Also notable is that Prometheum’s leadership includes Aaron Kaplan, his brother Benjamin Kaplan and their father Martin Kaplan. Aaron Kaplan, who testified before Congress as a securities law expert, earned his law degree from Thomas Jefferson Law School. Walsh pointed out that while “the Kaplan's are being held up as security law experts,” the school’s national accreditation was stripped by the American Bar Association in 2019 over concerns including the academic program there. Benjamin Kaplan also earned his J.D. from Thomas Jefferson, according to biographical information posted by the family law firm, Gusrae Kaplan.  Walsh described his findings as “beyond bizarre.” They would seem to fit the general theory that Prometheum was given standing to testify before Congress because they were saying things that authorities wanted to hear, rather than because they were prominent, influential, knowledgeable or successful at running a crypto business.  Andrew Bailey, associate professor at Singapore’s Yale-NUS College and part of the Resistance Money crypto research group, summed up three possible interpretations of the situation. At worst, some will see conspiracy. But Prometheum may also simply be an unserious operation that got lucky.  At least one prominent voice in the crypto-regulatory world, lawyer Preston Byrne, dismissed conspiratorial speculation, writing that:  “Aaron [Kaplan] has been working on Prometheum since at least 2015, comes from a family of lawyers … and has a view on tokens consistent with that background. There’s nothing fishy, it’s just nobody noticed him until this week.”  UPDATE (June 15, 22:10 UTC): Updates to add comments from Aaron Kaplan.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,CoinDesk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/15/crypto-lobbyists-ask-sec-for-info-on-prometheum-the-mysterious-regulated-crypto-firm,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb7d25aec1fc05e6c51482121b05aa41f78f7aab-5714x3214.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410401,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKFB0,1686858019,Chainalysis VP Caroline Malcolm: U.S. Crypto Policy Needs to Accomplish These 3 Things,"In the U.S., the claim that crypto faces ""regulation by enforcement"" is giving way to a growing and real threat of a ""ban by enforcement,"" all at the cost of protecting American consumers and markets.  The overwhelming majority of digital asset players want to be compliant and safe for consumers. However, to do just that, they need clear regulatory guidelines that take into account the specifics of the underlying technology, and offer the certainty needed for further investment.  Caroline Malcolm is the vice president of global public policy at Chainalysis.  Enforcement actions, in the absence of a comprehensive regulatory framework and adequate guidance, do not accomplish this. Nor do they protect consumers. The goalposts move with each enforcement action, and oftentimes remain relatively unclear due to settlements with outcomes that never see the light of day.  Meanwhile, our data at Chainalysis shows consumers continue to enter the market, and thus the importance of making progress on true regulatory and legislative reform.  U.S.-based firms are increasingly debating whether they should relocate to other jurisdictions where clear regulatory guidance exists. This harms U.S. consumers by limiting the market options available to them, and also by potentially pushing a revolutionary technology outside the bounds of U.S. law. Therefore, a comprehensive regulatory framework is the only sustainable path forward – even if the only goal is consumer protection.  Drawing on our experience working with governments and industry players across the globe, we believe a holistic regulatory framework in the U.S. is paramount to prepare the country for the future of digital finance and protect consumers from harm.  We believe such a framework rests on three pillars, and it’s through these three pillars that we'll evaluate and advocate for any legislative proposal.  1. Prudential safeguards  The digital asset sector can be volatile, and the safety and soundness of digital asset players rests on their ability to manage a range of risks. Some of these risks are common across businesses, such as the exposure to asset price shocks, redemption surges and counter-party failure. Others are unique to the digital asset space, such as operational and technological risk relating to the operation of the underlying blockchain and smart contracts.  Prudential regulatory requirements can help ensure that digital asset players are resilient to shocks, and can continue to meet their obligations to customers under stress. The appropriate prudential measures will depend on each business’ risk profile, and can include capital and liquidity buffers as well as business continuity and resolution planning to facilitate an orderly wind-down in the event of failure.  See also: Mike Belshe – U.S. Lawmakers Can Get Crypto Regulations Right | Opinion  For instance, sound regulation for stablecoin issuers could consider their unique token stabilization mechanism while digital asset custodians may be required to pay attention to technological and operational safeguards for the management of private keys. What is vital is to work with digital asset players to ensure that prudential requirements are well-tailored to the magnitude, locus and nature of their risk.  2. Market conduct regulation  Market conduct regulation establishes standards around the behavior of market intermediaries and participants, in order to secure confidence and integrity in markets. The events of 2022 have shown that this is as central to digital asset markets, as in any other financial or physical asset market.  Market conduct is an expansive concept. One important facet in the digital asset space is the establishment of internal controls to manage conflicts of interest. This can include the clear segregation of customer assets from corporate assets, as well as the separation of reporting lines and information flow where a digital asset player takes on multiple functions.  Another important element is the detection and prevention of market abuse, such as market manipulation, wash trading and pump-and-dump activity, all of which have been observed in the digital asset ecosystem. A variety of tools exist today for digital asset players to monitor unusual trade and price activity within and across trading platforms, and even to scrape social media platforms to detect planned collusive action.  Regulators, too, have a role to play in ensuring that industry participants have the policies, processes and resources to promote fair and efficient markets, as well as the tools themselves to detect and investigate abuse.  Finally, there are concerns about financial integrity. Like fiat markets, digital asset markets can be abused for illicit purposes such as money laundering, terrorism financing and sanctions evasion. Although data shows that the proportion of illicit flows on chain is very low – less than 1% of total on-chain transactions – such activity can nonetheless have an impact on economic and security outcomes.  The benefit of blockchain-based assets stems from the transparency of the underlying blockchain infrastructure, which can make it easier to detect and disrupt illicit activity. The tools are available for each digital asset player to monitor their illicit exposure and take mitigating measures.  3. Consumer protection safeguards  Consumer protection safeguards are about ensuring that crypto users are treated fairly and that they understand the nature and risks of the activity in which they are engaging. As digital assets go evermore mainstream among the wider public, policymakers have highlighted concerns about speculative trading and scams.  See also: Marc Hochstein – You Want Crypto Regulation? I’ll Give You Crypto Regulation | Opinion  The financial sector in particular includes comprehensive risk disclosures meant to protect consumers. Further, financial education, knowledge assessments and due diligence procedures all have a role to play outside the digital asset space and could be useful in the digital asset space as well.

Abra is a crypto lender that's been around nearly 10 years.

The regulators are hoping to hold a hearing on the matter, though one has not yet been scheduled.  Until then, Abra and its various entities are still allowed to let customers withdraw funds, the filing said.

42410386,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKEQi,1686855921,Soft Science Economics Struggles With Hard Money Bitcoin,"Proving that economics is more an art than a science, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will ""skip"" a round of rising interest rates. This left market analysts to debate the meaning of the word.  For the first time in over a year, the Federal Reserve has decided to stay the course by keeping rates at about 5%, breaking its streak of 10 consecutive interest rate hikes. However, Powell has left open the door to further hawkish rate increases, clarifying that he “shouldn’t call it a skip.” What would the market think?  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Despite the Fed’s decision to pull back on the most aggressive monetary policy strategy in the U.S. since the 1980s, stocks and crypto crumbled after the press conference. For many, Powell’s slip of the tongue all but guarantees the Fed will continue to raise interest rates this year, likely as early as July, in a bid to cool the economy. Powell said signs show inflation appears to be easing, finally, and will use this … pause … to assess the impact of the Fed’s strategy.  I don’t envy Powell’s job to navigate an economy out of a global pandemic, which contributed to consumer price inflation spiking to 40-year highs of over 9%, as a regional war cut the global supply of necessities like wheat and oil. But the experimental economic rejiggering at the Fed is already one for the history books. “Given how far we have come, it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace,” Powell said, confirming the Fed intends to move more slowly after a breakneck pace. “It’s just the idea that we’re trying to get this right.”  For many, however, Powell has already gone wrong. It’s widely believed that the Fed’s financial engineering contributed to the collapse of three U.S. banks earlier this year – including the second-largest bank failure on record in the U.S. – by cratering the value of U.S. Treasury bonds. Backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, Treasurys are considered the safest investment in the world. This banking distress could continue to weigh on the economy.  Then there are the effects on everyday folk. According to a WalletHub survey (between May 29 and June 2) two-in-five people say Fed rate hikes are forcing them into more debt, and putting their jobs at risk. Part of the Fed’s strategy of cooling an overheated economy is by increasing unemployment. WalletHub projects further that the Fed’s cumulative rate hikes of 500 basis points will translate into consumers paying $33.4 billion in extra interest charges over the coming year.  Borrowing costs are the highest in years and mortgage rates have been volatile and even if inflation has technically come down. People still report paying more than ever for groceries, healthcare, etc. Powell is at least candid about the difficulties ahead of trying to push inflation down to the Fed’s standard 2% target. “The process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one,” he said. Though he thinks the right conditions for that “are coming into place.”  Whether that translates into less economic anxiety is another question. It’s worth noting the stock market recently entered a bull market (as have most assets, besides crypto), which is a ringer for populist rage considering who owns the majority of stocks (i.e. not the people hurt most by higher consumer prices).  See also: Bitcoin Sinks Below 25K, Altcoins Tumble, as Investors Shrug Off Fed  To put a bow on this, because this is a crypto news site, there was a time when bitcoin advocates really seemed to think that government mismanagement or incompetence would drive people into the fold. If that was ever true, perhaps around when you could still call bitcoin an inflation hedge, adoption likely only happened around the margins. Bitcoin traded flat during the recent U.S. debt default debate – if ever there was a time for a hedge, or a currency with a predicable issuance schedule. In the U.S., it’s hard to see bitcoin treated as anything more than a curiosity – at least in the short term.  But these things are relative. In places like Turkey and Argentina, bitcoin adoption continues to outpace those countries’ inflation. In other words, it’s a ""hard money"" depending on what currency you’re using. I guess that's why they call economics a ""soft science.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/15/soft-science-economics-struggles-with-hard-money-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3f313115328ed1a8b80d8a1dffee142c6fb07bc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initial success of EigenLayer’s launch highlights a strong demand for the restaking market.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform EigenLayer had its first-ever restaking smart contracts reach their maximum limits on Wednesday, the same day the much-hyped protocol was deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. The contracts, which allow people to “restake” ether (ETH) and use it to secure other platforms, drew in 9,600 tokens worth more than $16 million.  Compared to other Ethereum smart contracts deployed in the past week, EigenLayer’s three restaking pools – which consist of stETH, rETH and cbETH liquid staking tokens – have seen the highest capital inflows in the past 24 hours from “smart money” wallets tracked by the blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  Nansen’s smart money wallets represent crypto traders and institutions with a history of generally profitable trades. A notable smart money depositor into EigenLayer’s stETH, rETH and cbETH pools included the address that deployed the U.S.-sanctioned Tornado Cash money mixing tool.  EigenLayer’s restaking system lets Ethereum stakers – people who lock up tokens to help operate Ethereum – reuse their interest-earning staked ETH to “extend cryptoeconomic security to additional applications on the network to earn additional rewards,” according to the protocol’s documents. Eigenlayer's restaking contract limits will be raised over the coming weeks and months, according to the protocol's Twitter account.  The large early inflows into EigenLayer’s smart contracts represented “a strong signal of confidence in the EigenLayer team and demand for the restaking market,” staking service provider P2P's head of Research Steven Quinn told CoinDesk.  “Restaking could potentially further boost ETH staking real yield by massively expanding ETH’s utility as collateral to secure additional protocols,” Quinn added. “This is also cementing ETH staking as a very compelling alternative to DeFi yields, which are still largely supported by unsustainable token inflation. Creating competition for ETH capital between sources of real revenue and inflation can only be a good thing for the health of applications and Ethereum itself.”  In March 2023, EigenLayer raised $50 million in a Series A funding round, which saw participation from Blockchain Capital, Electric Capital, Polychain Capital, Hack VC, Finality Capital Partners and Coinbase Ventures.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING,Sage D.

42410391,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKEhF,1686852997,"Ripple, SEC Seem to Agree About Not Taking Hinman Speech Seriously","Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seem to be on the same page about the documents known as the Hinman Emails: The former official’s past remarks shouldn’t govern current policy.  Despite the rush of attention this week on the insider deliberations that went into writing a five-year-old speech from William Hinman - the former head of the SEC’s corporation finance division - the agency’s past uncertainty over the status of ether (ETH) never amounted to formal commission-approved rules or guidance. So the dialogue over the ex-official’s one-time remarks may offer some insights, but it's unlikely to move the needle on the agency's crypto policy.  “Nothing in these documents creates precedent or establishes law,” said Andrew Hinkes, a lawyer at K&L Gates who co-chairs its digital assets practice. At best, the emails give “a helpful snapshot of certain SEC staffers' views on some issues at a point in time,” so it’s useful for those trying to understand where the agency has been coming from on the crypto-as-securities debate, but there’s nothing the SEC can be held to, Hinkes said.  Hinman, in his speech that’s still posted on the SEC website, had said he didn’t “see a need to regulate ether” – a view that was debated among officials inside the agency even as he said it. The remarks have been a particular focus of Ripple, in light of the parallels between ETH and the XRP token closely associated with Ripple’s business.  “The SEC fostered regulatory confusion in the marketplace,” Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty said Thursday in an interview on CoinDesk TV. “They knew the marketplace was confused, then they took steps to deliberately aggravate that confusion.”  Alderoty had also tweeted what he thinks the emails should mean: “Hinman’s speech should never again be invoked in any serious discussion about whether a token is or is not a security.”  As it happens, that seems fine with the SEC. The agency hasn’t relied on Hinman’s position in recent years and has moved on with other remarks from SEC Chair Gary Gensler that suggest a different view. After Ethereum’s high-profile move to proof-of-stake, Gensler said that such tokens may actually be securities, though he didn’t specify ETH.  Agency spokespeople declined to comment on the release of the emails this week, and Hinman didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Still, none of the issues debated around Hinman’s speech have legal bearing until the SEC’s five commissioners make a new rule, issue guidance or bring an enforcement action that explicitly makes the case that ETH is a security. That’s the chief point of interest for Ripple, which has been fighting with the regulator in court over whether the XRP token associated with its products is a security.  After the company also waged this fierce campaign to win access to the SEC’s emails, Ripple’s Alderoty would like to see them remain in the limelight, arguing that an investigation should be conducted into why Hinman said what he did. He said the SEC has relied on those remarks in its ongoing battles with the sector.  “They've weaponized it to bring a series of enforcement actions and trying – through regulation-by-enforcement, we now know – to really destroy and disrupt this crypto economy in the United States,” Alderoty told CoinDesk TV.  But others aren’t sure there’s anything in the messages to alter the high-stakes debate over how crypto will be regulated in the U.S.  “Those who expected bombshells were probably disappointed, but for those who work to understand these markets, there are helpful inclusions that merit further consideration,” Hinkes said.  “I don’t believe that the Hinman emails are particularly significant from a legal standpoint,” said Grant Gulovsen, an Illinois-based lawyer who works with crypto clients, in an email. “I don’t see how it helps Ripple/XRP. And if the Hinman speech is no longer (or never was) the view of the SEC, then it’s not good for crypto generally.”  Hinman – who noted during the 2018 speech that it was his personal view – took a position that crypto projects could become “sufficiently decentralized” that buyers wouldn’t expect anybody was at the helm, so they couldn’t be investment contracts regulated by the SEC. Gulovsen said that idea is still useful as ""a reasonable application"" of securities law for digital assets.

13840990,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/level-the-omnichain-liquidity-marketplace-launches-on-arbitrum,1686852900,LEVEL : The Omnichain Liquidity Marketplace Launches on Arbitrum,"Since inception, LEVEL has designed a protocol to serve as a functional alternative to centralized counterparty risk. After half a year of product testing, it’s finally time to expand, and the LEVEL DAO has determined that Arbitrum will be the next ecosystem where Level will be deployed on. LEVEL’s Success Story LEVEL has experienced phenomenal growth. In just the first month, LEVEL witnessed a notable $320 million in volume traded, generating over $400k in fees and bringing in more than 1000 community members. As a testament to the product-market fit they found, it took just 55 days for the ecosystem to hit $1 billion in trading volume, leading to collecting $8.3 million in fees during that time – going from strength to strength with over $20 billion traded in the first half of 2023 alone! Impressively, the most significant daily trading volume was $339 million on April 14, 2023, accounting for around a third of the total volume across Perp DEXs (Delphi Digital). A Quick Look On-Chain Total Volume: $17.4 billion, of which leverage trading volume accounts for $14.5 billion Total Collected Fees: >$22 million Interestingly, these collected fees are distributed to: LLPs (supply-side revenue) = 45% LVL Stakers (protocol revenue) = 10% LGO Stakers (protocol revenue) = 10% DAO Treasury (protocol revenue - redeemable against LGO) = 30% Reserved for Protocol Development (5%) Assets Under Management (AUM): $30 million During this time, LEVEL has established itself as the leading perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain, rivaling even the likes of GMX – a significant achievement considering the difference in total value locked (TVL) and market cap. Setting itself apart from competitors, LEVEL wrote its own codebase from scratch and pioneered the tranche system in DeFi. By leveraging its innovative dual tokenomics model (LVL and LGO), which perfectly fits a perpetual DEX platform, LEVEL has created a strong protocol growth flywheel, reflected in the simultaneous growth of platform volume and Treasury assets. This has resulted in achieving close to $10M in treasury liquid assets. Last but not least, LEVEL is taking DeFi on-chain governance to the next level, with more than 19 DAO Proposals submitted. Truly decentralized governance, driving rapid iteration in product and incentive models for a fast-paced marketplace. Why Arbitrum? Even at a glance, Arbitrum looked like the most immediate choice for LEVEL, and this sentiment resonated with the majority of their community. All new possible chains were evaluated according to their: Liquidity User profile Daily active users Daily number of TXs Arbitrum crushes all of these criteria, securing itself as the fourth chain by TVL, thanks to its deep liquidity and a DeFi-native user base. An equally important factor included the sustained growth of unique addresses in the network, even after the ARB Airdrop. Many critics speculated that activity on Arbitrum would sink after the airdrop. Nonetheless, the daily transactions on the network are steadily increasing, averaging around 1m per day — close to ATH if one does not take into account the days of the airdrop. Considering these factors, it is understandable why the DAO voted for Arbitrum, securing 53% of the total votes across 4 options. Arbitrum is the home of DeFi, and a place full of open collaboration. The composable nature of DeFi on Arbitrum offers endless possibilities for new products and partnerships with other protocols. Some remarkable examples include: Yield Aggregators Money Markets Other Derivatives (e.g., hedging, structured products) Furthermore, this Layer 2 protocol is a fantastic fit for LEVEL as it houses a native niche of perp DEX traders who can benefit from the ecosystem’s incentivized program for traders, shrewdly configured to drive protocol and treasury growth. While the expansion to Arbitrum is the project’s main priority, LEVEL is not stopping there. LEVEL will continue to expand in its goal to become a key piece of the wider omnichain infrastructure. Practical Developments Cross-chain infrastructure is being built to cement the marketplace as an omnichain protocol. As part of these developments, LEVEL is migrating the LVL and LGO tokens to the ‘Omnichain Fungible Token’ (OFT) standard. The ultimate goal is to enable the cross-chain aggregation of fees distributed to its stakeholders so that LEVEL users can earn yield anywhere in the ecosystem. The DAO treasury will also be united across the entire ecosystem, meaning LGO redemptions against the treasury will occur on all chains. Following the recently approved proposal, LEVEL is utilizing LayerZero’s technology to bridge 5M LVL to Arbitrum, to bootstrap liquidity and trader activity through auctions and other incentive programs. They have also begun migrating: LVL/USDT Liquidity — to make LVL tokens more accessible to users on Arbitrum, LEVEL migrating the entire LVL/USDT pool (currently ~ $713,214) to Trader Joe Arbitrum ensures that new users trading for the first time will have the liquidity to access LVL tokens. LEVEL Trading Pool Liquidity — enabling access to all trading features, migrating 3,555,192 Senior LLP (currently ~ $4,061,500) from the BNB Chain to seed trading liquidity on Arbitrum (50% of the protocol-owned Senior LLP supply). Future Plans When it comes to future footprints, a key priority for Level Protocol is for the DAO to steer Level’s journey towards exceptional growth. LEVEL also remains committed to delivering an exceptional user experience, ensuring that their customers receive premium service and can trade using a top-notch UX. Further solidifying its position in the DeFi space, LEVEL is actively seeking, discussing, and moving forward with several partnerships with additional Tier-1 projects, enabling them to expand its reach and utility across the industry. LEVEL's success to date was achievable through the tremendous support from its community of users. Expanding to a cross-chain liquidity marketplace, the marketplace will release a first-in-kind utility-based NFT in just 60 days. All of these unique items will be exclusively for LEVEL's community of users, with allocation retroactively determined based on interactions with the protocol on both Arbitrum and BNB Chain. Three categories will correspond to the three main facets of LEVEL: Stock Broker's Vest, Earned through proving yourself as a trader. The life blood of any financial hub, a Trader needs to look the part at his desk. Auctioneer's Hammer –A key group of mechanisms at LEVEL, Auctions serve to widen the reach of the ecosystem as a whole. Embody the power of the Auctioneer with their Hammer. Tattered Farmer's Hat – LEVEL wouldn’t we be anywhere without liquidity. LPs take on risk enabling the entire marketplace to function. It ain’t much, but it’s honest work. LEVEL's vision is to become a leading omnichain trading platform, and their recent expansion to Arbitrum marks the first step towards realizing this goal. Expanding their services into other DeFi sectors is another avenue they are exploring. The goal is to become a multi-chain liquidity aggregator where fragmented liquidity across different ecosystems can be unified in a single pool, allowing users to trade, swap, and borrow seamlessly. LEVEL is excited to embark on this omnichain journey, transforming the way people engage with DeFi and revolutionizing their trading experience. Step into the LEVEL Ecosystem!

13840569,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538174,1686852047,Bitcoin Headed for Another Crash? Over $100 Billion in Liquidations Suggests Trouble Ahead,"Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, was expected to continue its bull run after consolidating its gains. However, on June 14th, just before its daily close, Bitcoin suffered a 3% decline, dropping below $25,000 and reaching as low as $24,700, a price level not seen since mid-March. In light of these developments and the mounting regulatory pressure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the nascent industry, many are starting to believe that the recent bull run for BTC was nothing more than a fakeout. Related Reading: XRP Exhibits Bearish Chart Pattern – Where Could The Price Head Next? Bitcoin On The Brink With Massive Amount Of Liquidations Looming Bitcoin has been facing a lot of turbulence recently, and the troubles don’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. The latest data shows that Bitcoin is facing trouble as over $100 billion in liquidations loom, signaling the potential for another crash in the cryptocurrency market. Despite attempting to surpass its nearest resistance levels, Bitcoin has been struggling, with the potential for further downside movements and increased selling pressure. According to the latest data provided by the trader and crypto analyst under the pseudonym “Bleeding Crypto”, there is a total of $63.9 billion worth of liquidations at the $24,200 price level and $52.3 billion worth of liquidations at the $21,800 mark. The increased selling pressure in Bitcoin could potentially result in further liquidations and a subsequent crash in the cryptocurrency’s price, delaying any further uptrends and causing a return to the lower price levels seen at the beginning of the year. This could induce fear among investors, further fueling short positions and potentially leading to a vicious cycle. However, if that’s the case, it’s important to note that there’s also a possibility of a contrary situation, where institutional investors hunt for short position liquidations, leading to a surge in buying pressure and propelling the price of Bitcoin to the upside. BTC’s Open Interest Skyrockets Crypto analyst and Crypto Quant author Maartun has recently warned that volatility is incoming in the world of Bitcoin. According to him, although BTC’s price has been going sideways, the open interest in the cryptocurrency has increased by $439 million. Maartun’s analysis suggests that a significant amount of money is being poured into the market, which could lead to a significant increase in volatility. Maartun notes that this situation differs from previous occasions, as the funding rates for Bitcoin are trending down and are close to neutral. This means that longs and shorts are in almost perfect balance, creating a situation where any significant move in either direction could trigger a cascade of buying or selling. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding contracts in a particular market yet to be settled. In the case of Bitcoin, an increase in open interest typically indicates that more traders are entering the market, which could lead to increased volatility. The impact of the increase in open interest on Bitcoin’s price and market direction is unclear. While an increase in open interest can suggest a growing interest in Bitcoin and potentially lead to upward price movements, it can also lead to greater volatility and downward price movements if the market sentiment turns negative. Alternately, according to the latest data from Glassnode, the amount of illiquid Bitcoin supply continues to grow at a rate of 119,000 BTC per month. This suggests that Bitcoin holders are becoming increasingly reluctant to sell or move their coins, leading to a concentration of coins in wallets with a sparse spending history.

This development signifies a substantial move by one of the most influential financial institutions into the world of cryptocurrencies. The anticipation is growing amid revelations that BlackRock plans to use Coinbase Custody for the ETF, alongside the crypto exchange’s spot market data for pricing. This alliance represents a significant step in legitimizing cryptocurrencies in traditional finance. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) and Coinbase (COIN) have not reacted to the news but have only continued to dwell in red, with both assets down 3.9% and 2.81%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Data Reveals Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Refuse To Sell Despite SEC Crackdown BlackRock’s Foray Into Crypto The move marks a continuation of the collaboration that started last year when BlackRock partnered with Coinbase to offer crypto directly to institutional investors. As of yet, the specifics about the nature of the ETF – whether it will be spot or futures – remain undisclosed. Notably, The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), responsible for regulating ETFs in the U.S., has previously turned down every application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. However, several Bitcoin futures ETFs have gained the regulatory body’s approval for trading, indicating a gradually warming stance towards cryptocurrencies. Potential Impact On Bitcoin Price The news of BlackRock’s potential Bitcoin ETF could significantly affect BTC’s price. Creating such an ETF would allow a broader spectrum of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, possibly driving up demand and its price. ETFs make it easy for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, opening up a substantial new demand avenue. Analyst crypto Daan Crypto reported that Bitcoin had recorded a strong spot bid on Binance in the past few hours – a move that has not been seen for the past few days. According to the trader, Bitcoin’s local bottom is more likely in if the asset continues to the downside in the coming days. At the time of writing, BTC currently trades at $24,977, down by nearly 4%. Its trading volume has also spiked over the past 7 days indicating massive trading activity. Notably, from a technical perspective, BTC could still be prone to a continuous downtrend, given that the asset hasn’t hit major support, which can be found in the order block at $24,500. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price On Shaky Ground: Market Analysts Warn Of Potential Fall To $20,000 Level Furthermore, the association with BlackRock, a globally recognized asset management name, could lend credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin. This increased trust could lead to greater adoption rates and an upward price trajectory for Bitcoin in the long run. As observed in the past, any positive development or news about BTC ETFs has often led to a spike in Bitcoin’s price due to increased demand from retail and institutional investors.

Some of the first features of the digital garment IDs will include: Authentication of the garment as genuine, eliminating fakes and counterfeiting Rewarding responsible behaviours of treasuring and caring for clothing long-term, such as refurbs and second-hand purchases Recording each individual garment's unique history - owners, events and places worn, repairs and alterations - enabling the item to accrue emotional and monetary value over time Acting as a digital ticket for entry to events Access to and voting rights within BLK DNM Society BLK DNM Society The digital garment IDs are the first hardware elements of BLK DNM Society, which launches in tandem. The first example of connected fashion, BLK DNM Society is a community of BLK DNM owners, connected virtually by their physical items, who are rewarded for responsible behaviours and are granted voting rights on key brand decisions based on item ownership - thereby beginning the first ever process of decentralising a fashion brand’s stewardship. Each digital garment ID will create a ‘digital reflection’ of the physical garment: a twin in the virtual world where the physical item’s history and place within BLK DNM Society is recorded. The digital reflection can also be worn in the metaverses, catering especially to younger generations whose identities in virtual worlds are equally as important as in the physical. FW 2023 Digital garment IDs will be revealed at BLK DNM’s FW event in Paris on June 21st. For this first collection, the chips will be embedded in only leather items, with subsequent collections introducing more items to BLK DNM Society through embedded blockchain-enabled hardware. Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay, comments: “This is totally futuristic. Nothing like this has been attempted in fashion before. It’s very exciting for us, after much hard work, to see our technology elevating one of fashion’s iconic brands into something completely unique. This has the potential to transform people’s relationships with the clothes they wear and the brands they buy. No longer does the relationship with the customer end at the checkout. And each beautiful garment now becomes its own living, evolving piece of history.” Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, and Henrik Hjelte, CEO and Co-founder of ChromaWay Toni Collin, CEO of BLK DNM, comments: “BLK DNM’s philosophy is one of community, and our clothing is designed, through both its craftsmanship and timeless aesthetic, to be treasured and passed down through generations - the antithesis of irresponsible fast fashion. Now, with the introduction of BLK DNM Society and the first embedded hardware in our garments, we take those two pillars to a revolutionary new level. By embedding intelligence in every item, we hope we can inspire our industry to join us in using connected fashion to do better.” About BLK DNM BLK DNM is a Swedish-American fashion brand that specialises in timeless tailoring, leather, and denim of extraordinary quality. Following its 2023 relaunch as an entry-luxury fashion house under the stewardship of new Creative Director Jessy Heuvelink, BLK DNM’s focus on both enduring craftsmanship and aesthetic timelessness encourages customers to love and treasure each item for decades and across generations.

42410387,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKEU1,1686848108,"Judge Allows FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried to Go to Trial on Only Wire Fraud, Political Contribution Charges for Now","The judge overseeing Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal trial will allow the government to treat some of the charges against him as part of a separate criminal trial for the moment.  Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled Thursday afternoon that five of the charges brought against Bankman-Fried can be brought to trial in March 2024, allowing the U.S. Department of Justice to proceed only on eight charges brought in an initial indictment last December for the FTX founder's current trial this fall.  During the hearing, the judge asked the FTX founder's defense team several questions about their motion to dismiss bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance charges, though he did not make a decision on the motions to dismiss during Thursday's hearing.  ""I'd like to congratulate you on an extraordinarily imaginative [defense],"" the judge told one defense attorney who argued that the U.S. Department of Justice was trying to insert new legal theories into its prosecution.  Mark Cohen, another attorney for Bankman-Fried, argued before a packed courtroom that the campaign finance charge should be dismissed, or at least severed alongside other charges, on a technical detail.  ""The operative document in extradition is the warrant of surrender,"" Cohen said. ""It does not list the campaign finance charge.""  Bankman-Fried never consented to be extradited on that charge, Cohen contended.  A prosecutor pushed back against this assertion later on, saying the U.S. had included the charge in its extradition request.  The warrant in question was addressed to Bahamian police, and while it may not have included the charge, the Bahamian court itself was aware of it, the prosecutor said.  Judge Kaplan seemed unconvinced. He seemed similarly skeptical about the defense's efforts to dismiss bank and wire fraud charges.  Part of Thursday's hearings focused on the possible timeline through the start of the criminal trial. While the DOJ shared a proposed timeline, the judge said it didn't give him enough time to review all of the materials he'd have to look at.  The judge also denied a number of motions made by the defense tied to discovery, including an effort to have the DOJ review FTX documents and materials.  Bankman-Fried's attorneys filed to dismiss most of the charges laid out against him last month, arguing that there were a number of different reasons to grant the motions. Several of the motions to dismiss focused on claimed legal issues, including failure to state an offence or allege valid property rights.  Bankman-Fried also sought to dismiss some charges brought after he was extradited to the U.S. on grounds that the Bahamas hadn't consented to them.  Bankman-Fried was arrested last December on eight initial charges, but prosecutors have added another five through multiple superseding indictments. Bankman-Fried's attorneys have argued that under the U.S.'s extradition treaty with the Bahamas, the Bahamas' government needs to sign off on the charges brought post-extradition. On Tuesday, the Bahamas Supreme Court ruled that he should have an opportunity to argue against the country approving the additional charges.  Late Wednesday night, prosecutors agreed to hold off on these added charges until the Bahamas signed off.  Prosecutors pushed back against the other motions, saying the defense's arguments didn't carry enough weight on the procedural issues.  UPDATE (June 15, 2023, 21:25 UTC): Judge Kaplan ruled on the motion to sever charges after the end of the hearing.

In an email sent from Collect Trump Cards with the subject ""Claim Your Prize from the Trump Digital Trading Cards Sweepstakes NOW!"", winners of prizes such as a one-on-one meeting with the former President, a gala dinner at Mar-A-Lago or group Zoom calls were told they could now burn their NFTs to claim their prizes (Full disclosure: I received a ""Win Trump Prizes"" NFT via a Sweepstakes write-in entry method).  Previous reporting revealed that most of the buyers of Trump’s first digital collection were first-time buyers of NFTs and the email laid out explicitly what the process of burning an NFT meant.  Those who won a prize by purchasing a Trump Digital Collectible Card NFT received a second, separate “Win Trump Prizes” NFT with their specific prize indicated within the NFT. It is this second NFT that holders must burn for prizes, not the original trading card NFT.  The site does not indicate when any prizes involving the former president will be awarded but does lay out that physical prizes, such as books or hand-signed memorabilia, would be received in 4-6 weeks.  While prices and sales spiked in March when the former president was first indicted with 34 felony counts, prices of the two Trump NFT collections have remained largely unchanged following his second indictment. The first collection, Trump Digital Collectible Cards, has seen just 144 sales with a floor price of about .15 ETH (roughly $246), while the Series 2 collection has seen 562 sales over the past seven days and a below-mint floor price of about .04 ETH (about $64). Both collections had a mint price of $99.  As for the Win Trump Prizes NFTs, at the time of writing, the number of unique owners had dropped from 799 to 788, indicating that only a few others are choosing to or are able to burn their NFTs (I burned mine without issue as part of reporting this piece).

Of the three live proposals, two revolve center around open standards for algorithms and metadata.  Lens Protocol – a decentralized social media platform that originated from DeFi lending giant Aave – introduced Thursday a new open governance model where community members can propose improvements to the protocol.  Lens Improvement Proposals (LIPs), which is inspired by Ethereum and Aave’s model for improvement proposals, is an attempt to create a framework for developers, creators and users to participate in the decision-making process of Len’s future development.  Currently, there are three live proposals, according to the announcement. The first proposal establishes the open governance model, while the second and third proposals are centered around open standards. The second proposal “will encourage third-party algorithms and machine learning (ML) services to be integrated into Lens Protocol,” while the third proposal defines “how metadata is classified, organized and labeled within Lens,” as stated in the announcement.  The protocol’s embrace of open governance through LIPs comes one week after the social media platform raised $15 million from a group of high-profile investors like IDEO CoLab ventures, Palm Tree, Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams, OpenSea co-founder Alex Atallah, entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.

13837743,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538104,1686844827,XRP Exhibits Bearish Chart Pattern – Where Could The Price Head Next?,"In the past 48 hours, the price of XRP has experienced notable volatility, dropping below $0.50. The crypto market is closely focused on XRP due to a recent favorable development in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) vs. Ripple lawsuit. The emergence of the Hinman documents has sparked inquiries into the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although XRP witnessed positive price action earlier this year, the altcoin has faced challenges due to ongoing market volatility. This has led to a break below significant support levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Plunges Below $1,700, Here’s The Metric That Signaled This In Advance Over the last 24 hours, XRP has seen a close to 7% dip. There has been an 8% depreciation on the weekly chart. Both the demand and accumulation of the asset have remained low. This indicated a dominant bearish trend. The fear index remains high in the market, contributing to a decline in investor confidence. Failure to surpass the $0.50 level may result in a significant loss of value for XRP during the next trading session. Furthermore, the decrease in the altcoin’s market capitalization reinforces the weak buying power reflected on the chart. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.47. Following the rejection of the bulls at $0.50, XRP has been experiencing a downward trend. The coin faced resistance at $0.50, and it is anticipated that it may encounter even stronger resistance at $0.55. If the altcoin fails to surpass the $0.55 mark, it will likely dip to its local support level of $0.46 and potentially further down to $0.43. Moreover, the altcoin has formed a bearish double-top pattern, indicating a potential reversal in its price trend as it moves downward on the chart. The trading volume of XRP has also declined in the last session, suggesting that sellers have taken control of the asset. Technical Analysis During the majority of this month, XRP witnessed a decline in demand. This was reflected by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) falling below the half-line, indicating that sellers had taken control of the asset. Additionally, XRP fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting low demand and indicating that sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. However, if the altcoin trades near the $0.50 price mark, it can potentially bring the price back above the 20-SMA line. This would essentially indicate a resurgence in demand for the asset. In addition to the mentioned technical indicators, other signals on the chart for the altcoin indicate selling pressure. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed red histograms, signalling sell signals for the altcoin and indicating a bearish sentiment in the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Set Their Sights On Next Downside Target If $1,700 Support Breaks Furthermore, the Bollinger Bands have widened, indicating increased volatility and potential price fluctuations for the altcoin in the upcoming trading sessions. This suggests that the price of XRP may experience significant changes and unpredictability in the near term.

42410395,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdKErA,1686844800,Unveiling the Uniswap Foundation's Bridge Report: Winners and Losers,"The Uniswap Foundation released its Bridge Assessment Report on Thursday, a major community undertaking that saw the biggest decentralized exchange (DEX) formally examine some of the core infrastructure powering its governance process.  Uniswap is the largest DEX by trading volume. It was among the first blockchain-based programs to offer a decentralized alternative to the traditional currency exchange – using smart contracts to allow users to swap between different crypto tokens without the need for trusted middlemen.  The foundation has used a group of nine experts to analyze six of the leading crypto bridge providers – vital pieces of crypto infrastructure that allow blockchains to pass messages from one to another.  After a comprehensive review involving code evaluation and direct interaction with the bridge teams, the committee approved Wormhole and Axelar for Uniswap's specific use case of protocol governance. Other bridges including LayerZero, Celer, DeBridge and Multichain did not meet the committee's criteria. The report leaves open the possibility for some protocols to be reevaluated following future updates.  The assessment was designed to address some key issues faced by Uniswap and other decentralized governance bodies: The need for specialized expertise when weighing big decisions, and the potential for conflicts of interest to muddy community deliberations.  The committee took pains to repeatedly note that its findings were “narrow in scope” and “should only be used to evaluate cross-chain messaging protocols for this use case,” the report said.  The results of the process are not binding: Whenever Uniswap expands to a new blockchain, its community will ultimately be tasked with voting on the bridge platform that will be used to back its governance process. (LayerZero, which wasn’t approved by the committee, is already used by Uniswap on the Avalanche blockchain).  However, the protocols that were reviewed positively in the report, like Axelar, are already wearing the results as a badge of honor. “Uniswap’s approval is a validation of Axelar’s approach,” a representative for the firm told CoinDesk in an email.  Axelar CEO Sergey Gorbunov lauded the report in an interview, “I was generally positively surprised at how thoughtful it was. There are very few projects that can afford to be that thoughtful. It takes highly technical teams and a lot of dedication to come and dig under the hood behind all of these solutions.”  Bridge Selection Woes  Uniswap was built by Uniswap Labs, a for-profit company, but is governed by the Uniswap DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) – a collection of community members who use UNI tokens to vote on key protocol changes. Similar to other DAOs, Uniswap has a formally established operating entity, in this case the Uniswap Foundation, whose responsibilities include stewarding the DAO’s vast treasury and organizing day-to-day operations.  The foundation kicked off Uniswap’s bridge assessment process after a tumultuous community vote last year to select a bridge for Uniswap v3’s expansion to BNB Chain.  When Uniswap delegated the selection of the bridge to a community vote, it ignited an unusually heated battle in the typically humdrum Uniswap governance forums.  Read more: Wormhole Wins Vote to Be Uniswap's Designated Bridge to BNB Chain  Bridges are a famously finicky technology to get right. Many, if not most, of the headline-making multibillion-dollar crypto exploits from the past few years resulted from buggy bridges. Teams vying for Uniswap’s BNB bridge spot quickly realized their selection could signal confidence to the wider crypto community.  Following the vote, however, many DAO voters complained that Uniswap’s forum-centric deliberation process was not sufficient for them to weigh the highly technical tradeoffs of different bridge platforms. When DAO voters sought guidance from their peers to assess bridge designs, a significant hurdle also emerged in the form of conflicts of interest.  Uniswap Foundation sought to remedy the challenges it faced with the BNB vote with the assessment process.  “Our Committee first defined the Uniswap cross-chain governance use case and then worked from first principles to create the assessment framework, prioritizing security first and foremost.” Uniswap Foundation Executive Director Devin Walsh said in an email to CoinDesk. “[W]e hope that this process will inspire other DAOs as they think about cross-chain deployments, and support decentralized decision-making generally.”",NEUTRAL,UNI | BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TRADING | UNI | BNB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/15/unveiling-the-uniswap-foundations-bridge-report-winners-and-losers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/734d45b6fdbcb3d5b3bbe88dd08b6532b0c1bfac-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
13837817,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/binance-launches-bitcoin-cloud-mining-services,1686844800,Binance Launches Bitcoin Cloud Mining Services,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, has announced the launch of its new subscription-based Bitcoin cloud mining services. The move comes as a surprise amidst the ongoing regulatory challenges Binance is facing in the United States. Binance's Bitcoin Cloud Mining Service Binance announced the launch on Twitter, claiming that users who are interested in Bitcoin mining but lack the necessary hardware can subscribe to these new cloud mining services and purchase hashrates. Currently, Binance offers 1 Terahash per second (Th/s) at a rate of $10.7280. An increase in the purchased hashrate corresponds to an increased probability of higher Bitcoin earnings through mining. The BTC mining subscription service will remain active for six months. During this 180-day period, for every TH/s purchased, users could potentially earn 0.0004338 BTC. However, as of now, this product is only available on Binance's global website, indicating that users from the United States cannot access it. Current Regulatory Trouble Binance's decision to launch these cloud mining services comes at a particularly challenging time for the cryptocurrency exchange. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal action against Binance, alleging violations of securities laws. Alongside this, the SEC has filed for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of Binance.US. The SEC has accused Binance of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, and CZ has been accused of failing to prevent U.S. customers from using the platform and providing misleading information about its market surveillance measures. According to the lawsuit, Binance and CZ were involved in an ""elaborate scheme"" to evade U.S. federal securities laws, which included creating separate U.S. entities and diverting billions of dollars in customer funds to Merit Peak Limited, a separate company under Zhao's control. In a press release, SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that the charges against CZ and Binance detail an ""extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law."" He further accused the defendants of misrepresenting their risk controls, manipulating trading volumes, and actively concealing crucial information, such as the platform's operations, manipulative trading by its affiliated market maker, and the custody of investor funds and crypto assets. Binance Building Forward In the wake of these accusations, CZ has remained unfazed, choosing to dismiss the charges with a tweet stating ""4"", a reference used within the Binance community to encourage users to ignore fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). He assured the community that Binance's systems remain stable and that deposits and withdrawals are operating as normal. In preparation for the legal proceedings, Binance.US has already added former SEC enforcement co-director George Canellos to its legal team. Meanwhile, last week, Binance.US revealed that it has suspended USD deposits on its platform, a significant step in its transition to becoming an exclusively crypto-based exchange. Binance is not the only crypto exchange facing regulatory pressures. Coinbase, another prominent cryptocurrency exchange, also found itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit from the SEC for alleged failure to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency. Binance's cloud mining services launch amid such regulatory challenges is a notable step, reflecting the exchange's commitment to advancing its services, even as it grapples with legal and regulatory issues.

The Series A fundraising was led by Open Source Software Capital with participation from Boost VC, RedHat's Bob Young, Vercel’s Guillermo Rauch, Replit's Amjad Masad and others.  Funders of science projects rely on citation-based metrics to judge the quality of an academic researcher, so many scientists optimize their research to generate the most citations possible. That, say Armstrong and co-founder Patrick Joyce, is a broken, wasteful model. Science should operate more like open-source software, they argue.  ResearchHub is building a platform that allows anyone to earn crypto rewards for contributing new knowledge to the global scientific community. Users earn ResearchCoin (RSC) for publishing content to ResearchHub, and the amount of RSC received is in proportion to how valuable other members of the community perceive content to be.  “Our web application hosts a suite of publishing and collaboration tools that help researchers draft new manuscripts and share them with the world,” a ResearchHub blog post said. “Over time, we hope to iterate towards a ResearchCoin reward structure that channels resources to the best and the brightest minds on ResearchHub in a reliable, evidence-based fashion.”",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/06/15/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrongs-researchhub-startup-raises-5m-in-funding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d447bf888d578f472f7ce70c628c2371fa8c8a0f-1165x655.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This development has spurred a sense of urgency among traders and market analysts who are bracing for a possible further dip in the value of Bitcoin (BTC). At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $24,872. The past week has been less than favorable for the cryptocurrency. The asset has plunged 4.2% in the past 24 hours, pushing its price to trade below $25,000. This downward trend has negatively impacted Bitcoin’s weekly performance, resulting in a 6% loss. Traders And Analysts Voice Concerns Several traders and analysts have shared their predictions for the leading cryptocurrency in response to its downturn. Notably, a trader identified as Bluntz conveyed that the critical test for Bitcoin would be to reclaim the $25,600 mark in the ensuing days. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Stored On Exchanges Plummets Amid Regulatory Uncertainties: Santiment In another corner, a trader called Rekt Capital raised concerns about a possible slide of Bitcoin’s price to lower $20,000. This prediction followed Bitcoin’s break below another weekly support level situated around $26,600. If Bitcoin faces rejection at this price point in the next few days, Rekt Capital posits that BTC will likely descend to the $20,000 level. Meanwhile, CryptoCon, another analyst, offered his perspective on the Bitcoin situation. In his tweet, CryptoCon pointed out an interesting correlation with the past, stating that Bitcoin found resistance at $31,000, which was also a key resistance level back in 2016. According to his analysis, not only did BTC meet rejection at this resistance level, but it also found support when the price broke below its current all-time high. Bitcoin Latest Price Action It is worth noting that Bitcoin has been in a notable bearish trend in the past week. The largest crypto asset by market capitalization has recorded a downward movement falling by more than 5% in the past 7 days. BTC has continued the downtrend over the past 24 hours, seeing a 4.2% loss. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $24,925 after moving slightly above $26,000 on Sunday. Bitcoin’s trading volume has spiked over the past 7 days from below $10 billion earlier this Monday to $14 billion in the past 24 hours, indicating massive trading activity, which could turn into a violent sell-off given its current price. However, the asset’s market capitalization has seen a more than $30 billion loss in the past 7 days. BTC’s market cap has plummeted from $518 billion last Thursday to $483 billion.

Rules requiring stablecoin issuers to hold appropriate reserves take effect as of June 2024, and industry lobbyists have said how the rules are implemented under subsidiary legislation could prove crucial in practice.

The protocol’s customers will soon be able to check how much of their assets could be withdrawn, nearly a year after Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A Sigh Of Relief Paul Hage, Voyager’s bankruptcy administrator, stated in a court filing on the 14th of June that the Voyager app would be updated by the 15th of June. Once the app has been updated, customers will be able to check the amount they can withdraw. Hage also estimated that the withdrawal period could start between the 20th of June to the 5th of July. The bankruptcy plan was approved in court on the 17th of May and will see Voyager customers initially receive around 35% of their claims through withdrawals from the Voyager app. They can also withdraw in cash after a period of 30 days. “Voyager Court adjourned for the day. Fee examiner’s findings approved by the judge app will come back online on or around the 15th of June Estimated window for withdrawals opening the 20th of June to the 5th of July 30 days to withdraw once the window opens all creditors will receive 35.72 initial distribution.” Once submitted, withdrawals will take between 3 and 7 days to process. Additionally, some liquidations may take longer depending on the liquidity available at the time of liquidation. Supported cryptocurrencies will be distributed in kind, while unsupported cryptocurrencies will be distributed in USDC. Hage stated, “The initial distributions of cryptocurrency will be made to creditors between three to seven calendar days after a withdrawal request is submitted on the Voyager platform.” Three Arrows Capital Still Owes $650 Million Hage also added that the bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) still owed Voyager around $650 million. The first tranche of withdrawals will allow customers to withdraw just over 35% of their funds. Once completed, the focus of the proceedings will shift to recovering additional assets that can be distributed to creditors. Furthermore, an additional $445 million in customer funds could be made available to creditors. However, this depends on a final resolution of Alameda Research’s preference claim against Voyager, which will happen sometime in September 2023. “Meditation between @investvoyager and @FTX_Official is anticipated to not start until Fall 2023. Anything less than 100% return would be a devastating result for Voyager creditors!” Voyager’s Bankruptcy Struggles Voyager had filed for bankruptcy on the 5th of July, 2022. The company then filed two prior bankruptcy plan proposals, both of which fell through. The first proposal was to the United States arm of FTX. However, this deal fell through after FTX itself filed for bankruptcy. The second was a $1 billion deal with Binance.US. This deal fell through after Binance.US backed out of the deal, citing an uncertain and hostel regulatory climate prevailing in the US. At the time, Binance.US stated in a Twitter communication, “Binance.US has made the difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager. While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager’s customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community.” Voyager had expressed disappointment with the outcome, stating, “Today, we received a letter from Binance.US terminating the asset purchase agreement. While this development is disappointing, our Chapter 11 plan allows for direct distribution of cash and crypto to customers (a “toggle option”) via the Voyager platform.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420266,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGej,1686836802,It’s OK to Think of Crypto as a Macro Market,"Cryptocurrency markets are macro markets.  Despite this assertion, I find that many digital asset investors get lost in this nascent market’s minutia. I’m not discounting the regulatory, operational, or custodial challenges unique to the new market, let alone the high volatility of the asset class and 24/7 market hours. These are essential issues to consider when committing client capital. However, many analysts appear to place more emphasis on cryptography details, TVL (“total value locked”) and on-chain activity rather than spending time studying the broader macro environment.  This bottoms-up approach may stem from the early days of crypto markets when there were limited correlations with traditional asset classes. However, with the total market capitalization of digital assets averaging above $1 trillion over the past two years, evaluating the macro backdrop is becoming unavoidable.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  Last year’s market performance made this clear. Digital assets like bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) suffered when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in response to economic conditions.  To demonstrate the efficacy of macro signals in navigating digital asset markets, I constructed a composite basket of macro indicators. I began by selecting some typical macro market rates, specifically front-end interest rates, inflation-adjusted interest rates (“real yields”), U.S. dollar exchange rate baskets, and U.S. corporate credit spreads. It’s worth mentioning that these rates are typically used within broader indices that are widely watched.  To form a forward-looking perspective on this selected macro data, I generated moving-average trend signals, which served as the foundation for the macroeconomic view. I then assigned positive or negative values to the changes in these markets that result in the relaxing of financial conditions. Lowering nominal and real interest rates, weakening of the U.S. dollar, and tightening of corporate credit spreads were all classified as easing of financial conditions, and expected to have a positive impact on digital assets. Likewise, rising nominal/real interest rates, a strengthening dollar, and widening of corporate credit spreads were classified as tightening of financial conditions, likely leading to a negative impact.  With a newly constructed macro indicator data series in hand, I conducted a hypothetical backtest to assess the usefulness of a macro signal in dynamically allocating to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin was chosen as a proxy for crypto assets due to its status as the oldest and consistently largest token in the market by market cap, and I used the CoinDesk Indices Bitcoin XBX index as a global price for bitcoin.  I combined the macro signal (ranging from -1 to +1) with a 50% allocation to bitcoin to create a long-only dynamic strategy, with the Bitcoin weight varying from 0 to 100%. The remainder of the simulated portfolio is placed into a short-term cash ETF.  Over the five years of the hypothetical backtest period, it’s clear that keeping an eye on macroeconomic conditions can help reduce risk and improve risk-adjusted performance versus a buy-and-hold bitcoin approach.  This is particularly pronounced during crypto bear markets (“winters”) such as 2018 and 2022, where all three components of the macro trend signal minimized crypto allocations during tightening financial conditions. Both credit and foreign exchange (FX) market signals were also able to navigate through the COVID market drawdown. In contrast, the real yields signal was more reactive to reduce crypto exposure during 2022, highlighting the benefit of a diversified combined macro signal.  While there is always some benefit of hindsight baked into any backtest, it’s apparent that digital asset investors can gain from incorporating macro insights derived from more traditional asset classes to aid in navigating a market as cyclical as cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/15/its-ok-to-think-of-crypto-as-a-macro-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8778d1f2dda4ed2338d780283993f8260ddcc332-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s the on-chain indicator that may have signaled this dip in advance. Ethereum Age Consumed Metric Saw A Spike Before The Price Decline According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, institutional investors look to have been expecting the move to take place. The indicator of interest here is the “ETH age consumed,” which first finds the total number of coins moving on the Ethereum blockchain. Then it multiplies this value by the days these coins had been dormant before their movement. So, in this way, the metric keeps track of how many coins are being sold/moved each day and uses their age as a weighting factor. This means that many old coins are moved to the network whenever this indicator’s value is high. Naturally, low values of the metric, on the other hand, would imply that there aren’t many coins moving on the chain right now or some coins with a low average age are being transferred. Related Reading: XRP And Ethereum Seeing Increased Social Media Talk As Bitcoin Loses Interest Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum age consumed over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum age consumed metric had recently registered a very large spike. This would suggest the potential movement of many dormant coins on the chain during this surge. Generally, when such large spikes in the indicator are observed, it’s a sign of selling from the long-term holders (LTHs). The LTH cohort includes all the investors holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. These holders are the experienced hands in the market who don’t easily sell even when the market is distressed. Because of this reason, their movements can be something to watch out for, as when they do finally sell, it’s usually not a positive sign for the price. The chart shows that the LTHs had also shown a large move earlier in the month. Shortly after these investors became active, the cryptocurrency price plunged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment On Social Media Now Most Red Since COVID Crash, Bottom Signal? This time, the spike in the Ethereum age consumed also seems to have preceded a price decline, as the cryptocurrency’s value has now dropped below the $1,700 level. This latest price plunge has come after the news that the US Federal Reserve isn’t raising interest rates this time, but more hikes would be coming later in the year to fight inflation. Santiment suggests that the spike in the age consumed metric before the price decline could imply that the institutions already expected the move, hence why they shifted their coins early.

42420260,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGcf,1686834000,"Polkadot Revamps Governance System, Removes ‘First Class Citizen’ Voting Groups","Polkadot, an interconnected network of public blockchains, streamlined its governance model to allow voting on multiple issues to take place simultaneously with everything being directly controlled by the community.  Polkadot OpenGov, introduced on Thursday, will abolish so-called first class citizens like the Polkadot Council, an elected entity that could propose referenda and approve spending proposals, and the Technical Committee, which fast-tracked certain referenda.  Living up to its next-generation blockchain moniker, Polkadot and its sister ""canary"" network Kusama have learned the lessons of earlier systems, such as Ethereum. Getting decentralized governance to scale is a problem organizations like MakerDAO, for example, have been grappling with for some time.  Replacing the Polkadot Council and Technical Committee is a new, elected body named the Polkadot Fellowship, that has no hard power over the network and cannot change parameters or move assets. The Fellowship has 45 members and is likely to keep growing as core developers submit their candidacy.  To remove bottlenecks in the existing system, multiple voting proposal tracks can take place simultaneously, explained Joe Petrowski, System Parachains Team Lead at Web3 Foundation.  “The previous governance system could only take one referendum at a time with the default that each one lasted for 28 days, so you could only get 12 or 13 of these through a year,” Petrowski said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That pace makes sense for sensitive things like system upgrades, but not for when somebody wants to make a treasury proposal or start a new auction for a parachain.”  OpenGov comes to Polkadot after being tested on Kusama for six months.  CORRECTION (June 15, 13:37 UTC): Corrects spelling of Petrowski in penultimate two paragraphs.

42420248,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGRJ,1686834000,Polygon Labs Rolls Out Open Database for Blockchain Use Cases,"Polygon Labs, the Ethereum scaling platform, has released an open database that shows positive use cases of blockchain on any application from across the world, it announced on Thursday.  Called ""The Value Prop,"" the database hosts as many as 39 use cases and over 300 applications, with numbers expected to increase. Polygon Labs conceived the project as a “Wikipedia for use cases.”  ""This is just the beginning. It's not like this is going to be a stagnant website,"" said Rebecca Rettig, Chief Policy Officer at Polygon Labs in a pre-launch interview with CoinDesk. ""It's going to grow as people see it and say, 'Oh, we want more applications that are on Solana to be listed on here. Please put them up on the website.'""  The clamor for use cases has been growing among regulators as jurisdictions grapple with the challenge of framing legislation that not only supports innovation but also protects citizens.  ""We need to see a body of use cases of blockchain that reflect the power of the technology without the vulnerabilities of crypto to tilt the discussion in favor of positive regulation intended for mass adoption,"" one policymaker from the Group of 20 (G20) told CoinDesk. Earlier this year, Singapore's central bank started a pilot program to explore use cases of digital assets in tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi).  Rettig said this could shift the narrative from how regulators can't potentially see beyond the ""sort of crypto casinos"" at a time when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sued the world's largest exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  ""It'll be very useful for policymakers but there's also this general feeling, what's blockchain good for and what problems does it solve, and this is hopefully an answer to that in a general way.""  Regulators have asked for the industry to decouple blockchain and its use cases from crypto but Rettig said that ""when there is a fundamental value, you don't have to decouple yourself,"" citing the example of the UNICEF CryptoFund which shares donations with those in need through crypto, allowing the funds to be tracked publicly.  The use cases are categorized under seven different verticals – education, security & risk management, social impact & sustainability, finance, business & marketing, governance and information technology.  The platform will also hold a testimonials page showcasing written and video messages from people on how blockchain impacted their life positively.

42420256,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGXV,1686834000,Mining Pools Are the New Mixers For Cybercriminals: Chainalysis,"Ransomware hackers have a new money-laundering trick: mining new coins to replace “tainted” ones, blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in a blog post on Thursday.  The firm located 372 exchange deposit wallets that received both mining profits and ransomware proceeds, Chainalysis wrote. These addresses altogether have received $158.3 million from ransomware-related wallets since 2018.  “Overall, the data suggests that mining pools may play a key role in many ransomware actors’ money laundering strategy,” Chainalsysis wrote  This fashion of money laundering is becoming increasingly popular, with ransomware-related wallets sending more and more funds to mining pools since 2018.  Chainalsysis gives an example of a deposit wallet on an unnamed popular crypto exchange that received large amounts of crypto from ransomware incidents and mining pools. Of the $94.2 million worth of cryptocurrency sent to that deposit address, $19.1 million has come from ransomware addresses and $14.1 million has come from mining pools, Chainalysis calculated.  Although the funds always came to the exchange via intermediary wallets, Chainalysis found instances in which the wallet receiving ransomware proceeds sent funds directly to the mining pool wallet, which then sent the coins to the exchange. This might mean that both the ransomware- and mining-related wallets belong to the same owner, who is using mining as a way to launder criminal funds, Chainalysis wrote.  “In this scenario, the mining pool acts similarly to a mixer in that it obfuscates the origin of funds (reminder: you can’t trace crypto through services, mining pools included) and creates the illusion that the funds are proceeds from mining rather than from ransomware,” the blog post reads.  The BitClub Network scam, which pretended to be operating a crypto mining business until its operators were indicted by the DOJ in 2020, also used this scheme, Chainalysis wrote. The wallets attributed to BitClub used the same set of deposit address on two exchanges as “a Russia-based Bitcoin mining operation,” Chainalysis wrote, without naming the mining firm.  This might have been a trick to make exchanges believe that the funds are coming from mining, not from crime, Chainalsysis wrote. Exchange deposit addresses that received money both from scams and mining pools received a little less than $1.1 billion worth of crypto since 2018, according to the firm.  The North Korean hacking group APT43, also referred as Archipelago, is also investing the crypto it steals into mining, cyber security firm Mandiant said in a report earlier this year.

The result of this collaboration is the conception of the Blockchain-eCommerce Centre of Excellence, a hub for research and development. The center's primary focus is to navigate the nascent landscape of Web3 and the metaverse, mapping out the next phase of digital commerce.The Indian digital commerce heavyweight is partnering with Polygon Labs and Hang, a leading next-generation loyalty platform, to introduce a specialized loyalty program named FireDrops 2.0. Aiming to reinvent the wheel of customer engagement and loyalty, FireDrops 2.0, powered by Hang's loyalty platform, will use underlying non-fungible token (NFT) technology to incentivize millions of Flipkart users through gamification. The application of Web3 and NFTs to brand loyalty programs is expected to revolutionize brand marketing, storytelling, and customer engagement. Polygon x Flipkart: Loyalty NFTs via FireDrops The use of NFTs in the program allows for easy ownership and redemption of rewards, thereby generating new revenue streams for brands and enabling customers to participate actively in the loyalty ecosystem. The FireDrops program also envisions a dynamic marketplace where users can buy and sell rewwards, bringing flexibility to loyalty programs and enhancing brand engagement. FireDrops 2.0 aims to offer an immersive experience to users, enticing them with surprises, games, and rewards related to their favorite brands. These interactions could allow users to earn benefits like membership passes, lifetime discounts, and more, fosterling deeper connections between users and brands. The partnerships underscores Flipkart's commitment to fostering innovation and expanding its tech offerings to transform the experience of online shopping for millions worldwide. As Flipkart steps into the Web3 arena, it is set to reshape the contours of commerce, consumption, and value generation in the digital world. Jeyandran Venugopal, the Chief Product and Technology Officer at Flipkart, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership: “Innovation is one of the main pillars for Flipkart and we have consistently worked towards technology solutions to scale new frontiers and introduce new products and services,” Venugopal shares. Previously, Flipkart made its maiden voyage into the metaverse through eDAO, a project nurtured by Polygon. The venture, known as ""Flipverse,"" has played a crucial role in redefining the dynamic between brands and consumers. It promotes novel, interactive experiences via non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Additionally, Flipkart's FireDrops—an accessible platform for NFTs—cultivates a space where creators, brands, and consumers can delve into the multi-dimensional value of NFTs. Prominent brands such as Adidas, Adobe, Robinhood, and Stripe have already chosen Polygon as their entry point to Web3. Flipkart's decision to align with this flourishing ecosystem underscores its forward-thinking approach to harnessing the potential of blockchain. Polygon's recent developments, notably the zkEVM scaling solution, will be pivotal in accommodating the global influx of users in Web3's next chapter. Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon's co-founder, praised the partnership when it first began sometime in late 2022, sharing that Polygon: ""serves as the bridge to Web3 for the world's biggest corporations. Our goal is to shepherd the next billion users into Web3, so our partnership with Flipkart to create the Blockchain-eCommerce Centre of Excellence is an exciting prospect."" Nailwal adds that Polygon recognizes the sheer amount of blockchain talent to be found in the country, and that such a resource forms opportunities for the partnership to stimulate R&D, and further ""solidify India's stature as a Web3 titan."" Polygon's Current Regulatory Predicament Polygon recently launched its Version 2.0 amid the troubles that it's currently facing with SEC's claim of $MATIC being a security. The crypto firm is currently expanding its efforts at privacy, and has since launched a zero-knowledge identity infrastructure program for Web3 with PolygonID. In response to the SEC's allegations, trading platform Robinhood took the step of delisting Solana, Cardano, and Polygon, effective from June 27. However, it reassured its users that the removal would be restricted to SOL, ADA, and MATIC, and no other coins on the platform would be affected. Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS) were the other tokens implicated, as regulatory scrutiny also hit major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase.

Egorov previously deposited $24 million worth of CRV tokens to Aave on Monday. However, bearish sentiment in the broader crypto market has since caused prices of several tokens – including CRV – to drop more than 10% on a weekly basis.  The partial payback eases risks associated with the large loan. The recent decline in Curve's CRV token, with a 24% weekly decrease and a current trading price of 57 cents, has raised concerns about potential liquidation and selling pressure.  As of Thursday, the wallet holds over 288.7 million Curve DAO (CRV) tokens, valued at $167 million at current prices, and has around 60.7 million USDT borrowed against it.  This position represents over 30% of the total CRV token supply and has drawn attention among some Crypto Twitter community members for the risks it may present to the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) sector were it to be liquidated.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Cryptocurrencies fell sharply late Wednesday and into Thursday, with bitcoin dropping below $25,000 and Polygon’s MATIC, and Cardano’s ADA extending 24-hour declines to as much as 9% and 8%, respectively. This comes following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve policy decision at which the central bank suspended rate hikes for at least one meeting, but signaled it expects further monetary tightening before the end of the year. Bitcoin could see further short-term losses, according to LMAX Digital’s morning note. “As per our technical insights in today’s update, any additional setbacks in the price of bitcoin should be well supported ahead of $22K.”  Paying interest on or surcharges for using a digital euro would be banned under a draft law seen by CoinDesk, and set to be proposed by the European Commission on June 28. The proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) would have to be available for cash-style offline payments from day one, and users shouldn’t be able to program it to limit onward use, the leaked bill said. “The digital euro shall be available for both online and offline digital euro payment transactions as of the first issuance of the digital euro,” said the text viewed by CoinDesk. The level of privacy for offline, face-to-face use should be “comparable” to withdrawing banknotes at an ATM, it said.  The Middle Eastern arm of OKX, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has received an MVP Preparatory license from the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA). OKX Middle East has already taken up residence in a new office in Dubai World Trade Center, and says it plans to expand the number of staff to 30, with a focus on local hires and senior management. Once the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) license becomes fully operational, OKX Middle East will provide spot, derivatives and fiat services, including U.S. dollar and United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) deposits, withdrawals and spot-pairs, the company said in a press release.  Chart of The Day  The chart shows total value locked in Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has declined to $3.29 billion, the lowest since March 2021.  Investors are pulling capital from BSC-based projects in the wake of the U.S. SEC's crackdown on Binance.

13832338,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538109,1686830718,Here’s Why The Tether FUD Could Be Good For Bitcoin,"The Bitcoin market is once again in turmoil, and the reason is an old acquaintance: no, not the US Federal Reserve, but the worries and rumors about Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. Anyone who has been active in the Bitcoin and crypto market for a while knows that rumors about USDT’s lack of backing are part of every bear market. And this bear market seems to mean it particularly “well” as the Tether FUD is now making a reappearance in this cycle. As NewsBTC reported earlier today, USDT has slightly lost its peg to the US dollar as the Curve 3Pool has lost its balance. The reason for this is that whales are selling USDT and trading it for USDC as well as DAI. However, according to Tether CTO Paolo Arduino, the company is “ready to redeem any amount 1:1 against US dollars”. Historically, the de-pegging of USDT is not an uncommon occurrence. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin focused company JAN3, writes: Tether FUD is always the FUD bottom. It’s what they pull out when there’s nothing left. Up soon. Analyst Miles Deutscher has a similar view. He explained: “Fun Fact: Stablecoin FUD often marks local bottoms,” and shared the following chart. Bottom Signal For The Bitcoin Price? As can be seen in the chart, the Tether FUD first surfaced at the end of June 2022. At the time, news emerged that hedge fund Fir Tree Capital Management was shorting Tether after the Terra ecosystem stablecoin Terra USD collapsed. Contrary to speculation, however, Tether was able to process all USDT redemptions, even though the value of USDT had fallen to $0.9520 temporarily. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) De-Pegs As Crypto Market Stumbles, More Downside Coming? In mid-November 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bankrupt after its competitor Binance backed out of a purchase agreement. The Tether FUD hit a 6-month high and the price of USDT fell to $0.9970. Again, Tether was able to handle all redemptions, while the market found a local bottom. Most recently, USDC depegging provided the local bottom signal in March this year. The event was caused by the collapse of the counterparty from stablecoin issuer Circle, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Crypto whales had also tried to take profits from the situation at the time, while other USDC holders sold out of panic. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hammered Below $25,000 Amid Fed’s Hawkish Tone, SEC Lawsuits Tether emerged as the clear winner from the latter situation and was able to capture large market shares from USDC since then. Most recently, Tether reported huge profits, some of which they are investing in Bitcoin, as NewsBTC reported. This is another reason why crypto expert Thor Hartvigsen believes that the likelihood of Tether not having enough funds to settle all USDT redemptions is “pretty low”, adding: “According to Tether, the company made $1.48b in profits in Q1 alone which brought the reserve surplus to $2.44b. They’ve further been winding down bank deposits (hold less than $0.5b here) and acquired over $53b in US treasuries throughout 2022.” Remarkably, the price of USDT has already returned to its default level at press time. After the USDC/ USDT price on Binance climbed temporarily to $1.0042, it was now already back at $1.0019. As of press time, the Bitcoin price was bucking the Tether FUD and holding slightly above $25,000. However, the drop below the 200-day EMA (blue line) is somewhat critical. Most recently, BTC fell below this indicator which is known as the “bull line” during the USDC de-pegging. Therefore, Bitcoin bulls are advised to stage a similar reaction as in March to prevent a further plunge.

The initiative is part of a blockchain experimentation phase conducted by MinTIC.

DLN uses a global liquidity engine that creates a decentralized order book, enabling any asset on one chain to be traded directly to any asset on another without the bottlenecks and risks of liquidity pools.  Liquidity pools refer to a basket of tokens locked on decentralized exchanges that are used to facilitate trading for those tokens in the open market. DLN uses peer-to-peer liquidity to conduct trades, instead of relying on a liquidity pool.  “For users, DLN offers unprecedented speed, capital-efficiency, and control — all trades are protected from slippage, MEV, the possibility of reversion, and guaranteed rates with fees as low as 4bps,” developers told CoinDesk.  “Users can also set cross-chain limit orders and cancel at any time before fulfillment. A $10,000,000 cross-chain trade, for example, can be executed for the same low rate as a $1,000 trade,” they added.  DLN claimed their app makes it possible for users to trade across chains without exposure to wrapped assets or liquidity pools for the first time – unlike other services on the market that rely on these instruments.

In an update on its website, Delio revealed that it had paused withdrawals due to its funds being inaccessible in Haru. This follows the recent suspension of deposits and withdrawals by Haru itself on June 13, in response to undisclosed complications with one of its service providers. Haru, a platform that offers users up to a 12% return on its Earn Plus product, has yet to provide a detailed explanation regarding the ongoing issues with its service provider. This lack of communication and the subsequent suspension of services have led to speculation and concerns among its users, resulting in a significant surge in withdrawal requests. Delio's CEO, Jung Sang-ho, confirmed this increase in a recent interview with Money Today. He noted that the difficulties Delio was facing resulted from a rapid increase in withdrawal requests following Haru's suspension. Jung Sang-ho also acknowledged a transactional relationship between Delio and Haru, but he refrained from commenting on the specific details, including the total amount involved. Delio's platform offers a range of cryptocurrency lending and borrowing services, with advertised returns of up to 10.7%. According to the claims made on its website, Delio has processed transactions involving significant volumes of cryptocurrencies including 41,700 Bitcoin (valued at approximately $1 billion), 118,000 ether (valued at around $205 million), and $6.2 million worth of various altcoins. The temporary suspension of Delio's withdrawal services has come as a shock to many in the Korean cryptocurrency market, highlighting once again the inherent risks and volatility associated with the industry. The move follows a string of similar incidents involving cryptocurrency platforms globally, underscoring the need for increased transparency, regulation, and security within the cryptocurrency market. These incidents have drawn increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities and have prompted calls for more robust oversight and legislation to protect investors. In many parts of the world, regulators are already working on new frameworks to address these issues and ensure greater security for investors. The events involving Delio and Haru also demonstrate the interconnected nature of many cryptocurrency platforms and services. Problems at one platform can quickly spread to others, causing a ripple effect throughout the industry. This connectivity means that issues at a single platform can lead to broader instability and lack of trust in the market as a whole. As Delio works to resolve the current situation, users of the platform are left in a state of uncertainty, with their funds temporarily locked. The incident underscores the importance of due diligence and careful risk assessment when choosing a cryptocurrency platform, especially those offering higher-than-average returns.

The coin has fallen dramatically since the beginning of June. The network metrics for Cardano are still fairly underwhelming. One of the more interesting projects on Cardano is the ADA-backed DJED stablecoin. DJED's developer was also named in the SEC's Binance for offering an unregistered security via its COTI token. This was a clear outlier compared to the other designations. It's now difficult to find a cryptocurrency with a top 10 market cap that the US Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't think is an unregistered security. The recent SEC lawsuit against Binance (BNB-USD) specifically cited nearly a dozen digital assets that included some of the top altcoins in the market like Solana (SOL-USD), Polygon (MATIC-USD), and Cardano (ADA-USD). Unlike the others mentioned, Cardano is not a network that I've previously covered for Seeking Alpha as I've never found the level of activity on the chain to be all that impressive. However, I think it's fair to wonder if ADA is now more interesting after the dramatic selloff following the SEC's announcement. Data by YCharts After falling nearly 40% from peak to trough in the month of June, ADA is now dramatically underperforming other top crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) or Ethereum (ETH-USD). Network Metrics Unlike most of the other smart contract chains with a top 25 native coin market cap, Cardano doesn't have a significant DeFi footprint with a vibrant stablecoin presence. Coin MC Rank Network TVL Rank Protocols TVL Stables MC/TVL 1 Bitcoin 15 7 $170.45m 2,960 2 Ethereum 1 816 $25.22b $68.67b 8.32 4 Binance 3 612 $3.43b $5.68b 11.31 7 Cardano 19 20 $139.59m $12.58m 69.41 9 Tron ( TRX-USD ) 2 22 $5.37b $44.46b 1.22 10 Polygon 5 426 $887.92m $1.48b 6.84 11 Solana 11 104 $250.89m $1.53b 24.25 Source: DeFi Llama Based purely on the network's market cap to total value locked (MC/TVL), only BTC is more overvalued than Cardano's 69.4 MC/TVL ratio and that's not exactly a fair comparison because Bitcoin has not been positioned as a broad smart contract network. Furthermore, at just $12.6 million in stables on-chain, Cardano is ranked 38th in stablecoin value. Suggesting it's not a network that is used for payments. Cardano Development (Token Terminal) One of the areas where Cardano has generally been impressive compared to peers is in the level of developers and code commits on the chain. With 150 core developers in June, Cardano is well ahead of networks like Polygon, Avalanche (AVAX-USD), or Solana. However, over the last year, that activity has started to trend lower with developers down 8% and code commits down 25% in the last 365 days. Cardano DAUs (Santiment) Over the last several years the price of ADA has generally been well correlated to the number of daily active users of the network. While still well ahead of 2020 levels, Cardano's DAUs figure has rarely been over 80k over the last year while Ethereum scaling chains like Polygon and Arbitrum (ARB-USD) have regularly achieved six-figure DAUs over the last four months. The Unregistered Security Arguments In the Binance lawsuit, the SEC offered some rationale for why the agency believes ADA is an unregistered security. The SEC's argument seems to be centered around the idea that Cardano's developers have led holders to believe the coin has a reasonable expectation of profit: The information publicly disseminated by Cardano, IOHK, and Emurgo—including since the initial sales of ADA—have led ADA holders, including those who purchased ADA since November 2017, reasonably to view ADA as an investment in and expect to profit from the Cardano Foundation’s, IOHK’s, and Emurgo’s efforts to grow the Cardano platform, which, in turn, would increase demand for and value of ADA. Despite that, the majority of ADA holders have generally been underwater throughout Cardano's existence. As of mid-June, just 8% of ADA holders are in the money and over 91% of ADA holders are currently behind: ADA Holders (IntoTheBlock) IOHK responded to the SEC's allegations shortly following the lawsuit announcement but didn't offer many specifics as to what the organization disagreed with: The filing contains numerous factual inaccuracies and will not impact IOG’s operations in any way. Under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been. Understanding how decentralized blockchains operate is a fundamental component in creating responsible legislation. IOG continues to welcome cross-industry collaborations with regulators to help develop frameworks, which not only safeguard consumers, but do not stifle innovation within the communities building decentralized protocols. This latest filing from the SEC demonstrates that we still have a long way to go in this regard. This might be somewhat expected if IOHK anticipates a court battle, but it would be nice to see the organization point out what some of the claimed inaccuracies are. Is the SEC Also After Djed? What I find really interesting about the coins that the SEC selected to highlight in the Binance lawsuit is that COTI (COTI-USD) was picked. COTI is a rather obscure token that is not very well known in the crypto space. Of the coins selected in the lawsuit, it's the only one that doesn't have a circulating market cap in or near the top 50: Token Market Cap (millions) Market Cap Rank SOL $9,640 11 ADA $9,640 7 MATIC $6,070 10 FileCoin (FIL-USD) $1,567 32 Cosmos (ATOM-USD) $3,039 20 Sandbox (SAND-USD) $729 53 Decentraland (MANA-USD) $651 56 Algorand (ALGO-USD) $842 42 Axie Infinity (AXS-USD) $587 60 COTI $56 330 Source: CoinMarketCap, as of 6/14/23 While it's not totally unusual for the SEC to go far down the market cap list when it designates coins as unregistered securities, for me it is odd that COTI was mentioned in the Binance lawsuit given the peers selected - it's a fairly obvious outlier from where I sit. Furthermore, there wasn't much rationale given for COTI's inclusion beyond founder blog posts touting token demand and alleged COTI wash trading on the Binance platform. But allegations of wash trading in crypto coins is certainly not unique to COTI. This is purely speculation on my part, but I suspect COTI's inclusion in that lawsuit might have something to do with the Djed stablecoin that Coti developed. DJED Mechanics (Coti) DJED is a decentralized stablecoin that utilizes ADA as its collateral. The stablecoin project aims for a collateralization ratio between 400-800%. This is an enormous collateralization ratio compared to other decentralized stablecoins like Dai ( DAI-USD ) and likely necessary because it's a single asset collateral coin. The nearly 40% peak to trough drawdown in ADA's coin price that began on June 5th has led to a scenario where DJED's collateralization ratio is now well below the target range at just 313%. The coin's dollar peg briefly broke below 96 cents on June 10th, but it has since recovered and now trades at a 7% premium to $1: DJED (CoinMarketCap) As I mentioned in the opening section, Cardano is not well known for having a large DeFi or stablecoin footprint. So it's interesting to me that the developer of what I view as the most promising chain-native Cardano stablecoin is also mentioned in the Binance lawsuit. Frankly, I don't know what exactly to make of it but I don't think it's a coincidence. DJED is an interesting crypto project because it is one of the few decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoins in a market that is otherwise flooded with fiat-backed coins. If the SEC is aiming to target DJED, lower ADA prices might be the best way to do it. Summary I think the risks with going long ADA are somewhat evident at this point. The market response to coins like MATIC, ADA, and SOL being named unregistered securities speaks for itself. Each of these coins have been absolutely walloped since the beginning of June. By itself, I don't believe this designation from the SEC is a reason to dump out of any of the coins. I believe we'll ultimately see more court challenges and clearer crypto guidelines down the line. In my view, some of these crashes could be opportunities to add to long term positions. In the case of ADA though, from an application standpoint there isn't much to show for all of the development activity that has been apparently happening based on code commits and developer numbers. In the past, critics of Cardano have gone as far as to call it ""vaporware."" I'm not personally willing to go that far because I don't think all blockchain networks have to go with the ""move fast and break things"" approach that can be witnessed elsewhere in the ecosystem. That said, I'm still not ready to call ADA a buy today.",NEUTRAL,ADA | BNB,ADA | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611662-cardano-is-it-time-to-buy-the-weakness?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13830709.jpeg

13830647,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/aaves-proposal-to-freeze-curve-founder-loan-draws-community-ire,1686826500,Aave’s Proposal To Freeze Curve Founder Loans Draws Community Ire,"An Aave proposal intended to prevent a particular account from accumulating more debt has led to significant controversy, with some stating that it violates the principle of neutrality in DeFi. The proposal suggested imposing a cap on using CRV tokens as collateral, preventing the wallet address in question from adding more loans. The Account In Question Many believe that Curve (CRV) founder Michael Egonov owns the account in question. Egonov had begun borrowing stablecoins on Aave in April, beginning with $37 million worth of Tether (USDT) being sent to Bitfinex and a further $51 million in USDC being sent to market maker Wintermute. More recently, Egorov deposited $24 million worth of Curve DAO (CRV) tokens to Aave to mitigate the liquidation risk of a $65 million stablecoin loan. “Seems like Curve’s founder has a $110m leverage position against his $CRV stack across all Defi. If not repaid at some point (spoil: it prob won’t, my man is taking profit), this will cascade into a lot of bad debt for lending protocols.” Liquidation Risk According to the author of the proposal, the address associated with the account (0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428) has gone on to accumulate over $67 million worth of debt in USDC and USDT using the AAVE v2 protocol and putting up $185 million worth of CRV tokens as collateral. The proposal’s author expressed concern that the account could continue increasing its debt, increasing the risk that it could be liquidated if the price of CRV suddenly drops. Adding to the problem is the fact that CRV has suffered a recent decline in liquidity over the past few months. This could lead to considerable slippage if the account is liquidated, as there may not be enough buyers looking to purchase CRV and take on such a significant amount of CRV tokens, leading to millions of dollars worth of bad debt for the Aave protocol. Freeze on CRV As Collateral According to Aave user DecentMuse, the wallet address is tagged as belonging to Michael Egonov, the founder of Curve. According to the user, the loan could be a way for Egonov to take profits from his activities on behalf of Curve. Financial modeling platform Gauntlet, the proposal’s author suggested that the AAVE decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) freeze further use of CRV tokens as collateral for taking out loans. Such a move would allow the account to hold its current loan position but prevent it from accumulating more debt. The proposal found some support among users who criticized the account for taking on so much debt. One user wondered if the account intended to pay off its debt, adding that it constantly added to its position despite the token losing value. Proposal Criticized However, critics of the proposal defended the account. One user suggested that the account owner may believe that CRV tokens are undervalued, leading them to increase their use as collateral as their price declines. Marc Zeller, Aave-Chan Initiative founder, also put forward his views, adding that the AAVE DAO should not violate neutrality, which is one of the core tenets of DeFi. “The intention of users or what they do with their funds is not our primary concern. Users should be free to utilize the protocol as they see fit.” So far, the proposal is only listed as a “recommendation,” meaning it has not yet been turned into an Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP), which the DAO can vote on. However, Gauntlet has stated that turning it into a formal AIP is the next step. An Ongoing Debate There is an ongoing debate in the larger blockchain ecosystem regarding the limits of censorship resistance. In January, Bitcoin saw a similar debate where users complained of high fees caused by some users minting and trading ordinals. Some Bitcoin users wanted a ban on Ordinals, while others opposed a ban, stating it would be censorship. In April, Tether blacklisted an address that drained $25 million from EVM-front-running bots. Jayanti Kanani, Polygon co-founder, stated that the blacklisting could establish a bad precedent and lead to more transactions being censored. However, ZachXBT, the on-chain sleuth, stated that Tether could have been forced to act by a court order. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420258,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGYX,1686825269,"EU’s Leaked Digital Euro Bill Outlaws Interest, Large Holdings, Programmability","Paying interest on or surcharges for using a digital euro would be banned under a draft law seen by CoinDesk, and set to be proposed by the European Commission on June 28.  The proposed central bank digital currency (CBDC) would have to be available for cash-style offline payments from day one, and users shouldn’t be able to program it to limit onward use, the leaked bill said.  “The digital euro shall be available for both online and offline digital euro payment transactions as of the first issuance of the digital euro,” said the text viewed by CoinDesk. The level of privacy for offline, face-to-face use should be “comparable” to withdrawing banknotes at an ATM, it said.  For offline transactions, “neither the European Central Bank nor the payment services providers will gain access to personal transaction data,” though banks who distribute the currency can send financial crime authorities details of how accounts are funded if they suspect money laundering.  Privacy emerged as the number one area of public concern in a 2021 ECB survey, with precedents from China leading many to worry a CBDC could lead to large-scale state snooping.  The EU is one of several jurisdictions worldwide, including the U.S. and U.K., considering whether to issue fiat currency in digital form. After a long period of investigation, the ECB is set to take a decision on whether to press ahead with the CBDC later this year, though executive board member Fabio Panetta has said a decision on proceeding should be a political one rather than for central bankers alone.  Any legislation needed to underpin the CBDC would have to be agreed by the European Parliament, where lawmakers have proved somewhat skeptical, and governments who meet in a body called the Council, who seem unlikely to nix the project all together.  “The Council will not decide or formulate a joint opinion on whether a digital euro should be introduced, at least not in any near future,” a senior EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ahead of talks that are set to continue Thursday. “I would not expect the ECB to go forward against a very skeptical bunch of ministers.”  Mandatory acceptance  As legal tender, the draft law says, shops would have to accept digital euro and not impose any surcharge for using it, unless they are very small businesses or have some other good-faith reason for declining, such as a power outage.  The CBDC “shall not be programmable,” the text added, following concerns that giving the ability to control how given funds are used could limit the freely usable nature of fiat currency.  The text also sets out measures to stop people using digital euro accounts as alternatives to commercial bank savings. Holdings cannot bear interest, and the ECB will be able to impose further controls. Panetta has already said individuals should be limited to holding about 3,000 euros ($3,250) to ensure it is primarily used for day-to-day payments.  “The digital euro settlement infrastructure should seek to ensure adaptation to new technologies, including distributed ledger technology,” the law says – though the ECB has not yet committed to using blockchain to underpin the CBDC.  A version of the draft seen by CoinDesk is set to be approved by the commission at a June 28 meeting, alongside a proposal on the legal status of cash, according to a schedule published by the EU’s executive branch.

CleanSpark is trying to improve its hashrate, become more efficient, and gain scale ahead of this event. Given the level of price where Bitcoin has to go for miners to breakeven with the halving, I think an investment in Bitcoin itself is now the much better play. Back in early March , I placed a “Buy” rating on CleanSpark ( CLSK ), saying the company should greatly benefit from lower natural gas prices and the purchase of discounted mining equipment. With the stock up over 50% since then, let’s take a closer look at the name. Company Profile As a quick reminder, CLSK is a Bitcoin miner. The company got into the Bitcoin mining arena through the acquisition of ATL in December 2020, and has since picked up more data center and mining equipment since. The company owns and operates its facilities, and doesn’t lease any space to anyone else. Its main campus is located on over 16 acres in Georgia. It also has some miners in New York from a co-location agreement it has with Coinmint. The company doesn’t participate in regular Bitcoin trading, nor does it hedge its holdings. It does, however, sell the Bitcoin it mines to help support its operations and fund growth. Management does not use any specific formula or program to determine when to sell any Bitcoin. Looking For Efficiency Gains Currently, CLSK is in a race to increase efficiency and improve its hashrate. As a reminder, in simplistic terms, for Bitcoin mining the hashrate is a measure of how quickly a set of computers can guess a random code to obtain a Bitcoin. More computing power gives crypto-miners the ability to make more guesses per second, enabling them to earn more Bitcoin. However, as more Bitcoins are mined, the codes become more difficult, requiring more computing power to maintain the same hashrate. CLK has been aggressively adding to its computing power ahead of the block reward being cut in half to 3.125 Bitcoin from 6.25 Bitcoin, which is expected to happen in April of next year. It’s in rapid growth mode to add computing power, increase efficiency, and gain scale before this event. On its Q2 earnings call , CEO Zachary Bradford said: “At CleanSpark, we are positioning our self to take full advantage of the halving by ensuring that we are among the most efficient miners in the industry. Right now, our fleet average is 31 watts per terahash. As the XPs we ordered last month are delivered and come online, we expect our fleet-wide efficiency to accelerate, landing us at or below 26 watts per terahash on a fleet average. As I mentioned, efficiency will be one of the most important metrics for analyzing miner health, as we near Bitcoin halving. Let me take a moment to share with you how we are preparing ourselves to capitalize on the events surrounding halving, preparing maybe two passive award."" In fact, we are training for halving, as with any big race, the real work starts months and months before the meeting the starting line.“ As I discussed in my original write-up, CLSK was taking advantage of a distressed mining equipment market earlier this year to purchase new mining equipment at a discount. On its May earnings call, the company had future orders set for 20,000 Bitmain S19 J Pro pluses and 45,000 XPs. The company said it called the bottom on prices for XPs, and that it was the lowest price for XPs on record. It said it should get a great ROI on the investment, and that it has now largely locked in most of its expansion CapEx. The company is in the process of expanding both its Washington and Sandersville facilities. The Washington expansion is expected to go live soon in Mid-June. The Sandersville expansion is expected to make it one of the largest Bitcoin mining data centers in the country, and the company is hoping it gets completed in October. The company has already has 99% of the machines for the expansions under contract or in transit. Lower energy costs was another area I discussed as a potential tailwind for CLSK. On that front, the company did see its energy costs go down -16% sequentially in Q2. However, costs were still higher year over year, and the company should have ability to see even lower prices given the drop in natural gas prices. This was one area, though, I was hoping would have been better. Of course the price of Bitcoin will play a big role in how CLSK performs as well. It mined less Bitcoin in Q2 versus a year ago, but it generated 14% more revenue due to higher Bitcoin prices. How Bitcoin prices react in anticipation of the “halvening” will play a large role in how CLSK performs. With a mining cost of $11,700 per Bitcoin in Q2 and over $9,500 per Bitcoin in other expenses not including D&A, mining at current prices after the halving isn’t very attractive. Even if CLSK becomes more efficient, you’d still need prices of well over $40,000 to make it worthwhile. Conclusion With CLSK up over 50% since my initial write-up, I think the smart move is to take profits. Given the level of price where Bitcoin has to go for miners to breakeven with the halving, I think an investment in Bitcoin itself is now the much better play at this time. Bitcoin is just under $26,000, so it would have to move over 50% for many miners to just be able to breakeven, and that excludes D&A, so it should really be an even higher bar. And given that CLSK doesn’t hold much Bitcoin, it won’t benefit as much from the move. In addition, the company is still likely going to be diluting shareholders through its ATM program, so now seems like the right time to exit. Interestingly, much of Bitcoin's gains from past halving events have come after the event, more so than in anticipation of the event. Cointelegraph CNBC I’m going to take my rating on CLSK from “Buy” to “Neutral,” and would funnel any profits into Bitcoin itself.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4611673-cleanspark-downgrading-after-50-percent-move?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/13829623.jpeg
42420252,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGVR,1686824010,Bitcoin Halving History Provides Little Guidance on Outcome: Coinbase,"It is possible that the next bitcoin (BTC) halving, expected in second-quarter 2024, will have a positive impact on the cryptocurrency’s performance, but that’s not a foregone conclusion, Coinbase (COIN) said in a report Wednesday.  “Getting a clear picture of how markets reacted to previous bitcoin halving episodes requires disentangling the effect of liquidity, rates and U.S. dollar movements,” analyst David Duong wrote.  The halving of the block reward is often viewed positively because it enhances bitcoin’s “prospective scarcity” and supports its supply/demand dynamics, the note said. When bitcoin halving occurs, rewards are cut by 50%.  Still, with only three recorded halving events in the past, evidence of how markets react is limited, the note added. It is difficult to see a clear pattern, particularly as the events were “contaminated by factors like global liquidity measures,” the report said.  Coinbase says global liquidity appears to have peaked in the near term, noting that there's still another 9-10 months till the next halving, “which makes it unclear what the net effect on bitcoin’s price behavior might be.”  Retail demand for the largest cryptocurrency is likely to remain strong ahead of the event, according to Wall Street giant JPMorgan (JPM).

The UAE is a key strategic growth and business hub for OKX globally and in the region, and the company plans to scale OKX Middle East's operations. As part of this effort, OKX has opened a new office in Dubai World Trade Center, and will seek to expand its number of Dubai staff to 30 with a focus on local hires and senior management. OKX also plans to extend its nine-figure brand partnerships to the UAE with customer and fan-focused activations and activities. The MVP preparatory licence allows approved licensees to fulfill all pre-conditions required to undertake MVP operations within the VARA regime. Once licensed to be operational, OKX Middle East will be able to extend its approved suite of duly regulated virtual assets activities and will provide spot, derivatives, and fiat services, including USD and AED deposits, withdrawals and spot-pairs, to institutional and qualified retail customers.

Licensing in Dubai is a critical element of OKX’s global regulatory compliance strategy. In today’s uncertain market environment, it's of the utmost importance for VASPs to be highly secure, transparent, compliant and backed by strong, clear regulation. Under VARA’s comprehensive framework, all operators must meet high standards of compliance, risk management, security and consumer protection, benchmarked against well-known existing regulatory principles for traditional financial services. This provides confidence to operators and customers alike, and positions the crypto and Web3 industry in MENA for increased participation and overall growth in the near and long term.”OKX Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said: ""We've been waiting to enter the UAE and we want people here to experience our products first hand.

However, crypto continues its downward slide. Fed intervention A Fed pivot is on the horizon even though it may not start to actually reduce interest rates until next year. This was certainly coming given that the current mad series of interest rate hikes is forcing the economy into recession. Never before has the Fed tightened as quickly and as harshly as this following Biden and Yellen’s claims back in July of 2021 that inflation was only “temporary”. History tells us that our boom and bust cycles are caused by government and central bank manipulation of credit, and that government intervention in the markets is always a bad thing and could probably be said to be axiomatic. Attempted eradication of crypto In such a chaotic world where the dollar and all other fiat currencies are being debased like crazy, it appears that the last thing the US government needs is the slightest hint of competition to its currency. It could be argued that the government sees this competition coming on two fronts. It is now understanding the full import of cryptocurrencies - which might be classified as a type of private money. After huge successes for some cryptocurrencies, admittedly mostly driven by hype and speculation, the US government has probably decided to try and eradicate them through the auspices of its enforcement agencies (SEC and CFTC). A systemic attack on the crypto ecosystem is now taking place and lacking liquidity and with many crypto investors fleeing the sector the market is bleeding out. Bitcoin unassailable? However, there is one cryptocurrency that even the US government would have the devil of a job in taking down, and that is bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most decentralised and secure private money that exists in the world today, and given that it runs purely on code there is nothing any government or agency can do to stop it. Be that as it may, the rest of the market is obviously having an effect on bitcoin as large crypto businesses run into difficulties with sizable chunks of bitcoin on their books, and Mt Gox and the US government are selling their bitcoin into the market. Once this selling pressure is gone though it might be expected that bitcoin would begin a dramatic rise as investors rush out of a worsening dollar, to say nothing of the rest of the fiat currencies. BRICS currency on the horizon The other front where the US can expect huge competition is from the BRICS nations. In August, at a Summit in South Africa, these nations are expected to announce a new currency which could be backed by gold and/or other commodities, or could even become a rival reserve currency to the dollar by having its own deep and liquid bond market, with the bonds bought by citizens in 20 or so countries that are in or on the point of joining the BRICS nations. So whether it be Bitcoin or the BRICS nations, the dollar is likely to undergo the most profound and serious rivalry since it came into existence. With the unpayable debts owed by the US government and nothing but thin air and promises backing the currency, a new world order may be on the way.

13827986,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538063,1686820519,"Tether (USDT) De-Pegs As Crypto Market Stumbles, More Downside Coming?","The Bitcoin and crypto markets are deep in the red today. Even though the US Federal Reserve announced the hoped-for interest rate pause yesterday, the release of the updated dot plot was a nasty surprise for the financial markets. The Fed revealed in its updated dot plot that it sees the average terminal interest rate at 5.6% instead of 5.1% for 2023. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell explained, almost all FOMC members think further hikes are reasonable. And the resulting price slump in the crypto markets is also having an impact on Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, at the moment. Tether (USDT) De-Pegs Slightly USDT has slightly lost its peg to the US dollar at the time of writing. On Binance, the USDC / USDT exchange rate was at 1.0030. The reason for this seems to be Curve’s 3Pool, which is one of the most important pools for stablecoin trading in decentralized finance. Currently USDT accounts for 73.79% of the Curve 3Pool, DAI for 13.05% and USDC for 13.16%. Apparently, users are rushing to exchange tens of millions of USDT in favor of the stablecoins USD Coin (USDC) and Dai (DAI). The ideal balance of the Curve 3Pool should be 33.33% for each of the three stablecoins. Due to the imbalance, USDT is currently de-pegging. Related Reading: Crypto Market Bleeds As SEC Pressures Mount, Is It Time To Buy? Chinese journalist Collin Wu also reports that in Aave V2, the USDT lending rate skyrocketed, including the deposit rate by more than 20% and the loan rate by more than 30%. Some big whales are borrowing USDT on Aave and selling it on DEX like Curve. One of them is Ethereum whale @samczsun. He borrowed 31.5 million USDT from Aave V2 using 17,000 ETH and 14,000 stETH as collateral, and then exchanged all the borrowed USDT for USDC on 1inch. The borrower then deposited USDC 10 million and USDC 21 million to V2 and V3 respectively. This guy then borrowed 12 million USDT from V3 and deposited it with V2. Wu further explains: Twenty minutes after czsamsun.eth borrowed USDT, another address (0xd2…0701) mortgaged 52,200 stETH through Aave V2 and borrowed 50 million USDC, using USDC>USDT de-peg, with a few million USDC converts USDC from Curve to USDT in batches at a time, and each operation can obtain an additional 1000-8000 USDT. However, Tether CTO Paolo Arduino remains calm. On Twitter, he commented that “markets are edgy in these days,” adding: “so it’s easy for attackers to capitalize on this general sentiment. But at Tether we’re ready as always. Let them come. We’re ready to redeem any amount.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hammered Below $25,000 Amid Fed’s Hawkish Tone, SEC Lawsuits The last time Curve 3Pool was unbalanced was in mid-March, when the balance of USDC and DAI rose to over 45% each. Moreover, there was also an imbalance in November 2022 when FTX and in May 2022 when the Terra ecosystem collapsed. Will The Crypto Market Continue To Fall? Bitcoin, as the leading indicator for the crypto market, is in a critical situation. For the first time since the mid-March crash, the BTC price has fallen below the extremely important 200-day EMA (blue line). A recapture of the price level currently at $25,290 could be of high importance to create a recovery similar to mid-March 2023.

The SEC had moved to expand its definition of an exchange in 2022. What’s The SEC’s Problem With Crypto? The Securities and Exchange Commission has been relentless in its dogged pursuit of everything crypto. In its latest salvo, the regulatory body sued Coinbase in a New York federal court. In its lawsuit, the agency alleged that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker and exchange and demanded that it be “permanently restrained and enjoined” from doing so. The lawsuit came just a day after the SEC had sued Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao. The SEC in its press release, stated, “Since 2019, Coinbase has been engaging in an unregistered securities offering through its staking-as-a-service program, which allows customers to earn profits from the “proof of stake” mechanisms of certain blockchains and Coinbase’s efforts.” The crypto markets have been fairly nervous since the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, just a day before its action against Coinbase. According to the SEC, Binance mishandled funds and lied to investors and regulators about operations, a claim Binance refutes. Coinbase Demands Clarity Coinbase has pushed back against the Securities and Exchange Commission, urging it to provide better clarity for the crypto industry. The SEC has responded to Coinbase’s call for clarity, stating that it requires four months or 120 days to respond. The response comes after a barrage of court filings by both, Coinbase and the SEC. Coinbase had filed a writ of Mandamus against the regulatory body after it stated that it was “in no hurry” to respond to the exchange’s demand for regulatory clarity. Coinbase had accused the agency of wilfully ignoring its request for immediate clarity. Prior to this, the SEC had responded to a previous petition stating that it would not give in to the exchange’s demands. SEC’s Proposed Definition Change In 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to expand its definition of an exchange. In April 2023, the agency reopened its comment period of the proposal, adding that this was needed as it planned to “fold in DeFi and crypto.” SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated that this would help address comments on proposals from market participants, particularly those associated with the crypto markets. Coinbase has been pushing back against the SEC, especially since the agency sued the exchange, alleging it was offering its users unregistered securities. In a letter to the SEC, Coinbase stated that it has no authority to ban an entire industry. “As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, an agency’s authority to regulate a particular industry does not include the authority to ban that industry, absent clear Congressional authorization.” Coinbase also criticized the SEC’s decision to include crypto and DeFi under its planned exchanges definition. The updated definition also applies to more traditional market makers. The exchange stated that it was especially concerned with the proposal’s potential impact on decentralized exchanges (DEX). In its letter to the SEC, the exchange stated, “The proposed rule, as applied to DEXs, would be just such an impossible requirement. When creating a DEX, a software developer typically writes the code that creates the DEX and then publishes the code onto a public, permissionless blockchain, along with a mechanism for widely distributing the governance tokens that enable holders to alter select elements of the DEX going forward. Criticism From All Quarters The SEC’s proposed exchange definition has come under heavy criticism from all quarters. Critics include the Blockchain Association, Paradigm, DeFi Education Fund (DEF), and Republicans from the House Financial Services Committee, some of whom have urged the SEC to withdraw the proposal. Paradigm stated that a DEX, particularly one using an automated market maker mechanism, does not involve any intermediary between buyers and sellers, adding that it used algorithms to balance crypto pools. It urged the agency to withdraw the proposal, stating, “We write to request that the Commission withdraw its proposed redefinition of ‘exchange’ and begin its consideration of how to adapt its regulations in the DeFi context anew — after rigorous economic analysis, genuine, broad engagement with the industry, and a close look at the limits of its statutory jurisdiction.” Paradigm, the Blockchain Association, and Coinbase have also argued that the SEC has violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The APA governs and guides how agencies devise and implement regulations. “The rule change is vague and ambiguous, and the range of activities that may be captured within its scope are not yet fully fleshed out.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The cryptocurrency experienced a significant drop earlier this week, plunging to $0.00000543, even breaching the 2021 lows of $0.00000510. This decline triggered worries and sparked debates among market participants, questioning whether SHIB has the potential to recover from its recent losses. However, all eyes are not solely fixated on SHIB’s price movements. Many are looking toward the US Federal Reserve for potential signals that could impact the future of this meme coin. The Fed’s actions and monetary policy decisions have far-reaching effects on the broader financial landscape, and cryptocurrencies are not immune to their influence. Shiba Inu Price Watch Amid Fed Deliberations Currently, there is a sense of optimism among central bank market observers, as they anticipate a likely dovish stance and a pause on rate hikes from the Fed. If this expectation materializes, it could potentially alleviate the negative sentiment surrounding the coin and provide a favorable environment for a reversal of recent losses. Investors and supporters of the meme coin are hopeful that a more accommodative monetary policy from the central bank would contribute to renewed interest and confidence in SHIB, ultimately driving its price upwards. Shiba Inu is currently priced at $0.00000655 according to CoinMarketCap, experiencing a 3.73% slump in the last 24 hours and a significant decline of 17.5% over the past seven days.

Source: IntoTheBlock Meanwhile, if the Federal Reserve adopts a hawkish stance, it could pose further challenges for SHIB. A hawkish monetary policy, characterized by increasing interest rates and tightening of financial conditions, could potentially devalue the meme coin even more. This scenario would present an uphill battle for SHIB bulls, making it increasingly difficult for them to defend the coin’s current price levels and instilling uncertainty regarding its future prospects.

However, as of the latest Shiba Inu update, the selling pressure has subsided, while the supply of SHIB outside of exchanges has seen a significant increase.

Despite this potential shift in sentiment among certain investors, the futures market has yet to display a clear bullish bias.

Total market capitalization lost 3.8% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows.  Further declines may be in store, with some traders suggesting bitcoin could drop to as low as $23,500 based price-chart analysis.  ""Bitcoin has retreated to local resistance levels from August last year to February this year,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at trading firm FxPro, said in an email to CoinDesk. ""The bulls may try to hold the sell-off near this level, but the current decline is still within the descending channel that has been in place since April.""  A descending channel refers to a bearish trend in any asset marked by prices making lower highs on short-term time frames.  ""More significant support for bitcoin is near the 200-day average – now at $23.6K and pointing higher,"" Kuptsikevich added.  ADA's drop means it's fallen more than 20% in the past week after being named with 12 other tokens as a security in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  XRP erased all gains from a surge earlier this week as markets digested the ""Hinman emails"" from a Ripple Labs filing on Tuesday. The emails from William Hinman, a former director of SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, were released to the public in connection with the SEC's lawsuit against Ripple.  Ether (ETH), meanwhile, posted a 6.4% 24-hour drop, while ether-tracked futures lodged the highest liquidations among majors at $57 million out of a total of $143 million across all crypto-tracked futures.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, that is, they have insufficient funds to keep the trade open. Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Market sentiment was further spooked by general bearish sentiment and an abnormal amount of tether (USDT) stablecoin sales on the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance.

Fahrenheit, a consortium of buyers that includes venture capital firm Arrington Capital and miner US Bitcoin Corp, was announced as successful bidder in May, ousting an attempt by NovaWulf to claim the company whose assets were previously valued at around $2 billion.  The plan, filed early Thursday, must be agreed by the New York bankruptcy court overseeing the wind-up, and is already set to see creditor pushback.  “This proposed treatment violates every consumer lending law out there,” tweeted David Adler of law firm McCarter & English, saying that the group of borrowers he represents in the case will oppose the plan because Celsius won’t return their collateral.  The Celsius group “need to show that they are moving the case forward and communicating with constituencies” in order to keep the exclusive right to propose a bankruptcy plan, Adler added, saying that his clients had been ignored and “treat[ed] like mushrooms for the past seven weeks.”  Under the Fahrenheit deal, the new company will get between $450 and $500 million in liquid cryptocurrency, and US Bitcoin Corp will construct a range of crypto mining facilities including a new 100 megawatt plant.

Huobi users will become the first in the Web3 field to enter space.” According to Huobi's announcement, the first phase of the Huobi Mars Program spans from June 2023 to June 2024 and consists of 12 rounds. Each round will include a themed activity under which the participating users need to complete the specified tasks and mint the space NFTs. For each round, one lucky user will be selected to win a monthly reward and the winner will be shortlisted as a candidate space passenger. In the second phase, the 12 candidates will be evaluated based on their physical fitness, training and preparation, community contribution, etc., to determine the eventual passenger for space travel with Justin Sun. The space flight is scheduled at a suitable time after July 2024. The first round of the Huobi Mars Program will last from 12:00 (UTC) on June 14 to 15:59 (UTC) on July 5, 2023. Participating users will need to complete the required one-time, revolving, or monthly settlement of spot trading, P2P transactions, futures trading, and Huobi Earn transactions in order to win space NFT rewards. A user will be offered one chance to mint a space NFT for each task completed, without upper limits. The space NFTs will be issued on the TRON Network and marketable on various NFT trading platforms. Users will need to link their TRON addresses on the event page in order to receive the minted NFTs. Users are advised to mint the NFTs as soon as possible, as the daily allocated NFT mints are capped and the minting qualification does not carry over to the next round. The first round of NFT minting time lasts from 12:00 (UTC) on June 14 to 15:59 (UTC) on July 15, 2023. The result for the first round will be released at 12:00 (UTC) on July 20, 2023. One lucky user will be drawn to win the generous monthly award and shortlisted as a candidate space passenger each month. The space flight will be broadcasted to the world via a livestream. The candidate space passenger shall be the holder of the NFT number that has been drawn. Huobi will also check the lucky NFT holder's TRON address, UID, KYC verification, etc., to verify the winner's identity. Please note that snapshots will be taken at the time of the result release to determine the winner. The winning space NFTs are not transferable. Any such transfer is deemed as a waiver of the reward. The lucky users shortlisted during the first round of Huobi Mars Program will not only qualify as a space passenger candidate but also enjoy the privilege of a 180-day exemption from spot trading fees on Huobi. Ancient astronomers observed the movement of stars to make calendars. In the contemporary time, Elon Musk's SpaceX has been blasting off next-generation rockets. Huobi is contributing its own share to this great cause. With this Mars Program, Huobi hopes to introduce space travel to more people, inspire more interest and passion, and promote the development of commercial spaceflight. This move demonstrates Huobi's commitment to innovation and exploration, as well as its financial strength. Get Huobi on Mars! Huobi will always be on the road and never stop.

USDT, which usually trades around $1, lost its peg to the U.S. currency and dropped as low as $0.9968, according to CoinMarketCap data. The token was recently trading at $0.998.  USDT balances on Curve’s popular 3pool, a stablecoin swapping pool made up of USDT, USDC, and DAI, rose to over 72% early on Thursday – suggesting traders had exchanged tens of millions of USDT in favor of stablecoins USD coin (USDC) and dai (DAI).

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $24,995, down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, data from crypto market tracker CoinMarketCap shows. BTC has now lost 5.26% of its value in the last seven days. Crypto assets may be particularly vulnerable to the central bank’s projection of a higher terminal rate later this year.

Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin price had been stable around $26,000 for the past few days as the market processed the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase and rising macroeconomic anxiety about interest rate signals from the Fed. SEC Lawsuits, Hawkish Fed Message Hammer Bitcoin Price According to Benjamin Stani, head of business development and sales at cryptocurrency trading platform Matrixport, the SEC’s lawsuit against the two largest cryptocurrency exchanges is a major factor in the market’s recent losses. The majority of altcoins also took a beating in value as a result. CoinMarketCap data shows that in the past 24 hours, the entire cryptocurrency market cap has dropped 2.7%, to $1.02 trillion, while daily crypto trading volume has decreased 5.3% to $31.89 billion. BTCUSD drops to the $24K level. Chart: TradingView.com Despite widespread expectations for a rate suspension, the Federal Open Markets Committee signaled future rate hikes in its statement, which normally dampens investor enthusiasm for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Since early 2022, the US central bank has been gradually increasing interest rates, with the most severe effects seen by the riskiest assets. When interest rates rise, it becomes more expensive to borrow money, which leads to lower levels of investment and consumer spending. And because of the prolonged crypto winter, Bitcoin has been plunging since the beginning of the year. Analysts say it may take awhile for the alpha coin to muster a strong rebound and break past the key $27K or $28K level given the cryptocurrency’s sluggish performance of late. Sluggish XRP Creates Negative Ripples Across Bitcoin Market Add to the ongoing misery for Bitcoin is the disappointment emanating from the XRP community following the release of the Hinman documents, that many expected would be a savior of sorts to the price of the token and its creator Ripple, whose legal tussle with the SEC has yet to see closure.

The filing urges a New York court to impose a fine of $10,000 per day for wilfully ignoring previous requests, citing Davies’ lavish lifestyle and handsome profits from having run the company, whose bankruptcy in the middle of last year soon sent shockwaves across the crypto sector.  In March, Judge Martin Glenn ordered Davies to comply with a subpoena by April 13, as the court sought information on company assets, crypto, and records, but 3AC’s liquidators say he “fail[ed] to comply or respond in any way.”  “Davies’s failure to respond is not due to an inability to engage with the Court or any credible qualms with its jurisdiction,” the filing said. “It cannot be clearer that the Court can—and should— exercise personal jurisdiction over Davies, hold him in willful contempt of court, and impose sanctions.”  Though contempt is a civil offense, the filing suggests that the significant daily fine “is fair and likely meaningful in persuading Davies to respond.” It cites a recent interview with the New York Times in which Davies boasts of investing in a super yacht and potentially buying a private island.  Davies’ new venture, OPNX, for trading claims on bankrupt companies, was formally reprimanded by Dubai regulators, which said it was an unregistered exchange.

42420262,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGbd,1686808672,Hong Kong Put Pressure on 3 Major Banks to Take On Crypto Exchanges as Clients: Report,"The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is putting pressure on HSBC, Standard Chartered and Bank of China to take on crypto exchanges as clients, the Financial Times reported on Thursday citing three people with knowledge of the matter and a letter.  ""Due diligence on potential customers should not “create undue burden”, particularly “for those setting up an office in Hong Kong to look for the opportunities here,” said the April 27 letter from the HKMA to banks, according to the Financial Times.  Hong Kong has taken recent steps to emerge as a global crypto hub – its Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) began accepting applications for crypto trading platform licenses on June 1, and a Hong Kong lawmaker invited Coinbase to come and register in the region. Hong Kong's ambitions coincide with lawsuits by U.S. regulators against the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.  ""We have dialogues with different stakeholders from time to time on a host of matters,"" an HKMA spokesperson said in an email to CoinDesk. ""It is our general practice not to confirm, deny or comment on any of those meetings.""  The UK-based HSBC and Standard Chartered, and Bank of China, were asked by HKMA at a meeting last month why they were not accepting crypto exchanges as clients, according to the FT. The three banks are among the largest in the world. Bank of China is a majority state-owned Chinese commercial bank.  “HKMA encouraged the banks to not be afraid,” FT quoted a person with knowledge of the discussion. “There is resistance from a conventional banking mindset ... we are seeing some resistance from senior executives at traditional banks.”  The HKMA spokesperson also said that with the implementation of the new rules, banks in Hong Kong ""should endeavor to meet the legitimate business need of licensed [Virtual Asset Service Proviers] ... and provide the required banking services.""  ""The HKMA has consistently communicated the importance of banks following the risk-based approach to managing the risks of individual customers,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the HKMA issued a circular in April to provide further guidance to banks on the provision of banking services to corporate customers, including crypto firms.  Banks and payment settlers have had a tricky relationship with crypto companies globally. Last year, some payment processors cut off local exchanges in India, and recently reports have emerged that Australia's banks have been blocking payments to crypto exchanges. While no ban on crypto clients exists in Hong Kong, banks appear to be reluctant to engage with the industry for fear of legal challenges in the event of a scam.  “We have active dialogues with virtual asset players to exchange views on a range of topics, including but not limited to account opening,"" an HSBC spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""We remain very engaged on policies and developments of this nascent industry in Hong Kong.”  A spokesperson for Standard Chartered told CoinDesk that it has ""regular dialogue"" with regulators on different subjects.

42420246,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUaGOD,1686804655,U.S. Justice Department Agrees to Try Sam Bankman-Fried on Original Charges Only for Now,"The U.S. Department of Justice intends to only try FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on the eight charges it brought in December 2022 for now.  Prosecutors with the DOJ wrote late Wednesday night that they would agree to try Bankman-Fried on a handful of charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, after a court in the Bahamas blocked the local government from agreeing to additional charges.  Bankman-Fried faces 13 total charges, but five of these were brought as superseding indictments in February and March 2023. In one of his motions to dismiss last month, attorneys for Bankman-Fried wrote that the government of the Bahamas had to agree to the additional charges – which include bank fraud, operating an unlicensed money transmitter and bribery – before the onetime CEO could be tried, because he was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S. last year.  On Tuesday, a court in the Bahamas blocked the government from agreeing to those additional charges until Bankman-Fried's defense team has had a chance to fight against that approval.  In a letter addressed to Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams and his team wrote that the Bahamas court fight may not end until near Bankman-Fried's trial in the U.S.  These charges are counts four (fraud on FTX customers tied to derivatives), six (securities fraud against FTX investors), nine (conspiracy to commit bank fraud), 10 (conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitter business) and 13 (conspiracy to bribe foreign government officials) in the latest superseding indictment.  ""In light of the uncertainty concerning when The Bahamas will render a decision with respect to specialty, and to simplify the proof at trial and decrease the burden of trial preparation on the defendant, the Government is prepared to proceed to trial as scheduled on the counts contained in the original Indictment,"" the letter said.  Those original charges include counts one (conspiracy to commit wire fraud on customers of FTX), two (wire fraud on customers of FTX), three (conspiracy to commit fraud on FTX customers tied to derivatives), five (conspiracy to commit securities fraud against FTX investors), seven (conspiracy to commit wire fraud on lenders to Alameda Research), eight (wire fraud on lenders to Alameda Research), 11 (conspiracy to commit money laundering) and 12 (conspiracy to make unlawful political contributions and defraud the Federal Elections Commission).  The prosecutors requested a trial date in the first quarter of 2024 for the additional charges. Bankman-Fried is currently set to go to trial this October.  Bankman-Fried's defense team filed additional motions to dismiss most of those other charges on various grounds, though the DOJ has pushed back against their arguments. A hearing is set for 10:30 a.m. ET on Thursday for oral arguments on the motions to dismiss.  Inner City Press first reported on the DOJ letter.  A second letter filed by prosecutors on Wednesday night addressed claims previously made by Bankman-Fried's team alleging the DOJ had failed to provide all of the discovery materials requested.  According to this second letter, the DOJ believes it had provided most of those discovery materials, but said it faced delays for various reasons including technical issues.

BTC was recently trading at about $25,171, off 3.1% over the past four hours, part of a wider crypto selloff. The largest cryptocurrency in market value had been traveling comfortably just below $26,000 for much of the past five days as markets awaited the latest interest rate decision by the U.S. central bank and continued to chew over last week's U.S. Securities and Exchange lawsuits against crypto exchanges Binance and Coinbase.  The Federal Reserve elected to suspend rate hikes, but comments by bank Chair Jerome Powell following the announcement appeared to spook markets. Powell reiterated the Fed's commitment to sink annual inflation to a target 2.5%. It currently stands at 4%. But critics of bank policy say that the focus on prices risks sending the economy into a recession.  Just as equity markets were closing a lackluster day, digital assets plunged. Ether, the second largest crypto by market cap, fell to $1,630 before regaining ground to hover near $1,654, off 5.1% from Tuesday, same time.  Among other major cryptos, XRP retreated was recently down 6.4% to trade at just over 48 cents over the past 24 hours. It sank as low as 46 cents earlier in the day, its lowest level in June, according to CoinDesk Indices data. The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets performance, was recently down 3.8%.  In an email to CoinDesk, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at Web3 crypto and fiat service provider YouHodler, wrote that bitcoin's late plunge did not necessarily foreshadow a larger downturn. ""We have to remember that the crypto market is a relatively small market, and a few hundred million dollars can move the market for a few percent,"" Lienkha wrote. ""So let's see the following days if it is really a downward trend or just a single whale sell off.""  And in a follow-up comment to an earlier note to CoinDesk, Markus Levin, co-founder of blockchain geospatial network XYO Network, wrote that despite the Fed's hawkish, post-announcement comments, he believed that has ""bottomed already for"" its current ""four-year cycle.""  ""But nothing is certain in this market, especially when it comes to crypto,"" he added. For example, if we do enter recession territory, then we should be prepared for even more unpredictable movements with Bitcoin and other assets that are further along the risk curve.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Chainlink LINK +0.1% Computing  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP −6.2% Currency Ethereum ETH −5.0% Smart Contract Platform Gala GALA −4.1% Entertainment  Insights  Large Bitcoin Holders Hold Their Ground  Despite the recent regulatory turmoil hitting crypto markets, larger holders of bitcoin have not been reducing their bitcoin holdings.  Data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, shows that unique addresses holding between 100-1,000 BTC have increased their BTC holdings since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) announced lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase.  Addresses holding between 10 and 100 BTC performed similarly. The risk appetite was not as robust however for wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC.  Addresses holding between 1,000 and 100,000 BTC stayed relatively flat, although a slight decline occurred with the segment of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000.  The data coincides with funding rates that remain positive for BTC as well as a decrease in BTC on centralized exchanges. While not necessarily a bullish signal, the data implies that large bitcoin investors are content to sit on their positions at the moment.

42393289,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bhOEQX,1686788811,Bitcoin Friendly Miami Mayor Francis Suarez Jumps Into Presidential Race,"Bitcoin friendly Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has announced he's running for President.  Suarez announced his candidacy on Twitter on Thursday morning, and filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday.  Suarez, who vowed to make the city a bitcoin hub and has accepted his salary in bitcoin, joins a growing Republican field seeking to unseat President Joe Biden in the 2024 election. He faces an uphill struggle to build national name recognition among several high-profile candidates who have already announced their candidacies, including former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Miami has elected Suarez twice.  During the coronavirus pandemic, Miami – also called ""Magic City – drew an exodus of tech workers from Silicon Valley and New York. Several crypto firms relocated there permanently.  Suarez, who touted bitcoin's ""democratizing impact on the future of wealth for every American"" in a 2021 interview with CoinDesk, has examined ways to accept taxes and pay municipal employees in the currency. He also announced MiamiCoin (MIA), built on the Bitcoin adjacent blockchain, Stacks, which he hoped could someday pay a recurring BTC stimulus to Miami citizens.  By 2022, MIA had shed roughly 95% of its value from an all-time high of around 5 cents eight months earlier, according to data from CoinMarketCap. In March, crypto exchange OKCoin suspended the trading of MIA – and a second city coin, NYCCoin – citing limited liquidity as the reason for the decision.  In a 2022 CoinDesk interview, Suarez said that despite MIA's struggles, he remained a believer in crypto. ""People ask me the same thing about bitcoin, the fact that it's lost more than 50% of its value, but that doesn't change my feelings about the fundamental technology,"" Suarez said.

13813747,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/green-economy-bitcoin-mining-grows-greener,1686788100,Green Economy - Bitcoin mining grows greener,"In the coming years, the tone of the cryptocurrency market will be set by environmental projects, which will be increasingly used for mining around the world. New technologies and developments will be implemented in different parts of the world. And maybe even in outer space - such ideas and proposals already exist and are being discussed within the professional community. Interesting discussions took place at the Bitcoin Miami conference in the USA at the end of May. Bitcoin mining was one of the key topics in the latest report by Messari, a leader in cryptocurrency market research and analysis. The authors believe that the green agenda will increasingly dominate in this field, and it will be the driving force of the industry in the years to come.On the one hand, environmental friendliness will grow into an actual trend, and crypto enthusiasts will adhere to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) Investing approach - environmental, social, governance aspects of investing. On the other hand, this trend will be supported by economic considerations, and the high cost of energy. As for this point, Messari analytics highlights a very indicative example for Bitcoin mining cost: in 2021, the mining of 1 bitcoin cost American miners in Texas about $5-10 thousand, and the coin itself was trading at around $50-60 thousand; its value went down in 2022, and the best price was estimated at $20 thousand with $15-20 thousand of mining cost. Serhiy Tron, Owner of White Rock Management, speaking at the Bitcoin 2023 conference As the coins value decreased, miners actively went looking for ways to reduce their energy costs. First of all, by making mining more environmentally friendly. The interest in hydroelectric power and electricity generation by flaring gas, byproduct of oil production, has grown tremendously. The latter technology not only provides cheaper energy for cryptocurrency mining, but also significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Reduction of the negative impact of mining on the environment. ""Being environmentally friendly is not just a fashion trend, but an economically profitable direction for mining. In some regions, the share of renewable energy in this field amounts to 40%, and even exceeds 70% in other regions. I think that interest will keep on growing, and global oil and gas corporations will cooperate more actively with the cryptocurrency industry. For example, our company has various projects in the U.S. underway: gas flaring in Texas and hydropower near Niagara Falls in the state of New York,"" said the founder of one of the world's largest mining companies, White Rock Management, Serhiy Tron. White Rock Management, along with 250 other companies, has joined the Crypto Climate Accord for environmentally friendly and safe cryptocurrency mining. With operating offices in Canada, Sweden, Kazakhstan and the United States, the company implements a number of green projects and has plans to develop data centers in Switzerland and the U.S.Tron believes that coal, oil and gas constituents will gradually be outed from the energy consumed by miners. A similar opinion has been voiced by Coin Metrics co-founder Nick Carter, who has high hopes about the use of energy from flare gas in bitcoin mining; he believes this type of fuel can completely cover the needs of all miners worldwide inside the next 10 years. Crypto analysts' predictions regarding the development of alternative sources are backed by energy experts.A new report from a global energy think tank Ember emphasizes that the global energy system will very shortly enter a “new era of reduction of fossil fuel production”. Gas and coal generation volumes are expected to decrease, with alternative sources in extensive use.Ember's findings note that at the end of 2022, the expansion of wind and solar power accounted for 80% of the growth in electricity demand, and when combined with hydropower and bioenergy, 92% of the growth. By the end of 2023, low-carbon sources are expected to provide 100% of the growth in energy demand. Analysts provide an interesting example: the solar power plants launched worldwide last year would be powerful enough to supply an entire country like South Africa for a year, and wind power plants would provide almost the entire 12-month supply for the United Kingdom. ""The price/quality principle will be always at work. Miners will do everything to reduce their costs, and increase their income from cryptocurrency mining, while preventing methane emissions and being environmentally conscious along the way. This, in my opinion, is worth the support of local authorities in different regions. For example, by tax incentives or other means,"" says financial analyst Vladyslav Kravets. Particular interest in ""green"" mining is growing in the U.S. Local Marathon Digital Holdings launched the King Mountain data center in Texas, with a capacity of 280 MW, carbon-neutral by 70%. In addition, this spring the company announced a joint project with Zero Two, designed to construct two new 200 MW and 50 MW zero-carbon sites in the UAE (Abu Dhabi). Also, BIT Mining Limited reported building a 57.2 MW facility in the same state, running by 85% on clean energy. This does not come as a surprise, since the Americans have been growing generally more interested in cryptocurrency as of late. The bigger it is, the greater the interest of local miners in more environmentally friendly and cheaper crypto mining. The analytics service Ahrefs recently estimated that the word ""Bitcoin"" has been looked up 1.9 million times in Google search in the U.S. over the past 12 months. It topped the search ranking, coming before the scandalous former president Donald Trump, news, Elvis Presley, Disney and Spider-Man. ""For years, Texas was considered the home of the American shale gas and oil revolution, but it has now become the go-to place for cryptocurrency miners. Miners have realized that energy from flare gas can be used profitably to mine crypto. Our company is using it already. Also, this way we significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Around 400 million tons of carbon dioxide make their way to the atmosphere annually, but the crypto community can reduce this figure significantly,"" assures Serhiy Tron. There is no doubt that the miners’ interest in green energy will grow as the interest in cryptocurrencies as such multiplies. This process is gradually spreading around the world, although not always in transparent ways.For example, in May, during the bankruptcy of BlockFi and Celsius, it was revealed that Druk Holding & Investments (DHI), a state-owned investment bank in the Asian Kingdom of Bhutan, was secretly (without public knowledge) mining bitcoin. This country employs hydropower, with natural availability of high-altitude mountains with fresh air that allow cooling down the equipment. Mining is carbon-neutral and, as DHI assures, self-sustaining.The interest in cryptocurrencies is increased in the Seychelles, and local Finance Minister Naadir Hassan stated in April that his government is working out the requirements for the registration and licensing of specialized companies. Also, state authorities in Europe's Liechtenstein have recently declared they’re going to allow their citizens to use bitcoin to pay for public services. Although the head of the government, Daniel Risch, did not specify when such a possibility was to come in effect, but was adamant that it eventually would. Regardless of what goes on in the crypto market and no matter what skeptics say about this industry, the interest for it does not decrease. Even after significant price swings of several coins and frightening statements about the crypto-winter. Steady focus of the investors and hi-tech companies is backed not only by the projects that’s been already greenlit, but with new developments, ideas and discussions that do not stop. At the end of May, for instance, active debates on the future development of the market and its prospects took place in the United States, at the Bitcoin Miami conference. “Rather interesting and large-scale event, which was helpful not for professional players alone, but for the curious newcomers as well. Highly-esteemed and acknowledged experts were represented at the event: Christopher Grilhault des Fontaines from Dfns, Joseph Ziolkowski from Relm Insurance, Domenic Carosa from Banxa and many others. Not only current problems were discussed, but some new developments, including those in the space industry, were spoken of openly, too. Quite gripping and productive. Once again, we were able to make sure that Bitcoin remains a powerful asset, and amid the challenging situation in the global economy and growing rates of inflation everywhere, attention and trust to Bitcoin is on the steady rise”, summed up Serhiy Tron.
