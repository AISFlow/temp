Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37820132,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320846,1734564600,South Korea’s Deputy PM: ‘Government Not Negative on Crypto’,"South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister has claimed that the government is not negative on crypto -related matters. Choi Sang-mok, the nation’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, admitted that “domestic and international uncertainties” remain in the wake of a successful vote to impeach President Yoon Suk-yeol earlier this month. Not Negative on Crypto: Finance Chief Per Newsis , Choi told reporters that the government would “not let its guard down” in spite of the turmoil . Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance, speaking on December 17, 2024. (Source: JTBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) He claimed Seoul would “manage the economy as stably as possible” by “gathering all the capabilities of the public and private sectors.” South Korean lawmakers have recently claimed to have issued an “all-stop” or pause on all crypto-related legislation following the political chaos of early December. Yoon declared martial law on December 3, only for lawmakers to force their way into parliament and overturn his decision. Impeachment Ruling Lawmakers have since voted to impeach the President. But the ruling is yet to be ratified by the constitutional court. Yoon has been suspended pending a verdict, with the People’s Power Party faction de facto ruling the nation in his stead. Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange platform Bithumb over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Choi responded to questions from the media on December 18, with one journalist asking him about US President-elect Donald Trump’s “position on strategic crypto reserves.” “Since the specific details of the strategic cryptoasset proposal from President-elect Trump have not been revealed yet, this is not the time to evaluate it. We plan to prepare a response and other measures when the new US administration takes office. We will act after these and other and new proposals related to cryptoassets become concrete.” Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Crypto Tax Delay The Deputy Prime Minister also spoke about the National Assembly’s recent vote to delay the launch of crypto tax to 2027. He explained: “The government is not negative on cryptoassets. As regulations and related systems are still in their infancy, we decided to defer [the crypto tax launch]. Because we judged that it would be appropriate to monitor the progress [of regulations] before we introduce taxation.” Trading volumes on the South Korean crypto exchange platform Upbit over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Choi further claimed that the central Bank of Korea, financial regulators, and “other related authorities” are currently “preparing new regulatory policies” for the crypto sector. He said these focus “not only on customer protection,” but also on “the legal nature” of crypto. And Choi said these parties were also looking at more “general” issues on “how to regulate this sector domestically.” “Everything has happened at lightning speed from beginning to end.""

The Deputy Prime Minister indicated that the government was focusing its attention on implementing the 2025 budget. The People’s Power Party has faced stiff opposition from the Democratic Party, which has a large majority in the National Assembly. The results of a public opinion poll show that the gap in support between the Democratic Party of Korea and the People Power Party has reached its highest level since the inauguration of the Yoon Suk Yeol administration in May 2022. #YoonSukYeol https://t.co/YDPCnlQhwj — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 18, 2024 The Democratic Party has previously refused to accept the budget, causing a long stand-off in the National Assembly. However, following the impeachment vote, the government is hopeful it will finally make a breakthrough in implementing the budget. Crypto trading volumes remain high on South Korean crypto exchanges following the events of December 3, while the fiat won continues to slide against currencies like the USD. Lawmakers, anticipating a potential election in the event of Yoon’s impeachment, previously said they would not discuss crypto-related bills until the political chaos had abated.

This bumps their ENA holdings to 741,687, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. WLFI’s December buying spree totaled nearly $45 million , expanding its position across multiple crypto assets. The breakdown: $30 million secured 8,100 Ethereum (ETH). $10 million was invested in Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). $2 million each allocated to Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE). $250,000 picked up 134,216 Ondo (ONDO) tokens via Cow Protocol on December 16. WLFI tokens rally as the market responds The crypto market hasn’t ignored WLFI’s spending spree. Several of its key assets have rallied, with Chainlink (LINK) leading the charge at a 28% surge, now valued at $28. Aave (AAVE) followed with a 17% gain, landing at $52. Ethereum (ETH) edged up by 8%, trading at $3,912. WLFI’s purchases have fueled speculation about the project’s ability to boost confidence in these tokens. The platform has partnered with AaveDAO, leveraging Aave’s protocols for lending and borrowing services. In return, AaveDAO gets 20% of WLFI’s fee revenue and 7% of its total token supply. And then there’s Justin Sun, founder of TRON, who invested $30 million in WLFI. His involvement has been a bit controversial, but the backing undeniably adds firepower to WLFI’s arsenal. But WLFI hasn’t had it easy since its September unveiling. Early token sales brought in $220 million, but wallet authenticity concerns during the launch cast doubt over the project’s credibility. Despite the briefly strong start, sales have slowed. WLFI wanted to sell $300 million worth of tokens but has managed to offload less than 25% of the remaining supply.

Here’s Why Qubetics Is the Next Best Crypto to Buy Under $1,"In the world of cryptocurrency, timing can be everything. The regret can be palpable for those who missed the opportunity to invest in Render during its early days. Render ($RNDR), now a household name among blockchain enthusiasts, began humbly but rapidly captured the attention of forward-thinking investors. Its ICO price was a mere fraction of its current value, and those who recognised its potential have seen their investments soar exponentially. However, if you’re feeling you’ve missed out, there’s a new opportunity on the horizon that could rival Render’s success – Qubetics ($TICS). The Rise of Render: From Underdog to Powerhouse Render debuted with an ICO that saw tokens priced at just $0.05, an absolute bargain in hindsight. Its vision was revolutionary at the time: a decentralised GPU rendering platform designed to streamline creative industries. Despite scepticism, early believers reaped life-changing gains as the project gained traction. Fast-forward to today, and Render is valued significantly higher, delivering returns that make investors’ eyes light up. But what about those who missed the boat? While hindsight can be cruel, the crypto market constantly evolves, offering new opportunities to capitalise on innovation. This is where Qubetics comes into play – the best crypto to buy under $1 right now. Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Opportunity Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 13, and excitement is reaching a fever pitch. Unlike Render’s initial days, Qubetics has already achieved impressive traction, with over $7 million raised, more than 10,600 holders, and 355 million tokens sold. The price of $TICS tokens is just $0.034, making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking the best crypto to buy under $1. With weekly presale phases bringing a consistent 10% price hike, Qubetics is designed to reward early adopters handsomely. By the final presale phase, the token will experience a 20% price jump, making now the most compelling time to act. Post-presale projections suggest a target price of $0.25 per token, delivering a staggering ROI of 630.27% for those entering at this stage. Analysts are even more bullish, predicting Qubetics could soar to $10 or even $15 following the mainnet launch, offering potential returns of 29,106.88% and 43,660.31%, respectively. Imagine investing today and seeing your portfolio multiply beyond your expectations. Could Qubetics be your second chance at capturing gains similar to those who believed in Render early on? Innovating Cross-Border Transactions: The Qubetics Advantage What sets Qubetics apart isn’t just its presale success – it’s the groundbreaking utility it offers. The Qubetics Network empowers banks and financial institutions by enabling near-instant cross-border payments and settlements using the $TICS token. Institutions can leverage blockchain technology to perform transactions faster, more cost-effectively, and with enhanced transparency. The ability to execute international payments efficiently is crucial in an increasingly globalised business environment. Traditional systems are slow, riddled with inefficiencies, and lack the transparency that businesses and individuals now demand. Qubetics’ solution addresses these pain points, ensuring funds are transferred securely and swiftly. This means improved cash flow and operational efficiency for businesses, while for individuals, it ensures faster remittances and reduced delays. For anyone seeking the best crypto to buy under $1, Qubetics offers a rare combination of real-world utility and explosive growth potential. Why Timing Is Everything As we’ve learned from Render’s story, hesitation can be costly. Those who waited on the sidelines missed the chance to buy low and reap the rewards of early adoption. Qubetics offers a similar, if not greater, opportunity to position yourself for significant gains. With the next presale phase imminent and the token price set to rise again, the window of opportunity is shrinking. Every passing week brings higher prices, and the potential for missed gains grows larger. If you’re searching for the best crypto to buy under $1 that combines innovation, strong community backing, and exceptional growth prospects, Qubetics is a clear frontrunner. Conclusion: Don’t Let Another Opportunity Slip Away Cryptocurrency history is filled with stories of missed opportunities and rich with tales of redemption. Render’s meteoric rise may be behind us, but Qubetics presents a fresh chance for investors ready to act. With its presale success, groundbreaking real-world applications, and analysts’ bullish predictions, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy under $1 today. The presale phase is your chance to get in early, secure a favourable position, and watch your investment grow. Will you seize this chance, or will you look back with regret, wondering why you hesitated? The choice is yours, but the clock is ticking.

BREAKING: The S&P 500 falls sharply after the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points, but raises inflation forecast. The Fed reduced their outlook from 3 to 2 rate cuts in 2025 and raised inflation expectations from 2.1% to 2.5%. Inflation is back. pic.twitter.com/kKtEHD0IF0 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 18, 2024 US equity markets and major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) , which had probably been looking for an excuse to pull back following their very strong performance in recent weeks, were dumped. And this bled across in the highly speculative crypto meme coin space, with meme coin total market cap collapsing to $106 billion from $117 billion on Tuesday, per CoinMarketCap . Crypto bulls will likely remain confident that there will be a reversal of the market’s fortunes into the year’s end. That’s because the incoming Trump administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, a complete 180-degree shift from the anti-crypto stance of the outgoing Biden administration. And global crypto adoption is also accelerating, not least thanks to increased chatter about the establishment of Bitcoin strategic reserves in nations all around the world. If one country implements a Bitcoin strategic reserve you can kiss goodbye to your 4 year cycles. I already laid this out in January and assumed an adoption cycle. Think 2002 big tech. pic.twitter.com/k5mQQNJRLw — Tyler (@TylerDurden) December 17, 2024 That means there is fertile ground for the return of a new meme season, with Shiba Inu likely to lead any such rally. That said, the latest developments in the Shiba Inu price chart are concerning. Is a short-term price crash right around the corner? Bearish Chart Developments – Is the Shiba Inu Price About to Crash? The Shiba Inu price’s latest drop has seen it slump under its 50DMA, after falling below its 21DMA earlier in the month. Moreover, SHIB has now also broken to the south of an upward trend channel in play since mid-November. All that suggests a drop back towards the next major support zone around $0.00002160 is on the cards, a further 11% decline from current levels. However, things would only really get bad for Shiba Inu if the meme coin broke below its uptrend from its summer 2024 lows. That could open the door to a retest of the 200DMA under $0.000019 or lower. But SHIB bulls should not fear. Yes, maybe the Fed won’t cut interest rates as much as the market wants in 2025. But this is not the end of the world for crypto markets, nor meme coins like Shiba Inu. As noted, the US crypto industry is about to enter a new golden age and global adoption is accelerating. Bitcoin may be the initial beneficiary of this, but this will eventually work its way into the altcoin and meme coin space. As a leading name in the space with a massive community and vast web3 ecosystem, Shiba Inu is going to attract substantial demand.

37817557,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313313,1734562886,Coinbase Says Justin Sun ‘Unnacceptable Risk’ to Wrapped Bitcoin After Delisting wBTC,"Crypto exchange Coinbase has cited risks linked to Tron-founder Justin Sun during a lawsuit over its delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin ( wBTC ). In a recent complaint, the wBTC custodian and Sun-affiliated BiT Global accused Coinbase of using wBTC – the tokenized representation of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain – as a “cash grab” before delisting it and replacing it with its own version of the asset. Said the complaint, “In the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab. It saw a competitor, wBTC, that had something it wanted: an innovative product that released value inherent in Bitcoin and let users utilize that value in bold new ways… Coinbase decided it would take what it wanted. Once the value in wBTC had been demonstrated, Coinbase changed the rules, delisting wBTC from its platform so that it could no longer be traded on the Coinbase platform – and it did so shortly after launching its own knock-off clone called cbBTC.” In response to the complaint, Coinbase says it made the decision to delist wBTC largely because of its links to Justin Sun and the risks that would arise should he have any influence over it. The exchange notes that Sun’s name is “conspicuously” left out of BiT’s complaint. “Coinbase made the decision—based on a rigorous internal process—that wBTC should be delisted from Coinbase’s exchange due to the unacceptable risk that control of wBTC would fall into the hands of Justin Sun. BiT now asks the Court to override, on an emergency basis no less, Coinbase’s judgment that continuing to list wBTC could compromise the integrity of its platform and put customers at risk. BiT seeks to force Coinbase to do business with an entity that no longer complies with Coinbase’s standards due to Mr. Sun’s ‘material involvement.’ And yet, Mr. Sun’s name and connection to wBTC is conspicuously absent from BiT’s Complaint and TRO (temporary restraining order) request. So too is any acknowledgement that he has repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct, and that reports of his alleged misdeeds abound in the press and crypto community more broadly.” Coinbase also alleges that Sun is “infamous” in the crypto community and that he has been accused of several wrongdoings, including market manipulation and misappropriation of digital assets.

37817850,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630027,1734562824,World Bank moves to calm fears of AI taking over education,"The World Bank, in a recent publication , recognized that artificial intelligence has spilled over into education. The international body maintains that the technology presents both opportunities and challenges. According to the World Bank article authored by Jaime Saavedra (Human Development Director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank) and Ezequiel Molina (Senior Economist), if properly implemented, AI can boost learning and teacher training, which could also mean more specialized support for students. A good example of a country tapping into this use case is Ecuador. There is reportedly a successful AI tutoring program that was able to improve the math skills of students for a mere $18 per head in the country. The fear the general public and various governing bodies have regarding artificial intelligence is valid. It could even be necessary to ensure the creation does not spiral out of moderate ranges. Common fears about AI’s impact on education Critics have raised valid concerns about the impact AI will have on equity, effectiveness, and the very nature of learning itself. However, the truth is that AI is already being used in most aspects of human society which is why the World Bank believes it is important that we confront these challenging questions now. According to the World Bank, it is not irresponsible to promote AI even when many schools lack the minimum conditions to operate the technology. While it admits that many schools still require fundamental infrastructure and well-qualified teachers, the World Bank publication highlights how properly implemented technology can help bridge the gaps faster. AI can scale up teacher training and become a great learning aid that allows teaching materials to reach remote areas quickly. This means students who need extra support can get it more easily and effectively. On the question of whether AI will serve human communities or if it will be the other way around, the publication conceded that this is a truly legitimate concern shared by many people. AI development is concentrated in the developed nations of the Global North (North America and Europe), so it is possible for developing nations not to focus on their crucial local needs, such as native language content and culturally relevant teaching approaches. The solution according to the World Bank is strategic engagement. It recommended developing local AI talent via targeted scholarships and training, creating partnerships for local language content development, establishing clear regulatory frameworks that protect data sovereignty, and building teachers’ digital skills through comprehensive training programs. One country that seems to be ahead where creating a regulatory framework for AI is concerned is Uruguay. In the country, they’ve developed guidelines for AI use that respect local teaching methods while leveraging AI advances. Such a framework ensures the technology serves their educational purposes, and not vice versa. Will AI make students lazier? One of the most common questions teachers and parents have asked since generative AI like ChatGPT went mainstream is how it will affect students’ work ethic. While it is true that tools like ChatGPT will become a crutch, promoting intellectual laziness and superficial learning, the World Bank says what matters more is how people use it. The World Bank article argues that its capabilities mean students always have a high IQ partner to either brainstorm problems or more commonly, do homework. It went on to maintain that while AI can promote complacency among students, it did not invent cheating. Hence, it is ultimately up to a person to decide how to use it productively. The sophistication AI tools offer presents an opportunity to fundamentally rethink how we teach and assess learning. After all, we know technology can facilitate focusing on what truly matters: developing higher-order thinking skills, creativity, and critical analysis. One country that has proven this is Nigeria . In the country, the World Bank ran some pilot programs that revealed a fascinating fact: under proper guidance, students who learn to use AI tools thoughtfully actually engage more deeply with the material. So, rather than asking students to summarize texts (something AI can do instantly), teachers can urge them to critique AI-generated analyses, compare different AI interpretations, or even use AI as a brainstorming partner while coming up with their own novel ideas. According to the World Bank, a good teacher is able to encourage critical thinking via thoughtful conversations. With AI, more teachers can prepare effective lesson plans and activities for difficult-to-teach skills. Recommendations for implementing AI responsibly in schools In the field of education, there have not been many scientific breakthroughs regarding learning because educational research, unlike medical research, often struggles to reach classroom practice. However, the World Bank believes AI can change this pattern. How? By adopting the same evidence-based approach used in medicine, pharmaceuticals, or food safety – forging ahead consciously without allowing the fear of innovation to paralyze growth. Still, no new medical procedure or food additive is ever introduced to the public without proper testing, so a systematic approach to AI in education is required. According to the World Bank, we will have succeeded in properly harnessing the power of AI when we can manipulate the technology while keeping the human element at the center. Since education mainly focuses on human interaction, we have the opportunity to use AI to make this interaction more effective and enjoyable, but only as an assistant, not a replacement. Focusing on this principle will ensure that the technology serves our educational values and not the other way around.

37817173,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=630022,1734561624,Bitcoin drops for the first time in four days after Fed’s disappointing rate cut,"Bitcoin fell sharply for the first time in four days as markets reacted to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate decision. The apex crypto tumbled by as much as 5.3%, dropping to $100,752 after briefly soaring past $108,000 earlier this week in a record-breaking rally. Traders, spooked by the slower-than-expected pace of easing, pulled back speculative bets, hitting Bitcoin and other riskier assets. Fed signals fewer cuts The Fed’s quarter-point rate cut on Wednesday was widely expected, but its forecast left markets cold. Officials projected the benchmark rate to fall to 3.75-4% in 2025, down from an earlier prediction of a full percentage-point reduction. Morgan Stanley described the updated outlook as “much more hawkish than we anticipated.” This cautious approach suggests the Fed is prioritizing inflation control over aggressive stimulus. Fed Chair Jay Powell admitted that the December decision was a “closer call” than previous ones. He said inflation was moving “sideways,” while risks to the labor market had “diminished.” These comments signaled that the central bank might adopt a more restrained pace of easing moving forward. The policy change sent shockwaves through global markets. U.S. Treasury yields climbed, with the two-year note—closely tied to Fed policy—rising 0.08 percentage points to 4.33%. The dollar strengthened by 1% against a basket of major currencies, while Wall Street’s S&P 500 dropped 1%. Risk assets, including Bitcoin, bore the brunt of this recalibration. A recalibration in monetary policy The Fed’s rate cuts have been framed as part of a broader “recalibration” of monetary policy aimed at curbing inflation. Officials raised their estimate of the neutral rate—one that neither stimulates nor constrains the economy—to 3%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Revised forecasts showed the Fed expects core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, to reach 2.5% in 2025 and 2.2% in 2026. These figures are slightly higher than earlier projections. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.3% over the next three years. Markets were already on edge following the September decision, where Fed Governor Michelle Bowman dissented, marking the first internal opposition to a rate cut since 2005. The December move, though expected, came amid continued debate among officials about inflation’s trajectory. The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose at an annual rate of 2.8% in October. Powell described this phase as a “new process” in the Fed’s approach, explaining that future rate cuts would require a higher bar for approval. The Fed’s goal remains clear: bring inflation back to 2% without derailing the labor market or broader economy.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Alternative Larger Metrics Show The Answer,"A crypto analyst has shared an XRP price chart, analyzing its action on the 4-hour timeframe while pinpointing key metrics of strength that suggest a possible rally. The analyst has predicted that XRP is preparing for a significant run to $11, marking a new All-Time High (ATH). Key Metrics Suggest XRP Price Set For $11 Surge In an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday, prominent crypto analyst Javon Marks shared key observations of XRP’s price behavior, noting signs of strength through crucial metrics and a potential for a significant price rally to a new ATH at $11. The analyst has suggested that XRP shows clear upward momentum, with a sharp increase visible on the presented price chart. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance Looking at the chart, XRP has been breaking recent resistance levels and maintaining bullish momentum. XRP’s strongest resistance at $0.5, which lasted for over three years, was broken earlier in November, jumping above $1 following Donald Trump’s victory in the US Presidential elections. Currently, the XRP price is trading above $2.5, underscoring the massive growth surge it has experienced in less than two months. Marks has revealed that he was keeping a close watch on alternative larger-term metrics for the XRP price that signal a potential surge to new ATHs. The volume bars below the price chart indicate steady buying pressure for XRP, with increasing trading volume during upward trends. Recently, the XRP accumulation trend among large holders has increased significantly. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed via a price chart that whales have purchased a staggering 30 million XRP within the last 24 hours. This increased buying activity reflects the growing confidence in XRP, possibly fueled by the market’s bullish sentiment and expectations of a price rally. At the bottom of the XRP chart shared by Marks, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) illustrates a sharp upward curve, signaling the potential for a bull rally. The RSI appears as a fluctuating black line, clearly reflecting rising momentum. If XRP can sustain its current uptrend, it could surpass its current all-time high of $3.84 set during the 2021 bull market, potentially reaching a new high above $11 in this bull cycle. Update On XRP Analysis The XRP price has been persistently attempting to break through the resistance area at $2.5, aiming to reach new highs. Over the past month, XRP has had an impressive performance, recording a whopping 119.5% price increase. Despite being in consolidation, the cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong growth, with its price climbing nearly 8% in the last seven days as it attempted to break through key resistance levels.

Though some lawmakers and President elect Trump support a U.S. Bitcoin reserve. Powell’s comments caused Bitcoin to drop 5.7%, with other major cryptos also losing value, and the stock market reacted negatively. Powell Says No to U.S. Bitcoin Reserve Jerome Powell Fed Chair has made a point during a press conference that the U.S. central bank is not allowed to hold Bitcoin. He explained that according to the Federal Reserve Act, there are rules about what the bank can own, and Bitcoin is not part of that. He also stated that the Federal Reserve is looking for something other than a law change by leaving the decision to Congress. “We’re not allowed to own bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own, and we’re not looking for a law change. That’s something for Congress to decide, not the Fed.” These statements came after questions about the possibility of the U.S. government building a Bitcoin reserve, similar to how it holds gold. Powell stressed that any decision on the U.S. government holding Bitcoin would be up to Congress and not the Federal Reserve. He clarified that the central bank is interested in something other than getting involved in Bitcoin or changing its laws. Despite Powell’s firm stance, there has been growing interest in Bitcoin as a potential asset for the U.S. government to hold. Trump has supported the idea, suggesting that the U.S. should not fall behind other countries in the global crypto race. Some pro- crypto senators including Senator Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming, have been pushing for this idea. Lummis has even drafted a bill requiring the U.S. Treasury to buy one million Bitcoin over the next five years. President-elect Donald Trump has also supported the idea of the U.S. creating a Bitcoin reserve, saying the U.S. needs to stay ahead of countries like China by embracing digital currencies. Market Reaction to Powell’s comments After Powell’s comments, the cryptocurrency market reacted quickly. Bitcoin dropped to $100,300 when he declared Fed won’t hold Bitcoin, which is down about 5.7% over the past 24 hours. By the time of the press release, Bitcoin was trading at $104,000, when he started his speech. The cryptocurrency market also fell. Ethereum fell by 6.8%, Binance Coin (BNB) dropped by 4.6%, and Solana (SOL) by 8.1%. Dogecoin (DOGE) performed the least among the top 10 positioned tokens which is dropping by 11% to $0.348. The stock market also equally reacted negatively to Powell’s comments. The S&P 500 closed with a loss of 1.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 dropped by around 2%. These show how market is reacting to the news about government policies, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Powell’s stance on not supporting a Bitcoin reserve created uncertainty among investors and also, they quickly adjusted their positions by selling. Jerome Powell’s comments made it clear that the Federal Reserve is not interested in holding Bitcoin or supporting the U.S. Bitcoin reserve. The market’s reaction showed how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are dependent from investors and policymakers.

Santiment’s data, on the other hand, showed that 104 whale wallets with >100K ETH jointly held over 57% of the total supply worth $333.1B. ETH holders exhibited increased faith in the altcoin this year as the group’s overall balances grew steadily despite market volatility. IntoTheBlock’s ETH data summary revealed that 74% of the holders had held the token for more than 1 year, while large holders accounted for 53%. The number of transactions with a value of $100K or greater had a total volume of $65.4B in the last seven days as exchanges recorded a netflow of -$912.97M. The data suggested that most of the ETH supply was aggressively being moved into whale wallets. Long-term ETH holders continue to strengthen their holdings Long-term ETH holders showed conviction this year, with a continued increase in their collective balance. Roughly 110 million $ETH is now held by long-term holders. pic.twitter.com/smh7DZL1of — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) December 18, 2024 According to Santiment’s latest data, 104 whale wallets currently hold nearly 58% of all existing ETH tokens. These holdings reached an all-time high, suggesting a positive shift in long-term holder sentiment. These 104 whales reflected increasing confidence among ETH’s largest stakeholders as they continued accumulating despite the token’s ability to hold above $4K. Conversely, mid-level ETH holders (100-100K) dropped to their all-time low supply ratio, accounting for ~33% of the total supply. The broader Ethereum ecosystem generally included a rising number of staking wallets, signalling a bullish long-term outlook. Such sustained accumulation by key stakeholders suggested increased conviction and reduced selling pressure, which aligned with positive market sentiment over time. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed out that ETH’s price movement historically correlated with shifts in long-term holder sentiments. Long-term holders could, therefore, enter the ‘greed phase’ as the current bull cycle suggested a parabolic price surge. These holders were now in the early stages of the ‘belief’ stage, indicating they felt optimistic about ETH’s future price potential. If history repeated itself, this indicated that Ethereum’s major upward movement could still be on the horizon as long-term investor sentiment strengthened. Bitwise predicts ETH’s value will rise significantly in 2025 Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that Ethereum stood to benefit from several big trends in 2025. Leon claimed that ETH had positioned itself as the most ‘battle-tested’ smart contract platform, with an 81% share of the tokenization market. He argued that ETH would be the driving force behind the tripling of tokenized funds in 2025. Leon called ETH ‘the comeback kid of 2025’, saying it would likely lead in the $100 trillion tokenized real-world asset market next year. Ethereum was overshadowed by Bitcoin and Solana in 2024. The Bitwise investment strategist noted that Ethereum ETFs had attracted over $2 billion in net inflows over the past 10 days. Farside’s data confirmed a new daily record of $428.5 million in ETH ETF inflows on December 5th. According to the data, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only three of the 10 trading days Leon considered. Leon estimated that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on ETH could surpass its $2.4 billion YTD fees by more than 40 times in 2025. He attributed Ethereum’s next year’s dominance to its status as the most secure and reliable decentralized smart contract platform. Ethereum’s growth could also be accelerated by regulatory tailwinds and its widely distributed validator network.

The firm claimed that it has shifted its focus to Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency, which has been profitable, especially with the current price increases. *Metaplanet Projects First Fiscal Year Operating Profit Since 2017* pic.twitter.com/oYNKOtNatR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 18, 2024 Metaplanet expects an operating income of ¥270 million ($1.8 million) for the year ending December 31, which is an improvement from the ¥468 million ($3.1 million) loss it made the previous year. Sales are also forecast to increase at a much faster pace – from ¥261 million ($1.7 million) to ¥890 million ($5.8 million). Bitcoin treasury management powers growth Metaplanet has attributed a lot of its success to its focus on Bitcoin, especially through Bitcoin put options trading. The company has projected that it will earn ¥520 million ($3.4 million) from put options only. Put options allow Bitcoin investors to sell the digital currency at a specific price providing both protection and profit-making chance. Metaplanet stands to benefit from earning premiums on these contracts and, when exercised, receiving more Bitcoin. This has helped it to increase the number of Bitcoins it has and also helped it to generate revenue. The company currently holds 1,142 Bitcoin worth ¥17.6 billion or $119.4 million as of now, and this makes the firm the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. It goes further than simple trading, as the company has announced that it will create a separate “Bitcoin accumulation and management” business. Besides treasury management, Metaplanet has expanded its activities in the Bitcoin sphere. Recently, the company obtained a license to launch a Japanese edition of Bitcoin Magazine, which has become a new player in the digital asset media market. This could open up new income streams since the use of Bitcoin is on the rise in Japan and the rest of the world. The deal was announced in July at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, which was attended by the former US President, Donald Trump. Metaplanet is set to officially launch Bitcoin Magazine Japan in the first quarter of 2025. Bitcoin Magazine was launched in 2012 by Buterin and others and is one of the earliest outlets focused on Bitcoin. In a bid to strengthen its position, Metaplanet has offered ¥9.5 billion ($64.5 million) in bonds to increase its Bitcoin reserves. The company intends to use both debt and equity as capital to facilitate the accumulation strategy in the business. Besides Metaplanet, other companies that have been actively accumulating Bitcoin include MicroStrategy. This week only, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoin for about $1.6 billion and now holds 439,000 Bitcoin in its portfolio with a total value of over $46 billion.

37816186,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375109,1734560136,"Ohio Follows Pennsylvania, Texas in Pursuing State-Level Bitcoin Reserves","Ohio State Representative Derek Merrin has introduced House Bill 703, known as the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, in a bid to authorize the state treasurer to invest public funds in BTC. The latest initiative is announced as part of Merrin’s broader vision to leverage innovative financial solutions. The legislation provides the framework for Ohio to incorporate Bitcoin into its state treasury portfolio. Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act Merrin highlighted concerns about the ongoing devaluation of the US dollar, positioning Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset to preserve state funds’ value and supplement the existing financial framework. While the bill does not mandate the purchase of Bitcoin, it gives the State Treasurer the authority and flexibility to make such investments as part of asset allocation decisions. He stated, “Bitcoin is revolutionizing finance and will reshape world economies. We must have sound money – it’s like digital property rights for everyone who owns it. This legislation sets up the framework for Ohio’s state government to harness the power of Bitcoin to strengthen our state finances.” The bill also anticipates further federal-level efforts, referencing potential proposals from lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis to establish a national Bitcoin reserve under the incoming administration. Supporters like Andrew Burchwell, Executive Director of the Ohio Blockchain Council, also highlighted Bitcoin’s increasing adoption as a reserve asset globally, praising the legislation for positioning Ohio as a leader in this movement. State Bitcoin Reserves Merrin’s proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve positions Ohio alongside other states pursuing similar initiatives. For instance, in Pennsylvania, Republican Reps. Mike Cabell and Aaron Kaufer introduced the “Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act” in November. The bill allows the treasury to allocate up to 10% of the state’s $7 billion fund into Bitcoin to hedge against inflation and reduce reliance on traditional investments like bonds and cash reserves. In Texas, Republican Rep. Giovanni Capriglione filed House Bill 1598, establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve account funded entirely through donations. Unlike Pennsylvania’s approach, the assets in Texas’s reserve would be held for up to five years.

37817055,https://thecoinrise.com/deutsche-bank-tackles-institutional-regulatory-risk-with-ethereum/,1734560120,Deutsche Bank Tackles Institutional Regulatory Risk With Ethereum,"Deutsche Bank is at the forefront of a bold experiment to tackle the regulatory risks that have long plagued institutions. The financial bank revealed its plan to solve the issues using public blockchains like Ethereum. In November, the German bank introduced Project Dama 2, an innovative Layer 2 asset-servicing platform. Despite backlash from major industry players like Tether , this new initiative aims to solve compliance challenges for regulated financial institutions. It targets issues like unintentional transactions with sanctioned entities or criminal networks. These obstacles have long hindered seamless blockchain adoption in traditional finance. Bridging Compliance and Blockchain with Layer 2 At its core, Project Dama 2 integrates with Ethereum, leveraging the Layer 2 technology to offer faster and more cost-efficient transactions. However, innovation is not centered on reducing costs. It also focuses on redefining how banks engage with the blockchain. Boon-Hiong Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific innovation lead, emphasized the risks of public blockchains like Ethereum. He pointed out unclear transactions and accidental payments to sanctioned entities as key issues. Sudden disruptions, like unexpected system changes, are also major challenges. To address these challenges, Project Dama 2 adopts a dual-chain approach, which Chan believes could mitigate many of these concerns. This Layer 2 platform is an integral part of Project Guardian. The Monetary Authority of Singapore launched this initiative. It aims to unite 24 financial institutions to tokenize assets and explore blockchain’s potential. A Collaborative Effort to Tokenize Finance The development of Project Dama 2 reflects a strategic partnership between Deutsche Bank, Memento Blockchain Pte, and Interop Labs. The platform employs ZKsync technology, a sophisticated tool enabling banks to use public blockchains while maintaining enhanced regulatory control. Chan highlighted how this model allows financial institutions to create a detailed list of validators. It also ensures transactions are processed transparently and rewards are distributed fairly. Moreover, the system grants regulators “super admin rights,” enabling real-time monitoring of fund movements. By using this approach, Chan explained that banks no longer rely on Layer 1 blockchains for detailed transaction records. The minimum viable product (MVP) for Project Dama 2 is set to launch next year, pending regulatory approval. This platform could redefine how traditional banks interact with decentralized ecosystems if successful. Beyond Compliance: Deutsche Bank’s Growing Crypto Influence While Project Dama 2 captures headlines, Deutsche Bank’s blockchain ambitions do not stop there. The institution has actively forged strategic partnerships in the crypto sector. Recently, it joined forces with Keyrock to enhance the crypto-native market maker’s global services and expand its reach in key regions. Deutsche Bank has consistently advocated for blockchain technology to solve financial sector challenges like margin compression. In 2019, the financial bank joined JPMorgan’s blockchain-based Interbank Information Network. The move reinforced the bank’s role as a leader in adopting blockchain to enhance efficiency and transparency in banking operations.

37816222,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629967,1734559227,Fed’s rate cut sends US inflation up and stocks down. What does 2025 hold?,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%, triggering a sharp sell-off on Wall Street and raising fresh questions about inflation. The S&P 500 nosedived, erasing earlier gains, while inflation expectations climbed. The Fed raised its 2025 inflation forecast from 2.1% to 2.5% and slashed its planned rate cuts from three to two. The cut was divisive. Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack voted against it, calling for no cuts at all. Her dissent highlights the central bank’s struggle to balance inflation control with market stability. Alongside the cut, the Fed updated its quarterly projections, including the infamous “dot plots,” which chart where policymakers expect rates to go in the next three years. The dot plots now show only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the three predicted in September. Markets tumble as yields rise Treasury yields, particularly on the two-year note, surged. The two-year yield, which reacts sharply to Fed policy changes, rose eight basis points to 4.33%, its highest level since late November. The 10-year yield followed, climbing to 4.43%. Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that future decisions would be “data-dependent.” Markets, which had priced in a more aggressive series of cuts in 2025, quickly adjusted to the reality of a slower pace. Swap contracts tied to Fed policy decisions now reflect fewer rate cuts next year than previously expected, leaving investors grappling with tighter financial conditions. The Fed’s update on its long-term neutral rate—now pegged at 3%, up from 2.9%—also rattled markets. A higher neutral rate means the central bank sees less need to slash rates dramatically, even if the economy softens. That’s a tough pill for markets already jittery about inflation and sluggish growth prospects. Inflation creeps higher Inflation is back in focus, and the numbers aren’t encouraging. The inflation gauge the Fed uses to guide policy rose to 2.3% in October. November’s reading, due Friday, is expected to hit 2.5%, with core prices potentially climbing to 2.9%. This uptick complicates the Fed’s task. Higher inflation eats into consumer spending power, pushes borrowing costs higher, and could reignite wage pressures. The Fed’s revised inflation projections reflect these challenges. Policymakers now expect inflation to stay higher for longer, even as they cut rates cautiously. The Fed’s shift aligns more closely with market expectations, which have been trending higher since September. But for traders, this isn’t good news—it means tighter financial conditions and slower easing in 2025. Bond investors are particularly worried. Rising yields have already led to losses for those holding older bonds, as prices drop when yields climb.

But analysts at the firm warn that two critical indicators could signal that forecast is off course. Speaking during a webinar, Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital assets research, reiterated the firm’s confidence in Bitcoin’s four-year cycle, driven by BTC halving events. These events, which reduce the supply of newly produced Bitcoin by half, have historically triggered significant price increases. “Bitcoin’s gains tend to peak a year after the halving,” Sigel explained. Bitcoin’s most recent halving occurred in April 2024, potentially setting the stage for significant bullish momentum in 2025. Based on historical data, Bitcoin’s price could rise by nearly 1,000% from its recent low of $18,000 to a peak of $180,000. However, Sigel noted that several metrics should be monitored that could signal speculative excess or market weakness. VanEck analysts have identified two key warning signs that could signal a reversal: Continuous Funding Rates Sigel warned that a sustained funding rate above 10% for more than two months generally reflects speculative excess in the market. “Right now, the funding rate has exceeded 10%, but only for a few weeks,” he said. Persistently high funding rates indicate excessive demand for long positions, which could lead to a correction in the market. Relative Unrealized Profit “We recently hit 0.6, so forward yields are still promising,” Sigel said. “But if we hit 0.7, it’s probably time to consider a top call.” VanEck’s predictions extend well beyond 2025. Sigel predicted that Bitcoin could reach $3 million per token by 2050 as nation-states continue to adopt and strategically accumulate it. Sigel noted a hypothetical scenario in which the U.S. government creates a national Bitcoin reserve, as has been proposed by lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis. If the U.S. were to acquire 1 million Bitcoins during President-elect Donald Trump’s second term, and Bitcoin appreciated at an average annual rate of 25%, its price could exceed $42 million per token by 2050.

BTFD Coin is the Bullish Move to Secure This Month for Big Returns,"Do you remember when Floki Inu burst onto the crypto scene? Birthed by fans of Shiba Inu and inspired by Elon Musk’s own Shiba Inu dog, Floki Inu quickly grew into something much larger. Its community, the self-proclaimed “Floki Vikings,” rallied behind a shared vision of making Floki a cryptocurrency with utility and staying power. For early believers, Floki Inu became a gateway to impressive returns. From its ambitious NFT gaming metaverse, Valhalla, to its decentralised finance suite, FlokiFi, it captured the imagination of investors everywhere. But for many, it was another missed opportunity—a coin they heard about too late. If you’re still thinking about Floki Inu’s rise and wondering where your next big chance is, it’s time to look ahead. This month, that chance is BTFD Coin . With its explosive presale, impressive staking rewards, and forward-thinking roadmap, BTFD is becoming one of the best new meme coins to buy this month. The Baby Bull is charging, and for smart investors, this is the moment to secure your position before it takes off. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Everyone’s Talking About BTFD Coin is more than just a meme—it’s a mindset. Built around the idea of buying the dip and holding strong, it’s a rallying cry for investors who know how to navigate the ups and downs of the crypto market. And the market is already taking notice. In its 12th presale stage, BTFD has raised over $4.1 million, sold 56 billion tokens, and attracted more than 5,900 investors to its growing community of bulls. Priced at just $0.00013, the coin offers an accessible entry point for those who understand the value of getting in early. What makes BTFD stand out is its ability to deliver real value to its investors. The project offers 90% APY staking rewards, giving holders the chance to grow their portfolio passively while the coin continues to gain traction. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD combines community-driven energy with features that encourage long-term participation. Adding to its appeal is the upcoming Play-to-Earn game, which taps into one of the fastest-growing sectors in the crypto world. This game is designed to add real-world utility to the token, creating sustained demand and keeping investors engaged well beyond the presale phase. For those searching for the best new meme coins to buy this month , BTFD ticks every box. It has momentum, a strong community, and a clear vision for the future. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, BTFD offers a rare chance to get in early on what could be the next big success story. Floki Inu: A Story of Vision and Community Floki Inu’s success wasn’t an accident. While its origins were rooted in meme culture, it was backed by a passionate community and an ambitious roadmap that set it apart from the typical meme coin. With utility projects like Valhalla, an NFT gaming metaverse, and FlokiFi, a decentralised finance product suite, Floki Inu proved that meme coins could combine fun with functionality. The FlokiPlaces marketplace brought NFTs and merchandise into the ecosystem, while the University of Floki aimed to educate people about cryptocurrency. These projects gave Floki Inu tangible utility, making it more than just a speculative token. Its partnerships with major crypto players like Chainlink and Trader Joe added further credibility, while its Viking-inspired community rallied behind the idea of creating something lasting in the crypto space. Floki Inu’s rise showed the power of community and vision in the world of cryptocurrency. Those who got in early reaped the rewards as its value surged, proving once again that timing and belief are everything in crypto. But for those who missed out, the regret is real. If Floki Inu taught us anything, it’s that opportunities in crypto don’t last long. The key is recognising the next big move—and right now, that move is BTFD Coin. The Bottom Line Floki Inu’s rise to prominence showcased how a strong community and a clear vision can turn a simple meme into a significant player in the crypto world. Its success rewarded early believers and became a symbol of what’s possible when a project combines fun with functionality. But like all major opportunities, its biggest gains were reserved for those who acted fast. Now, the spotlight is on BTFD Coin, one of the best new meme coins to buy this month, already making waves with its thriving presale, massive staking rewards, and ambitious roadmap. This is your chance to get in early, secure your position, and be part of a community that’s charging forward. Don’t let another opportunity slip by—BTFD is ready to reward those who act today.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-surge-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37815503,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629991,1734558037,"Hyperliquid tokens are valued at over $9B, but may carry extreme risk","Hyperliquid completed the first days after its airdrop, focusing on the native HYPE token. The perpetual futures DEX, however, is building an ecosystem of tokens, which may hold both opportunities and high risks. Hyperliquid is shifting the focus from its native HYPE token to its wider ecosystem of assets. As a high-speed chain, Hyperliquid has already started adding tokens. Its initial list of assets is now valued at over $1B for all the new tickers, based on Cryptorank data . As of December 18, the HYPE ticker is valued at $8B, still making the bulk of the Hyperliquid trading ecosystem. HYPE peaked above $28.20 before sliding again to the $24 range. The expectation for HYPE is to reflect the growing activity and possibly climb to a higher price range. For others, HYPE is not sustainable and may start to lose value more rapidly. HYPE still depends on its native DEX trading, with limited opportunities for more balanced price discovery. Hyperliquid DEX sparks a wave of token generation Tokens are quickly catching up, in a way similar to aping into meme tokens on Solana. For months before the generation of the HYPE token, the Hyperliquid DEX was seen as another perpetual futures platform, similar to dy/dx. Once tokenized, the chain and the DEX showed their potential for price discovery through rapid trading. The Hyperliquid DEX may have turned into another token casino with the potential for breakouts. PURR is the biggest meme token to date, which was airdropped to early users. The Hypurr (PURR) project trades at $0.47, with a total capitalization of $277.8M. Just days ago, the token peaked above $370M. The asset grew by as much as 200% within days, granting unexpected airdrop value to early adopters. HFUN went vertical once the ticker established liquidity and sufficient market makers. | Source: Cryptorank The third-largest token is Hypurr Fun (HFUN), which launched on December 5 and had a vertical climb with 1,500% gains at one point. The token is the native asset of the fastest Telegram trading bot for Hyperliquid. Within days, Hyperliquid was carrying a small selection of blue chip memes, with liquidity flowing in. Auctions are also launching based on their 31-hour schedule, each with a higher starting price for new tickers. Hyperliquid limits the number of tickers Hyperliquid has put a bottleneck on the number of tokens listed. The perpetual futures DEX will not have unlimited listings like other automated platforms. Instead, Hyperliquid sets up Dutch auctions for available tickers. Even established projects will have to buy their ticker at auction. A Dutch auction starts at the highest possible price, which decreases until a buyer is found. For instance, the SOLV ticker was sold for $128,000, raising the floor for the next bid. Hyperliquid carries out a ticker auction every 31 hours. Over time, the price to deploy tokens gradually increases, making the first listings look cheap by comparison. The tokens pay the fees in the form of network gas, which keeps climbing for new tickers. In the past few days, listing prices climbed close to $1M, with the potential to increase. A high fee to buy a ticker is not an endorsement or a guarantee of the token’s performance. In the last few days after Hyperliquid started adding more tokens, the GOD ticker was the leader, selling for $975K. The next auction will start with a price of $1.95M, further challenging the projects that want to list on Hyperliquid.

The rapidly rising price essentially blocks the launchers of small-scale or experimental memes, thus discouraging rug pulls. Hyperliquid tokens, however, may hold one major risk. The newly listed tokens may lack market makers and remain practically frozen. Currently, buyers are even aping into tokens with a small investment, while waiting for assets to enter the hyperliquid stage. At that point, previously inactive tokens may pump significantly. Hyperliquid tokens are already available through DexScreener, transparently showing the available market makers . The tokens offer the opportunity to buy during periods of low activity, then sell when there is available hyper-liquidity. Token trading is just taking off on Hyperliquid and is yet to show the full effects of the Dutch auctions and limited listings.

37815252,https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-layer-2-hashkey-chain-goes-live-on-mainnet/,1734557970,Ethereum Layer 2 HashKey Chain Goes Live on Mainnet,"HashKey Group, a Hong-Kong-based regulated digital asset leader, has officially launched its Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, HashKey Chain, on the mainnet. This marks a significant leap forward in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, positioning the group as a key player in global decentralized finance (DeFi). Testing the Limits: HashKey Chain’s Impressive Numbers Before its mainnet debut, HashKey Chain underwent a rigorous testnet phase, which began on November 11, and the results were remarkable. The platform recorded an impressive 25 million transactions, securing over 860,000 wallet addresses. It handled 400 transactions per second under simulated conditions. Over 50 projects were deployed during this period, with a 300,000-strong community actively participating. These achievements underline HashKey’s commitment to building a robust and dynamic blockchain network. Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Lab, said this is not just about building a blockchain. It is an initiative focused on delivering an efficient and secure platform. The focus is on creating an environment that is welcoming to developers. HashKey Chain Joins the Ethereum Superchain Revolution HashKey Chain’s debut aligns it with the Ethereum Superchain, a network of interconnected Layer 2 blockchains powered by Optimism’s OP Stack. This integration enhances blockchain interoperability. This positions HashKey Chain alongside prominent platforms like Coinbase’s Base, Zora, and Worldcoin. The Superchain improves scalability, making it easier for developers to create efficient decentralized applications (dApps). HashKey Chain is not just a follower but a leader within this ecosystem. Its native token, HSK, is available on various exchanges and enables holders to engage in governance. Also, it shapes the network’s future, promoting decentralization and community involvement. Reportedly, HashKey did not stop at infrastructure. HashKey Chain recently rolled out a $50 million grant program to support and attract top-tier talent. This initiative offered funding, technical mentorship, and opportunities for collaboration. With this program, HashKey is cultivating a developer ecosystem ready to tackle real-world challenges using decentralized solutions. Beyond the Blockchain: Crypto ETFs and Market Presence HashKey’s influence extends far beyond its Layer 2 chain. The group has made remarkable progress in the crypto industry through strategic initiatives and partnerships. Recently, it partnered with Bosera Asset Management to launch Hong Kong’s first spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier this year. These ETFs have attracted over $88 million in investments, showing strong investor interest. However, their scale remains smaller compared to U.S. counterparts. Collaborating with Ripple, HashKey advanced XRPL (XRP Ledger) solution in Japan , strengthening blockchain innovation in the region. In August, HashKey Exchange added AVAX and LINK to its trading platform to expand its crypto offerings and reinforce its market leadership.

37817212,https://invezz.com/?p=2394404,1734557653,"Amid Bitcoin surge, Hong Kong approves new crypto exchange licenses","Hong Kong is solidifying its position as a global digital asset hub by granting licenses to four new cryptocurrency exchanges. Accumulus GBA Technology, DFX Labs, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology are the latest platforms to receive regulatory approval from the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), bringing the total number of licensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) in the city to seven. These approvals, announced amidst a significant surge in Bitcoin’s price, reflect Hong Kong’s commitment to bolstering its competitiveness in the digital asset space, and signal a strategic approach to balance innovation with investor protection. The SFC has emphasized a “swift licensing process,” ensuring these new platforms meet stringent regulatory standards, while expediting their entry into the market. According to Eric Yip, SFC executive director of intermediaries, “We aim to strike a balance between safeguarding the interests of investors and facilitating continuous development for the virtual asset ecosystem in Hong Kong.” The timing of these approvals is particularly noteworthy, with Bitcoin’s value soaring over 60% in the past six months, even crossing the $100,000 threshold for the first time, a milestone which has underscored the need for well-regulated platforms. While the SFC has granted licenses, these new exchanges must complete additional steps before fully commencing operations. This includes thorough checks for vulnerabilities and independent testing to ensure they adhere to the highest standards of security and compliance. Thousand Whales Technology, the operator of the EX.IO trading platform, is particularly notable as it is backed by Valuable Capital Group, a brokerage owned by Sina Corporation, which also operates China’s popular social media site Weibo. This highlights the growing connections between traditional finance and the digital asset space. These four newly licensed exchanges were part of a larger group of nearly 30 firms that applied for VATP licenses in 2024. However, some notable platforms, such as OKX and HTX, withdrew their applications due to ongoing regulatory concerns, further indicating the need for a robust and sustainable regulatory framework for the region. Hong Kong has previously licensed HashKey, OSL, and HKVAX, and earlier this year became the first in Asia to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for spot Bitcoin and Ether, outpacing the United States. However, Hong Kong has encountered difficulties in regulating over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trading. Now the city is adjusting its regulatory oversight approach based on recent industry feedback.

37816283,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52509,1734557434,Elon Musk’s Grok Says XRP Will Hit this Price By New Year’s Eve,"XRP has been one of the standout performers in the 2024 cryptocurrency market, registering an over 300% year-to-date (YTD) increase. Despite this impressive rally, the token’s recent price trend has raised questions about its near-term trajectory. Following the news of RLUSD’s official launch on December 17, XRP momentarily surpassed a key resistance level of $2.50 and traded at $2.70. However, since reaching this milestone, the token has experienced consolidation as it trades at $2.35, according to CoinMarketCap. Given this mixed scenario—marked by both a sharp rally and subsequent stagnation—investors and analysts seek clarity about whether XRP can sustain its momentum. To provide insight, Times Tabloid consulted GrokAI, a leading artificial intelligence tool, to evaluate XRP’s price potential by the end of 2024. GrokAI’s 2024 Year-End XRP Price Forecast In its assessment, GrokAI acknowledged XRP’s strong performance but emphasized the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The AI model highlighted that XRP’s recent price surge was largely driven by external factors, including developments in Ripple’s legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It also noted that shifts within the SEC have played a critical role in shaping investor sentiment. Factoring in the token’s historical price trends, resistance levels, and market dynamics, GrokAI offered a conservative year-end price prediction of $2.50 for XRP. Explaining its reasoning, GrokAI stated, “Most of the token’s big jumps were driven by external developments – and there are no guarantees there will be more of these events in the remaining weeks of 2024.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The AI model further clarified that accounting for these external influences, coupled with resistance levels and the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, leads to the conclusion that XRP’s price may remain stable through the end of the year. Volatility and Market Sentiment While some may view this forecast as stagnation, GrokAI’s cautious stance reflects its consideration of XRP’s current market position. After a rapid ascent to $2.70, the token has struggled to break through key resistance levels, and the absence of significant catalysts suggests that further upward momentum may be limited for now. Nevertheless, GrokAI hinted at potential opportunities for XRP beyond 2024. The AI model noted that January 2025 could serve as a turning point for the token, citing the upcoming resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. The anticipated appointment of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins as his replacement is expected to provide a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially driving renewed interest in XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Although XRP has already benefited from news of Gensler’s departure, GrokAI suggested that the actual leadership transition is another catalyst for the token’s price.

In a real 11-hour move, Congressional leaders have unveiled a stopgap bill to fund the government for three more months. Should it pass, lawmakers will narrowly avoid a government shutdown. However, the new deadline to agree on a budget would come during President-elect Trump’s crucial first 100 days in office. Lawmakers now have until Friday to pass the highly-anticipated continuing resolution , all 1,500 pages of it. The House Rules Committee will have to approve a violation of the 72-hour rule, whereby bill text is released three days ahead of a vote. Over in the Senate, unanimous approval is needed to break procedure for passage before the deadline. As we’ve written about before , Republicans and Democrats largely agree that a CR is the best way (and at this point, the only way) to avert a shutdown. Some highlights from the bill: $110.4 billion in total disaster aid, most of which would go to southern US states in the wake of hurricanes Milton and Helene. There’s a provision that would give DC control over Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, an agreement that would help the District bring the Commanders back to the city.

37814819,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375280,1734557111,Why Did Ripple’s (XRP) Price Crash by 18% in 36 Hours?,"TL:DR; XRP was the top performer from the larger-cap alts until yesterday afternoon, but its price has tumbled hard by double digits since then. Could that be related only to the market-wide retracement, or is there more to the story, such as another ‘sell-the-news’ event? Recall the price developments around XRP that took place earlier this week. The asset stood at around $2.35 but exploded on Monday evening to almost $2.6 after the company behind it announced that its long-anticipated stablecoin would be launched on the next day – December 17. The positive movements continued on the launch date as XRP skyrocketed to a multi-week peak of $2.73 (on Bitstamp and other exchanges). However, Ripple’s cross-border token failed to maintain its momentum despite multiple highly bullish price predictions. Just the opposite, it started to retrace and dropped to $2.5 earlier today before the market-wide correction after the Fed’s latest rate cut pushed it south violently to a 6-day low of $2.23. Although this plunge could be attributed to the overall crypto market drop, XRP’s retracement is more painful than most, being down by 11% on a 24-hour scale and by 15% on a 36-hour one. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView As such, this could go under the ‘sell-the-news’ category, given the fact that XRP jumped ahead of the RLUSD launch, and its price has tumbled after the new token actually went live for trading. Additionally, the situation around a potential XRP ETF in the States doesn’t seem too bright, at least according to experts on the matter. As reported earlier, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas warned that Ripple might be behind other projects that could be greenlighted first, such as Litecoin and Hedera. The ETF expert predicted that such a wait could be related to Ripple’s ongoing legal tussle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission even though there will be a seismic shift in the agency’s leadership in the next few months.

37814915,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629983,1734556800,Cardano charts a strategic path to 2030 with nine key focus areas,"Input Output (IO), the research and development company behind Cardano, has introduced a Strategic Research Agenda to guide Cardano’s evolution toward 2030. The plan defines nine areas of focus to increase the plan’s scalability, governance, interoperability, and security. Each area tackles a specific concern in the blockchain arena and positions Cardano for new possibilities. Nine themes for growth and innovation The Strategic Research Agenda is built around nine topics, including the world’s operating system, Ouroboros Omega, Tokenomicon, Global Identity, Democracy 4.0, the internet Hydra-ted, Interchains, Core Zero-Knowledge capabilities, and the post-quantum landscape. These areas are in line with the strategic plan of addressing the challenges that blockchain presents and the preparation for Cardano’s tomorrow. Among the key goals of the “world’s operating system” is to enhance the performance of smart contracts and the infrastructure necessary for the development of new services. Ouroboros Omega will increase the overall efficiency of the blockchain to accommodate for higher volumes of transactions in the course of the Cardano ecosystem expansion. To deliver on the full promise of blockchain, Input | Output Research is advancing a Strategic Research Agenda through 9 thematic focus areas. From scaling the Ouroboros protocol stack, to building a next-level identity and credential layer, and enabling seamless interchain… pic.twitter.com/RVzFEmOels — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) December 18, 2024 Tokenomics is another important area that comes to the fore. IO intends to investigate the use of additional transaction options, including Babel fees, as well as enhance the management of user-defined assets. The Tokenomicon initiative aims at exploring this relatively uncharted territory of blockchain technology. Global Identity is another key focus area that focuses on integrating digital identity into the Cardano ecosystem. This initiative aims at plugging into governance structures, transactions, and smart contracts and fostering cross-cutting compatibility. Another major focus is Democracy 4.0, which aims to transform blockchain-based voting systems. Additionally, the Hydra protocol aids Cardano’s scalability by increasing transaction speed and decreasing transaction costs. It is designed for high-load applications such as games and supply chain management. Calls for governance reforms at the Cardano foundation In related news, the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, has called on the Cardano Foundation to consider moving to a jurisdiction that supports community-driven board elections. He proposed Abu Dhabi or Wyoming as the possible locations for the shooting. The two locations are popular for offering support for the regulation of blockchain and encouraging innovation. The Cardano Foundation is currently based on the Swiss legal framework. This legal framework does not contemplate community-based board votes. However, there are still demands for the organization’s reshuffling of its leadership even with the adoption of open forums to enhance transparency. As stated by Hoskinson, relocation to either Abu Dhabi or Wyoming would enable the community to have more control over governance, leadership choices, financial management, and strategic direction. These jurisdictions offer additional inclusive spaces that might enhance the opportunities for community engagement. As of this writing, Cardano is currently trading at $0.9917, registering a 7% decline in the last 24 hours. Additionally, in the last seven days, ADA has declined by 7.76%. Over the past month, it grew by 33.26% and over six months, it increased by 183.90%.

Cosmos (ATOM) just dropped a major announcement with its CosmWasm Coalition, an initiative powered by the ATOM Accelerator to fund groundbreaking blockchain projects. It’s a move designed to solidify Cosmos as the go-to platform for interconnected blockchains. Meanwhile, Render (RNDR) is turning heads in the Web3 space with its advanced tokenisation models for decentralized GPU rendering, showing massive potential for creatives in gaming, media, and AI. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) —a rising star promising to eliminate the everyday complexities of crypto. If you’ve ever felt like crypto is a maze only techies can navigate, Qubetics is here to flip the script. With features like instant fiat conversion and integration with payment systems like Apple Pay, it’s making crypto transactions as easy as buying your morning coffee. Let’s dive into why these three are the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 and how they’re reshaping the market. Qubetics: The Wallet That Changes the Game Crypto adoption has always hit a wall with usability. That’s where Qubetics steps in, solving the “too complex” problem with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet . Whether you’re a business, freelancer, or just someone trying to make sense of digital assets, Qubetics makes crypto transactions feel effortless. Let’s paint a picture. Say you’re a freelance designer living in the U.S., and your client is in the U.K. With Qubetics, you don’t need to worry about conversion rates or market volatility. The wallet automatically converts your payment to fiat at the point of sale . And the best part? It works seamlessly with Apple Pay, Google Pay, and other systems you’re already using. It’s crypto made simple. For businesses, this wallet opens up new possibilities. A local coffee shop can accept crypto without needing to learn the ins and outs of blockchain. The built-in smart contract conversion mechanism ensures every transaction is stable and secure, giving both businesses and customers peace of mind. It’s not just a wallet—it’s a revolution in how we think about digital payments. And here’s the kicker: Qubetics is in Presale Phase 13, with the price of 1 $TICS at just $0.0342. Over $7 million has already been raised, and more than 355 million tokens have been snapped up by over 10,600 holders. With a 10% price increase on the horizon and a post-presale target of $0.25, this project is poised to deliver an eye-popping 900% ROI. If you’re still on the fence, now’s the time to jump in. Cosmos: Building the Blockchain Highway Cosmos (ATOM) isn’t just another blockchain—it’s a network of blockchains. Dubbed the “internet of blockchains,” it’s designed to solve one of crypto’s biggest pain points: interoperability. And with its latest CosmWasm Coalition, it’s taking things to the next level. The ATOM Accelerator has pledged matching funding for projects using Neutron and CosmWasm tech, setting the stage for rapid growth. Why does this matter? Imagine a world where different blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot can communicate seamlessly. Cosmos is making that dream a reality with its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. It’s like building highways between cities that were previously isolated. Developers love Cosmos because it’s scalable, eco-friendly, and ridiculously fast. But it’s not just techies who are excited. Investors are eyeing ATOM as one of the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, thanks to its strong fundamentals and ambitious roadmap. With more projects joining the Cosmos ecosystem every day, the potential for growth is staggering. Here’s a fun fact: Cosmos isn’t just about tech. It’s about community. The ecosystem thrives on collaboration, with developers and stakeholders working together to push boundaries. If you’re looking for a crypto that combines innovation with real-world impact, ATOM might just be your ticket. Render: Powering the Future of Creativity Render (RNDR) is the kind of project that makes you stop and say, “Why didn’t I think of that?” Focused on decentralized GPU rendering, Render is giving artists, game developers, and AI researchers a new way to access computing power. In a world where visuals and graphics are king, this project is a game changer. Here’s the scoop: Render allows users to tokenize GPU rendering power. Instead of relying on expensive centralized services, creatives can tap into a decentralized network of GPUs to bring their visions to life. Think of it as Airbnb, but for computing power. Recent developments have put Render in the spotlight. The platform is now gaining traction as a key player in the Web3 space, with analysts predicting a 100x potential. Whether you’re into gaming, 3D modeling, or AI development, Render is making high-quality rendering accessible to everyone. But it’s not just about tech. Render is also about empowerment. By decentralizing GPU rendering, it’s giving power back to the people—literally. No more gatekeeping by big corporations. If you’re on the hunt for the Best Cryptos to Buy in December 2024, RNDR is definitely one to watch. Wrapping It Up So, what do Qubetics, Cosmos, and Render have in common? They’re not just cryptocurrencies; they’re solutions to real-world problems. Qubetics is simplifying crypto transactions, making them as easy as swiping your card. Cosmos is building the bridges that will connect blockchains across the globe. And Render? It’s democratizing GPU rendering for creatives everywhere.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Comparing IntelMarkets and Bonk as Solana targets $500 by Christmas. Table of Contents Solana $500 price possible by Christmas BONK fueled by speculative trading IntelMarkets among the best bets for Christmas Conclusion Christmas is known to bring huge surges to the crypto market. As the days till Christmas count away, many analysts are wondering what the season will bring to cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Bonk (BONK). At the same time, IntelMarkets (INTL) is emerging among the best crypto bets for this festive period. Solana $500 price possible by Christmas Solana’s fast and low-cost blockchain has become a game-changer for decentralized applications and DeFi. SOL is currently trading at around $215, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.26 billion, and a market cap of over $100 billion. Driven by favorable market sentiment SOL reached its ATH of $263.83 in November 2024. However, the altcoin has seen a decline of around 6% in the past week. Despite this, analysts believe the current market sentiment gives a bullish trend that could drive SOL to reach the $500 mark by Christmas. Solana’s solid technological advancements, increasing adoption, and overall positive momentum in the crypto market further fuels this optimism. BONK fueled by speculative trading The meme-inspired cryptocurrency built on the Solana network, BONK, has gained quite a reputation due to its community-driven approach. BONK was launched on December 25, 2022, to rejuvenate liquidity on Solana-based decentralized exchanges. After launch, the token skyrocketed in price and added to the growth in Solana’s value. Currently, BONK is priced at $0.000034, with a 24-hour trading volume of $457M and a market capitalization of approximately $2.6 billion. Following the initial spike in November’s massive market hype, BONK saw a massive price correction, falling more than 50% to previous levels. It is difficult to predict BONK’s forthcoming performance, as BONK is quite volatile due to its meme nature. While BONK can provide short-term gains, its lack of substantial real-world utility means that its price depends on community sentiment making it a high-risk investment. You might also like: XRP falls below $2.5; experts see SEC overhaul boosting IntelMarkets demand IntelMarkets among the best bets for Christmas IntelMarkets is a trading platform that aims to integrate artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to provide top-notch trading solutions that will improve traders’ efficiency and profitability. Notably, its AI-powered bots will be able to execute trades across multiple markets. The eighth stage of IntelMarkets’ ICO is in progress, having raised over $4,900,000, showing strong interest from investors. The INTL token is priced at $0.073. INTL offers unparalleled growth potential in part thanks to its relatively low market cap, which could result in great upside after launch. IntelMarkets is also strategically positioning itself by following current market trends, focusing on AI and DeFi integration. With its listing nearing by the day, INTL could be on its way to the moon. Conclusion While Solana shows promise for potential gains leading up to Christmas and BONK offers speculative opportunities, IntelMarkets stands out as a strategic investment. Its approach in combining AI and DeFi positions it favorably for substantial growth in the Christmas season. For more information on IntelMarkets, visit their website or Telegram .

37814381,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/altura-alu-is-getting-ready-for-a-massive-breakout,1734556135,Altura ($ALU) Is Getting Ready for a Massive Breakout,"Altura ($ALU) is gaining momentum as a top contender in the blockchain space, and the buzz surrounding its upcoming breakout is undeniable. With its innovative approach to integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and gaming, Altura is setting the stage to revolutionize the digital economy. Let's dive into why Altura is bullish, explore the technical analysis, and discuss the potential for significant price movement. Altura’s Bullish Case: AI and Gaming Innovations Altura stands out in the blockchain landscape for its commitment to combining cutting-edge AI technologies with gaming. The project has developed advanced AI-driven solutions that optimize in-game economies, personalize player experiences, and enhance scalability for developers. This focus positions Altura as a leader in the emerging sector of GameFi (Gaming Finance).Moreover, Altura's smart NFT technology—which allows for dynamic NFTs that can evolve based on in-game actions—is further enhanced by its AI capabilities. This combination provides unparalleled utility and value to both gamers and developers. As gaming continues to grow into a multi-billion-dollar industry, Altura’s unique innovations make it a strong candidate for long-term success. Technical Analysis: Falling Wedge Pattern Indicates Bullish Potential From a technical perspective, Altura’s price chart is exhibiting a classic Falling Wedge pattern. This pattern is characterized by converging trendlines, where the upper resistance line slopes downward more steeply than the lower support line. Falling Wedges are widely recognized as bullish reversal patterns, signaling that a significant price breakout is likely imminent. Currently, Altura is trading near the lower boundary of the Falling Wedge, showing signs of increasing buying pressure. Here are the key levels to watch: - First Target: The recent high of $0.165. This level represents the first resistance point and a short-term target for Altura once it breaks out of the wedge. Source: Tradingview - Second Target: The 1.6 Fibonacci retracement level at around $0.20 per coin. Fibonacci levels often act as strong indicators of potential price movement, and the $0.20 mark is a critical milestone for traders. Source: Tradingview Understanding the Falling Wedge Pattern The Falling Wedge pattern is considered one of the most reliable bullish setups in technical analysis. It occurs when an asset’s price consolidates between two downward-sloping trendlines. As the wedge narrows, it signals that sellers are losing momentum, paving the way for buyers to take control. A breakout above the resistance line typically results in a sharp upward price movement, as pent-up demand propels the asset higher.For Altura , the combination of this bullish pattern and increasing volume is a strong indicator that a breakout is on the horizon. Traders and investors should watch for a confirmed breakout above the resistance line, accompanied by strong trading volume, to validate the move. Long-Term Vision: A Multi-Billion-Dollar Project While the short-term targets of $0.165 and $0.20 are exciting, Altura’s true potential lies in its long-term growth. With the rise of AI and gaming innovations, Altura is well-positioned to become a multi-billion-dollar project. The convergence of blockchain, AI, and gaming is creating new opportunities, and Altura’s leadership in this space ensures it will be at the forefront of this revolution.In addition, the project’s partnerships and continuous development are strengthening its ecosystem, attracting more developers and users. As adoption grows, the value of $ALU is expected to rise significantly, making it a compelling investment opportunity for both short-term traders and long-term holders. Conclusion Altura ($ALU) is on the verge of a massive breakout, fueled by its groundbreaking AI and gaming innovations. The technical setup, particularly the Falling Wedge pattern, indicates strong bullish potential with short-term targets of $0.165 and $0.20. However, the true value of Altura lies in its long-term vision of transforming the gaming industry and achieving multi-billion-dollar market capitalization.For investors seeking exposure to a high-growth project with cutting-edge technology, Altura represents an exciting opportunity. As the breakout unfolds, all eyes will be on $ALU to see just how far it can go in reshaping the future of blockchain gaming. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37814394,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313356,1734556119,Bitcoin Price Drops As Jerome Powell Says Federal Reserve ‘Not Allowed’ To Hold BTC,"The price of Bitcoin is testing $100,000 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell issued a statement on the central bank’s ability to hold BTC. Powell took questions from reporters after announcing the Fed has lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point in its third consecutive reduction. When asked if he sees any value in the Fed building a Bitcoin reserve, Powell said current laws make it impossible. “We’re not allowed to own Bitcoin. The Federal Reserve Act says what we can own and we’re not looking for a law change.” The Federal Reserve Act outlines the types of assets the central bank can hold, primarily including US government securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other assets related to its monetary policy operations. Powell says only a congressional act can allow the Fed to buy BTC – which is something he has no interest in. “That’s the kind of thing for Congress to consider, but we are not looking for a law change at the Fed.” Powell’s statement, along with his declaration that the Fed will likely lower rates only twice next year, sent BTC from around $103,700 to as low as $100,241 in less than an hour. President-elect Trump has said he will ensure the US stops selling its trove of seized Bitcoin on the open market and instead strategically hold the asset as an investment. Early this week, when questioned by CNBC on whether he plans to build a strategic BTC reserve, Trump said “Yeah, I think so.” However, to date, Trump has not issued a statement on whether he believes the Fed or Treasury Department should accumulate BTC. Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced legislation that would direct the Fed to buy one million BTC over a five year period. Whether her legislation will secure widespread backing within Congress remains to be seen.

The board explored loopholes that AI developers may exploit to process personal data without contravening current legislation . The European Data Protection Board raised questions over the lawful basis for AI developers processing user personal data. In an opinion published on December 17, the board addressed various matters of general application in compliance with Article 64(2)of the GDPR. European Union privacy board weighs in on issues in data protection and AI deployment The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) issued the opinion upon the Irish supervisory authority’s request. The board noted it had a statutory mandate under the General Data Protection Regulations(GDPR) to issue an opinion on matters affecting more than one member state within the European Union. The agency pointed out the requests presented by the Irish body related to processing personal data during the Artificial Intelligence(AI) development and deployment phases. It narrowed the opinion to four issues related to data protection within the European Union. The issues included when and how an AI model can be considered anonymous and how controllers can illustrate the necessity of legitimate interest in deployment. The board also explored the consequences of unlawful data processing during the development phase of an AI model on the subsequent operation of the AI model. Regarding the question of when and how an AI model’s anonymity can be determined, the body stated that a competent local authority should make such a determination on a case-by-case basis. The board expressed that it did not consider all AI models trained using personal data anonymously. The body recommended that national supervisory authorities evaluate relevant documentation the controller provides to determine a model’s anonymity. It added that controllers should also take the relevant steps to limit personal data collection during training and mitigate potential attacks. On the question of legitimate interest as an appropriate legal basis for processing personal data during the deployment of AI models, the board left it upon the controllers to determine the appropriate legal basis for processing such data. The EDPB emphasized the three-step test for determining legitimate interest by supervisory bodies. The steps included identifying the actual legitimate interest and analyzing its necessity. Controllers must also assess whether the legitimate interest balances with the data subjects’ rights and freedoms. In assessing the consequences, the body referred the discretion to the supervisory authorities in the respective states. It added the SAs should choose the appropriate consequences depending on the facts of each scenario. Ireland Data Protection Commission comments on EDPB opinion on AI model regulation The Ireland Data Protection Commission responded in a statement noting the opinion would promote effective and consistent AI model regulation in the EU. Commissioner Dale Sunderland commented: It will also support the DPC’s engagement with companies developing new AI models before they launch on the EU market, as well as the handling of the many AI-related complaints that have been submitted to the DPC. Dale Sunderland Complaints over ChatGPTs maker OpenAI have reportedly been put on the frame over the past months. Polish Data Protection Authority raised questions last year about the AI developer’s compliance with the GDPR. The authority alleged that OpenAI overlooked requirements such as prior consultation with regulators where there was a risk of personal data breach. The regulator noted that OpenAI launched ChatGPT without consulting local regulators in contravention of the GDPR guidelines. Italy’s Garante also ordered OpenAI to cease processing personal data in 2023 before addressing issues it had identified with the company’s platform. It highlighted that the San Fransico-based company lacked measures to prevent minors from accessing the technology as required by law. The regulatory authority warned that failure to comply with the guidelines would attract penalties, including a four percent annual turnover or twenty million euros, whichever was greater.

37819274,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105621,1734555614,"Blockchain Audits Are Complex, Costly, And Completely Necessary","A development firm shocked laypersons by quoting $300,000 for a security audit in a preliminary market survey. However, those familiar with the ins and outs of the blockchain world were not surprised by the hefty price tag in the least. A number of factors necessitate the high costs, including the extreme scarcity of audit teams with the required expertise.Blockchain audits are time-consuming and highly complex. Atom Accelerator recently ran an RFP that culminated in a grant of $440,000 for Zellic to engage as an audit partner of Cosmos Hub over a period of two years. Zellic has performed audits for Cosmos Hub numerous times, including the Inactive Validator Set, Permissionless ICS, and Liquid Staking Module (engaged by Atom Accelerator). The Inactive Validators set involved a third-party audit of the codebase with the same name. Zellic conducted the audit in two weeks for a total ask price of $59,500, which included Simply Staking’s fee as an intermediary. This entity also performed mediation for the Permissionless ICS third-party audit, which enabled anyone to create an optional consumer chain without a governance proposal, aimed at launching chains faster and with less friction. Zellic’s quote was $90,000 and a 25% price buffer to account for ATOM token volatility during the voting period. The total price, including Simply Staking’s fees, was $121,500. Cosmos Hub spent $327,000 on one-off feature audits in the past year and a half, coming to an average of $26,000 for each week in which audits took place. The grant engages Zellic based on a 20 audit-week contract, which costs 16% less per week than Cosmos Hub paid, thanks to Atom Accelerator’s efforts. A smart contract audit can take up to a monthThe project’s size and complexity are the primary factors in determining how long a smart contract audit will take. While auditing a single token contract takes a couple of days, this goes up to a week for a decentralized application with complicated tokenomics. More advanced smart contract security audits are performed in up to a month. The length also depends on whether the developer team wants a full security audit or only an interim report. It’s generally a better idea to audit the smart contract that has been deployed, not the one on GitHub. It minimizes the risk of code churning and malicious last-minute bugs and conveys a message of transparency to the user community.The audit’s duration is also affected by whether it’s manual or automated. Reviewing individual functions in the code manually is time-intensive. However, manual audits are more efficient because they reduce the risk of false reports. They involve checking the code line-by-line to help identify hidden issues in its architecture and logic.Binary analysis and cryptographic algorithm verificationSmart contract auditors perform a binary analysis to make sure the code is free from backdoors, i.e. hidden mechanisms attackers use to access a system without authentication. To this end, the team makes sure no unauthorized entities gain administrative access and inspects the transcoding and bonding protocols among participants. It also verifies cryptographic algorithms and enhances the overall security infrastructure.Product security audits require deep knowledge of programming languagesMost software products integrate a user interface. Smart contracts frequently interact with a backend server in DeFi and Web3, whose code can be proprietary or open-source. The interface communicates with the backend server and uses Metamask or another local wallet to verify the user and sign transactions. There is often at least one database, such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB, and AWS Cognito, Auth0, or another OAuth2 authentication service.Product security auditors verify that all components interact with each other as expected, each component performs its functions correctly, no information leaks are possible, system deployment procedures follow best practices, and unauthorized access is prevented. These tasks require a strong understanding of large software project architecture and the ability to navigate codebases written in different programming languages. Typically, the frontend is written in ReactJS, while the backend is a mix of Golang, NodeJS, Python, etc. The smart contracts are in Rust or Solidity. A wide range of tools is involved, including blockchain nodes and Docker container management techniques.Penetration testers are well-versed in network protocols and architecturePenetration testing focuses on external API endpoints Web2 backend services offer. Testing auditors mitigate security flaws by calling some of these APIs via unexpected syntax to obtain privileged access. This is a common attack vector, where cybercriminals trick the system into leaking private data or performing another unauthorized action. Auditors are well-versed in network protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP/HTTPS, UDP, DNS, and SMTP, as well as architecture like firewalls, routers, switches, and their configurations. Familiarity with subnets and IP addressing (CIDR, NAT, VLANs, and VPNs) and tools like Wireshark to analyze packets is also required. Knowledge of command-line proficiency, permissions, and configurations entitles auditors to command high fees.The risks of skirting an auditFailing to identify smart contract bugs or errors can result in exploits, leading to fund loss. Skipping audits can also lead to violations of KYC/AML laws, resulting in fines or legal action.Without an audit, vulnerabilities in smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, or cryptographic protocols may go unnoticed. It also suggests a lack of due diligence, leading to skepticism among users and partners.A breach of trust or funds can lead to a loss of users or participants in the blockchain network. Without an audit, inefficiencies in the code can lead to increased transaction costs or slow network performance.Finally, auditors often provide recommendations that improve performance, security, and compliance. Their services are indispensable to blockchain operations for these and many other reasons and are well worth the substantial compensation.",NEUTRAL,ATOM,ATOM | BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/blockchain-audits-are-complex-costly-and-completely-necessary/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blockchain-audits-are-complex-costly-and-completely-necessary,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Since late November, SOL’s price has been in a retrace, dampening the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency. The prolonged decline has left investors uncertain about the next move for Solana, with many questioning whether it can regain its bullish momentum. Related Reading: XRP Consolidation Could End Once It Clears $2.60 – Top Analyst Expects $4 Soon Top analyst Jelle recently shared a technical analysis on X, shedding light on Solana’s current setup. According to Jelle, Solana has formed a falling wedge pattern—a classic bullish formation—into what was once a critical resistance level. The price has confirmed this level as support, providing a potential foundation for a significant rally in the near term. If the support holds, it could reignite bullish sentiment and position Solana for another strong run. However, a failure to sustain this level may signal further downside, potentially eroding confidence in its long-term trajectory. As Solana navigates this pivotal moment, all eyes are on whether it can reclaim its former glory and capitalize on the momentum. Solana Finding Fuel To Take Off Solana has experienced a 23% retrace from its local high of $264, set on November 22. Despite this decline, the cryptocurrency is holding firm above the $210 level, a crucial support zone that has analysts optimistic about a potential rally to new all-time highs. The resilience shown by SOL at this level suggests that bullish momentum may be building as the price consolidates. Top analyst Jelle recently shared his insights on X, highlighting a bullish technical setup for Solana. According to Jelle, SOL has formed a falling wedge pattern, a structure often indicative of an upcoming breakout. Importantly, the wedge aligns with a key resistance level that has now been confirmed as support, strengthening the case for further upward movement. Jelle also points out that Solana has formed its first higher low during this retracement, a potential signal that the asset is poised to resume its bullish trend. He believes Solana could re-enter price discovery before Christmas, forecasting a target of $300 in the coming days. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Load Up: Bullish Sign Or Bear Trap? However, risks remain, particularly if the consolidation phase continues for longer than expected. Should SOL fail to break out decisively, it could struggle to regain the upward momentum necessary to challenge new highs. For now, Solana’s ability to hold above $210 will be critical in determining its next move. Testing Reactive Demand Solana finds itself at a critical turning point, trading at $216 and holding firm above the $210 mark—a level that once acted as significant resistance. This key support level now plays a pivotal role in determining whether SOL can ignite a historic rally. The current price action reflects growing optimism among investors, with many anticipating that staying above $210 for just a few days could trigger a sharp recovery. Analysts suggest that if SOL maintains its foothold above this critical level, a swift move toward $250 would likely follow. Such a recovery would position Solana to regain its bullish momentum and potentially challenge its all-time high (ATH). While this scenario might seem ambitious, SOL has previously demonstrated its capacity for rapid upward moves during similar conditions.

To read full editions, subscribe . Industry insiders have predicted more crypto IPOs in 2025. In a possible preview, today we saw a segment player uplisted to a major exchange. Shares of crypto wallet provider Exodus became available on the NYSE American stock exchange Wednesday. It was a “finally” moment for the company, which had prepared for this in May before an unexpected delay . Exodus considers itself “a pure-play crypto company” at a time when more investors seek exposure. CFO James Gertneztke said access to capital markets could be helpful for product and marketing initiatives, or for buying other companies. The focus in 2025 is to launch and (extend the reach of) products that bridge the TradFi-crypto gap (i.e. passkeys and XO Swap), he noted. “We have a large warchest already so this is not necessarily an immediate impact,” Gertneztke said of the capital markets access. Part of that warchest he’s referring to is a treasury comprising 1900 BTC and 2,660 ETH. Exodus has held bitcoin since its 2015 founding. The company receives most of its revenue in BTC and USDC; revenues linked to its exchange aggregator processing record volume in Q4 helped Exodus recently add 100 BTC to its treasury . “We have no debt, so our holdings are not ‘levered,’” the CFO added. The company’s BTC holdings might seem small relative to MicroStrategy’s (439,000 BTC). But 1,900 BTC (currently worth ~$200 million) is nothing to sneeze at, and corporate BTC buying sprees seem poised to continue.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire says that the US should promote “full reserve digital dollars” as a means of preserving the value of the US dollar. Allaire also says the US’ fiscal situation is “not in order” – something that could also be aided by a transparent digital dollar system. “First and foremost, we have to focus on the strength and competitiveness of the dollar first. We have a situation in the world where while the dollar is the reserve currency, there are lots and lots of places in the world that don’t want the dollar to be that currency. So first we need full reserve digital dollars, like stablecoins to become a mass export product of the United States and if there’s going to be a major currency of the internet, make sure it’s a digital dollar… The fundamental issue that we have here is a sound money issue. We don’t have sound money principles embedded in our monetary system right now. Virtually every government in the world is – I won’t say they are all bankrupt – but they are in massive debt. The United States has an enormous amount of debt, its fiscal house is not in order.” The CEO calls upon US regulators to clearly define what digital assets are, how they can be bought and sold, and how they can be used. “The big thing is we need statutes that define what these different types of digital assets are. Digital tokens are a huge innovation and they are an innovation in economic incentives and others. We need laws that say here is what a digital token is, here is how you offer one, here is how you distribute it and users can use it, whether it’s a game or whatever it is.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin continued a downward trend following the rate cut news, falling 2.1% in an hour and hovering around $101,400 as of writing. 24-hour BTC price chart – Dec. 18 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Texas House eyes Bitcoin reserve laws Powell’s Bitcoin comments not new It’s not the first time Powell has made these statements. Fed Powell has repeatedly asserted the same declaration at several post-FOMC meetings before. However, it’s one of the first times Powell has said so since the U.S. chose Donald Trump as its 47th president. Powell’s comments likely caught attention this time due to Trump’s plan for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. While widely supported by legislators like Senator Cynthia Lumiss and industry leaders at large, a few crypto experts, like Castle Island Venture founding partner Nic Carter, were skeptical about the move. Carter opined that creating a U.S.-managed BTC reserve could spark doubts about the dollar’s strength, and its role as a global reserve currency.

Unlike the previous such occasions in the past few months, bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market headed south immediately and violently. Perhaps the reason for this lies in Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s words as he hinted that the central bank might halt its current policy of reducing the key interest rates due to the alarming CPI data that came out for November and October. “Today was a closer call but we decided it was the right call,” he said. Bitcoin’s price tumbled hard as the asset plummeted to a multi-day low of $100,250, and the freefall doesn’t seem to be near its end. The cryptocurrency had already retraced from $108,300 to $105,000 within a day, making a 36-hour decline of more than eight grand. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 18.12.2024.

XRP is among the poorest performers on a daily scale, as it briefly dumped below $2.2 minutes ago before bouncing to $2.3. Nevertheless, Ripple’s native token is down by over 11% on a daily scale. The price declines from DOGE, AVAX, and SHIB are similar, while ETH, BNB, and SOL have posted slightly less painful drops. Still, the total crypto market cap, which had already tumbled by $150 billion since yesterday, has lost another $200 billion and is down to $3,650 trillion on CG. The total value of wrecked positions has skyrocketed to almost $700 million, according to CoinGlass.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin reaching $150k could spark massive price rallies for altcoins like XYZVerse and Dogecoin in 2025. Table of Contents Dominate with XYZ: A meme coin champion in the making Dogecoin Conclusion As Bitcoin (BTC) edges closer to unprecedented highs, the crypto market buzzes with excitement over altcoins that could ride this wave. Analysts suggest that if BTC hits the projected $150,000 mark, tokens like XYZVerse (XYZ) and Dogecoin (DOGE) might see their values surge significantly. As such, the year ahead could be transformative for investors eyeing these potential breakout stars. XYZVerse emerges as the first all-sport meme coin looking to unite fans across football, basketball, MMA, and more. With its blend of meme culture and sports enthusiasm, XYZ aims for exponential growth, offering early adopters a unique advantage. Dominate with XYZ: A meme coin champion in the making The game is on, and XYZ is leading the charge. This token has entered the arena with unstoppable momentum, knocking out weak competitors and scammy cryptos. With a bold target of 9,900% growth, XYZ is set to leave rivals like BOME and WIF in the dust, staking its claim as the meme coin crown-holder in the upcoming bull market. At the heart of the XYZVerse ecosystem, XYZ will bring together sports fans and crypto enthusiasts in a vibrant, community-driven playground.

Over the last month, however, it gained nearly 5%. Looking at the past six months, DOGE surged by an impressive 228.17%. This shows significant long-term growth despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, DOGE is trading between $0.381 and $0.423. Its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, around $0.403. The Relative Strength Index stands at 47.39, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is below 30, which might suggest the coin is oversold. The MACD level is slightly above zero, hinting at potential upward momentum. Based on these indicators, DOGE could be poised for a rise. If it moves up, it may face resistance at $0.515. Breaking this level could lead to the next resistance at $0.616, which is about 35% higher than current prices. On the downside, support exists at $0.312. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 12%. The data suggests that DOGE has room to grow if it can overcome these hurdles.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PropiChain looks to outperform the Cardano price action with a predicted 30,000% ROI. Table of Contents Cardano to breakout from rejection trendline PropiChain: Real estate altcoin to rival Cardano Conclusion The Cardano (ADA) price surged with impressive upward momentum in the recent rally but has slowed over the past two weeks. While Cardano has lost demand, the emerging RWA altcoin PropiChain (PCHAIN) continues to witness increasing investor participation in its presale due to its 30,000% upside potential. Cardano to breakout from rejection trendline The Cardano price surged over 300% with the massive rally in November. However, when it reached $1.24, the price encountered a rejection trendline, leading to a consolidation near this resistance. After a few days, the Cardano price plunged from this region, correcting over 20% to the $0.9 support level. Due to this drop, the price moved below the 10-day SMA line but has since recovered and moved back above it. In the past few days, the Cardano price has been consolidating just below the resistance trendline, with traders waiting for demand to pick up for a breakout. PropiChain: Real estate altcoin to rival Cardano PropiChain is an RWA platform integrated with blockchain, AI, and the Metaverse aiming to eliminate the issues that have long plagued the real estate industry. It seeks to address fraud risks, opaque pricing, and high transaction costs that deter investors from investing in real estate. PropiChain will divide all properties into fractions and convert them into tokens that users can trade on the blockchain. This approach will offer users a fractional ownership model with better liquidity and diversification opportunities than the traditional market. The fractionalization of real estate will also allow PropiChain users to collectively access traditionally reserved high-end real estate without depleting substantial capital on a single asset, thus benefiting from improved accessibility and better risk management. PropiChain’s use of the Metaverse will make real estate even more accessible by providing a virtual experience of far-away properties. This will allow users to assess their dream real estate without traveling long distances, saving them time that can be used to evaluate more properties and make better decisions. When the user has decided on a property to invest in, they can use the platform’s AI features to simplify the transaction. The AI will automatically execute the purchase or sale order precisely at the valuation specified by the users, removing human error to maximize profits. Furthermore, PropiChain users will be able to automate property leasing using the platform’s smart contracts. The smart contracts will create legally binding lease agreements and automatically trigger them after the successful completion of signatures and fund transfers. The smart contracts will also simplify lease renewals and notify both parties when the lease is close to expiring. The tenant and landlord will then get a renewed lease with updated terms without any paperwork. The lease agreements will be stored on the blockchain to ensure they are tamper-proof. PCHAIN is PropiChain’s native token and will be essential for maintaining the platform. You might also like: 3 altcoins to buy in the US before Trump’s inauguration The potential for PCHAIN to surpass ADA The ADA price is in a zone of interest and shows the potential to break out from the resistance trendline for another rally. If the price can gain substantial momentum, it might surge over 180% to reach its ATH at $3.10. On the other hand, PCHAIN has raised over $1 million in the first presale stage and is in the second stage. Investors are moving fast to get the token at its current $0.011 price before it surges to $0.023 in the third stage and $0.032 after the presale. This suggests that investors with a $1,000 initial investment in this stage will gain over $2,000 when the presale reaches the next stage and over $2,900 by the end of the third stage when PCHAIN launches. Moreover, PCHAIN is projected to surge by 30,000%, and investors who hold the token at the lowest price can capture the maximum of these returns when PCHAIN rises after the presale. Conclusion Traders await the Cardano price to move past the immediate resistance and surge again. However, the PropiChain presale offers an opportunity with potentially higher and steady returns. PropiChain seeks to transform the real estate sector with an efficient, safe, and transparent investment platform. Its incorporation of blockchain will improve transactional security and transparency, while AI and the Metaverse will transform investment experience and efficiency. Regarding user safety, BlockAudit rigorously tested the platform’s security features. The blockchain auditing firm reported zero vulnerabilities and guaranteed regulatory compliance and integrity. Moreover, PCHAIN was recently listed on CoinMarketCap , which helped the presale gain significant momentum. The project’s development is also going fast and will soon reach further milestones, potentially leading to more momentum and quicker gains.

42389817,7ea5968c-9987-4722-bbdb-7475f237200c,1734554674,Crypto’s Estate Planning Problem: A Wake-Up Call,"As 2024 draws to a close, cryptocurrency stands at a turning point. Bitcoin has crossed the $100,000 mark and digital assets have solidified their place in investment portfolios of all sizes. Yet, amid these milestones, a critical, yet overlooked issue remains: the estate planning challenges unique to cryptocurrency and other digital assets.  A Looming Crisis: Estate Planning in a Digital Era  Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies and digital assets operate outside established estate planning frameworks. Their decentralized nature, reliance on private keys, and pseudonymity make them revolutionary. Butwithout proper planning, crypto holdings can be lost forever, become embroiled in legal disputes, or heavily taxed.  This vulnerability is not hypothetical. Chainalysis reports that nearly 20% of all bitcoin is lost or stranded, much of it likely due to the misplacement of private keys or owners dying without a plan for the now-valuable assets transferring to their heirs. As billions of dollars in digital wealth continues to accumulate, the risks tied to inadequate planning grow exponentially.  With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 set to sunset in 2025, legal frameworks surrounding wealth transfer may undergo significant changes (while Congress appears likely to act, it is not assured). For cryptocurrency holders, this moment represents both a wake-up call and an opportunity to reassess their plans to protect and pass on digital assets to future generations.  2025 Tax Law Changes: A Catalyst for Action  The TCJA temporarily doubled the federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exemptions, allowing individuals to transfer up to $13.99 million, tax-free, in 2025. Without new legislation, however, these exemptions will revert to approximately $7 million per individual on January 1, 2026 (adjusted for inflation). This reduction will subject a greater share of estates to federal taxes, making planning for cryptocurrency even more urgent.  Additionally, the IRS’s new reporting requirements for digital assets, which will go into effect on January 1, 2025, will increase reporting requirements and scrutiny. Pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress has allocated billions of dollars to the IRS, including a bolstering of the agency’s staff and an increased focus on the pursuit of crypto enforcement.  Legal Strategies for Cryptocurrency Estate Planning  To address these challenges and seize opportunities before the tax law changes, cryptocurrency holders should consider these strategies:  1. Draft Digital Asset-Specific Estate Plans  Traditional wills and trusts often fall short when dealing with cryptocurrency. Comprehensive estate plans must create a succession plan, including instructions for accessing private keys, wallets, and recovery phrases (without creating security vulnerabilities). A secure, regularly updated inventory of digital assets is critical to ensure heirs can locate, access and manage holdings effectively.  2. Capitalize on Gift Exclusions and Lifetime Gifting  With the current high exemption levels, now is the time to transfer digital assets out of taxable estates. Gifting cryptocurrency to heirs or placing it in irrevocable trusts can lock in tax savings before exemptions are reduced in 2026. Charitable remainder trusts also allow for tax-advantaged transfers, benefiting both heirs and philanthropic causes.  Additionally, the annual gift tax exclusion will rise to $19,000 per recipient in 2025. Married couples can gift up to $38,000 per recipient tax-free. Regular use of these exclusions allows incremental reductions of taxable estates over time.  3. Embrace Multi-Signature Wallets and Collaborative Custody  Strategic use of multi-signature wallets and collaborative custody can enhance both security and estate planning. By collaborating with multiple parties (such as an executor and trusted family members) to authorize transactions, these wallets prevent unauthorized access while ensuring heirs can access funds when needed.  4. Move Digital Assets to LLCs or Establish Asset Protection Trusts  Placing cryptocurrency in an LLC and transferring ownership to a trust can shield assets from creditors and legal claimants. This structure also bypasses probate courts, ensuring a smoother transition to heirs while safeguarding wealth from lawsuits or creditor claims.  5. Stay Ahead of Regulatory Changes  The IRS’s rules on cryptocurrency transactions are rapidly evolving and will demand more meticulous record-keeping and compliance measures. Sophisticated tools and legal and accounting expertise will be crucial to navigate this environment and ensure tax-efficient wealth transfers.  Looking Forward to 2025  This year underscored the transformative potential of cryptocurrency as an investment class — but also exposed its vulnerabilities. Estate planning remains an afterthought for many crypto holders, even as the value of digital assets climbs and tax law changes loom on the horizon. For 2025, the crypto community must confront these realities. Regulators, estate planners, accountants, financial advisors and investors alike need to prioritize creating and implementing solutions that address the unique challenges of the rise of digital wealth.  A Call to Action  The close of 2024 is not just a moment to celebrate cryptocurrency’s successes but also a chance to prepare for its future. By taking proactive steps now — whether through establishing estate plans, creating trusts, or implementing gifting strategies — investors can secure their digital wealth and pass it on as a lasting legacy.  As the saying goes, failing to plan is planning to fail. For cryptocurrency holders, 2025 offers a rare window to act decisively before tax laws change and vulnerabilities deepen.

As part of the collaboration, Ethena aims to integrate its sUSDe token, a staked version of its USDe synthetic dollar, into WLF’s forthcoming Aave v3 instance. Ethena Labs @ethena_labs · Follow Ethena has entered into a strategic partnership with @worldlibertyfi A governance proposal has been submitted to add sUSDe to WLFI’s upcoming Aave instance as a core collateral asset Watch on Twitter View replies 7:04 PM · Dec 18, 2024 1.0K Reply Copy link Read 67 replies Governance proposal to onboard sUSDe as a collateral asset for WLF As revealed in the announcement on December 18, Ethena Labs has submitted a governance proposal to onboard sUSDe as the first collateral asset for WLF’s market. The governance proposal outlines multiple benefits for the integration of sUSDe. It cites the token’s proven ability to boost stablecoin deposit rates and attract capital flows. On Aave Core, sUSDe’s integration increased supply rates for stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and USDS, creating a multiplier effect that benefited liquidity providers. Ethena’s co-incentive program promises additional rewards for users depositing sUSDe, amplifying the appeal for WLF users. Moreover, the proposal seeks to align WLF’s rates with broader DeFi market standards. Poor relative rates could hinder WLF’s ability to attract deposits, but sUSDe’s integration positions the platform to compete effectively. The Ethena Foundation has also committed to co-incentivizing sUSDe deposits through its points program, further encouraging market growth. If approved, this integration will enable users to deposit USDe and earn dual rewards in sUSDe and WLF tokens. Ethena’s sUSDe has demonstrated remarkable performance on other platforms, such as Aave Core and Lido, where it reached $1.2 billion in supplied assets in under a month. Its introduction to WLF’s market is expected to enhance stablecoin liquidity and utilization rates, potentially solidifying WLF as a premier platform for stablecoin lending and borrowing. World Liberty Financial aims to tap into Ethena’s extensive DeFi network The partnership comes at a pivotal moment for WLF, which has faced challenges in establishing itself among DeFi’s major players. Following a lacklustre launch in October, the platform sold just $12.7 million of its WLFI tokens, leaving a substantial portion unsold. However, a $30 million investment by cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun in November provided a financial boost, enabling WLF to acquire assets such as ETH, AAVE, ENA, and most recently ONDO . This collaboration with Ethena is seen as a potential turning point. By integrating sUSDe, WLF hopes to tap into Ethena’s extensive DeFi network and leverage its successful track record. Ethena, supported by prominent backers like Binance Labs and Fidelity Ventures, has rapidly grown since its launch in early 2024, achieving nearly $6 billion in total value locked (TVL), and the partnership will reinforce its role as a key player in driving innovation across the DeFi ecosystem.

37816927,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320937,1734554622,"Crypto Could Experience Harrowing Dump Post Donald Trump Inauguration, Arthur Hayes Says","Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes believes digital assets will fall victim to a “harrowing dump” following the January 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, a new Substack from the crypto mogul shared this week shows. Donald Trump Inauguration May Signal Selloff, Ex BitMEX CEO Says According to Hayes’ prediction , anticipated policy changes regarding the crypto market under Trump will fall short of their expectations, potentially creating a selloff scenario. Hayes further claimed that his investment firm Maelstrom will begin to sell “certain positions” before repurchasing them at a later date for a lower price. “I think there exists a wide gap between crypto investor’s high expectations for how quickly Trump can change things and the reality that there are no politically acceptable solutions available to Trump to quickly bring about such change,” he states in his latest blog post. However, Hayes also accepts the possibility of him being wrong should the crypto market continue to balloon. “Knowing this, we are committed to admitting defeat if the bull market steamrolls through January 20 th , licking our wounds, and getting back on the bull,” he said. Arthur Hayes’ Crypto History Hayes is best known for running the cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, though he notably stepped down in 2020 after federal prosecutors charged him with violating key Bank Secrecy Act provisions. In February 2022, Hayes and his fellow BitMEX co-founders pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program at the company. As a result, the Detroit-born businessman was sentenced to six months home confinement and two years probation; additionally, he was ordered to pay a $10 million fine. News of Hayes’ commentary comes ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration next month after he campaigned hard in support of digital assets on the campaign trail. The former reality television, who recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has pledged to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework upon returning to the Oval Office. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Prior to winning last month’s election, Trump vowed to fire current United Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler over his regulation-by-enforcement approach to the blockchain sector as a whole. Gensler, who has since announced his resignation, is slated to be replaced by crypto-friendly former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins.

Sonic Labs announced the mainnet launch of its layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible blockchain Sonic on Dec. 18. The new governance proposal seeks community support that would allow the integration of Aave ( AAVE ) v3, currently with a total value locked of over $22 billion, to the new L1 blockchain. “This Temp Check seeks the community’s input on the deployment of Aave V3 on Sonic Mainnet,” proposal’s author ACI noted. Read more: Ethena Labs proposes collab with Trump-backed WLFI The Sonic Foundation has committed to providing $15 million funding, migration incentives, up to 50 million native Sonic tokens S and 20 million USDC supply. Following the temp check, consensus will take the proposal to a snapshot stage, then Aave Request for Comment and Aave Improvement Proposal. The ARFC and AIP stages lead to a vote that will see final confirmation and deployment. Sonic’s mainnet launch brings the native token S, faster finality and a fee monetization feature. Aave-Chan notes in the proposal that this feature could be a great source of additional income for Aave. “Given the impressive history of the team building Sonic, and the innovations it promises, it represents a strong candidate for deployment of Aave V3. In addition, the fee monetization for apps has potential to be an additional income source for Aave,” the proposal states in part. With Sonic live, Fantom ( FTM ) token holders can upgrade their FTM to S 1:1. The Sonic Labs team applied a points system to the L1 network’s airdrop, with about 190.5 million S tokens available to eligible community members. FTM traded around $1.16 at the time of writing.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

Despite the OpenAI case that Sam Altman is currently facing, he continues to make significant decisions. The deal is a 20-year agreement with Switch Inc., a privately held data center operator. According to reports , Oklo will build nuclear reactors called the Aurora powerhouse with a combined capacity of 12 gigawatts by 2044. According to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, each Aurora Powerhouse reactor can generate a maximum of 15 megawatts of electricity. This amount of energy is sufficient to power all 7.6 million households in New York state. Oklo said that the deal doesn’t have any legal force. Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and chief executive reported that the transaction could be valued at multiple billions of dollars if binding terms are achieved. Oklo initiative- Details Oklo is in the process of creating small modular reactors, which are advanced nuclear plants with a capacity of 300 megawatts or less. These reactors are approximately one-third the size of standard facilities. Jacob DeWitt asserted that nuclear energy was the sole source of energy that could sustainably satisfy the substantial energy requirements of the AI revolution. However, he downplayed the concerns of critics regarding the inherent risks of nuclear energy, which has been subject to delays and cost overruns and is highly regulated. He said, “ We are entering a new world due to the size of the energy demand(…) You can’t do it with renewables, as you would need a lot of gas back-up capacity, and a lot of folks want a clean solution.” In addition, Oklo is aiming to deploy its first 15MW reactor by late 2027 at the Idaho National Laboratory. On the other hand, Amazon and Google have recently executed power agreements with X-energy and Kairos Power, two nuclear developers located in the United States, to supply their data centers with low-carbon electricity. In September, Microsoft also entered into a corporate power agreement with Constellation Energy, which will result in the reactivation of the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania. Nuclear crops are coming up more. Still, some analysts are skeptical that the new crop of nuclear start-ups will ever deliver. Edwin Lyman, nuclear power safety director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, explained his doubts, “These agreements do not appear to be the kinds of serious, substantial, and sustained financial commitments on the order of many billions of dollars over decades that would be necessary to fully realize these speculative nuclear projects.” The OpenAI Court cases The New York Times(NYT) filed a lawsuit against OpenAI , alleging that the AI startup has used “millions” of articles published by the newspaper without permission to train its popular ChatGPT model. OpenAI publicly responded to the allegations in the NYT’s complaint, stating that the suit is “without merit” and that “memorizing” and “regurgitating” near exact copies or substantial portions of published works is uncommon. OpenAI further stated that the prompts employed by NYT to generate outputs that closely resemble the published NYT articles used as exhibits were deliberately manipulated and already contained substantial portions of the articles. Also, the main news organizations in Canada filed a lawsuit against the technology firm OpenAI for potentially billions of dollars. The lawsuit alleged that the company was “strip-mining journalism” and unjustly enriching itself by using news articles to train its popular ChatGPT software. The suit was filed at Ontario’s superior court of justice, seeking punitive damages, and a portion of the profits generated by OpenAI from the use of the news organizations’ articles. In addition, Silverman filed a comparable copyright class action lawsuit against OpenAI in a federal district court in California. The lawsuit alleged, among other things, that OpenAI had copied copyrighted works to train AI large-language models. Sam Altman said he is not worried about Elon Musk — his former partner in founding OpenAI — and President-elect Trump hurting his business.

An abbreviation of ""Build on Bitcoin,"" BOB's aim is to establish Bitcoin as the foundational network for DeFi by creating bridges between itself and other blockchains, using Bitcoin as the anchor chain to finalize transactions.  Integrating with Babylon forms part of BOB's roadmap by giving it ""Bitcoin finality,"" the point at which a transaction is permanent and irreversible on the oldest blockchain. Assets deposited from other chains on BOB would be confirmed and verified on Bitcoin via Babylon's protocol.  Babylon, which is billed as a way of using BTC to secure other protocols and decentralized applications, is the foremost Bitcoin staking project in the sector, with total value locked (TVL) of around $6 billion.   Staking refers to offering up crypto tokens to support the running of a blockchain network in return for rewards, similar to accruing interest in a bank account.   Such a process is fundamental to networks like Ethereum and Solana which run on a ""proof-of-stake"" mechanism, but is absent from Bitcoin, which use ""proof of work.""  However, given that the total market cap of bitcoin is greater than every other crypto asset combined, projects like Babylon are exploring ways of tapping into BTC's deep reserves to benefit the broader industry.  This week, Babylon completed its third staking round in which it took its total BTC staked to 57,290 ($5.93 billion), placing it in the top 10 protocols by TVL, according to data tracked by DeFiLlama.  BOB's next step is to launch bridges connecting Bitcoin to other networks, using BitVM, a computing paradigm designed to allow Ethereum-style smart contracts on the world's original blockchain. BitVM is set for testnet release in Q1 of 2025.

37813447,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629976,1734554028,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell shares bullish outlook for 2025, doubles down on Trump resistance","The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday, lowering its target range to 4.25%–4.5%. It was a predictable move, but what came next wasn’t. Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid out a drastically scaled-back forecast for 2025, with just two rate cuts on the table instead of the four expected back in September. Powell painted a sharp picture of the challenges ahead, focusing on sticky inflation, consumer pain, and the ongoing balancing act between economic growth and price stability. The numbers may show a cooling trend, but families are still bleeding cash over food, heating, and transportation. “Prices went up by a great deal, and people really feel that,” Powell said. Even as inflation itself retreats, the higher baseline for everyday costs remains. According to Powell, the solution is simple: keep driving inflation lower so wages can catch up. Fed dismisses Bitcoin as Trump warms up to crypto Powell shot down any idea that the Federal Reserve might add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. “We’re not allowed to own bitcoin,” he said. The Federal Reserve Act lays out strict rules on what the central bank can hold, and crypto isn’t on the menu. Powell also made it clear that the Fed isn’t lobbying for a change in the law, leaving any potential Bitcoin policy changes in Congress’s hands. This comes in stark contrast to President-elect Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly tone during his campaign. Trump openly floated the idea of creating a Bitcoin reserve for the United States. It’s a wild idea that could set up a clash between the administration and the Fed, especially since Powell and his team are staying firmly neutral on the crypto front. Labor market trends remain another flashpoint. Powell acknowledged that the job market is cooling, but the pace is glacial. “We do think the labor market is still cooling, by many measures,” he said. But he did stress that the process isn’t fast or drastic enough to trigger alarm bells. This sluggish adjustment gives the Fed more time to weigh inflation against broader economic performance. The outlook for inflation remains murky. While year-over-year inflation has stopped climbing, it isn’t dropping fast enough to satisfy policymakers. Powell made it clear that any further rate cuts in 2025 would depend entirely on progress in this area. “We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation,” Powell admitted, hinting that the Fed is running out of patience. Markets didn’t take the news lightly. Stocks tanked after Powell’s comments, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both shedding 0.4% by the end of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped around 100 points, marking its tenth consecutive day of losses. Investors, it seems, aren’t thrilled about the prospect of fewer rate cuts in 2025. Despite the market fallout, Powell stood firm on the Fed’s data-driven approach. “The actual cuts we make next year will not be because of anything we wrote down today,” he said. For the Fed, it’s all about the numbers. As Powell put it, “We’re going to react to data.” With inflation proving stubborn and the labor market holding steady, Powell signaled that future cuts would come slowly, if at all.

On the weekly timeframe, the Dogecoin price is consolidating between $0.3696 and $0.4471. Analysts are looking forward to a price surge in the coming days. EWT forecasts the value of the Dogecoin crypto might surge to $1.5 in the coming weeks. However, the meme coin must claim $0.5 and then rally to $1 first. Going forward, Dogecoin (DOGE) faces resistance at $0.44 and $0.47. Claiming this region would push DOGE to a new yearly peak of $0.5.

37813541,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320932,1734553820,Michael Saylor Eyes ‘Intelligent Leverage’ to Boost MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-Driven Strategy: Bloomberg,"Michael Saylor, co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy Inc., has outlined plans to enhance “intelligent leverage” for the company’s shareholders. The Virginia-based firm, which has transformed from a software maker to a leveraged Bitcoin investment vehicle, continues to draw significant attention for its bold cryptocurrency strategy. MicroStrategy’s Intelligent Leverage: What Does Michael Saylor Mean? In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Saylor shared the company’s approach to optimizing its capital structure. He said; “We have $7.2 billion in convertible bonds, with $4 billion effectively acting as equity through the strike price and call price.” “These convertibles are trading with a delta of nearly 100%, resembling equity. Our goal is to build more intelligent leverage to benefit our common stock shareholders.” I want everyone to listen to this interview at least one time. Ideally at least three times. By then you will understand what Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy are doing thru $BTC and why they are ready to conquer the world. No one is prepared for what’s coming. YOU ARE NOT… https://t.co/3ojKtEEONl — Gladiator (@cf_trades) December 18, 2024 MicroStrategy has become one of the most closely watched corporate players in cryptocurrency. This year, the company accelerated its unconventional approach, raising $42 billion solely to purchase and hold Bitcoin. As a result, its stock has soared by around 500%, significantly outpacing Bitcoin’s roughly 150% gain over the same period. Over the past six weeks, the firm has announced multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin acquisitions every Monday, fueling a surge in its share price alongside the cryptocurrency’s rising value. However, this aggressive strategy has also sparked debates about its long-term sustainability and risks. MicroStrategy’s issuance of convertible bonds has been key to its capital-raising efforts. This year alone, the company issued $6.2 billion worth of convertibles, attracting interest from hedge funds employing convertible arbitrage strategies. These funds purchase the bonds while shorting the company’s stock, which means betting on its volatility. The heightened demand for its fixed-income securities has bolstered MicroStrategy’s ability to continue leveraging its position. Despite questions surrounding the viability of its approach, MicroStrategy’s market capitalization has soared to over $90 billion. This growth has led to the company’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a major milestone expected to drive additional institutional interest. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, funds that track the tech benchmark index may purchase over $2 billion worth of MicroStrategy shares following its inclusion at the end of trading on Friday. MicroStrategy’s Market Cap Nears $100 Billion Amid Bitcoin’s Unprecedented Rally Bitcoin has surged 120% this year, recently surpassing $100,000, and has climbed nearly 40% in the past month. MicroStrategy has been a key beneficiary. Since 2020, the company has acquired 386,700 BTC for $21.9 billion, now worth approximately $37.6 billion. In 2024 alone, MicroStrategy added 249,850 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 439,000 BTC—surpassing Marathon Digital’s 40,435 BTC by 985%. MicroStrategy’s market cap is nearing $100 billion, positioning it among major U.S. companies if Bitcoin’s price continues to rise. Saylor recently shared the company’s performance, noting a 46.4% yield quarter-to-date and a 72.4% year-to-date return. On December 9, the firm announced an additional purchase of 21,550 BTC. On December 1, Saylor presented Bitcoin to Microsoft’s board and urged the tech giant to embrace the cryptocurrency. He proposed an annual $100 billion Bitcoin investment, arguing that it could add nearly $5 trillion to Microsoft’s market capitalization. However, the majority downvoted the proposal in the last annual shareholder meeting.

37813609,https://blockworks.co/news/rate-decision-fuels-santa-rally-odds,1734553800,Fed delivers expected 25bps cut as investors speculate a Santa rally,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The FOMC today, as expected, lowered interest rates by 25 basis points. Committee members cited a commitment to achieving “maximum employment” and getting inflation closer to its 2% target as reasons for the decision. It’s the central bank’s third consecutive rate cut, but projections show committee members expect to slow their pace of decreases in 2025. Odds of another 25bps cut in January are now at 82%, according to data from CME Group. Committee member projections published Wednesday show the median interest rate target by the end of 2025 falling in the 3.75% — 4% range. This is 50bps higher than previous projections showed. The FOMC’s forward guidance (see what we did there) from this week’s meeting was mostly unchanged but a key phrase was added: “extent and timing.” “In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,” Wednesday’s statement read. It’s the decision we saw coming, so markets shouldn’t be surprised. Still, the “Trump trade,” i.e., the rally we’ve seen across the board since the election, appears to have stalled . Stocks, with the exception of Big Tech, have largely traded sideways for most of the month. The S&P 500 is up just 0.2% since Dec. 2. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, has gained around 3.7%. Not too shabby of a return, but still down from November, when the index gained almost 6%. What gives? Politics. And I’m not just saying that because I’m writing this newsletter from Reagan International. “Since Trump announced several unorthodox cabinet nominations , there has basically been an inverse correlation between cyclical stocks and the likelihood these cabinet nominations get confirmed,” Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, said. “Prior to Trump’s announcement of Matt Gaetz as AG, Pete Hegseth as Defense, RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary and Tulsi Gabbard as National Intelligence Director, the market was marching steadily higher.” The slowing Trump rally has markets poised for a Santa rally , some analysts say. We’re still a few days out from the true “Santa rally window” (the last five trading days of the year plus the first two days of the new year), and with the Fed’s decision coming in as-expected, a breakout in equities and crypto could be imminent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently on its longest losing streak since 1978 (nine days), but historically slumps preempt runs, at least the vast majority of the time. As a reminder, this is not trading advice! The S&P 500 was down 0.6% over today’s session in the moments after the Fed’s decision, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite had also lost 0.6% just after 2 pm ET.

Table of Contents Dogecoin leads the meme coin revolution Dogecoin’s community takes notice of Lightchain AI Lightchain AI could lead the future of blockchain and AI The Dogecoin (DOGE) community, one of the most loyal and enthusiastic groups in the crypto space, is no stranger to spotting emerging opportunities. While Dogecoin thrives on its meme status and strong community support, a rising project — Lightchain AI (LCAI) — is catching their attention. Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI), Lightchain AI has quickly become one of the most talked-about tokens in crypto, offering real-world utility and the potential for massive returns. Priced at $0.003 in its presale phase , Lightchain AI offers an opportunity that’s hard to ignore, especially for investors accustomed to finding undervalued gems like Dogecoin.

Deflationary tokenomics: Lightchain AI’s token model will burn a portion of tokens with every transaction, ensuring scarcity and long-term value appreciation. Clear roadmap: With its mainnet launch scheduled for March 2025, Lightchain AI is progressing steadily with milestones that inspire confidence among investors.

The result is skyrocketing rewards that could slam dunk their way to unprecedented returns. In 2024, meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is poised to crush the competition.

Looking at the longer term, ADA has gained a remarkable 183.90% in the past six months. These figures show significant growth and increasing investor interest. Based on this data, the price of ADA might continue to rise. The current price range is between $1.02 and $1.176, which is above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $1.00 and $1.08. The RSI is at 53.92, indicating neutral conditions. This suggests room for the price to move higher. If ADA continues its upward momentum, it could test the nearest resistance at $1.35. Breaking this level might lead towards $1.63. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.78, a drop of around 15%. Traders should watch these levels as indicators of ADA’s potential movement.

The reason for the decline is thought to be the hawkish statements of the FOMC following the FED's interest rate decision today, as well as FED Chairman Jerome Powell's ongoing speech about slowing down the pace of interest rate cuts. Related News: JUST IN: FED Chairman Jerome Powell Speaks After Interest Rate Decision - LIVE In September, the FED's dot plot graph expected four interest rate cuts in 2025, but with the data updated today, this number has decreased to two. In addition, the market is pricing in interest rates to remain unchanged in January. In addition, FED Chairman Jerome Powell's answer to the question about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the US may have contributed to the decline. Powell stated that the FED is not allowed to hold Bitcoin and is not willing to make a change in the laws on this issue. Following the interest rate decision, the BTC price fell by approximately 3% and is trading at $101,800 at the time of writing.

Carter said MicroStrategy has innovatively used the fixed-income markets to issue debt and buy Bitcoin, allowing the company to capture a 2x premium over the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. The strategy, championed by Michael Saylor, has provided a path for institutional investors who can’t buy Bitcoin directly or through ETFs. But Carter warned investors about the risks associated with MicroStrategy’s premium, warning that its stock price could diverge from Bitcoin’s trajectory in the event of a sell-off. Carter noted that Ethereum plays a key role as the cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, hosting the majority of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi applications. Ethereum remains the dominant platform for stablecoins and NFTs and has promising prospects for continued growth. “Ethereum has an opportunity here after following Bitcoin for a long time,” Carter said. Related News: FED to Announce Critical Interest Rate Decision, What Will Powell Say Afterward? Here are the Opinions of Moody's Chief Economist Carter expressed skepticism about the possibility of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, dismissing the possibility of Congress supporting such a move. He argued that switching the US financial system from the dollar to a Bitcoin-backed standard would undermine global trust in the dollar as a reserve currency. While smaller countries like Bhutan and El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as part of their financial strategies, Carter argued that the US should avoid signaling a shift away from the dollar as the issuer of the global reserve currency. However, he also acknowledged the market’s optimism regarding Bitcoin, which recently reached a record high of $108,000. Carter warned that speculative rhetoric such as strategic reserves could lead to market disappointment and corrections if these expectations are not met. Carter predicts that Bitcoin could reach a market value equivalent to gold in the long term, with each Bitcoin priced at $900,000. While he remains optimistic about the sector’s growth, he urged caution against speculative rhetoric overstating the impact of Bitcoin’s short-term price movements. *This is not investment advice.

37813116,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629794,1734553135,Hong Kong moves forward in becoming crypto hub with new exchange approvals,"Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has approved licenses for four virtual assets trading platforms (VATP) under its swift licensing process. The regulator announced this today, noting that it issued the license after completing on-site inspection of the firms. According to the announcement , the four platforms approved as deemed to be licensed are Accumulus GBA Technology Co Ltd, DFX Labs Co Ltd, Hong Kong Digital Assets EX Ltd, and Thousand Whales Technology Ltd. With these firms scaling the first hurdle in the application process, they can start operating within a restricted scope. However, the exchanges still have to complete rectification actions based on the inspection and pass the vulnerability assessment and penetration test. The Director of Intermediaries at SFC, Dr Eric Yip, noted that the new approach seeks to expedite approving digital assets platforms in the city without compromising standards. Hong Kong has been trying to position itself as a crypto hub over the past few years. Yip said: “We aim to strike a balance between safeguarding the interests of investors and facilitating continuous development for the virtual asset ecosystem in Hong Kong.” With the approval of these four firms, there are now seven licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong, including OSL, HKVAX, and HashKey, which got their approval earlier this year. Although some applications are still waiting for approval, the complexity of the process has already led several major exchanges, including OKX, to pull out. This is likely why the Hong Kong SFC is embracing the swift licensing process. Exchanges still need to pass the second phase to get a full license Meanwhile, the four exchanges still need to pass the second stage before obtaining their full license. To aid this process, SFC has amended the circular on the licensing for crypto exchanges by revamping the second phase. Under the new system, the Commission will focus on whether the exchange’s policies, procedures, systems, and controls meet regulatory standards and require the exchange to inform it of any changes. Exchanges also have to get an assessment from a certified public accountant on whether all its policies and procedures meet the guidelines for VATPs and the anti-money laundering and counter-financing terrorism rules. The SFC plans to be involved in the assessment procedure by requiring a tripartite arrangement involving the exchange, the regulator, and the external assessor. According to the SFC, this will expedite the process by enabling the regulator to engage the senior management and controllers of the exchanges directly. This approach has proven effective in getting the firms to meet the regulatory standards for the first phase, hence its continued adoption. After passing the second phase, all restrictions on the operation of the exchanges will be lifted.

Ripple drives global payments, while Lightchain AI bridges AI and blockchain, offering $0.003 presale with future potential. Table of Contents Ripple vs. Lightchain AI- core technology and use cases Can XRP or LCAI reach new heights in 2025? Why LCAI’s presale is attracting attention over XRP Secure potential for 2025 millions with Lightchain AI Ripple (XRP) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) represent two significant creations in blockchain technology. While Ripple streamlines global payments with its fast, efficient transaction system, Lightchain AI uniquely bridges artificial intelligence and blockchain through groundbreaking features. Notably, Lightchain AI’s presale offers investors a strategic entry at a price of $0.003, with Stage 6 ongoing and potential growth accelerating. As Ripple battles for mass adoption, LCAI positions itself as a leader in decentralized AI innovation for 2025 and beyond. Ripple vs. Lightchain AI- core technology and use cases Ripple utilizes the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source, decentralized platform designed for swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions. Its consensus protocol enables transaction validation within 3 to 5 seconds, facilitating real-time global payments. L͏ightchain AI combines artificial intelligence with͏ blockchain technology.

Can XRP or LCAI reach new heights in 2025? Ripple’s XRP has experienced significant growth, with its price reaching $2.39, driven by increased adoption among financial institutions and positive market sentiment. Analysts have varied predictions for XRP’s future value. Some forecasts suggest that XRP could reach $5 by the end of 2024 and potentially rise to double digits in 2025. Lightchain AI (LCAI) , currently in its presale phase at $0.003 per token, is attracting attention for its unique integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Experts predict that LCAI could reach $1 by the end of 2024, driven by its unique technology and growing adoption. Both XRP and LCAI have ambitious roadmaps aimed at enhancing their platforms and expanding their ecosystems. XRP’s focus on cross-border payments and financial partnerships positions it for continued growth, while LCAI’s fusion of AI and blockchain technology offers potential for significant market impact. Investors should consider these factors, along with market volatility and individual risk tolerance, when evaluating the potential of XRP and LCAI for substantial returns by 2025. Why LCAI’s presale is attracting attention over XRP Lightchain Protocol AI has launched its LCAI token presale, attracting significant investor interest. The presale offers tokens at $0.03 each, providing an accessible entry point for early participants. LCAI tokens serve multiple functions within the ecosystem, including governance participation, access to AI services, and incentives for contributors. The presale accepts contributions in ETH and ERC-20 USDT , making it accessible to a global audience. Early participants benefit from favorable pricing, giving them a unique opportunity to secure tokens at a discount before broader market adoption drives up demand. This strategic move positions Lightchain Protocol AI as a strong competitor in the blockchain space, offering investors a chance to join a platform poised for significant growth. Secure potential for 2025 millions with Lightchain AI As blockchain technology continues to evolve and industries explore its potential, cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth. XRP and LCAI represent two innovative projects with unique features and promising market potential. While XRP remains a top contender in the financial sector, Lightchain AI is emerging as a leader in decentralized AI creativit, with potential to change multiple industries. As such, investors should carefully consider their investment strategies and evaluate the opportunities presented by both Ripple and Lightchain. Investors should carefully consider the potential of LCAI and its presale price as they evaluate their investment strategies in the rapidly evolving blockchain and AI landscape.

A strategic reserve is a stock of a critical resource that can be released in times of crisis or supply disruption. The best-known example is the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest emergency supply of crude oil, established by Congress in 1975 after the 1973–74 Arab oil embargo crippled the U.S. economy. Presidents have used this stockpile to calm oil markets during wars or when hurricanes hit the U.S. oil infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. Analysts and legal experts are divided on whether Trump could use his executive powers to create the reserve or whether an act of Congress would be required. Some have argued that Trump could create the reserve through an executive order directing the U.S. Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, which can be used to buy or sell foreign currencies and can also be used to hold Bitcoin. The reserve could also include Bitcoin that the government has seized from criminal actors, which is around 200,000 tokens worth around $21 billion at current prices, according to the data. Trump suggested this stockpile could be a starting point when announcing his BTC reserve plan in a speech in July, but it remains unclear what the legal process would be to move them out of the Justice Department. Trump did not say whether the government would add to that stockpile by purchasing more BTC on the open market. To do so would require the government to borrow money, but some Bitcoin reserve advocates say the U.S. could sell some of its gold reserves and use the proceeds to buy BTC. *This is not investment advice.

According to Syndica’s research , Solana ( SOL ) native DApps garnered $365 million in revenue during November 2024, a new monthly high for the popular layer-1 blockchain network. Solana’s decentralized finance ecosystem was the leading port of call for revenue. SOL DeFi comprised almost 84% of cash raised last month, compared to wallets and infrastructure, which attracted less than 15%. Among DeFi activity, meme coins and meme-supportive protocols dominated SOL revenue. Meme coin DApps monthly revenue surged 305-fold in 2024, raking in over $500 million.

42416322,c9089ea1-cee4-424a-b89d-c783f75451f7,1734552499,How Wall Street’s Relationship With Bitcoin Will Transform in 2025: 5 Predictions,"When Michael Saylor announced MicroStrategy's conversion of $250 million in Treasury reserves to bitcoin in August 2020, Wall Street analysts dismissed it as a reckless gamble. ""Superior to cash,"" Saylor declared of bitcoin at the time, drawing skepticism from traditional banking circles.  Yet today, those same banks that sneered at bitcoin's corporate adoption are now scrambling to participate in bitcoin-collateralized lending as they race to capitalize on its superior characteristics as institutional-grade collateral and a thriving product-market fit.  Traditional collateral, such as real estate, requires manual appraisals, subjective valuations and complex legal frameworks that vary by jurisdiction. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers instant verification of collateral backing through public blockchain data, 24/7 real-time settlement and liquidation capabilities, uniform quality regardless of geography or counterparty, and the ability to enforce lending terms programmatically.  When a lender realizes that they can instantly verify and potentially liquidate bitcoin collateral at 3 a.m. on a Sunday — while real estate sits waiting for manual appraisals, subjective valuations, and potential evictions— there will be no going back.  1. Traditional banking bends the knee to bitcoin.  MicroStrategy's (MSTR) approach fundamentally altered how public companies view bitcoin as a treasury asset. Rather than simply holding bitcoin, the firm has pioneered a treasury model of leveraging public markets to amplify its crypto position — issuing convertible notes and at the market equity offerings to finance purchases of bitcoin. This strategy has allowed MicroStrategy to significantly outperform spot bitcoin ETFs by harnessing the same financial engineering that made traditional banks powerful, but with bitcoin as the underlying asset instead of traditional financial instruments and real estate.  As a result, one of my predictions for 2025 is that MSTR will announce a 10-for-1 stock split to further its market share as it will allow many more investors to purchase shares and options contracts. MicroStrategy's playbook demonstrates just how deeply bitcoin has penetrated traditional corporate finance.  I also believe financial services built around bitcoin are set to explode in popularity as long-term holders and new investors look to get more out of their positions. We expect to see rapid growth in bitcoin-collateralized loans and yield-generating products for bitcoin holders worldwide.  Moreover, there’s an almost poetic answer to why bitcoin-backed loans have become so popular — they are a true representation of financial inclusion, with a business owner in Medellín facing the same collateral requirements and interest rates as one in Madrid. Each person’s bitcoin carries identical properties, verification standards and liquidation processes. This standardization strips away the arbitrary risk premiums historically imposed on borrowers in emerging markets.  Traditional banks marketed ""global reach"" for decades while maintaining vastly different lending standards across regions. Now, bitcoin-backed lending exposes this inherited inefficiency for what it is: a relic of an antiquated financial system.  2. Borders fall as capital flows freely.  Nations are entering a new era of competition for bitcoin business and capital. Consequently, we expect to see new tax incentives specifically targeting bitcoin investors and businesses in 2025. These will happen alongside fast-track visa programs for crypto entrepreneurs and regulatory frameworks designed to attract bitcoin companies.  Nations historically competed for manufacturing bases or regional headquarters. Now they compete for bitcoin mining operations, trading venues and custody infrastructure.  El Salvador's bitcoin treasury position represents early experimentation with nation-state bitcoin reserves. While experimental, their moves and the recent proposal for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve forces traditional financial centers to confront bitcoin's role in sovereign finance.  Other nations will study and attempt to replicate these frameworks, preparing their own initiatives to attract bitcoin-denominated capital flows.  3. Banks race against obsolescence.  In debt markets, necessity drives innovation. Public companies now routinely tap bond markets and convertible notes to finance bitcoin-related transactions. The practice has transformed bitcoin from a speculative asset into a cornerstone of corporate treasury management.  Companies like Marathon Digital Holdings and Semler Scientific have been successful in following MicroStrategy's lead, and the market has rewarded them. This is the most important signal for treasury managers and CEOs. Bitcoin’s got their attention now.  Meanwhile, bitcoin lending markets have come a long way over the last two years. With the deadwood being cleared away, serious institutional lenders now demand proper collateral segregation, transparent custody arrangements and conservative loan-to-value ratios. This standardization of risk management practices attracts precisely the type of institutional capital that previously sat on the sidelines.  More regulatory clarity out of the U.S. should open the door for more banks to get involved in bitcoin financial products — this will benefit consumers the most, with new capital and competition driving rates down and making bitcoin-backed loans even more compelling.  4. Bitcoin and crypto M&A intensifies.  As regulatory clarity emerges through the SAB 121 resolution addressing crypto custody and other guidance, banks will face a critical choice: build or buy their way into the growing market of bitcoin & lending. As a result, we predict at least one of the top 20 U.S. banks will acquire a crypto business in the coming year.  Banks will want to move fast, and development timelines for cryptocurrency infrastructure stretch beyond competitive windows, while established firms already process billions in monthly volume through battle-tested systems.  These operational platforms represent years of specialized development that banks cannot rapidly replicate. The acquisition premium shrinks against the opportunity cost of delayed market entry.  The confluence of operational maturity, regulatory clarity and strategic necessity creates natural conditions for the banking industry’s acquisition of cryptocurrency capabilities.These moves mirror previous financial technology integration patterns in which banks historically acquired electronic trading platforms rather than building internal capabilities.  5. Public markets validate bitcoin infrastructure.  The cryptocurrency industry is poised for a breakthrough year in public markets. We expect to see at least one high-profile crypto initial public offering exceeding $10 billion in valuation in the U.S. Major digital asset companies have built sophisticated institutional service layers with revenue streams that now mirror those of traditional banks, processing billions in daily transactions, managing substantial custody operations with rigorous compliance frameworks and generating stable fee income from regulated activities.  The next chapter of finance will therefore be written not by those who resist this change but by those who recognize that their very survival depends on embracing it.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Mauricio  Di Bartolomeo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/18/how-wall-street-s-relationship-with-bitcoin-will-transform-in-2025-5-predictions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/253e7364b1418571b13ca9a7060fadee905430f6-2560x1718.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin is a revolution, but not only in a financial sense. It changed the way we view and perceive money. BTC managed to influence industries, financial markets, companies, and individuals. It touched on so many spheres of ordinary life that it's no wonder it changed the way live casino games are viewed and played. If we look only at the last few years, the gambling industry has been elevated to a new level thanks to technological advancements, of which Bitcoin is a massive part. The moment online casinos and sportsbooks started to embrace BTC and other crypto, their sphere of operations was widened by a large margin. Bitcoin allows casino goers to fully enjoy a faster, safer, and more transparent product. The gaming experience is on a whole new level with BTC and blockchain, a revolutionary technology not discussed enough. When writing this article, decentralized betting is already at the center stage. Its central promise, which it dully delivers, is a fairer and more accessible way to play casino games and partake in online gambling. We live in an age when the gambling industry is not only influenced but also shaped by the presence of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is leading the way, and its name is often in the news. Live casino gambling is a different beast with BTC backing it, and that's the subject we will cover today. We will also speak of what's expected in this domain at the end of 2024 and in the early months of 2025. The Impact of Bitcoin on Live Casino Gaming Bitcoin has a massive impact on live casino gaming. It can be compared to Muhammad Ali's influence on boxing or Lionel Messi's influence on FC Barcelona. It transcends the era and shapes things to come in the future. It has already brought a few changes to the main stage, but we're going to talk only about the key ones. The speed of transactions is always a good place to start, moving through improved safety and security fields. It wraps it up with the benefits the players experience from the transformation of online casinos in the hands of cryptocurrencies. Faster Transactions and Lower Fees While many still rely on and hold high faith in traditional payment methods, it is a public secret that their time is long over. Regarding online casinos, traditional banking comes with high fees and delays. It is never a surprise when credit card payments take days to process or when the bank has issues with transferring money to online gambling establishments. For most players, the main problem is when there are issues with funds withdrawal. It is a hell we've often been a part of, or is that a purgatory? What changed most of these issues and made them disappear in an instant is Bitcoin. BTC is a synonym for speed. With this cryptocurrency, most transactions are processed instantly. The best part is that Bitcoin knows no boundaries. Using cryptocurrencies doesn't matter whether you're playing from America, Europe, Asia, or Africa. Crypto doesn't discriminate. With crypto, the movement of funds is rapid, and you do not need approval from a higher authority. While there are attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies, they are still decentralized currencies with no governing body over them, and we wouldn't want it any different. While everything said above is fantastic, it gets even better—the fees associated with dealing with cryptocurrencies are much lower than standard payment methods. Traditional banking and casino withdrawals were often marred by high costs, infuriating players who had to give up a portion of their winnings. With this issue gone, online sport betting platforms and crypto casinos such as Bety.com , high rollers, and international players can finally enjoy their fruits of labor. Enhanced Transparency and Security While the Internet has been around for some time now, we do not yet fully trust it. Online casinos are especially scrutinized, with security being one of the biggest concerns in the universe of online gambling. Every player wants to have faith that their funds and personal info are in good hands—safe and secure. This is a possibility and a solution that can be attained by using Bitcoin. If you're new to online crypto casinos and digital currencies, you must know that the public ledger, better known as blockchain, records every BTC transaction. Because of this, players can't experience data breaches. Their data is not accessible, and no one can tamper with it. When it comes to gambling, money is always involved, and by knowing that it will always be safe through the use of BTC, players can rest easy when gambling online, which wasn't the case back in the day. Another layer of trust also exists with BTC because the players can verify transactions. The last but not least piece of info tied to BTC and its use at online casinos is that by using it, you eliminate the need for the casino to have your sensitive data shared with the house. This means that you do not have to reveal your personal data or banking information to play at a crypto casino. With this info kept to yourself, the chances of having identity theft or data breach are kept to a bare minimum. The Rise of Decentralized Betting Platforms Bitcoin managed to influence everything it touches. Both online and traditional casinos benefited from the existence of BTC. But the list continues. It also aided in the rise and prosperity of decentralized betting platforms. While many see these platforms as just another form of online casino, they differ significantly. Blockchain is not used only for payments and withdrawals at decentralized betting platforms. This tech is also behind creating and running games and is managing the bets. With this approach, decentralized betting platforms have elevated openness and fairness even more than regular crypto casinos. How Blockchain Technology Is Shaping the Industry Decentralized betting has many sources backing it, but its backbone remains blockchain technology. Blockchain helps decentralized betting by recording all transactions in a safe and secure way that cannot be changed once they are recorded. This aids both the players and the online casinos. First, blockchain technology ensures that all games and end results are random. RNG ( Random Number Generator ) is present in traditional casinos, too, but players have no means of knowing it and must trust the casino on its word. Blockchain eliminates the necessity for trust, as everything is transparent. All players can see how the results are calculated at any given moment, which leaves no place for doubt. Furthermore, blockchain technology simplifies payouts. Winnings are transferred automatically via smart contracts. This eliminates the possibility of human error and ensures that every player is paid what they're owed. Decentralized gambling is everything we've dreamed of in the past, and now that we have it, it is hard to believe that it's true. The Role of Smart Contracts in Fair Play Do you know what smart contracts are? In essence, they are contracts in the form of digital agreements that are executed when all conditions are met. For decentralized platforms, they are key ingredients. Let us give you an example for everyone who needs help understanding what we're discussing. Let's say you're playing a hand of blackjack. With a smart contract, your bet would be collected, your game results would be calculated, and in the case of a win, your winnings would be paid out in full. Do you understand? There would be no need for casinos or their staff to be involved in the process. What this does for a player is that it reduces the possibility of fraud and ensures that all rules tied to the game, the bet, and the payout are met in full. When a smart contract is implemented, disputes are less common. With smart contracts, all rules are set in advance, and with this setup, any misunderstanding remains minimal. For bettors, this makes all forms of bets enjoyable and straightforward. The Future of Bitcoin and Live Casino Gaming In terms of digital cu, Bitcoin is an ancient one. It was the first digital currency to meet the digital world, and thus, it holds the most influence. In the world of casino gaming, it is seen as a messiah. According to experts, more and more casinos will have to accept BTC. With time, many casinos will switch to only BTC models. When this happens, the doors will open for Ethereum and Litecoin to receive the same treatment. This revolution is happening as we speak, and by the end of 2024 and by the start of 202, we're going to be there. Here's what will happen. Predictions for 2024/2025 It is always challenging to predict the future. What's worse, it is easy to be wrong. However, we are almost sure that more and more casinos will accept BTC without fault. As we said, Ethereum and Litecoin will receive the same treatment as the following two cryptos once Bitcoin is widely accepted . Furthermore, governments will want to get on the gravy train. In the future, we will see more crypto regulation than ever before. This will be good for everyone as they will receive more trust from a broader audience. When players feel that the industry is safer than before, more of them will flock in to join. The funny thing is that crypto is as secure as it is, and BTC is more secure than any other, but for many onlookers, the blessing from the authorities will mean more than what the situation dictates in their wallets. While everything above is essential, the factor that could overshadow them all is the change in player demographics. Bitcoin casinos might receive a new influx of players, and we're talking about a younger audience that is more adept at using new technologies. When this happens, and BTC casinos receive a new and younger audience, the entire industry might change shape. In most cases, when the youth takes over, it leads to better features and more innovative games. Even the older players would be okay with this. Innovations to Watch Bitcoin in itself is an innovation. Together with a few others, it might shape the world of casino gaming. The one tech that is almost here to look out for is VR. Virtual reality is the game changer. An immersive, virtual casino, much like a real one, where you can wager using digital currencies, is imminent in the foreseeable future. With this innovation, live gaming would become more popular than ever and much more than it is today. While this is amazing, another step forward in the form of tokenized awards is waiting in the shadows. Casinos will soon be able to use blockchain to make this possible. These tokens could be money, cryptocurrency, exclusive access to casino events, or loyalty points. The last but not least addition is the much-talked-about artificial intelligence. In the future, online casinos will play a significant role. AI tools might be used to analyze blockchain data to improve game design or identify data patterns. When this becomes possible, it will be easier for casinos to offer players a more personalized experience. Conclusion Bitcoin is making its rounds around live casino gaming. It is making every transaction faster, reducing fees, and improving safety and security. Thanks to decentralized platforms and blockchain technology, fairness is taken to new levels, and both together are reshaping the industry. As we move into 2024 and 2025, all of these changes will accelerate; we guarantee it. With new innovations on the horizon, the future of live casino gaming looks brighter than ever. Whether you’re a casual player or a high roller, Bitcoin will improve your experience. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, this rate cut announcement cautioned us about additional reductions in the coming years. Fed Cuts Rates by 25 Basis Points This decision has officially lowered the federal funds rate to 4.25% from 4.50%. While inflation remains slightly above the central bank’s target, it has significantly declined from the 40-year high reached during the pandemic peak. Although the effects of this latest rate cut may not be immediately noticeable, it marks a critical step in what appears to be a broader effort by the Federal Reserve to continue reducing rates over time. Despite this expectation of a rate cut, the overall cryptocurrency market remained declining ahead and following the FED announcement. Additionally, there is no sign of price recovery across the crypto market. Will the Crypto Market Recover? According to Coinmarketcap , the overall cryptocurrency market is down by 2.62%. In contrast, major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP , and Solana (SOL) witnessed a price decline of over 2.65%, 2.30%, 4.69%, and 5.15% respectively in the past 24 hours. Source: Coinmarketcap Based on the historical data, the rate cut is undoubtedly favorable for the financial market, including cryptocurrency. However, Min Jung, the research analyst at Presto Labs cited that the upcoming rate cut would create the least impact on Bitcoin’s BTC price. However, during the meeting, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the Fed is ‘not allowed to own Bitcoin.’ This statement by the Fed Chair could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market and may lead to a price decline in the coming days.

The recent launch of the Aventurine proto-mainnet aims to help developers, validators, and users prepare for the future of the network. Aventurine is a strong bridge to ensure a smooth transition to Zilliqa 2.0. This development has generated excitement in the blockchain community, with anticipation for the mainnet launch. Building the Foundation for Agate The transition to Zilliqa 2.0, scheduled to be launched in 2024, was extended to allow thorough testing with Aventurine’s proto-mainnet. It is the last step before the Agate release brings Zilliqa 2.0 to life. This model is geared to simulate the entire migration process, including importing transaction history and state data from the current Zilliqa mainnet. Also, to ensure that account balances, smart contracts, and decentralized apps (dApps) are accurately replicated for testing. This process applies to Scilla and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) platforms . When the mainnet fully launches, the current Zilliqa mainnet will switch to the new protocol. Stakeholders will move their stakes to active validators. Zilliqa 2.0 will offer a simple staking portal to make this easier, allowing users to connect their EVM wallets and delegate stakes seamlessly. A New Zilliqa Protocol, A New Era Zilliqa 2.0 is not just an upgrade but a complete overhaul. It features a new architecture and a shift to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The upgrade aims to improve scalability, security, and interoperability. Migrating transaction history and state data from the old system to the new one is a massive task. Aventurine’s proto-mainnet is specifically designed to manage this process with accuracy. This would ensure a smooth and accurate transition to the new system. This testing phase ensures that all stakeholders, including developers, validators, and everyday users, are fully prepared for the transition. The phase focuses on testing technology and empowering the community to adapt and excel in this new environment. What Aventurine Brings to the Table Aventurine is designed to offer developers a real-world environment to refine dApps and tackle interoperability issues. This would allow them to test transaction histories and smart contracts from the current mainnet to ensure optimal performance on Zilliqa 2.0.

37812433,https://nulltx.com/?p=135928,1734552039,"Dogecoin Price Crash Leads Whales to Quietly Buy into an AI Altcoin Set for 50,000% Growth","The recent Dogecoin price crash has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, leaving many investors scrambling to reassess their portfolios. Once hailed as a leading memecoin, DOGE’s decline highlights speculative assets’ growing challenges in a volatile market. Amid the Dogecoin price downturn, attention has shifted to alternative opportunities, with savvy investors, including crypto “whales,” quietly reallocating their funds to emerging assets with greater long-term potential. One standout contender capturing significant interest is a new AI altcoin, PCHAIN . Top market analysts have all heaped praises on this emerging asset, with many predicting it will deliver staggering returns of up to 50,000%. This shift signals a broader trend as the market increasingly rewards innovation and utility over hype. While the Dogecoin price movement relies on market hype, this AI altcoin is designed to solve real-world problems, using cutting-edge machine learning technology to revolutionize the future of real estate investing. The Dogecoin Price Downturn and the Rise of this AI Altcoin, PCHAIN Over the years, the Dogecoin price movement has made many investors millionaires with its surges. However, the recent DOGE price crash has caused huge losses to retail traders and seasoned investors. The coin’s dependence on hype rather than fundamental utility has often left it vulnerable to market corrections. The crash, marked by almost double-digit percentage losses, reignited debates about the Dogecoin price long-term viability. Despite its status as one of the top crypto assets by market capitalization, the Dogecoin price reliance on sentiment-driven momentum makes it susceptible to sharp sell-offs. This latest Dogecoin price crash appears to have accelerated a broader shift among institutional and large-scale investors, who are now investing heavily into this AI altcoin, PCHAIN, with tangible utility, innovative capability, and low-risk, high-reward potential. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform poised to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. This AI altcoin combines blockchain technology with machine learning capabilities, enabling various applications such as predictive analytics to help real estate investors optimize profit. As a real-world asset (RWA) altcoin, PCHAIN bridges the gap between the global real estate market and the blockchain. The token also offers investors early access to the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. With top market analysts predicting a potential 50,000 growth for this AI altcoin, crypto whales are flocking in to capitalize on what promises to be a life-changing opportunity. Why Whales Are Betting on this AI Altcoin Amid the Dogecoin Price Fall Crypto whales, investors who hold substantial amounts of crypto assets, have a reputation for influencing market trends. Their recent accumulation of this AI altcoin as the Dogecoin price crashes has not gone unnoticed. Blockchain analytics reveal a steady accumulation of this new AI altcoin, PCHAIN , by wallets associated with high-value traders, suggesting a quiet but deliberate strategy to capitalize on its long-term growth potential. Why are whales betting on this altcoin? The first thing every savvy investor considers is the fundamentals of a project. For this PCHAIN, its solid fundamentals are the biggest motivation for these whales. As an RWA altcoin, PCHAIN enables digitizing real estate assets on the blockchain. Here is the catch: the RWA tokenization market is projected to be worth a massive $16 trillion, with real estate making up the bigger percentage of the market. PCHAIN’s value proposition to digitize real estate properties on the blockchain means the token is poised to take a huge chunk of the $16 trillion RWA tokenization market share. Secondly, PCHAIN’s parent project, PropiChain, is set to power the future of real estate using AI, smart contracts, RWA tokenization technology, and the Metaverse. The platform is poised to take at least 1% of the $600 trillion real estate market. This means the AI altcoin, PCHAIN, is set to become the utility token of a $6 trillion ecosystem. The whales understand the high-profit potential of the AI altcoin, and they see a pathway to its projected 50,000% growth. While the Dogecoin price struggles to sustain an upward momentum, crypto whales see PCHAIN as a dependable investment option. PropiChain Powering the Future of Real Estate PropiChain is revolutionizing real estate investment by blending cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), smart contracts, Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, and the Metaverse. The platform incorporates AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots to deliver round-the-clock support, simplifying the complexities of real estate investing. These tools cater to novice and experienced investors, offering personalized guidance based on their unique needs. Additionally, PropiChain’s AI-driven predictive market analysis tools provide insights into market trends, uncover emerging opportunities, and empower investors to make well-informed decisions to optimize returns. PropiChain also uses smart contracts to automate crucial real estate processes, including property leasing and lease renewals. By automating these tasks, the platform eliminates the necessity for intermediaries like brokers and leasing agents, resulting in increased efficiency and reduced operational costs. The platform’s implementation of RWA tokenization technology marks a significant disruption to traditional real estate investment models. By converting physical properties into digital assets on the blockchain, PropiChain facilitates fractional ownership, enabling investors to acquire smaller stakes in high-value real estate assets. PropiChain’s innovative application of the Metaverse redefines how investors evaluate and explore properties. With state-of-the-art 3D visualization technology, the platform allows users to tour properties from anywhere in the world virtually. This approach removes geographical limitations and offers an immersive experience, empowering buyers to assess properties from their homes thoroughly. The Metaverse also serves as a dynamic marketplace within PropiChain, enabling real-time interactions between property buyers and sellers. Conclusion The recent Dogecoin price crash has prompted major crypto whales to discreetly shift their focus to PCHAIN, which analysts predict could achieve explosive growth of up to 50,000%. This strategic move underscores the growing interest in projects that use cutting-edge technology, such as artificial intelligence, to disrupt traditional industries. PCHAIN has already raised over $1.3 million from its first presale round, which is a testament to investor confidence in the project’s profit potential. The projected 50,000% growth means your $1000 investment in the ongoing second presale round priced at $0.011 will yield $499,000 in profit. Join the PCHAIN presale now to enjoy such massive returns. After this second presale round, the token price will increase by over 109%. Join now for its low-cost, high-reward potential. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , a sign of the project’s readiness to do great things in the crypto space.

For now, market participants seem content to let SOL continue to move sideways. In the event of a breakout above the red diagonal line, however, the SOL price could pump upwards very quickly before possibly losing some momentum around $264.50. If the price managed to break above $264.50, that would be an extremely bullish sign – and it would be reasonable to consider $300 as SOL’s next target. On the bear side, it’s important to note that even though SOL’s descending triangle bottoms out around $203, the overall price trend would actually flip bearish before that point. This is shown by the SuperTrend indicator (the green-shaded area on the chart), which would turn red (bearish) if the price drops below $212. Eagle-eyed readers will also have spotted some early warning signs, in the form of recent candle wicks that have already pulled the SOL price below the SuperTrend support level. In the event of a dip below $203, key support prices to watch would include $200 (a pivotal psychological support level), and $183 (the highest price peak before SOL pumped in early November). Either way, a lot of volatility lies ahead for SOL as 2024 ends and we move into 2025. As the ongoing price consolidation shows, traders and investors are positioning themselves in line with their own analyses – and their actions can only cancel each other out for a limited period of time. Popular Twitter analyst Crypto Zach has identified a similar scenario playing out on a lower time frame. All I want for Christmas is $SOL to break this downtrend and pump to ATHs pic.twitter.com/O0PgXPEPpO — Zach (@CryptoZachLA) December 16, 2024 Solaxy: The first Solana Layer 2 blockchain While the crypto market awaits the volatile outcome of SOL’s consolidation, active investors need to keep searching for the next big token to accumulate. We have found Solaxy (SOLX) to be an especially intriguing option for crypto enthusiasts who don’t want to miss the next big opportunity. Solaxy is the world’s first Solana Layer 2 blockchain, and addresses the key pain points that have caused issues for Solana users in the past. These problems include failed transactions, network congestion, and limited scalability – and Solaxy solves them all, while retaining Solana’s much-loved low fees and high transaction speeds. SOLX is Solaxy’s native cryptocurrency token – but it’s also multi-chain, and will be available on the Ethereum network as well as Solana. That’s one token used across the two most powerful and versatile Layer 1 blockchains in the industry. The possibilities for project builders will be endless, and investors can begin accumulating SOLX at its current presale price of $0.00156. From meme coins to DeFi and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Solaxy is set to dominate across multiple crypto sectors and narratives. By providing token holders with access to Ethereum’s deep liquidity, Solana’s high throughput capabilities, and the unique advantages provided by the Solaxy Layer 2 network, SOLX is an exceptional presale token that demands further investigation. Another Layer 2 project – Pepe Unchained – recently saw gains of over 600% following its recording breaking $76m presale. If Pepe Unchained’s success is anything to go by, Solaxy could be set for a bright future. For more information, visit the Solaxy presale website .

37812604,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629924,1734551936,First look at Exodus gameplay: A blend of Sci-Fi adventure and BioWare’s legacy,"Archetype Entertainment released a gameplay trailer for Exodus, the studio’s new sci-fi role-playing game. Drawing heavily from Mass Effect, the game will have a post-Earth setting where gamers explore the universe and human colonies. Matthew McConaughey is also set to star in the game, but his role has yet to be disclosed. As gamers await the next Mass Effect game, Archetype Entertainment and Wizards of the Coast developed Exodus, a new AAA game. The sci-fi game is set to be released for PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Gamers will explore the vast cosmos in the game, engaging alien life and uncovering engaging mysteries. Archetype entertainment release gameplay trailer In the trailer released, gamers finally got a glimpse of Exodus’s space travel mechanics, which is shown by a ship flying around an Earth-like planet. The game’s trailer also introduced Jun, a traveler who is set to feature as the protagonist. In the trailer, Jun is capable of wielding unique powers known as celestial tech and is part of an unnamed ship’s crew. The trailer dialogue suggests that the crew will traverse the vast space, exploring hostile and mysterious sites in search of riches. The trailer is filled with rich visuals that show off the game characters’ space suits, scenic environs, and tools that will come in handy when completing missions. The trailer’s combat scenes also show several opponents that gamers must defeat in their quest using brains, brawn, and a diverse catalog of weapons to overcome size and power differences. The opponents shown include a gigantic modified bear and a four-armed modified beast. Exodus also heavily centers around Livestone, an element central to both gameplay and narrative. According to the game’s official website , gamers will have to travel across the stars and be entangled in the political complexities involving competing colonies. Gamers will also have to maneuver under time dilation during their journey. The decisions in the game will result in consequences that will translate to the gamer’s characters and their homeworld during the player’s absence. The website also announced Matthew McConaughey’s involvement, with his exact role yet to be revealed. Gamers can sign up as founding members to earn the EXODUS Aegis space suit and refer friends to earn more in-game rewards. Exodus draws Mass Effect comparisons as gamer anticipation rises Exodus was highly anticipated before its release, with gamers comparing it to the Mass Effect games. The sci-fi game’s development was spearheaded by BioWare alumni James Ohlen and Chad Robertson, whose development borrowed from Mass Effect’s combat and game mechanics and the integrated relationship-centered gameplay. The game’s narrative, its exploration-based plot, and interstellar conflicts are reminiscent of Commander Shepard’s adventures in Bioware’s flagship franchise. “EXODUS looks like it’s bringing the heat—ready to blast off into the sci-fi stratosphere. Hope the gameplay doesn’t have more glitches than my last attempt at cooking dinner..” – Richard Ward Gamers online stated that they were highly anticipating Exodus’ release after seeing the trailer. Most gamers stated that they would play it due to its resemblance to Mass Effect and the fact that Bioware veterans helmed the project. Some gamers also referred to the eleventh Secret Level episode and stated that the game would be unique if the developers properly implemented the time dilation elements.

37812134,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375125,1734551477,Tether (USDT) Inflows Surge as Stablecoin ‘Fuel’ Powers Crypto Bull Rally,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) climb to record levels has lifted the crypto market, and as the year wraps up, it’s sparking strong bullish sentiment for the future. In the backdrop, there has been a significant surge in Tether (USDT) inflows to exchanges. This stablecoin movement aligns with the ongoing crypto bull rally, which has been underway for more than two months now. USDT’s Daily Inflows to Exchanges According to the latest data compiled by Santiment, there has been an average net inflow of approximately $40 million per day USDT to cryptocurrency exchanges over the past eight weeks. These inflows have acted as critical ‘fuel’ for many historic crypto price pumps, contributing to the positive sentiment and liquidity in the market. With 2024 nearing its final stretch, the continuation of this stablecoin “dry powder” influx suggests further potential for upward momentum as traders allocate funds toward cryptocurrencies. The stablecoin market has matured significantly globally, even overtaking Bitcoin as a preferred asset for everyday transactions, as per Chainalysis’ report . In the midst of this, fresh challengers like Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD are entering the market, with other stablecoins raising their stakes. Despite several players in the stablecoin market, USDT has emerged as the undisputed heavyweight this year. One year ago, its supply stood at 90 billion – an impressive 50 billion growth over 12 months. USDT now controls 66% of the $212 billion stablecoin market and has maintained the top spot in trading volumes throughout 2024. Stablecoin Potential A recent report by Standard Chartered and Zodia Markets predicted that stablecoins could potentially grow from 1% to 10% of the US M2 money supply and foreign exchange (FX) transactions. The two companies believe that the utility of stablecoins has expanded beyond cryptocurrency trading to cross-border payments, payroll, trade settlements, and remittances. The report highlighted that stablecoins could address inefficiencies in traditional financial systems, offering faster and cheaper transactions. Regulatory clarity, particularly from a possible Trump administration in 2025, is seen as a key factor to unlocking their full potential. Besides, adoption in emerging markets like Brazil and Nigeria is already rising, driving further demand.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-explode-13000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-bonk-and-doge-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The fund was founded in 2015 and has roughly $750 million in client assets. The securities were issued by the city of Quincy, Massachusetts, in April and underwriter JPMorgan Chase & Co. used an application on its private, permissioned blockchain-based platform to facilitate the sale. Notably, it was the first deal where muni debt was purchased, settled and held all in blockchain on the platform, completely bypassing traditional methods. A $6.5 Million Deal! BlackRock is the first investor to purchase a portion of the deal. The Quincy transaction involved $6.5 million in municipal debt purchased by BlackRock. Notably, the city of Quincy made waves earlier this year when it issued bonds using blockchain technology instead of the traditional system. JPMorgan’s blockchain platform, Digital Debt Service, was at the center of this innovation. “The use of blockchain throughout the lifecycle of bonds is just one example of the potential for this technology to transform capital markets,” said Pat Haskell, head of the municipal bond group at BlackRock. “This transaction marks a significant moment for the municipal bond market and is a testament to BlackRock’s dedication to innovation.” The prospectus for MEAR was updated to allow the fund to invest in muni bonds settled on JPMorgan’s application Digital Debt Service, according to a US SEC filing dated Dec. 17. The firm updated its ETF’s prospectus to allow blockchain-based bond investments. This required a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which also outlined the risks, like limited liquidity and the possibility of bugs or errors in the blockchain application. Some issuers and underwriters have been exploring the use of blockchain technology in the muni market. For example, the Michigan State University board of trustees considered a deal to be registered on a digital platform provided by Goldman Sachs. IBIT Smashing Records Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), launched earlier this year, is smashing records. Over the past day, IBIT pulled in $740 million in inflows. It now manages over $51 billion in assets, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. Over the past 24 hours alone, IBIT pulled in $740 million.

CyberKongz announced the notice this week and says it plans to “stand up and fight” in response to the SEC’s crackdown. “We have been suffering in silence for the last two years, ever since we first received contact from the SEC. Throughout the entire process they have showcased a complete lack of understanding of blockchain technologies that has resulted in unjust accusations and information inaccuracies. CyberKongz is a project deep-rooted in gaming and the SEC’s Division of Enforcement have approached us with very concerning rhetoric that you can not have a token (ERC-20) in tandem with a blockchain game without registering it as a security. This discourse would have major implications for the entire web3 gaming industry, and we will defend against this stance for the wider space.” The SEC also sent a Wells notice to the NFT marketplace OpenSea in August, claiming that NFTs on the platform are securities. CyberKongz also says the regulator’s Wells notice “demonstrated a perplexing interpretation of smart contracts.” “One of their major concerns with CyberKongz is around the ‘sale’ of Genesis Kongz in April 2021, which was actually a contract migration. If they cannot distinguish between a primary sale and a contract migration, what hope do we currently have for a clear regulatory pathway going forward?” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The dot plot graph and statements published by the FED along with its interest rate decision were evaluated in favor of the hawkish. Here's what Powell said at the live press conference (refresh the page for new statements): Overall economic performance is strong. The job market has cooled due to overheating. Inflation is closer to the 2% target. Consumer spending remains resilient. Economic activities continue to expand steadily. The labor market remains robust. Although the unemployment rate has risen, it remains at a low level. Wage growth is slowing. Current labor market conditions are looser compared to 2019. The labor market is not a significant source of inflationary pressure. Long-term inflation expectations appear robust. The risks to achieving the objectives are roughly balanced. The interest rate range was lowered today and is moving towards a more neutral level. Today, the policy stance is significantly less restrictive. We may be more cautious in considering further interest rate adjustments. The Fed does not follow a predetermined path for interest rates. Reducing policy restrictions too slowly could severely weaken the economy and employment. If inflation cannot move sustainably towards 2%, policy restrictions can be lifted more slowly. Today's interest rate decision was a difficult one. We believe that inflation is still developing more or less as expected. The inclusion of the phrase “magnitude and timing” in the statement regarding interest rate adjustments suggests that we are at or close to a time when we will slow down interest rate cuts. We are clearly closer to a neutral interest rate. The slowdown in the pace of rate cuts reflects stronger economic data this year. We believe the policy remains largely restrictive. As long as the labor market and economy remain robust, further rate cuts may be considered cautious. We believe that inflation risks and uncertainties are high. The decision to cut interest rates next year will be based on data. Economic growth will be faster than expected in the second half of 2024. The fact that it is close to a neutral interest rate is another reason to be cautious. Inflation returned to normal in November after rising. We pay attention to the development of inflation when evaluating interest rate cuts. We hope to see further progress on inflation and a robust labor market. The committee discusses how tariffs drive inflation, and we have done a lot of work on that. A core inflation rate of 2.5% in 2025 would be significant progress. We will wait for further progress on inflation before considering reducing interest rates. The scope and timing of future rate cuts are not decisions we make. We expect significant policy changes and we need to see what they are and their impact to get a clearer picture. We have made significant progress in bringing inflation under control. It may take another year or two to reach the 2% inflation target. We must continue to implement restrictive policies to achieve 2% inflation. We are in a new phase of the interest rate regulation process. A rate hike next year is unlikely. We cannot rule out any possibility. Related News: BREAKING: The Anticipated Moment Has Arrived! FED Announced Interest Rate Decision! Here is Bitcoin's First Reaction Investors had largely expected the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but officials signaled some skepticism about how much and how quickly the central bank will cut rates in the future. “What really drives long-term interest rates and the market is the expectations for a rate cut,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. Analysts say that's consistent with the possibility that the Fed could pause interest rate cuts in January, if not longer, while central bankers assess the economy and the impact of new policies the new president will implement. *This is not investment advice.

37811816,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313303,1734550902,Trump Family’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) Forms Partnership With Arthur Hayes-Backed Ethena Labs,"Ethena Labs ( ENA ), a synthetic dollar protocol backed by BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes, is announcing a partnership with President-elect Donald Trump’s decentralized finance (DeFi) project. In a new announcement on the social media platform X, Ethena Labs says it has entered into a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLFI). According to Ethena Labs, the collaboration will bring over Ethena Staked USDe (sUSDe) – a yield-bearing token that inventors can stake – to the DeFi platform. “A governance proposal has been submitted to add sUSDe to WLFI’s upcoming Aave instance as a core collateral asset, Should it pass, this proposal will enable World Liberty Financial users to benefit from sUSDe rewards and also WLFI token rewards This integration will increase stablecoin liquidity and utilization rates on the protocol, as sUSDe’s integration has on Aave’s Core instance.” However, the proposed changes must go through Ethena’s governance process before implementation. “We propose the implementation of sUSDe as the first new collateral asset to the World Liberty Financial market… Should this proposal pass and be implemented, the Ethena Foundation is willing to co-incentivize supply of sUSDe to come to the instance via its points program, making World Liberty Financial users eligible for additional Ethena Rewards on top of sUSDe APY.” World Liberty Financial launched earlier this year. At the time, the project released a roadmap, noting that its goal was to spread stablecoins pegged to the US dollar and the concept of decentralized finance around the world, and help those disenfranchised by banks.

37811750,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/realnoi-and-chintai-nexus-partner-to-launch-124m-tokenized-real-estate-platform,1734550729,RealNOI and Chintai Nexus Partner to Launch $124M Tokenized Real Estate Platform,"In a move that highlights the growing convergence of real estate and blockchain technology, RealNOI , a platform focused on real estate investment, has joined forces with Chintai , a compliance-oriented tokenization platform, to debut a solution that brings multifamily rental property cash flows into the digital asset ecosystem. This initiative introduces a long sought after concept of tokenizing monthly rental income streams, making them accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly those interested in DeFi. A New Era for Real Estate Investment The collaboration will launch with two, one New York and one New Jersey based, properties valued at $124 million, offering a digital pathway for investors to engage with real estate income streams. Chintai Nexus's blockchain platform ensures that the process adheres to global standards, providing institutional investors with secure access to these tokenized assets. An example of this technology in action is the DNZ carbon exchange, launched by ChintaiNexus in early 2024. This platform successfully tokenizes and trades real-world assets like carbon credits, showcasing its capability to handle complex asset classes and paving the way for similar innovations in real estate. Solving Liquidity and Access Challenges Tokenized real estate cash flows aim to address persistent challenges in the market, such as limited liquidity and cross-border access. By leveraging blockchain, RealNOI and ChintaiNexus are creating a system that facilitates international participation while ensuring transparency. Chintai Nexus's infrastructure incorporates elements of decentralized finance (DeFi), including automated market making and inter-blockchain connectivity to major networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This setup enhances liquidity and accessibility for tokenized real estate assets, allowing investors from diverse backgrounds to participate in high-value markets. Rethinking Real Estate Investment Models This approach diverges from traditional real estate equity models, focusing instead on cash flow tokenization. Investors can expect monthly distributions of rental income through the platform, with future prospects for secondary market trading. A notable application of this model is seen in DNA Holdings Venture Inc., which has launched DNA Deal Desk—an exclusive investment platform built on Chintai's blockchain. This platform tokenizes projects as special purpose vehicles (SPVs), allowing investments to be securely managed on-chain. Such innovations could similarly transform how real estate cash flows are structured and traded. Broader Implications The partnership between RealNOI and Chintai Nexus represents a significant shift in real estate investment, underscoring the growing importance of tokenization in the digital age. The global real estate tokenization market, valued at $2.81 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $11.80 billion by 2031 , with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9%. This rapid growth reflects increasing adoption of blockchain technology within the sector. Tokenization could democratize property investment by lowering barriers that have historically favored institutional and high-net-worth investors. By fragmenting high-value assets into tradable tokens, these platforms may unlock unprecedented liquidity in a traditionally illiquid market. A recent EY survey found that 80% of high-net-worth investors and 67% of institutional investors are either investing or planning to invest in tokenized assets. This approach may also redefine property ownership, allowing investors to acquire targeted income streams or fractional interests rather than entire properties. Projections indicate that by 2030, tokenized real estate offerings could account for 13.58% of the total commercial real estate industry . As blockchain technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, tokenized real estate has the potential to transition from an experimental concept to a mainstream investment strategy, reshaping both the real estate and digital asset markets for a broader range of participants.

""The economy is strong overall"" and has made progress in the Fed's full employment and price stability goals, he said. With that economic strength, the Fed can be more cautious as it assesses further adjustments. ""Based on the updated dot plot and inflation projections, the Fed is positioned for a January pause,"" said Yimin Xu, on behalf of Seeking Alpha analyst Cestrian Capital Research . ""The main question is whether March will also see a pause, since inflation readings may spike early in the year, creating more uncertainty around monetary policy."" (Added at 3:14 PM ET) Event concludes at 3:23 PM ET. 3:22 PM: ""We're not going to settle"" for allowing inflation to stay at above 2%. He won't rule out the potential for rate hike in 2025. 3:17 PM ET: Headline inflation can be affected by energy and food prices, which is why FOMC's median projection for headline inflation is for an increase next year, while its median expectation for core inflation is declining. 3:16 PM ET: ""One thing the Fed policymakers know is that its rate is 100 basis points closer to neutral"" — the point at which the rate neither drives nor hinders economic growth — Powell said. 3:10 PM ET: The downsides to the labor market appear to be diminishing. ""It's still cooling, but in an orderly way,"" Powell said. 3:08 PM ET : The hiring rate is low, reflecting a softening in the labor market,"" but the layoff rate is low and unemployment is still relatively low. Wage growth is at a healthy and more sustainable level. 3:06 PM ET: The Fed is ""not allowed to hold bitcoin ( BTC-USD )"", and it's not looking for a law change that would allow that, Powell said. 3:02 PM ET: ""We are in a new phase in the process of rate adjustments,"" as the policymakers now need to see more progress in inflation. The Fed still thinks the interest rate is ""meaningfully restrictive,"" he added. The CME FedWatch tool now puts a 20.9% probability on no rate cuts in 2025, up from 9.8% on Tuesday. 2:59 PM ET: The story is the economy is still unwinding from the pandemic shock that occurred in 2020 and 2021, he said. It may take a year or two for inflation to get back to 2%. 2:56 PM ET: "" We've made a great deal of progress"" with inflation ""in the 2s."" Housing services inflation has come down quite steadily. ""The overall story on why inflation should come down in still intact,"" Powell said. 2:51 PM ET: Core inflation dropping to 2.5% next year ""would be significant progress,"" he said. 2:49 PM ET: Whether potential tariffs will drive inflation ""is not a question that's in front of us right now."" The Fed policymakers will wait until they see the fiscal policy before they respond to them. It's ""very premature"" to come to any conclusions, he said. 2:46 PM ET: Inflation ""has underperformed"" vs. expectations, and is a big reason for the slower expected pace of rate cuts. The central bankers will be looking for further progress in inflation before cutting again, Powell said. ""We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we've approached the end of the year."" 2:44 PM ET: ""We're closer to the neutral rate"" and that's another reason to be cautious, he said. As he stated at October's press conference, he said the FOMC thinks that both the economy and policy are ""in a good place."" Update at 2:42 PM ET: The statement signals that the Fed is ""at or near the place to close, or pause cuts,"" Powell said. The slower pace of expected cuts reflects the still-elevated inflation. The decision today ""was a closer call, but it's the right call,"" Powell said. ""We don't think we need further cooling in the labor market to get the inflation rate down to 2%,"" he added. The Fed still sees inflation ""broadly on track,"" though inflation has been moving ""sideways"" as it laps strong disinflation that occurred late last year. Overall, improving supply conditions have helped support the economy. Labor market conditions remain solid, but have eased from its overheated state in 2019. ""The labor market is not as source of significant inflation pressure,"" he added. Longer-term inflation expectations appear to be ""well-anchored,"" he said.

Trump’s DeFi project will use the technology of Aave to deliver passive income. Ethena has proposed the synthetic stablecoin USDe as an asset in the loan portfolio of World Liberty Financial. The Trump family DeFi hub will build lending vaults using the technology of Aave V3 and will have to decide on assets accepted for collaterals and loans. Ethena has entered into a strategic partnership with @worldlibertyfi A governance proposal has been submitted to add sUSDe to WLFI's upcoming Aave instance as a core collateral asset pic.twitter.com/jgjd8QGWDS — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 18, 2024 Ethena’s goal will be to position USDe as a core collateral asset. World Liberty Fi lenders and liquidity providers will then be able to earn both sUSDe and WLFI tokens as a reward. The addition of USDe has been wrapped in a governance proposal. If passed, USDe will be used in a way similar to its role in the core Aave lending protocol. However, the proposal will only receive votes when World Liberty Fi is fully approved and launches its first lending vaults. At this early stage, the potential vote adds more hype to WLFI and USDe. Aave (AAVE) has already voted on accepting USDe , and the stablecoin has spread to other DeFi protocols. The synthetic stablecoin is one of the fast-growing assets, aiming to gain legitimacy and prove its stability. For now, there is no finalized decision on adding USDe to the list of assets. World Liberty Fi owns a small amount of ENA tokens but has not committed to owning USDe. World Liberty Fi is still far from its fundraising goal World Liberty Financial has sold a total of 5.02B tokens, which is just 25% of its total goal. The token price is a low $0.015 and there is visible buying activity. However, WLFI will not start trading any time soon, turning all buyers into reluctant holders. Additionally, WLFI will be a staking and governance token, with a focus on holding for the long term. In the background, World Liberty Fi has been preparing for its role as a DeFi hub. The project acquired LINK tokens for its partnership with the Chainlink oracle provider. World Liberty also holds AAVE, in addition to stablecoins. There is no fixed date for launching the lending pool and adding a point of mainstream access for DeFi. USDe supply grows above 6.1B The partnership proposal comes at a time when Ethena’s USDe is expanding. It has become the third-largest stablecoin surpassing DAI and its swapped version, USDS. The total supply of USDe is now 6.1B, growing from lows of 2.4B in the middle of October. In the past 30 days, USDe expanded from around 3.5B to its current supply, with no sign of stopping. The continuation of the bull market for both BTC and ETH gave Ethena more confidence and higher earnings. This scenario has allowed the protocol to create more of the synthetic asset, with the option to burn the supply if market conditions change. Out of the total supply, 4.5B of the tokens are staked in the form of sUSDe. The token trades at a premium of $1.13, but takes longer to be unstaked. Ethena’s goal is to keep sUSDe supply high, keeping the stability of USDe during periods of market instability. After the news of supply expansion, ENA kept its position at around $1.10. The token also sees whale accumulation in the past day, as attention shifts to DeFi protocols and sources of passive income. ENA still trades close to its upper range, immediately reflecting the bull market for ETH and BTC. ENA is still up by as much as 600% in the past quarter, expecting to move to a higher range if the bull run continues. ENA predictions range from $3 to $8. In the past month, Ethena at one point surpassed even Tether in 24-hour fee generation. For the completed month of November, the Ethena protocol has earnings of $7.21M , leading to renewed hype and expansion.

37811709,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313294,1734550639,dTRINITY Launches Subsidized Stablecoin Lending Protocol on Fraxtal Layer-Two,"December 18, 2024 – Singapore, Singapore dTRINITY , a next-generation stablecoin liquidity protocol, has announced its mainnet debut on the Fraxtal layer-two network. The platform is designed to lower interest expenses and improve yields for stablecoin users, addressing the key challenge of rising credit costs in DeFi. At the core of dTRINITY is a protocol-native stablecoin (dUSD), which serves as the unified liquidity layer between its money markets (dLEND, an Aave version three fork) and external liquidity pools (e.g., Curve). dUSD is backed one-to-one by an on-chain collateral reserve consisting of stablecoins such as USDC, FRAX and DAI, as well as yield coins like sFRAX and sDAI. Exogenous yields from the reserve are redirected to fund ongoing interest rebates for dUSD borrowers on dLEND, based on their outstanding debts, which reduces the effective borrowing cost. This mechanism not only stimulates borrowing demand but also drives more sustainable utilization and yields for dUSD lenders. dTRINITY is launching on Fraxtal as its genesis network in a strategic collaboration with Frax to optimize ecosystem liquidity and user incentives. Fraxtal is an EVM-equivalent rollup with a scalable smart contract platform and efficient execution environment powered by the OP stack. Users can take advantage of Fraxtal’s fast transaction speed, low gas fees, robust network security and unique blockspace rewards, further enhancing their benefits. In the near future, dTRINITY plans to expand to Ethereum and other emerging blockchains, strengthening cross-chain liquidity and interoperability with Fraxtal as the network scales. Key features of dTRINITY Subsidized interest rate model – dTRINITY’s innovative subsidized interest rate model lowers the equilibrium of stablecoin borrowing costs on dLEND versus other protocols without impacting lending yields. In fact, rebates at low utilization levels could even result in negative interest rates for dUSD borrowers (i.e., borrowers could get paid to borrow). Liquidity incentives – dUSD lenders and liquidity providers benefit from a combination of protocol rewards and external incentives from strategic partners – in both points and tokens – for supplying and bolstering liquidity in the ecosystem. Security and risk management – dTRINITY has successfully completed smart contract audits with three leading blockchain security firms – Halborn, Verichains and Cyberscope. Additionally, the protocol disables rehypothecation of supplied collateral by default to minimize risk exposure. dUSD is the only borrowable asset on dLEND, and it cannot be borrowed against itself. Strategic partnerships – In addition to Frax, dTRINITY also plans to collaborate symbiotically with other major DeFi protocols. First, dUSD can be expanded to other lending platforms (e.g., Fraxlend, Morpho), providing their users with similar subsidy benefits. Secondly, dUSD can serve as a cheaper medium of leverage for loopers using other stablecoins/yieldcoins (e.g., Ethena, crvUSD), increasing demand for both projects. Furthermore, the dUSD reserve’s composition will be diversified over time, opening up potential partnership opportunities with more stablecoin/yield coin projects. dTRINITY’s core contributors include the co-founders of Stably. The project has been in development since Q2 2024 and secured first place at both the ETHVietnam and Fraxtal Hackathons earlier this year. Strategically, dTRINITY is advised by the co-founders of Frax, Convex, Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Coin98 and Promontory Partners, bringing a wealth of expertise from leading stablecoin and DeFi pioneers to the protocol’s development.

37813540,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320742,1734550349,XRP Tipped for ETF Approval – $100 XRP Incoming?,"The price of XRP has experienced a remarkable surge this year following a positive court decision and the tailwind provided by Donald Trump’s victory in the November U.S. presidential election. Thus far in 2024, XRP has seen its price increase by 311% while it jumped to 3 rd place in the list of most valuable cryptocurrencies according to data from CoinMarketCap. Although this performance has already been quite satisfactory to investors, the best may be ahead for this digital asset as rumors about the upcoming approval of a spot XRP-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) have started to circulate. Eric Balchunas, a well-known ETF analyst from Bloomberg News, said that he was expecting a “wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year” possibly as changes within the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are poised to take place shortly after Donald Trump takes office. We expect a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once. First out is likely the btc + eth combo ETFs, then prob Litecoin (bc its fork of btc = commodity), then HBAR (bc not labeled security) and then XRP/Solana (which have been labeled securities in pending… pic.twitter.com/29vMdciZxE — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 17, 2024 Applications for an XRP-linked spot ETF have already been filed from various financial services firms including Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, alongside several filings requesting the approval of Solana-linked vehicles as well. The SEC’s nod to BTC and ETH spot ETFs at the beginning of the year has opened the floodgates for institutions to fantasize about the potential approval of other similar vehicles for alt-coins. The success of BTC spot ETFs is undeniable as these vehicles have already attracted over $140 billion in capital inflows combined since they were launched. For Balchunas, these numbers are “unreal” considering that it has been only 11 months since the first BTC-linked ETF was listed. Can The Approval of an ETF Push the Price of XRP to $100? This year has already been outstanding for XRP and the trajectory that the price has followed ever since the court ruled in its favor goes to show that investors’ interest in this digital asset is alive and kicking. Currently, XRP has encountered two major resistance levels at $2.75 and $2.90 that it must overcome to reach new heights. Market participants slowed down the pace of their buying spree in the first half of December, possibly to take some profits after an amazing post-election rally. As the chart shows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was already stretched to its highest at that point and a pullback was due. However, now that trading volumes have subsided, late buyers could be considering that this is the right time to enter a position. Moving forward, the trend line shown in the chart should provide the necessary legs for the rally. As long as the price stays above that boundary, chances are that we could soon witness a break above the $3 mark in the short term. Although a $100 XRP seems a distant possibility at the moment, a $3 XRP was also out of the question just a month ago. This goes to show how things can change overnight in the crypto market. Only those with the discipline and willingness to endure uncertain times may be positioned to reap the biggest rewards over time. In the case of XRP, Trump’s victory is certainly a positive tailwind for a US-based project like this while the SEC’s changing stance on cryptos could favor the approval of an XRP-linked ETF. If this vehicle hits the trading desk, nothing can stop XRP from surging past the $10 mark as capital inflows going to BTC and ETH have already proven that both retail and institutional interest for cryptos is as strong as it has ever been. This Presale Token Could 10X Faster Than XRP XRP may end up the year as one of the top-performing crypto assets but its gains still pale in comparison to what certain presale tokens have seen in 2024. Most investors may be satisfied with 100% or even 300% returns but life-changing wealth with small investments can only be achieved by multiple 10x and 100x gains on novel tokens that are flying below most people’s radar. A rare gem in the crypto market known as Solaxy is currently being offered at an entry price of $0.001566 and investors have already poured $2.12 million into this project to get their hands on the first tokens that will be released to the market. Solaxy is a Solana layer-two protocol that offers increased scalability, zero network congestion, and guaranteed transaction execution. The presale period is about to expire as the project is close to hitting its funding milestone. Investors can get their hands on the first SOLX tokens by visiting the project’s presale website . A $100 XRP may sound like a far-fetched prediction but a $1 SOLX is on the horizon once this project gets traction as the adoption of Solana-based meme coins continues to attract developers and crypto entrepreneurs to the space.

37811540,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26690,1734550270,RealNOI and Chintai Nexus Partner to Launch $124M Tokenized Real Estate Platform,"In a move that highlights the growing convergence of real estate and blockchain technology, RealNOI , a platform focused on real estate investment, has joined forces with Chintai , a compliance-oriented tokenization platform, to debut a solution that brings multifamily rental property cash flows into the digital asset ecosystem. This initiative introduces a long sought after concept of tokenizing monthly rental income streams, making them accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly those interested in DeFi. A New Era for Real Estate Investment The collaboration will launch with two, one New York and one New Jersey based, properties valued at $124 million, offering a digital pathway for investors to engage with real estate income streams. Chintai Nexus’s blockchain platform ensures that the process adheres to global standards, providing institutional investors with secure access to these tokenized assets. An example of this technology in action is the DNZ carbon exchange, launched by Chintai Nexus in early 2024. This platform successfully tokenizes and trades real-world assets like carbon credits, showcasing its capability to handle complex asset classes and paving the way for similar innovations in real estate. Solving Liquidity and Access Challenges Tokenized real estate cash flows aim to address persistent challenges in the market, such as limited liquidity and cross-border access. By leveraging blockchain, RealNOI and Chintai Nexus are creating a system that facilitates international participation while ensuring transparency. Chintai Nexus’s infrastructure incorporates elements of decentralized finance (DeFi), including automated market making and inter-blockchain connectivity to major networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. This setup enhances liquidity and accessibility for tokenized real estate assets, allowing investors from diverse backgrounds to participate in high-value markets. Rethinking Real Estate Investment Models This approach diverges from traditional real estate equity models, focusing instead on cash flow tokenization. Investors can expect monthly distributions of rental income through the platform, with future prospects for secondary market trading. A notable application of this model is seen in DNA Holdings Venture Inc., which has launched DNA Deal Desk—an exclusive investment platform built on Chintai’s blockchain. This platform tokenizes projects as special purpose vehicles (SPVs), allowing investments to be securely managed on-chain. Such innovations could similarly transform how real estate cash flows are structured and traded. Broader Implications The partnership between RealNOI and Chintai Nexus represents a significant shift in real estate investment, underscoring the growing importance of tokenization in the digital age. The global real estate tokenization market, valued at $2.81 billion in 2023, is projected to reach $11.80 billion by 2031 , with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9%. This rapid growth reflects increasing adoption of blockchain technology within the sector. Tokenization could democratize property investment by lowering barriers that have historically favored institutional and high-net-worth investors. By fragmenting high-value assets into tradable tokens, these platforms may unlock unprecedented liquidity in a traditionally illiquid market. A recent EY survey found that 80% of high-net-worth investors and 67% of institutional investors are either investing or planning to invest in tokenized assets. This approach may also redefine property ownership, allowing investors to acquire targeted income streams or fractional interests rather than entire properties. Projections indicate that by 2030, tokenized real estate offerings could account for 13.58% of the total commercial real estate industry . As blockchain technology matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, tokenized real estate has the potential to transition from an experimental concept to a mainstream investment strategy, reshaping both the real estate and digital asset markets for a broader range of participants.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/realnoi-and-chintai-nexus-partner-to-launch-124m-tokenized-real-estate-platform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37811494,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313291,1734550261,"Sonic Labs Launches the Sonic Mainnet – EVM-Compatible, Verifiable 10,000 TPS and Sub-Second Finality","December 18, 2024 – George Town, Cayman Islands Sonic Labs today announced the launch of the Sonic mainnet, an EVM-compatible layer-one blockchain platform that offers developers attractive incentives and powerful infrastructure. With 10,000 TPS (transactions per second), sub-second finality and a native, decentralized gateway to Ethereum, Sonic empowers developers to build the next generation of applications on unparalleled infrastructure and liquidity. Developed by the same team behind Fantom, Sonic and its S token deliver a significant leap forward from both Fantom and FTM. Through a one-to-one upgrade process from FTM to S, existing FTM holders can seamlessly start using Sonic. Sonic leverages proven expertise to establish itself as a DeFi hub by revolutionizing developer incentives while providing users with smooth user experiences and access to vast amounts of liquidity. Fee monetization – Developers come first FeeM (Fee Monetization) on Sonic rewards developers with up to 90% of the network fees generated by their applications, adopting the Web 2.0 ad revenue strategies popularized by platforms like YouTube. While many blockchains offer limited developer incentives and primarily focus on value extraction, Sonic addresses this issue effectively through its FeeM model. Sam Harcourt, business development lead at Sonic Labs, said, “Recently, we’ve seen many new chains launch, especially centralized layer-twos where the founders pocket all network fees. “This excludes developers from the equation, forcing them to impose extra fees on users to earn revenue. “FeeM addresses this by coding developer rewards directly into the chain, ensuring that network fees are shared with developers from the start.” Developers on the Sonic chain receive a share of network fees generated by the traffic and engagement their applications attract, offering a built-in mechanism for ongoing revenue. Fantom to Sonic – Upgrading FTM to S Fantom and its FTM token are officially transitioning to Sonic and the S token. Sonic Labs is facilitating the transition by offering a dedicated upgrade portal on MySonic that allows FTM holders to seamlessly upgrade their FTM to S on a one-to-one basis. Michael Kong, CEO of Sonic Labs, said, “We are proud to launch the new Sonic chain as the next evolution of Fantom, building on its impressive track record of nearly 100% uptime since 2019. “Sonic is a revolutionary platform that prioritizes developers, empowering them to create applications with seamless user experiences while earning a share of network fees.” During the initial 90 days after Sonic’s mainnet launch, holders can freely swap between FTM and S using the upgrade portal. After this period, holders will only be able to upgrade from FTM to S. Sonic Gateway – Secure, decentralized interoperability With the rise of cross-chain activity, secure and trustless bridges are more crucial than ever. Traditional layer-one and layer-two bridging solutions often rely on centralized systems, risking billions in potential losses . The Sonic Gateway addresses these challenges as a decentralized and trustless bridge between Ethereum and Sonic, offering the following. Security – A fail-safe ensures user funds can be recovered on Ethereum if the Gateway is down for 14 days, guaranteeing asset protection. Speed – Asset transfers are batched efficiently (every 10 minutes from Ethereum to Sonic and hourly in reverse). The ‘fast lane’ feature lets users pay a small fee to bridge instantly. Decentralization – Operated by Sonic’s validators on both chains, the Gateway is as decentralized as Sonic itself, preventing centralized manipulation. Bernhard Scholz, chief research officer of Sonic Labs, said, “To empower users with effective and trustless control of their assets, we developed the Sonic Gateway, which provides liquidity from other platforms. “Powered by our own validators and secured by a fail-safe, the Gateway lets users and apps safely leverage the benefits and incentives of bringing new liquidity to Sonic.” Sonic Labs will expand the Gateway beyond Ethereum in the future, enabling direct, decentralized access to multiple blockchains’ native assets. Sonic airdrop – Distributing the S token To encourage network growth, Sonic Labs is distributing 190.5 million S tokens through an airdrop program focusing on both users and developers. The program includes two incentive structures . Sonic points – Rewards end-users for early adoption, asset holding and overall engagement. Sonic gems – Rewards developers for creating applications that drive user activity and innovation. Developers can convert gems to S and share the tokens with their users to incentivize continuous usage. About Sonic Sonic is an EVM layer-one platform that offers developers attractive incentives and powerful infrastructure. The chain provides over 10,000 TPS, sub-second confirmation times and a secure gateway to Ethereum for enhanced liquidity and asset security.

37811499,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664254,1734550214,"Shiba Inu Falls Below $0.00002631 As Bears Dominate The Market, Time To Buy?","Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen intense bearish pressure as its price slips below the critical $0.00002631 level. This downward move reflects growing market challenges, with SHIB struggling to maintain its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The break below this key threshold highlights the dominance of sellers, raising questions about the token’s ability to recover in the short term. As negative momentum builds, SHIB’s price action is at a pivotal point. Will bulls muster the strength to reclaim lost ground, or is the meme coin headed for deeper declines? The coming days will be crucial in determining the next phase of Shiba Inu’s journey. Technical Indicators Signal Continued Bearish Pressure For Shiba Inu Currently, the price of Shiba Inu is trading below the 100-day SMA, a key technical indicator that often signals the broader trend in the market. Trading below this crucial level suggests that bearish momentum is outweighing bullish efforts, creating a challenging environment for SHIB. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green The 100-day SMA typically acts as a dynamic support level in uptrends, helping to sustain upside strength. However, its current position below $0.00002631 indicates that the token has struggled to regain its upward trajectory. Furthermore, this development raises concerns about SHIB’s ability to mount a recovery, as prolonged trading below this threshold could invite further selling pressure and deepen the pessimistic outlook. For SHIB to reclaim positive momentum, a decisive move back above the 100-day SMA is essential, triggering renewed strength and potential for recovery. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator has experienced a significant drop, currently sitting at 35%. This sharp decline reflects a substantial loss of bullish strength, with selling pressure dominating the market. At 35%, the indicator suggests that Shiba Inu is approaching oversold territory, highlighting the intensity of the recent downward move. Such a low RSI level could signal that the token is under heavy selling pressure and might be due for a short-term rebound if buyers begin to step in. However, the persistent bearish momentum could drive SHIB’s price downward without a clear shift in market sentiment or buying activity. Monitoring the RSI in conjunction with other technical indicators will be crucial for identifying potential reversal points or continued downside risks. Key Support Levels Below $0.00002631: How Low Can SHIB Go? As Shiba Inu slips below the critical $0.00002631 level, attention shifts to the next key support zone that could determine its price trajectory. The immediate support lies near $0.00002045, a level previously shown resilience during bearish phases. If this fails to hold, SHIB could face more declines toward $0.00001272 or even lower, testing the strength of market sentiment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 82% Despite Recovery, Can SHIB Price Still Make It To $0.00008 ATH? However, if the bulls can gather enough strength at any of these support levels, it could trigger a recovery, pushing the price upward toward previous resistance zones. A rebound from these points would signal renewed buying interest and pave the way for Shiba Inu to regain lost ground, potentially reversing the bearish trend and reestablishing upward momentum.

Research by Kaiko and Bitvavo reveals that monthly euro trading volumes have consistently surpassed the 2023 averages, with notable peaks in March and November. Euro Trading Volumes Surge in 2024 Over $42 billion in trading volume was recorded in both months, signaling the euro’s growing importance in the crypto market. BREAKING: @KaikoData , a leading crypto market data provider, and @bitvavocom , a top European cryptocurrency exchange, report that compliant stablecoins are gaining traction in Europe, driven by growing crypto adoption and evolving regulations . Additionally, Euro trading… pic.twitter.com/futedx9hCp — Coinwaft (@coinwaft) December 18, 2024 As of late 2024, the euro accounts for 7.5% of the total fiat-based cryptocurrency trading volume, making it the third most-traded currency after the U.S. dollar, which holds a dominant 49.9%, and the Korean won at 33.4%. The rise in euro trading volumes comes alongside an evolving regulatory landscape in Europe. The European crypto market has seen a major shift in stablecoin usage with the introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. This regulatory framework, which came into effect on June 30, 2024, and will be fully implemented by December 30, 2024, is reshaping the stablecoin landscape by ensuring that asset-referenced and electronic money tokens comply with new legal standards. One notable development in the MiCA-compliant stablecoin market is discontinuing Tether’s euro-pegged stablecoin, EURt, on all blockchains. On November 27, 2024, Tether announced that it would halt minting EURt and cease its support on all blockchains. Despite Tether’s exit, the use of euro-backed stablecoins has flourished in Europe. As of late 2024, MiCA-compliant stablecoins dominate the market, with Circle’s EURC, Societe Generale’s EURCV, and Banking Circle’s EURI collectively controlling 91% of the European stablecoin market. Key Players in Europe’s Stablecoin Market Several players have emerged as leaders in Europe’s stablecoin space. Circle’s EURC, Societe Generale’s EURCV, and Banking Circle’s EURI are at the forefront of this new era of compliant digital currencies. Together, they have captured 91% of the stablecoin market in Europe. These stablecoins are designed to meet the new MiCA regulatory standards, providing a secure and reliable alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies for European traders. Crypto exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase are also pivotal in expanding the market for MiCA-compliant stablecoins. Binance made significant strides in this market by listing EURI in August 2024, almost matching Coinbase’s market share. This move positions Binance as a major player in the European stablecoin market, further solidifying the growing importance of MiCA-compliant stablecoins in the region. Coinbase has also adjusted its services in response to the new MiCA regulations. Starting December 1, 2024, the exchange will end its USDC rewards program for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). The decision is part of the changes prompted by MiCA’s stricter rules for e-money tokens like USDC. As Europe continues to develop its regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, MiCA-compliant stablecoins are expected to play an even more prominent role in the region’s digital economy.

The two companies announced plans for a “long-term collaboration,” beginning with the potential implementation of Ethena’s yield-bearing token, sUSDe, as a collateral asset in WLFI’s forthcoming instance of the Aave protocol. sUSDe Integration Proposal: How Ethena and World Liberty Financial Aim to Expand Stablecoin Utilization A governance proposal has been submitted to facilitate this integration. If approved, WLFI users can access sUSDe rewards and WLF token rewards. According to the proposal , the initiative is expected to boost stablecoin liquidity and utilization of the protocol, replicating sUSDe’s success in Aave’s Core and Lido instances. Should it pass, this proposal will enable @worldlibertyfi users to benefit from sUSDe rewards and also WLF token rewards This integration will increase stablecoin liquidity and utilization rates on the protocol, as sUSDe's integration has on Aave's Core instance… — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 18, 2024 In a joint statement, the companies emphasized the initiative’s potential impact, explaining that integrating sUSDe could boost stablecoin deposits within WLFI’s Aave instance. Since its onboarding to Aave in November, sUSDe has experienced rapid growth, reaching approximately $1.2 billion in supplied assets within a month . The team said in the statement: “In the unlikely event that WLFI governance does not approve the Aave instance or the use of sUSDe as collateral, both firms remain committed to exploring other avenues for collaboration.” Its integration has significantly increased stablecoin deposits and supply rates for assets like USDC, USDT, and USDS. World Liberty Financial’s (WLFI) governance body is expected to vote on the measure this week. If approved, sUSDe would be integrated into WLFI’s forthcoming instance of the Aave protocol, enabling it to access Ethena’s significant total value locked (TVL) and established user base. It will also allow WLFI to benefit from Ethena’s user base and the increased utilization of stablecoin deposits. The Ethena Foundation has committed to co-incentivizing deposits of sUSDe with additional rewards. Additionally, WLFI users would receive WLF token rewards for sUSDe deposits. The proposal also includes pre-approving sUSDe’s eligibility for E-Mode and aligning it with risk configurations set by Aave’s risk managers. Trump’s Crypto Pivot: World Liberty Financial Shakes Up DeFi World Liberty Financial represents Donald Trump’s most significant venture into cryptocurrency, an industry he previously criticized. Since his election in November, Trump has become more crypto-friendly and signaled his intent to reduce regulation in the digital assets sector. WLFI launched in September and seeks to democratize access to decentralized finance (DeFi). In October, it began its public token sale, signaling its intent to grow within the DeFi ecosystem. The announcement follows a series of strategic moves by WLFI. At the end of November, the platform appointed Justin Sun , the founder of Tron, as an advisor. This was soon followed by a $30 million investment in WLFI from HTX , a crypto exchange linked to Sun. WLFI has also expanded its digital asset portfolio significantly. Since Nov. 30, its wallet has acquired $30 million in Ether (ETH), $10 million in Coinbase Wrapped BTC (cbBTC), $2 million each in Chainlink (LINK) and Aave (AAVE), and smaller purchases of Ethena (ENA) and Ondo (ONDO), totaling $44.75 million in token buys this month . On Dec. 13, AaveDAO approved WLFI’s proposal to deploy its own Aave instance , enabling borrowing and lending for assets like ETH, WBTC, and USDC while sharing protocol fees and token supply with the DAO.

37811274,https://finbold.com/?p=220697,1734549801,2 cryptocurrencies to reach a $10 billion market cap in 2025,"As 2024 nears its close, the cryptocurrency market is once again showcasing its dynamic and volatile nature, capturing the attention of traders and investors navigating shifting trends. Following a sluggish start to the month, the global market has rebounded sharply, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging to a new all-time high of $108,268, sparking renewed optimism across the digital asset space, despite experiencing a slight pullback. As uncertainty continues to loom over traditional financial markets, the crypto space appears poised on the brink of a massive bull cycle . This ongoing bullish sentiment is particularly beneficial for several cryptocurrencies approaching significant market cap milestones, including the notable $10 billion mark. Finbold has identified two digital assets—Aave ( AAVE ) and NEAR Protocol (NEAR)—as strong contenders to surpass this threshold. These projections are driven not only by the continuation of the broader bull run but also by the impact of high supply inflation, which could propel market cap growth even if price movements remain relatively moderate. Aave (AAVE) AAVE is emerging as a top contender to reach a $10 billion market cap in 2025, backed by its dominance in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), expanding partnerships, and surging investor interest. Currently holding 45% of the DeFi lending market share, Aave remains the undisputed leader, supported by a total value locked (TVL) of $22.4 billion, nearly matching the combined TVL of other major lending protocols, as per DeFiLlama. The protocol’s growth is further fueled by key partnerships, including its integration with Linea, a Consensys-backed zk-rollup network, which promises lower transaction fees and improved scalability, two critical factors for attracting new users. Aave market cap and price. Source: CoinMarketCap Additionally, collaborations with Balancer v3 and deployments on Ethereum ( ETH ) to enable borrowing and lending for ETH, Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ), and major stablecoins like USDC and USDT have significantly boosted liquidity and utility, making Aave a top choice for borrowing and lending. Coupled with the broader crypto market rebound, Bitcoin’s march past key milestones, Aave’s strong fundamentals, and ongoing expansion position it to potentially double its current $5.5 billion market cap, placing the $10 billion mark well within reach. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) NEAR Protocol’s path to a $10 billion market cap hinges on its underlying market strength and improving investor sentiment. Despite a 5.56% decline in derivatives trading volume to $635.54 million and a 10.9% drop in open interest to $356.57 million, key indicators reveal a bullish undertone. The long/short ratio across major exchanges like Binance and OKX remains firmly positive, with Binance’s top trader long/short ratio at 4.72 and OKX at 2.52, reflecting strong buy-side confidence. Additionally, NEAR’s recent liquidations favor long positions, with $2.05 million in liquidated longs in the past 24 hours compared to only $66.96K in shorts, highlighting persistent bullish momentum despite short-term market caution. NEAR market cap and price. Source: CoinMarketCap NEAR’s robust DeFi and AI-driven use cases, coupled with investor accumulation near key support levels, suggest a breakout. Analysts are expecting a bounce back from the $6 level, followed by a pump toward $8 to $9, which could potentially push its market cap to the $10 billion mark. For investors and traders, both assets offer compelling entry points supported by strong fundamentals and technical indicators. Watching key levels, trading volumes, and ecosystem updates will be crucial for maximizing gains as AAVE and NEAR approach their next growth phase. Featured image via Shutterstock.

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network News  NEW DEVS ❤️SOLANA: The Solana ecosystem, ground zero for the memecoin craze, was the most popular blockchain among new developers this year, according to a report released last week by Electric Capital. In July, this community became the first since 2016 to bring on board more devs than Ethereum. Solana attracted 7,625 new developers in 2024, the most of any chain and a little over 1,000 more than Ethereum. The results underscore the challenge Ethereum faces as rival smart contract platform Solana's low fees and fast transactions attract investment and talent. Read more.  SPEAKING OF SOLANA: Solana's network activity has lit up as the Pudgy Penguins NFT project debuted its native token, PENGU, on the programmable blockchain. Solana registered a total transaction tally of 66.9 million Tuesday, the highest daily volume since its inception in 2020, according to data source Artemis. To highlight how busy it was, Solana's transaction count eclipsed the total of all other major chains combined.

The network, called Ink, is Kraken's answer to Base, the highly successful blockchain launched by rival exchange Coinbase. Like Base, Ink is based on the OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build their own rollups using Optimism’s technology. The team had originally planned for Ink to go live in early 2025, so the launch of its main network is ahead of schedule.

The network has been prepping for these changes for months, with new features that will cut the costs for sending transactions, operating validators and building applications on the network. Leaders at Avalanche previously said that part of the goal with the upgrade is to attract developers to Avalanche and encourage them to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets, or “L1s.""

An automated-market maker (AMM) for the Runes protocol went live on Wednesday on Stacks, following the unveiling of the layer-2 network's native BTC-backed asset sBTC on Tuesday. It's the first AMM for such tokens on Stacks. The teams behind decentralized exchange (DEX) Bitflow Finance and Bitcoin bridge Pontis developed the AMM. Runes launched in April and spurred a flurry of activity, paying 78.6 BTC ($8.18 million) in fees in the first 90 minutes. However, less than a month later, this excitement waned considerably, with fees dropping more than 50%. Bitflow's aim is for its AMM to help Runes scale and address some of the shortcomings holding it back. Read more.  ENS PICKS L2 TECH: ENS Labs, the company behind the Ethereum Name Service, has picked Linea's technology to build its upcoming layer-2 network, Namechain. Linea is a zero-knowledge rollup that came out in July 2023 and was built by Ethereum infrastructure giant Consensys. It is the seventh-largest rollup network, according to L2Beat, with $1 billion locked in its ecosystem. Rollups are a special type of blockchain where one can transact faster and at a lower cost. There are two kinds of rollups: optimistic and zero-knowledge. Optimistic rollups use optimistic proofs, which have a seven-day window to dispute transactions before they are finalized. Zero-knowledge rollups, by contrast, finalize proofs within minutes. ENS has been described as ""the phone book for Web3,"" but a more precise analogy is the web's domain name service (DNS). The domain name ""CoinDesk.com"" is easier to remember and type than a numerical IP address. Similarly, ENS handles like parishilton.eth, which the namesake heiress acquired in 2021, are more relatable than the strings of letters and numbers that make up Ethereum wallet addresses. For this service, ""we need fast finality,” said Nick Johnson, the founder and lead developer of ENS. That's because “you want to be able to update your ENS name and have the chain reflect it in the smallest interval possible. And to do that and have it remain decentralized and secure, we need fast finality, and optimistic roll-ups can't deliver that."" Read more.  NO CODE, NO PROBLEM? Patchwork, a startup focused on simplifying blockchain and smart-contract development founded by former Coinbase employees, has released the next version of its low-to-no-code tools for building decentralized applications (dapps). Currently linked to Coinbase’s Base and backed by Coinbase Ventures, the “Create-Patchwork” picks-and-shovels approach lowers the barriers to building blockchain applications and attaching data to them. Following the trend toward easily generated content, the complex world of blockchains and smart-contract design is on a path to no-code applications, or a “text-to-app” experience. Create-Patchwork is the first of several features the team plans to roll out in early 2025 and a foundational step to enable creators to generate contracts and applications in seconds using natural language inputs. “Patchwork is an Ethereum protocol that makes it really easy to build dynamic on-chain applications,” co-founder Kevin Day said in an interview. “It lets on-chain things own other on-chain things, and it allows anyone to attach programmable data to on-chain things.” Read more  EIGENLAYER'S SREERAM KANNAN: KING OF THE PROFESSOR COINS  For a crypto founder who's attracted so much controversy, Sreeram Kannan is surprisingly sanguine.  In a wide-ranging interview after his selection as one of CoinDesk’s “Most Influential” figures in crypto for 2024, the EigenLayer founder was generous with his time, chatting more than an hour beyond our scheduled slot. I was surprised at his openness because the last time we spoke, a colleague and I had just published an investigation into potential conflicts of interest at his company, Eigen Labs, and in the interim Kannan had disavowed our reporting point-by-point on a Blockworks podcast.  This time, Kannan emerged in a different light. Whatever his misgivings about CoinDesk’s past coverage, they didn’t seem top-of-mind.  What emerged wasn’t the portrait of a defensive tech founder, but rather that of a driven, thoughtful academic-turned-entrepreneur still adjusting to a spotlight few in this industry ever enjoy. Instead of bitterness or evasion, I found ambition, reflection and a quiet kind of excitement.  Kannan seemed as astonished as anyone by how swiftly EigenLayer had transformed from a concept into one of crypto’s most talked-about experiments, telling CoinDesk that he continued to view EigenLayer as a “scrappy startup.”  Over the past 12 months, EigenLayer — which allows emerging blockchain applications to borrow Ethereum’s robust security — went from a relative unknown to an industry heavyweight. The platform raised more than $100 million from venture firms including Andreessen Horowitz and, before even fully launching, drew hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits from crypto users seeking extra yield. Many were incentivized by a viral points program that investors hoped would translate into a lucrative future token airdrop.  EigenLayer’s success during the bear market was striking, and Kannan may have played a larger role than any other entrepreneur in revitalizing decentralized finance on Ethereum. But not everything went according to plan. Industry critics took issue with the EIGEN token distribution plan — which locked up tokens for months and barred claimants from certain geographies — as well as the platform’s slower-than-expected feature rollout and concerns about “rehypothecation,” or the reuse of collateral for multiple purposes. In August, the CoinDesk investigation (that Kannan disputed in the podcast) raised questions about EigenLayer’s conflict-of-interest policies, which may have allowed employees preferential access to tokens powered by its platform.  None of this seemed to derail Kannan’s intellectual ascent. Beyond running Eigen Labs, he still holds a position as an affiliate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Washington, and his theory of “restaking” — letting people reuse staked Ethereum assets to secure other networks — has sparked a wave of innovation and copycats. He’s become a familiar face on the conference circuit, where he unpacks his vision of blockchains as tools for solving humanity’s endless “coordination problems.”  Blockchains, Kannan says, “are the biggest upgrade to human civilization since the U.S. Constitution.”  CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL PROFILE BY COINDESK'S SAM KESSLER:  Money Center  'Wrapped' in intrigue  Coinbase Says It Nixed wBTC Because Justin Sun Posed 'Unacceptable Risk'  WBTC Episode 'Reopened Old Wounds' of Centralized Failures: Bitcoin Builders Association  Deals and grants  Stablecoin Payments Platform BVNK Raises $50M to Fuel U.S. Expansion  RWA-Focused Plume Raises $20M from Brevan Howard, Others Ahead of Mainnet Launch  Custody Firm Taurus Partners With Temenos Bringing Crypto Wallets to Thousands of Banks  Regulatory and policy  Next U.S. Senate Banking Chair Calls Crypto 'Next Wonder' of World  Calendar   Jan 9-12, 2025: CES, Las Vegas  Jan. 15-19: World Economic Forum, Davos, Switzerland  January 21-25: WAGMI conference, Miami.

Bloomberg reported the project Wednesday, and a representative for Matter Labs confirmed the story.    The chain will be ""a public and permissioned L2,"" Omar Azhar, the head of business development at Matter Labs, told CoinDesk over Telegram. When asked to elaborate, he referred a reporter to another participant in the project, Memento Blockchain, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Generally ""public permissioned"" means anyone can see what's happening on the network but only authorized participants can do certain things.    The project is a sign of a renewed interest in blockchain technology among institutions, as prices for various cryptocurrencies reach all-time highs. It also echoes the private enterprise blockchains that were in vogue nearly a decade ago. Those systems were disconnected from public chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, though they sometimes borrowed code from them.     According to the Bloomberg report, the bank is creating the layer-2 network in order to address regulatory compliance issues that come with public blockchains in finance. (Regulated institutions have to know who they are dealing with, which is hard in completely open networks like the main Ethereum chain). The bank believes that by creating a layer-2 on top of Ethereum, it will improve the speed of transactions as well as address those compliance needs.    The ZKsync-based rollup could allow banks to experiment with blockchains, and let them select which validators could run said blockchain, Boon-Hiang Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, told Bloomberg. The L2 blockchain may also give regulators “super admin rights,” allowing them to look more deeply into the movement of funds, Chan said.    Memento Blockchain announced the L2 endeavor on Nov. 6, but it received little attention at the time. The chain is currently in a test network environment. It is built with ZK Stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own blockchains based on ZKsync’s technology.    The L2 is part of Dama 2, a multi-chain initiative led by Deutsche Bank. Dama 2, in turn, is part of the Singapore Monetary Authority's Project Guardian, which is bringing together 24 major financial institutions that are looking into ways to use blockchains to tokenize their assets.

37811333,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629883,1734549506,Charles Hoskinson plans to move Cardano Foundation to Abu Dhabi or Wyoming – What’s happening?,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has urged the Cardano Foundation to move its operations to a jurisdiction that allows users to vote for board members. He recommended a move to either Abu Dhabi or Wyoming. The Cardano Foundation was founded in 2016 and operates under Swiss legislation, which does not allow for community-based board elections. Despite efforts to increase openness through open forums, there are persistent requests to restructure its leadership. According to Charles Hoskinson, locations such as Abu Dhabi or Wyoming would provide more opportunities for the community to participate in governance, leadership, budget allocation, and profound insights. Both locations are also known for providing blockchain-friendly environments. Cardano Foundation’s concerns Charles Hoskinson’s remarks are in response to a post by the Cardano Foundation that addressed governance concerns. The Foundation pledged transparency and declared open discussions, commencing with a virtual forum featuring CEO Frederik Gregaard. In the post, the Foundation highlighted its dedication to transparency by emphasizing its initiatives to support its annual activity report. The report would include the publication of financial insights reports and on-chain audited statements. Transparency, clarity, and dialogue are important to us. Over the past few years, we have put considerable effort into improving this, with the latest improvements being the launch of our financial insights report, along with our on-chain audited financial statements to… — Cardano Foundation (@Cardano_CF) December 17, 2024 Cardano Foundation explained, “The foundation model is the legal form that was chosen in 2016 when the Cardano Foundation was set up. If the goal was to create a membership-based model, the legal form of a Swiss association, such as we used for PRAGMA, would have been a more suitable choice.” However, Hoskinson believes that these measures are inadequate and is advocating for a new decentralized structure that is consistent with the principles of blockchain technology. Cardano enthusiasts are also in search of a governance model that prioritizes inclusivity. One user stated that Swiss bylaws enforce stringent compliance and provide some protection, but they lack flexibility for broader community involvement. Still, critics emphasize the obstacles to effective governance and impartial elections. This debate has acquired momentum, particularly in the wake of an anonymous whistleblower’s post regarding the Foundation. Cardano plans to organize a series on X spaces following a recent X account hack Currently, the Foundation intends to organize an X Spaces series in which its senior leadership will offer additional information regarding its operations. This comes after, on the Cardano Foundation X’s account was compromised on December 8. Following the compromise of the X account, a fraudulent advertisement for a token called ADAsol was displayed to users of the social media platform. This fraudulent advertisement boasted of a revolutionary bridge that was the result of a collaborative effort between the aforementioned entity and Solana. Additionally, an X post was visible to users on the platform, indicating that ADA withdrawals had been halted as the U.S. SEC tightened its control over the crypto project. However, it appears that this post has been removed. Overall, the X account breach saga attracted significant attention, emphasizing the importance of cyber security and its intricacies in the crypto industry. Still, the assault resulted in significant market volatility for the project’s native coin, which is one of the most prominent cryptos by market cap. Cardano (ADA) prices lately ADA also joined the broader crypto market rally. In the past two weeks, the ADA price has been experiencing a decline of over 20%, from its peak of $1.22, attained in early December. The price of Cardano has decreased by 5.4% in the past 24 hours due to the altcoin market’s collapse in preparation for the FOMC meeting. Market analysts are optimistic about the potential of a rally for ADA, which currently has support at $1.02. According to Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, ADA billionaires capitalized on the price increase from $1.15 to $1.33. However, these whales have resumed purchasing, accumulating 160 million ADA since the plunge despite a decline to $0.91.

37811332,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629934,1734549399,Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25bps,"The Federal Reserve dropped its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, setting a new target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision came with an 11-1 vote from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), continuing the central bank’s rate-cutting trajectory that started in September. But Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack wasn’t having it. She dissented , pushing to hold rates steady—making her the second official to go against the grain during this streak of reductions. This adjustment signals a cautious step in navigating the tightrope between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth. Alongside the rate cut, the Fed also announced a 30-basis-point reduction in the rate paid on its overnight reverse repurchase facility, effectively trimming it by five basis points relative to the federal funds target range. The dot plot gets stingy: Fewer rate cuts in 2025 The Fed’s infamous “dot plot” just got a little stingier. The latest projections show officials scaling back their expectations for rate cuts in 2025. The median forecast now points to only two quarter-point cuts next year, a sharp reduction from the four cuts projected back in September. If you’re counting, that means the benchmark lending rate is expected to drop to 3.9% by the end of 2025, equating to a target range of 3.75% to 4%. Of the 19 officials involved, 14 predict no more than two cuts in 2025, with five envisioning more aggressive easing—at least 75 basis points worth. For the longer haul, the committee sees the neutral rate landing at 3%. That’s 0.1 percentage points higher than their last projection, marking a slow but steady drift upward. Inflation expectations also nudged higher. Headline inflation is now expected to hit 2.4% in 2025, up from the 2.3% forecast in September. Core inflation isn’t looking much better, climbing from 2.6% to 2.8%. Despite the Fed’s relentless efforts, their dream of a 2% inflation target remains, well, just that—a dream. The economy isn’t escaping unscathed either. Projections for GDP growth were bumped up to 2.5% for the year, a half-percentage-point jump from September’s estimates. But the long-term forecast isn’t so rosy, with growth expected to crawl back to the Fed’s usual 1.8% projection after 2025. Mortgage rates stay stubborn If you’re hoping that rate cuts mean cheaper mortgages, think again. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate ticked up to 6.75% last week from 6.67% the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Turns out, Treasury yields and broader economic pressures have more say here than the Fed’s tweaks. “Mortgage rates have gone up—not down—since the Fed started cutting interest rates in September,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. With long-term bond yields surging thanks to fewer anticipated rate cuts in 2025, mortgage rates remain pinned close to 7%. For homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages, this means no immediate changes—unless they refinance or sell and jump into a new loan. But buyers looking to lock in a 30-year mortgage might catch a tiny break. A $350,000 loan at 6.6% would cost $56 less per month compared to November’s 6.84% peak. Over 30 years, that’s a savings of $20,160, according to LendingTree senior economic analyst Jacob Channel. Not exactly game-changing, but every penny counts when rates are this high. Student loans and savings accounts: Mixed bag Federal student loan borrowers won’t feel a thing from these cuts. Those rates are fixed, locked in at disbursement, and untouched by the Fed’s moves. Private student loans, however, are a different story. Variable-rate loans tied to benchmarks like the Treasury bill will eventually fall, shaving a few bucks off monthly payments. Mark Kantrowitz, a higher education finance expert, estimates that a 25-basis-point rate cut would reduce monthly payments on a 10-year private student loan by just $1 to $1.25. Not much to write home about. Refinancing into fixed-rate private loans could help borrowers save more down the line, but it’s a gamble. You’d be trading federal loan protections—like income-driven repayment and forgiveness programs—for a lower rate. That’s a tough call in this economy. For savers, the picture’s a bit brighter. Online savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) continue to flaunt competitive rates, thanks to the Fed’s earlier rate hikes. Top-yielding savings accounts are still paying up to 5% annual percentage yield (APY), a figure not seen in nearly 20 years. CDs aren’t far behind, with some one-year terms offering over 4.5%. McBride says these slower rate cuts are good news for savers. “The most competitive yields on savings accounts and CDs still outpace inflation,” he noted. Translation? If you’re parking cash, you’re winning. If you’re borrowing, not so much. The balancing act continues The Fed’s statement wasn’t all about cuts. It also reiterated that the risks to achieving inflation and employment goals are “roughly in balance.” The committee emphasized its data-driven approach, vowing to assess incoming numbers and evolving risks before making further moves. For now, the Fed’s cautious tone signals a wait-and-see approach. Whether more cuts are on the horizon depends on how the economy shapes up in the coming months. But one thing’s clear: This isn’t a free pass to assume rates will plummet anytime soon.

Market participants had fully expected Wednesday's move by the central bank, but recent data had shown continued solid economic growth and perky inflation. This turned the focus today to the policy statement, updated economic projections and the upcoming press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell for clues about the Fed's thinking on future policy actions.    The Fed's quarterly economic projections — which include the ""dot plot"" indicating where the central bank expects the Fed funds rate to land over time — reveal that policymakers expect the Fed funds rate to decline to 3.9% by year-end 2025 or another 50 basis points in rate cuts next year. That's higher than the 3.4% projected in September, signaling a less dovish monetary policy in 2025. Fed members' projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) and core PCE inflation for next year rose to 2.5% from September's forecast of 2.1% and 2.2%, respectively.    Already lower in the session, the price of bitcoin (BTC) turned lower from $104,000 following the announcement, dipping to around $101,000 as Fed Chair Jerome Powell's spoke to the press, down nearly 5% over the past 24 hours. Smaller cryptos tumbled even more, with XRP, Cardano's ADA, Litecoin's LTC nearly 10% down. The S&P 500 index also fell to a session low on Wednesday.     During the press conference following the FOMC decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the projected slower path of further rate cuts is a reflection of hotter inflation readings in previous months and higher inflation expectations for next year.    ""We are closer to the neutral rate, which is another reason about further moves,"" Powell added.   Powell, replying to a reporter question about the idea of the government establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve under Donald Trump's presidency, said that the Fed is ""not allowed to own bitcoin"" per the Federal Reserve Act and isn't looking for a law change.    “I think the biggest headache for the Fed right now is the fact that financial conditions have still tightened despite the Fed cutting rates,"" Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, told CoinDesk prior to today's action. ""Long bond yields and mortgage rates have increased since September and the dollar has appreciated which also implies a tightening in financial conditions.""    “A continued appreciation of the US dollar also poses a macro risk for bitcoin since dollar appreciation is associated with global money supply contraction as well which tends to be bad for bitcoin and other crypto assets,"" Dragosch continued. ""In fact, Fed net liquidity continues to decrease. Tightening liquidity and strong dollar is also the biggest risk for BTC in my view … On the other hand, on-chain factors for BTC continue to be very supportive, in particular the ongoing decline in exchange balances which supports the hypothesis that the BTC supply deficit continues to intensify.""

37813537,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320653,1734549046,Warning for PEPE Holders: Massive Supply Zone Could Trigger Price Collapse,"PEPE has dropped by 7% in the past 24 hours, with the meme token falling to $0.00002168 as the crypto market as a whole loses 4% today. This puts PEPE down by 8% in a week, although the coin remains up by 4% in a fortnight and by a whopping 1,600% in the past year. In-and-out-of-the-money data suggests that the token has been facing selling pressure whenever it has risen substantially in recent days, with over 21 trillion PEPE bought in a range between $0.000021 and $0.000024. This partly explains why PEPE has suffered more than other alts, although just because many holders may soon enter profit doesn’t necessarily mean they will all take this profit anytime soon. Warning for PEPE Holders: Massive Supply Zone Could Trigger Price Collapse To put things into context, IntoTheBlock data shows that just over 140 trillion PEPE is currently sitting in profit, compared to around 55 trillion PEPE out of profit. In other words, PEPE has already been facing potential selling pressure for a while, particularly since it crossed the $0.000020 threshold. Source: IntoTheBlock As such, holders shouldn’t assume they have anything more to fear from a move towards $0.000024 than towards $0.000022 or $0.000023. Indeed, while profit-taking may have been a factor in PEPE’s overnight decline, it has dropped largely in step with the rest of the market, which is also down today.

Its chart today shows that it has hit a bottom after a run of recent losses, with its relative strength index (purple) plunging below 30 earlier this morning, before beginning to rise again. At the same time, its 30-period moving average (orange) has reached a very low level in relation to the longer term 200-period average (blue), providing further ammunition for the view that PEPE should rebound very soon.

37810798,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313288,1734548841,NFTMozaic Secures Web3 Foundation Grant To Unite and Elevate Polkadot’s NFT Ecosystem,"December 18, 2024 – Singapore, Singapore NFTMozaic , the newest project to hit the Polkadot ecosystem, has been awarded a Decentralized Futures grant by the Web3 Foundation to establish Polkadot as the leading ecosystem for NFT-related projects and initiatives. What is NFTMozaic NFTMozaic aims to redefine the NFT landscape by aligning and defining one common vision of success for NFTs in the Polkadot ecosystem. With the support of a Decentralized Futures grant, NFTMozaic will play a pivotal role in driving NFT growth and adoption across the Polkadot network, ultimately becoming the go-to Polkadot NFT alliance hub for projects. NFTMozaic will focus on four strategic pillars – g overnance, technical development, business development and marketing initiatives. Unique Network – the first NFT parachain on Polkadot since 2021 – is the core initiator of NFTMozaic, aiming to expand opportunities, drive NFT innovation and work toward a path to decentralization. Since its initial inception, Alexandar Mitrovich, co-founder of Unique Network, introduced NFTMozaic (previously known as the NFT Collective) in November 2023, with the goal of “creating the common front to represent Polkadot NFT interests and improve the traction for everyone.” By leveraging the superior technology of Polkadot and Substrate, Unique Network has been able to achieve the fastest NFT mint of 100,000 NFTs in under 19 minutes. In addition, the team launched a test developer environment for developers and parachains to test NFT transfers via NFT XCM (cross-chain NFTs). NFTMozaic will work alongside projects and parachains within the ecosystem to drive the success of NFTs on Polkadot – collaborating with key Polkadot builders and developers, Web3 Foundation, Parity, OpenGov experts and community agents . In the coming weeks, NFTMozaic will have one-on-one talks and discussions with NFT projects to further align with their goals, current strengths and challenges. Vision for 2025 As NFTMozaic gains momentum, its goals for 2025 include creating a unified technical toolset for NFT developers, increasing the number of NFT-focused DApps (decentralized applications) and user engagement within the ecosystem, and curating a clear marketing narrative for Polkadot NFTs. Mitrovich said, “We’ve been heavily focused on creating a stronger message and a unified NFT front on Polkadot for over a year, and we’re excited to now introduce NFTMozaic as the go-to alliance hub for everyone in the Polkadot ecosystem – d riven by NFT experts and created for you.” About NFTMozaic NFTMozaic plans to build a comprehensive framework to improve the experience for developers, projects and users in the Polkadot NFT space – serving as a single point of contact for new projects looking to integrate NFTs into the ecosystem.

In a new interview on Yahoo Finance, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says that if the US government implements a Bitcoin strategic reserve other governments around the world would have to follow suit, sending the flagship crypto asset to astronomical new all-time highs. “If we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin – and there’s a bill from Senator Lummis that [would have] the government buy a million Bitcoin – $200,000 Bitcoin is going to be looking quaint. You’re going to be looking at $300,000, $400,000, $500,000 Bitcoin. It’s just too big a story, because governments all around the world would have to do it.” Hougan believes a Bitcoin strategic reserve has become more likely under US president-elect Donald Trump and his administration. “When this initial idea was floated, I was somewhat skeptical of it. But over the months, it hasn’t gone away. In fact, we continue to see leaders in the Trump administration suggest that they’re open to it. I still think maybe it’s less than a 50% chance, but it’s not zero. And again, if it happens, or if we start to see it happening in other countries, you’re going to see a rip up in Bitcoin that will make 2024 look pretty docile in comparison.” Hougan says that Bitcoin will be up more than 91% of its current value at the same time next year due to ‘irrepressible’ demand. “We expect Bitcoin to be up above $200,000 by this time next year. They’re just three irrepressible sources of demand driving the market. You have ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that are vacuuming up Bitcoin. You have public companies like MicroStrategy vacuuming up Bitcoin. And now we’re talking about governments vacuuming up Bitcoin. At the end of the day it comes down to supply and demand. There’s too much demand, not enough supply. And so I think the price goes higher in 2025.” Bitcoin is trading for $104,532 at time of writing, down 2.5% in the last 24 hours.

37810709,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394870,1734548697,Just In: Fed Slashes Interest Rates By 25 bps,"The post Just In: Fed Slashes Interest Rates By 25 bps appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The US Federal Reserve has finally announced its eighth and last policy decision for 2024 after a two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. It has cut interest rates by 25 bps to 4.5%-4.75%, aligning with market expectations. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since a 0.5% reduction in September. It also scaled down the number of cuts it expects to make next year. The consensus among Fed officials is for three rate cuts next year, down from four previously forecasted in September. Notably, Wall Street had expected the central bank to slash the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) for the second straight meeting after lowering it to 4.50 to 4.75 percent in November. Markets were confident in a rate reduction, with CME Group’s FedWatch tool indicating a 99% probability. The last policy verdict by the central bank came just after Republican Donald Trump secured a landslide victory in the 2024 US presidential elections. In the September meeting, the US Fed slashed the benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 percent to 5 percent for the first time in four years after policymakers expressed confidence that inflation was consistently on track to come near the target level. Fed Not In A Hurry To Slash Rates The US Fed policymakers estimate the benchmark interest rate falling by another half-point by the end of this year, another full percentage point in 2025, and a final half-point reduction in 2026 to end in a 2.75 percent-3.00 percent range. The Fed Chair Chairman, Jerome Powell, had earlier indicated that the committee is in no hurry to reduce the key benchmark interest rates and that the committee will be more careful in the rate cut approach. Also, earlier, Goldman analysts referenced a speech by Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, where she stated that resilient growth, a strong labor market, and elevated inflation justify maintaining a modestly restrictive monetary policy for some time, as it could help to “sustainably return inflation to 2 percent in a timely fashion.” Impact On Crypto “While a rate cut is undoubtedly favorable for Bitcoin’s price, the market appears to have already priced in a 25 basis point cut in December,” Min Jung, research analyst at Presto Labs, noted. He added that, as a result, the actual rate cut may have a minimal direct impact on Bitcoin’s price. Jung emphasized that attention will turn to the December FOMC meeting’s Summary of Economic Projections and comments from Powell on future rate cuts. He noted that any unexpected developments or surprises from these factors will likely be the key drivers of Bitcoin’s price action. The rate cut comes just weeks before Trump’s inauguration, which could spark further rallies in the crypto market, particularly if the president-elect implements the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Just recently, Bitcoin (BTC) paused after hitting an all-time high of $108,268 as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s anticipated interest rate cut and optimism from strategic Bitcoin reserve plans.

FED Announced Interest Rate Decision! Here is Bitcoin’s First Reaction,"The FED announced its interest rate decision, which was eagerly awaited by all markets. As expected, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Now, all eyes will be on the meeting to be held by FED Chairman Jerome Powell at 22:30 (30 minutes later). As Bitcoinsistemi.com, we will also broadcast this speech live. Here are the first reactions from Bitcoin after the decision: FED FOMC statement: Cleveland Fed President Hammack opposed the interest rate decision and supported not cutting rates. The Fed will evaluate data regarding the scope and timing of future actions. Fed officials expect inflation to reach 2% in 2027, while that figure was previously forecast for 2026. It was confirmed that labor market risks and inflation targets remain roughly in balance. The US Federal Reserve (FOMC) raised its median forecast for personal consumption expenditures inflation to 2.5% in 2025, from 2.1% in September. The Fed's dot plot shows the median estimate for the federal funds rate at the end of 2026 is 3.4%. (September's estimate was 2.9%) Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who voted at this month’s meeting, said earlier in the month, “We are at or near the point where it makes sense to slow the pace of rate cuts.” Hammack said she believes the central bank may have lowered interest rates enough to approach what is called a “neutral rate,” where interest rates are at the level best suited to spur sustained economic growth without fueling inflation. Related News: Investment Company CIO Announces Bitcoin Price Prediction: “If This Happens, Even $200,000 Will Look Strange” Former Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said he would oppose a rate cut at this meeting if he were still at the central bank because the policies President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on risked causing inflation to rise again. “Lower taxes, immigration and tariffs (are) all likely to be inflationary,” he told CNBC this week. “We don’t know the magnitude of those changes. The policy hasn’t been articulated very clearly yet, but the direction is certainly going to make it harder to hit the Fed’s 2% inflation target.” *This is not investment advice.

In the last ten years, U.S. markets added a massive $40 trillion. No other country even comes close. Right now, America’s stock market controls 74% of the MSCI World Index, blowing past the record set in the 1970s. In just four years, U.S. equities have doubled in value, raking in $32 trillion. Meanwhile, stock markets in the rest of the world barely moved, adding just $10 trillion. The gap between the U.S. and the rest isn’t just wide—it’s historic. U.S. markets break records with tech leading the way What’s driving all this growth? Tech stocks. Companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon have been powering the U.S. markets, making up more than half of the S&P 500’s gains in 2024 alone. The Nasdaq Composite has gone through the roof thanks to these tech giants, with valuations reaching levels no one thought possible. But it’s not just tech anymore. The rally that used to rely on a few big-name companies has spread to other industries. Consumer goods, financials, and energy stocks have all jumped in, showing this is no longer just about Silicon Valley. This year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average blew past 40,000 for the first time ever. The S&P 500? It smashed through 24 new all-time highs in 2024. The market’s growth is being fueled by expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon cut interest rates. Investors are so confident in a 25-basis-point rate reduction that futures markets are pricing in a 97% chance it’s happening. Inflation is cooling, borrowing costs are expected to drop, and Wall Street is swimming in cash looking for a home. Strong corporate earnings are adding even more fuel to the fire. Despite global challenges, American companies have been consistently posting solid results quarter after quarter. Analysts say this steady performance has been critical in keeping investor confidence high, even during times of geopolitical tension and volatility in other markets. America’s markets leave the world far behind The rest of the world? They’re not even close. Altogether, equity markets outside the U.S. are worth $61 trillion—still less than America’s total on its own. Over the last ten years, global equity markets outside the U.S. have been crawling, with their total value growing at less than half the pace of America’s. Even major players like Japan and Europe are far behind. Sure, the Nikkei and FTSE have seen gains, but those gains look tiny next to the flood of capital that’s been pouring into U.S. markets. Investors everywhere are throwing money into American stocks. Why? Simply because U.S. markets are reliable and deliver results. Other markets just don’t have the same opportunities for growth. Whether it’s slow economies, unstable governments, or weak corporate profits, the rest of the world can’t keep up. America’s stock market is pulling further and further ahead.

In contrast, Solana’s technical advantages, particularly its speed and cost-efficiency, make it the go-to choice for developers in the DeFi and NFT sectors. Why is Ethereum underperforming in 2024? Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its fixed supply and carefully regulated inflation mechanisms, which offer unmatched security, stability, and predictability. On the other hand, Ethereum faces challenges with its net issuance due to a significant reduction in gas fee burns. According to recent findings from CoinShares , the growth of layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism has diverted significant activity away from Ethereum’s core layer-1 network. This shift has drastically decreased ETH supply burns, undermining Ethereum’s once-praised deflationary model. In addition, other L1s, particularly Solana, have surged ahead with faster transaction speeds and reduced costs, attracting a growing user base. As of October, the number of monthly active wallets on Solana hit 138 million , a 245% increase since August. Alongside this growth, Solana’s total value locked saw significant gains, capturing 2.7% of Ethereum’s TVL inflows year-to-date. In contrast, Ethereum has struggled, registering net outflows amounting to $6 billion in 2024. Beyond Solana, another emerging Ethereum alternative is making headlines with its recent market launch. Enhanced on-chain speed and scalability: Graphite vs. Ethereum vs. Solana Graphite Network has introduced its proprietary L1 blockchain platform, designed to handle high transaction volumes with a capacity of up to 1,400 transactions per second and confirmation times of less than 10 seconds, a performance that significantly surpasses Ethereum’s limited transaction speeds, which hover around 15-20 tps. Graphite’s transaction model also maintains a clear fee rate, allowing users to predict their expenses upfront and avoid scenarios similar to Ethereum’s “gas bidding wars” during block sealing. Additionally, Graphite’s Ethereum-compatible virtual machines simplify the transition of Solidity smart contracts onto the network, allowing developers to scale their existing decentralized applications without the extra resources required to build on blockchains like Solana. Why Graphite is not just another L1 Graphite utilizes a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus model and the Polymer 2.0 algorithm, thus relying on a network of trusted, authorized nodes for validating blocks. This approach dramatically improves operational efficiency by minimizing the energy and computational requirements typically associated with traditional Proof-of-Work systems. Graphite’s transaction model offers a passive income opportunity for entry-point (transport) nodes, a feature that sets it apart from other blockchains, where only resource-intensive validator nodes earn rewards. Transport node operators will receive 50% of the transaction fees processed through their nodes, while the other 50% will go to block sealers. By making it feasible for nearly any participant to earn from operating an entry-point node without extensive server demands, Graphite democratizes blockchain access and creates an ecosystem where any user contributing to the network’s functionality is equitably rewarded. On top of that, Graphite is pioneering a reputation-based approach within the blockchain space, bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with the core mechanics of web3. Central to this vision is a set of features that establish a secure and trust-oriented blockchain environment. Its account activation feature enforces a “One User, One Account” policy, preventing the creation of multiple disposable wallets, which are often linked to fraudulent behavior. Through its multi-layered KYC verification , Graphite helps individuals and businesses balance privacy needs with the requirement for transparency. The KYC transaction filters enable users to apply KYC-based transaction filters, giving them control over who they interact with. And the Trust Score system assigns a credibility rating to each account, ensuring a secure and trustworthy network environment. Graphite prioritizes both privacy and reputation by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof technology to verify data for decentralized applications without exposing the data itself while keeping all KYC processes off-chain. The network’s KYC requirements are designed to be far less intrusive compared to those in TradFi, allowing blockchain users to maintain a level of anonymity that aligns with their expectations. Graphite will also implement tagged addresses, which allow users to label wallets linked to specific entities. This ensures proper fund usage while making any misuse instantly detectable on the blockchain. Moreover, Graphite’s smart ticker system appends the @G symbol to all coins integrated with its blockchain. This mechanism provides a seamless method for network identification and promoting ecosystem clarity. A new era of trust in blockchain From a global perspective, Ethereum’s current challenges are part of a broader evolution in the blockchain industry, where other L1 networks like Graphite are creating new entry points for mass audiences. Graphite Network addresses not only Ethereum’s scalability and cost limitations but also creates a trust-driven, user-centric blockchain environment.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Critics note the irony, as Coinbase itself faces numerous regulatory investigations. On December 17, Coinbase filed a response to a lawsuit from BiT Global, which accused the exchange of harming the wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) market by delisting the token from its platform in November. Coinbase Quotes ‘Unacceptable Risk’ The crypto community as it is lashing out against Coinbase’s reasoning for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) after the exchange linked the decision to the “unacceptable risk” associated with Tron founder Justin Sun. Coinbase referenced concerns about Sun in its filing, citing allegations of financial misconduct and ongoing regulatory investigations as reasons for the delisting. The exchange doubted BiT Global’s credibility, highlighting the firm’s linkage to Sun. 2/3 pic.twitter.com/L1svxZRFPC — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 17, 2024 “At the conclusion of its diligence, Coinbase concluded that Mr. Sun’s affiliation with—and potential control over—wBTC presented an unacceptable risk to its customers and the integrity of its exchange,” the filing said. The explanation sparked sharp criticism within the crypto community, with many questioning the sufficiency of Coinbase’s legal and technical justification for the move. Bit Global Says Delisting Was Illegal BiT Global, in its lawsuit filed on December 13, argues that the delisting was illegal and would irreparably damage WBTC’s economics. The lawsuit also criticized Coinbase for listing other tokens, including meme coins, which BiT Global claims are less relevant than WBTC. BiT argued that COIN’s launch of its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC, breaches antitrust laws and could lead to a monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin market, that could stifle competition. The exchange contended that its internal process led to the decision to delist WBTC due to concerns that its connection with Sun could harm the platform’s security and customer trust. Critics Note The Irony Bitcoin enthusiasts and critics of the exchange, such as the notable figure Pledditor, have rebuked the exchange’s actions, accusing it of relying on a weak rationale to delist WBTC. While Coinbase gave their reason in a court filing today as to why they delisted wBTC, Pledditor noted that “it’s basically just they don’t like Justin Sun. They don’t give any technical or legal arguments about why wBTC can’t be listed.” “It’s just guilt by association,” he added. So in a court filing today, @Coinbase gave their reason why they delisted wBTC, and it's basically just they don't like Justin Sun. That's really just it.

Sun, who has been the target of multiple regulatory investigations, is facing charges from the U.S. SEC for alleged violations, including fraud. Furthermore, VanEck adviser Gabor Gurbacs highlighted the irony that Coinbase is treating Justin Sun this way. “Coinbase itself is under SEC and numerous other investigations, probably many more than Justin and his businesses. Questioning someone’s reputation this way might just bring out skeletons from their own closet,” he remarked. It’s ironic that @coinbase is treating @justinsuntron this way.

According to analysts, MiCA-compliant stablecoins dominated the European stablecoin market share in 2024. A report by Kaiko and Bitvavo highlighted that MiCA-compliant stablecoins have captured Europe’s stablecoin market share. The researchers suggested that Coinbase largely drove the shift after promoting compliant assets. MiCA-compliant stablecoins take over European crypto market In a new report, Kaiko analysts highlighted Europe’s growing demand for cryptocurrencies. The research firm revealed rising euro-dominated trading volumes in 2024 signaled increased investor interest in the market. Kaiko, in collaboration with Bitvavo, noted that euro-dominated trading volumes experienced their peaks in March and November. According to the analysts, November saw a weekly euro-dominated trade volume surge to over €10 billion. They attributed the rise to Bitcoin’s all-time high after the US general elections, which had a ripple effect across global markets. EU Stablecoin compliance – Source: Kaiko and Bitvavo The researchers also examined the euro’s role in global crypto adoption and region-specific dynamics that may have fueled the widespread adoption of stablecoins. According to the firm, the Euro was the third most traded fiat currency in the crypto market in 2024 after the US dollar and the Korean Won. The researchers also noted a shift in the European stablecoin market. Kaiko analysts commented that euro-backed stablecoins experienced over $300 million in monthly volumes in 2024. They speculated the surge resulted from EURI stablecoin from Banking Circle after it was listed on Binance. According to Kaiko analysts, MiCA complaint stablecoins also surged in 2024, especially after the June enactment of the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA ). The MiCA regulation outlines the compliance standards for electronic money and asset-referenced tokens and is expected to be finalized by December 30, 2024. The regulation reportedly aims to protect consumers in the European market and promote innovation. The Kaiko researchers commented the regulations have established a stable framework for investors in Europe, boosting long-term institutional interest. They also noted the regulation led to exchanges delisting non-compliant stablecoins. For instance, they said Tether cited regulatory concerns in its November announcement that it would scrap off Euro-pegged stablecoins ahead of MiCA’s full implementation. As a result, they highlighted that assets such as Societe Generale’s EURCV and Circle’s EURC dominated over 90% of the market share by November 2024. Coinbase overtakes Binance as the leading market for EUR stablecoins Kaiko research analysts, in an October report , noted that Coinbase overtook Binance as the leading platform for euro-backed stablecoins trading in August. The analysts revealed that while Coinbase promoted MiCA-compliant assets, Binance promoted non-compliant Euro stablecoins for non-European traders using its zero-fee model. Coinbase later announced it would delist all non-compliant stablecoins from its platform by December 31st, 2024. The company pointed out the move was in compliance with MiCA’s stablecoin guidelines, which required issuers to acquire e-money authorization in at least one EU country. Kiako analysts also suggested that MiCA regulation could positively influence USD-backed stablecoins, such as USDC. They suggested the delisting of non-compliant stablecoins would lead to their widespread adoption beyond Europe, increasing their market shares. Kaiko analysts noted MiCA affected Decentralised exchanges(DeXs) outside Europe’s regulatory framework. They attributed this to the increased usage of USDT on DEXs as users sought assets not governed by MiCA to access liquidity. The analysts reported the trend was noticed on Uniswap, where USDT volume increased as opposed to USDC’s.

The decentralized finance protocol has submitted a proposal to add sUSDe to World Liberty Financial’s upcoming Aave instance. If approved by the community, the staked stable token will become a core collateral asset for users. Ethena sUSDe is the staked version of its ( USDE ) coin, a synthetic dollar backed by leveraged positions underpinned by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and staked Ethereum ( stETH ). The token’s mechanics involve simultaneously longing and shorting other assets, maintaining its dollar peg through the net effect. Users have deposited nearly $6 billion into USDe, according to total value locked data from DefiLlama. You might also like: Ethena officially launches USDtb, stablecoin backed by BlackRock Ethena Labs stated that integrating sUSDe into World Liberty Financial (WLFI) would provide several benefits for users, including accruing sUSDe rewards to enhance native WLFI gains. The Trump-endorsed WLFI protocol enables DeFi users to borrow and lend assets on-chain while earning yield for participation. According to Ethena Labs, introducing sUSDe to WLFI via Aave’s Core instance would boost stablecoin liquidity and user engagement. sUSDe has had an effective multiplier effect on rates across Aave markets: currently, $1B of sUSDe onboarded to Aave Core have almost doubled the supply rates on over $5 billion of USDC, USDT, and USDS liquidity… With sUSDe, the platform can capture a broader range of users seeking higher on-chain reward rates, diversifying its user base but also solidifying World Liberty Financial’s position as a premier destination for stablecoin lending and borrowing while growing core metrics like TVL. Ethena Labs proposal The proposal to connect sUSDe and WLFI is subject to the Aave protocol activating its lending contracts on World Liberty Financial. Aave governance members voted in favor of deploying Aave v3 on WLFI via a vote concluded on Dec. 13. Ethena Labs has also partnered with BlackRock and Securitize to launch USDtb, a dollar stablecoin primarily backed by tokenized money market BUIDL, which invests in U.S. government-issued debt such as Treasury Bills. USDtb functions like a traditional stablecoin such as USDC or USDT, utilizing cash and cash-equivalent reserve assets to back each token Blackrock's BUIDL represents the vast majority of the USDtb backing, currently the highest BUIDL allocation of any stablecoin in the market… — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 16, 2024 Read more: News Ethena and Securitize team up in $1b tokenization contest",POSITIVE,BTC,AAVE | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | ENA,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/ethena-labs-proposes-collab-with-trump-backed-wlfi/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37809789.jpeg

37809683,https://crypto.news/?p=14320516,1734546710,MicroStrategy is a ‘desperate’ Ponzi scheme: analyst,"Analyst Jacob King has labeled MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused business model a “giant scam,” claiming it is unsustainable and destined for collapse. King, a contributor to the Whalewire newsletter, issued this critique of MicroStrategy in a detailed post on X. King argued that MicroStrategy’s strategy of issuing bonds to buy Bitcoin ( BTC ) is a “giant Ponzi scheme.” King explained that the company’s model relies on a feedback loop: issuing debt or equity to purchase Bitcoin drives up the cryptocurrency’s price, which in turn increases MicroStrategy’s market capitalization. MicroStrategy’s business model is a giant scam and relies on a reflexive loop: it issues debt or equity to buy BTC, which drives BTC’s price higher.

With a higher valuation, it issues… pic.twitter.com/Owyi7mCHaO — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 17, 2024 This higher valuation allows the company to raise more capital, enabling further Bitcoin purchases. King warned that the entire cycle depends on Bitcoin’s price continuing to rise. “When Bitcoin stagnates or crashes—watch the entire structure collapse,” King wrote. He compared MicroStrategy’s dependence on Bitcoin’s value to an addict’s reliance on their supply, describing the approach as “pure desperation.” You might also like: Crypto.com drops SEC lawsuit after Trump meeting Michael Saylor’s duplicitous stance on Bitcoin King’s criticism extended to Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s co-founder and executive chairman. He accused Saylor of tying the company’s future to an unsustainable strategy and highlighted the stark contrast between Saylor’s current enthusiasm for Bitcoin and his earlier skepticism. “In 2013, [Saylor] dismissed Bitcoin as ‘useless,’” King stated. “Now, he has tied MicroStrategy’s entire future to an unsustainable feedback loop dependent on perpetual price increases.” The analyst went further, suggesting that MicroStrategy’s collapse could surpass financial scandals such as FTX and Enron. MicroStrategy has consistently defended its Bitcoin-centric strategy, arguing that it provides long-term value for shareholders. King’s critique comes as Bitcoin trades at $104,300, reflecting a surge in its value.

37809967,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-com-withdraws-lawsuit-against-us-sec/,1734546423,Crypto.com Withdraws Lawsuit Against US SEC,"Crypto.com has decided to drop its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This announcement came soon after a meeting between the exchange’s CEO, Kris Marszalek, and President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on December 16. This change could indicate that the exchange wants to work more closely with the new administration. Crypto.com to Work Closely With the New Trump Administration Crypto.com has filed a lawsuit to challenge the SEC’s decision to classify some digital assets as securities. This has sparked debates in the crypto industry. However, analysts believe the meeting between Crypto.com’s CEO and Trump may have influenced this decision. Trump has shown interest in promoting technological innovation and has indicated he supports the growth of the crypto and blockchain sectors. This shift contrasts sharply with the SEC’s traditionally strict oversight, often criticized for stifling innovation. With the lawsuit dropped, Crypto.com wants to work closely with the new government, influencing future rules that benefit the industry. Legal experts say that building this relationship could give the exchange a smart advantage as it tries to grow its business in the United States. Details of Crypto.com Lawsuit Against the SEC In October, the cryptocurrency exchange filed a lawsuit against the SEC, Gary Gensler , and the agency’s four commissioners. This legal action came in response to a Wells Notice, a preliminary warning indicating potential charges from the regulator. Crypto.com affirmed it is determined to challenge what it perceived as an unlawful expansion of SEC jurisdiction over its operations. In another statement, the exchange emphasized its commitment to maintaining safety , security, and compliance since its funding in 2016. The exchange boasts an impressive portfolio of over 100 regulatory approvals across various jurisdictions, including Ireland, South Korea, and the Netherlands. Crypto.com also filed a petition with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a separate initiative. A New Era for Crypto Policy If Trump fulfills his promise, the United States will have its first presidential council focused on cryptocurrency. Experts like Kristin Smith from the Blockchain Association believe it could happen quickly, changing how the government works with digital assets. Recall that Trump’s pro-crypto stance has boosted Bitcoin to record highs and reignited hopes for a $100,000 milestone . His promises to ease banking restrictions and treat crypto as a strategic asset have supported him in the sector. However, consumer groups caution against letting the industry regulate itself, a concern that may influence the council’s structure and agenda .

Nosov explained that the exchange grew by over 500%, with new offices in various parts of the world, over 1,100 employees, and partnerships with prominent brands, including FC Barcelona, ​​Turkish FC Trabzonspor, the Ukrainian National Football Team, VISA, and ESL Faceit. Additionally, WhiteBIT’s CEO announced in interview for Coingape that the company also plans to enter the American market: “Entering the U.S. is not just about geography—it’s about meeting high regulatory standards. We’ve spent time researching the market and tailoring our strategies to comply with local regulations. This ensures we’re offering products that meet the expectations of both institutional investors and private traders in the U.S.” The WhiteBIT Group’s growth is also reflected in its user base, which reaches over 30 million clients. Their core cryptocurrency exchange serves about 5.5 million users, with 1 million joining in 2023 alone. It handles a daily trading volume of $11 billion on the spot market and $40 billion on the futures market, which resulted in CoinGecko ranking it among the TOP-10 on futures market rating. Furthermore, CoinGecko also ranked in the TOP-2 for its website traffic, as it handles a base of 33 million users and over 1,000 institutional clients. Expanding WhiteBIT’s reach Volodymyr Nosov also stressed that the company has expanded from a startup to a prominent blockchain enterprise, which encompasses both the centralized WhiteBIT crypto exchange and the decentralized WhiteSwap exchange, Whitepay crypto-acquiring solution, the white.market marketplace, the Whitechain blockchain, and the WB Soul Ecosystem to power it. Lastly, the blockchain holding offers the WhiteEX physical cards for crypto balance top-ups, the native WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ), the G.N. News portal, the Pocket Rocket game, and the BiHy entertainment and educational YouTube channel. Nosov added: “This year, we launched WhitePool, a mining pool that quickly became one of the top global players in terms of hash rate. Within just months of its debut, it achieved a hash rate of 7 EH/s and, in October alone, mined six blocks worth over $1.2 million.” He also commended the platform’s native token: “WBT’s performance speaks volumes about its potential. This fall, it grew by 63.5%, surpassing $20* in value. This reflects both organic interest and active usage, and we’re excited to see how it continues to grow.” WhiteBIT’s CEO further highlighted the efforts to grow the exchange and expressed confidence in continued expansion.

37809372,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375192,1734546160,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Drops by 15% in 2 Weeks: These Factors Suggest Extended Correction,"TL;DR Shiba Inu’s price has fallen substantially lately, with declining burn rates and large transaction volumes signaling continued bearish momentum. On the other hand, reduced exchange reserves and SHIB’s RSI nearing oversold territory suggest that a potential rebound may be on the horizon. The Bad Days for the Bulls Might Not be Over The past two weeks have been quite successful for most leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin (BTC), for instance, saw its price surging by 10%, while Ethereum (ETH) pumped by 4%. However, some assets have not performed so well . The popular meme coin Shiba Inu is among the biggest losers, with its valuation plummeting by over 15% for that period. Currently, it trades at around $0.00002575 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 6% decline on a daily scale. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Some factors and on-chain metrics signal that the bears might continue to prevail in the near future . One example is the red wave going through the entire meme coin sector. The market capitalization of the niche is down 4% in the last 24 hours, with well-known assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), dogwifhat (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), Floki Inu (FLOKI), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and many more charting substantial losses. Another element worth mentioning is Shiba Inu’s burning mechanism. Data shows that the burn rate has decreased by almost 70% in the past week, resulting in just 128 million tokens sent to a null address. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the tremendous supply of SHIB, making it more scarce and potentially more valuable (assuming demand doesn’t head south). The Shiba Inu team and community have burned more than 410 trillion tokens since adopting the mechanism. However, the circulating supply remains quite significant, equaling approximately 589 trillion SHIB. Last but not least , we will focus on Shiba Inu’s large transaction volume (a momentum indicator showing the number of transactions greater than $100,000). According to IntoTheBlock, the metric is down 4.2%, entering bearish territory. It’s Not All Doom and Gloom On the other hand, there are some indicators that suggest SHIB could soon return to the green track. An example is the Shiba Inu exchange reserve, which, according to CryptoQuant, has recently plummeted to levels last seen in the spring of 2021. The development signals a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which could be considered bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. Last but not least , we will touch upon SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI). The technical analysis tool measures the speed and change of price movements, varying from 0 to 100. It helps traders identify oversold or overbought conditions, with readings below 30 suggesting a potential buying opportunity. SHIB’s RSI has been on a downtrend in the last week, currently standing slightly above the bullish zone.

37809283,https://nulltx.com/?p=135957,1734545930,This Altcoin Could Outshine Usual and Chainlink,"This Altcoin Could Outshine Usual and Chainlink in the Coming Rally As the cryptocurrency market prepares for the next major bull rally, all eyes are on the most promising altcoins. While Chainlink has been a consistent player and Usual brings innovation with its decentralized fiat stablecoin model, there’s a rising star capturing the market’s attention— FX Guys. Powered by its native $FXG token, FX Guys offers unique advantages that make it a serious contender in the crypto space. With an ecosystem built on Trade2Earn, staking, and an innovative Trader Funding Program, FX Guys could easily outshine established projects like Chainlink and emerging protocols like Usual in the coming rally. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE The Case for Chainlink: Reliable but Stagnant Chainlink has become synonymous with decentralized oracles, providing essential services for DeFi projects. However, its focus on one niche limits its adaptability in a rapidly evolving market. While Chainlink remains a strong asset, its growth potential may be overshadowed by innovative projects that offer diversified ecosystems. Usual’s Innovative Approach: A Strong Contender Usual is a decentralized fiat stablecoin issuer, leveraging its governance token $USUAL to empower users with ownership and control over its ecosystem. With a unique revenue-backed model, Usual provides stability through its three-token structure: USD0: A stablecoin fully backed by liquid, risk-free assets. USD0++: A liquid staking token distributing rewards in $USUAL tokens. $USUAL: A governance token tied to the protocol’s revenue model, driving ecosystem growth and incentivizing user participation. While Usual’s approach is innovative, it faces stiff competition from projects that offer a broader suite of financial tools and incentives, like FX Guys. FX Guys: The Altcoin Positioned to Dominate FX Guys has emerged as a leader in the PropFi and DeFi spaces, focusing on empowering traders and investors. Here’s what sets FX Guys apart: 1. Trade2Earn: Incentivizing Active Participation FX Guys rewards users through its Trade2Earn model, which distributes $FXG tokens to active traders. This innovative approach fosters engagement and creates a sustainable demand for the token. Unlike Chainlink or Usual, FX Guys directly incentivizes users to participate in its ecosystem. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE 2. Trader Funding Program: Empowering the Community The Trader Funding Program is a standout feature, providing skilled traders with access to capital and allowing them to retain up to 80% of their profits. This program creates a win-win scenario, aligning the platform’s success with its users’ profitability. 3. Staking Rewards for Altcoins FX Guys offers robust staking rewards, making it one of the best options for passive income in crypto. By holding and staking $FXG tokens, investors can enjoy consistent returns, a feature that outshines both Chainlink and Usual. 4. Top PropFi Project Recognition As a Top PropFi Project, FX Guys integrates decentralized finance with innovative trading tools, offering unparalleled value to its users. Why FX Guys Could Outperform Usual and Chainlink Broader Utility While Chainlink focuses on oracles and Usual emphasizes stablecoin adoption, FX Guys delivers a comprehensive ecosystem that caters to traders, stakers, and long-term investors alike. Higher Growth Potential With a relatively low market cap, FX Guys has significant room for growth. Projects like Usual, while innovative, may need help to capture mass-market interest due to their niche focus. Sustainability FX Guys ensures sustainability through its user-centric approach, rewarding active participation and fostering community-driven growth. How to Identify Altcoins Ready to Explode To pick winners like FX Guys, consider the following factors: Innovative Features: Look for unique models like Trade2Earn and staking.

37809913,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629850,1734545894,Is MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor joining the Trump administration?,"Michael Saylor, the executive chairman and co-founder of MicroStrategy, might be adding a new title to his repertoire—crypto advisor in Donald Trump’s administration. Saylor has reportedly met with several members of the incoming administration but is keeping tight-lipped about specifics. When asked directly whether he had met Trump, Saylor replied , “I have met with a lot of people in the incoming administration, but I could not comment further than that.” The possibility of him stepping into a government role has gained traction, especially after there are expectations for a crypto advisory council under Trump. “If I’m asked to serve on some digital assets advisory council, I would probably do so,” Saylor said. This aligns with his long-standing commitment to influencing crypto policies both publicly and privately. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin obsession keeps growing While political rumors swirl, Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, continues its Bitcoin-buying spree, making headlines for its aggressive strategy. Over six straight weeks, MicroStrategy has acquired Bitcoin worth $45 billion, solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The timing couldn’t be more perfect, as the company prepares for its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index next week. Interestingly, MicroStrategy’s stock performance this year has outpaced Bitcoin itself, driven by retail investors and hedge funds seizing on market volatility. MicroStrategy’s obsession with Bitcoin is anything but subtle. While the company started as a software firm in 1989, it now operates more like a Bitcoin treasury. Saylor confirmed the shift in focus, saying, “Our primary method of generating shareholder value is through our treasury operations.” In October, MicroStrategy announced plans to raise $42 billion over three years. However, with overwhelming market enthusiasm, Saylor hinted they could hit this target by January. “The equity capital markets were very enthusiastic over the past four weeks,” he said. With $7.2 billion in convertible debt already on their books, the company plans to lean more on fixed-income markets moving forward. Saylor explained that this is meant to build “more intelligent leverage” for the benefit of shareholders. He also addressed how MicroStrategy buys Bitcoin without moving the market. Using regulated exchanges like Coinbase and specialized algorithms, the company ensures its purchases remain discreet. “Our goal is to not be noticed by the market,” he said. Saylor’s view on Bitcoin, accounting rules, and corporate adoption Saylor has long championed Bitcoin as a superior financial asset, but he believes its true potential is just beginning to unfold. Recent regulatory changes and political changes have created a favorable environment for Bitcoin adoption, according to him. He pointed to the November 1st election results, calling them a “sea change” for the industry. With fair value accounting for Bitcoin becoming mandatory in 2025, Saylor expects this to be a turning point for corporate adoption. “For the first time in 100 years, large public companies have a capital asset they can consider in lieu of Treasury bills, and that’s Bitcoin,” he said. The MicroStrategy boss criticized traditional assets like real estate and gold, arguing that Bitcoin is the logical choice for corporate treasuries. He believes these changes could drive more companies to follow MicroStrategy’s lead, although he acknowledged the infamous rejection he got from Microsoft. He recently pitched to their board on investing in Bitcoin. “Microsoft’s strategies are conventional—buying back their own stock and parking cash in Treasuries,” he said. Still, he remains optimistic that broader adoption will come as accounting rules and regulatory clarity improve. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings have already delivered substantial returns. The company has generated $18.6 billion in unrealized investment income this year, and Saylor expects this figure to grow significantly with fair value accounting. By 2025, he projects $10 billion in annual investment income, positioning the company for inclusion in the S&P 500. “When we adopt fair value accounting and Bitcoin goes up 20% a year, we’ll be generating billions annually in investment income,” he explained. MicroStrategy’s controversial identity and shareholder value Despite its transformation into a Bitcoin powerhouse, MicroStrategy hasn’t abandoned its software roots. The company’s software division generates $75 million in annual operating income and remains profitable. Saylor called it a “core part of the company’s identity,” adding that they have no plans to spin it off. However, the numbers speak for themselves: the bulk of shareholder value now comes from Bitcoin-related activities. Saylor broke down the three ways MicroStrategy creates value: operating income, investment income, and acquisition income. This year alone, Bitcoin-related operations have added $14.4 billion in benefits to shareholders. The company’s strategy of issuing equity and debt to acquire Bitcoin has proven highly lucrative, and he sees no reason to slow down. As MicroStrategy prepares for its Nasdaq 100 inclusion, questions remain about its next steps. Saylor hinted that they might explore selling newly issued stock to index trackers, depending on market conditions. “When we execute the ATM, we sell equity into the market if we like the price and terms,” he said.

According to Matt Hougan, CIO of Bitwise Asset Management, this is just the beginning of a phenomenal rally that could take BTC to $200,000 by December 2025 and potentially even higher under certain conditions. Hougan attributes the ongoing rally to three dominant forces driving demand: significant Bitcoin absorption by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public companies like MicroStrategy expanding their holdings, and now the possibility of government adoption. Speaking on the results, Hougan said: “It all comes down to supply and demand. There’s too much demand and not enough supply, so I think the price will go even higher in 2025.” One of the most intriguing catalysts, according to Hougan, is the proposal for a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, an idea reportedly supported by members of the Trump administration. The concept, introduced in a bill by Senator Cynthia Lummis, would involve the government purchasing as many as one million Bitcoins. Hougan suggested that such a move could eclipse current price predictions: “If the government starts buying Bitcoin, $200,000 worth of Bitcoin will look outrageous. Now we’re talking about $300,000, $400,000, even $500,000 worth of Bitcoin.” Related News: FED to Announce Critical Interest Rate Decision, What Will Powell Say Afterward? Here are the Opinions of Moody's Chief Economist While Hougan believes the probability of such a reserve is still less than 50%, he said the proposal is not out of the question. He said there is growing interest in the idea, which could have a global domino effect, forcing other nations to follow suit and significantly increasing the value of Bitcoin. With catalysts like a potential U.S. strategic reserve, increasing institutional adoption, and new opportunities in the public markets, Hougan remains strong on Bitcoin’s future. While 2024 has already seen tremendous growth, he hinted that the real excitement could be just around the corner: “If we see governments or large-scale corporate companies getting into Bitcoin, 2024 will look calmer compared to the years to come.” *This is not investment advice.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Table of Contents DTX Exchange: The gateway to huge ROIs Ripple rides bullish momentum with a 130% surge Solana faces swings amid market consolidation DTX Exchange could outpace Solana and Ripple While Solana (SOL) aims for a possible new all-time high before Christmas and Ripple (XRP) records a rapid 130% monthly climb, a new player — DTX Exchange (DTX) — is quietly creating waves with a booming presale and bullish predictions of 30x returns in the current bull run. Already yielding 440% ROIs within a few months in the ongoing presale, could DTX be the next great crypto to yield the most returns in this bull run? Read on to find out the reasons smart investors are swarming to this promising crypto project.

Early adopters have already seen over 440% returns, and given the $10.2 million raised so far, DTX has been rather popular among institutional and retail investors alike. DTX is one of the best cryptos to buy right now, pre-listed on CoinMarketCap and projected to rise 50x throughout the ongoing bull run. DTX Exchange is quickly rising as the future of trading and the best choice for savvy investors by combining modern technologies, income-generating possibilities, and great development potential. Ripple rides bullish momentum with a 130% surge Rising an amazing 130% over the past month, Ripple (XRP) has attracted the attention of crypto investors lately. Though there is considerable volatility—the XRP price swings between $1.90 and $2.56 over the previous week—its long-term trend stays quite positive. The XRP price appeal was strengthened when it peaked at $2.84 earlier this month, a new 3-year high. Technical indicators like the MACD and Moving Averages, which show buy signals on the XRP price chart, draw attention from analysts. Strong fundamentals and increased market attention cause some analysts to estimate that Ripple could soar as high as $13 by next year, making it one of the promising altcoins to watch. Though the bullish structure on the XRP price chart is encouraging, for those looking for exponential gains DTX is one of the best cryptos to buy right now. With a market capitalization of approximately $57 million, DTX is still in its early years while Ripple (XRP) already shows a market valuation of $137 billion. DTX has much more space to rally from its lower valuation. With its creative trading system and predicted 30x ROI post-launch, DTX offers a special investment opportunity having already yielded a 440% ROI for investors in a few months during its presale. Solana faces swings amid market consolidation Significant Solana price movements have lately reflected short-term market uncertainty. The Solana price now looks to be in a consolidation phase after rising above $230, declining below $205, and then ranging between $215 and $235. Despite last week’s drop of more than 3%, as seen on the Solana price chart, the overall sentiment toward the altcoin is still bullish. Although the Momentum Oscillator and CCI show some short-term selling pressure, on the Solana price chart, buy indications from the MACD and Moving Averages emphasize its bullish potential. On the yearly Solana chart, analysts are attentively observing a bullish flag pattern that points to a possible breakout, making it one of the altcoins to watch now. Although Solana has shown outstanding gains of more than 190% in the previous year, DTX is creating waves with much more potential for growth. DTX has already given investors an amazing 440% ROI just within a few months in its presale phase alone. Driven by the platform’s creative ecosystem, lightning-fast transaction speeds, and extensive asset offers, analysts predict the DTX utility token may increase by an extra 500% with its official debut slated for Q1 2025. DTX Exchange could outpace Solana and Ripple Solana is getting ready for a possible breakout and Ripple is still climbing impressively. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is taking the stage with unmatched potential. DTX is creating the conditions for explosive returns with a presale ROI of 440% and counting, a unique ecosystem providing lightning-fast transactions, multi-asset access, and several income-generating opportunities.

37808837,https://nulltx.com/?p=135954,1734545067,Polkadot and Bonk Face a New Rival: Meet FXGuys,"Polkadot and Bonk Face a New Rival: Meet This Game-Changing Altcoin FXGuys In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, where giants like Polkadot (DOT) and meme-inspired tokens like Bonk (BONK) dominate headlines, a new contender has emerged to capture the attention of savvy investors. FXGuys ($FXG) is not just another token—it’s a game-changing altcoin redefining utility and opportunity in the blockchain space. While Polkadot excels in interoperability and Bonk capitalizes on community-driven hype, FXGuys combines financial empowerment, decentralized finance (DeFi) innovation, and trading-focused utilities. Here’s why FXGuys is quickly becoming a top pick for both retail and institutional investors. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE Polkadot’s Strengths and Challenges Polkadot is a leading blockchain that facilitates interoperability between different chains. Its scalability and parachain auctions have been instrumental in addressing blockchain congestion issues. However, Polkadot faces stiff competition from other Layer-1 solutions like Ethereum and Solana. For investors, Polkadot’s reliance on long-term ecosystem development and complex staking mechanisms can sometimes make it less attractive for immediate returns. This creates an opportunity for more dynamic projects like FXGuys to step in. The Rise and Limitations of Bonk Bonk (BONK), a meme coin on the Solana network, skyrocketed in popularity by leveraging community engagement and viral marketing. While its meteoric rise has captivated retail investors, meme coins often lack the utility or scalability to sustain long-term growth. Unlike Bonk, FXGuys is built on solid fundamentals, offering utilities like staking and a Trade2Earn model that encourages sustained investor participation. This makes FXGuys more appealing to those looking for value beyond speculative hype. Why FXGuys Is the Next Big Thing 1. Trade2Earn Model FXGuys introduces a revolutionary Trade2Earn model that rewards users for active participation on the platform. This approach enhances user engagement and provides a consistent income stream for traders, differentiating FXGuys from its competitors. 2. Staking for Passive Income With its robust staking platform, FXGuys offers lucrative rewards to token holders who lock their $FXG tokens. As one of the top defi coins, FXGuys ensures that both active and passive participants benefit from its ecosystem. 3. Trader Funding Program FXGuys collaborates with the best proprietary trading firms to provide traders with access to significant capital. The Trader Funding Program removes traditional entry barriers, enabling traders to scale their strategies and earn higher profits. 4. Utility-Driven Growth Unlike Bonk, which thrives on short-term trends, FXGuys is designed as a Top PropFi Project with long-term scalability. Its combination of financial tools and DeFi innovation ensures sustained relevance in a rapidly changing market. Why Investors Are Turning to FXGuys Investors seeking high potential altcoins are recognizing FXGuys’ ability to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and traditional trading platforms. With its unique value propositions, FXGuys has positioned itself as a serious rival to both Polkadot and Bonk. Moreover, FXGuys’ growing community and transparent roadmap have instilled confidence among both retail and institutional investors. Its current token price of just $0.04, with a clear path to higher valuations, makes it a highly attractive investment. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE The Road Ahead for FXGuys As FXGuys continues to grow, it’s evident that this game-changing altcoin has what it takes to rival major players like Polkadot and Bonk. By prioritizing utility, accessibility, and profitability, FXGuys is setting new standards in the crypto industry. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with a token that offers both immediate and long-term value, FXGuys is a clear choice.

Comparing It to Arweave & Helium Are you on the hunt for the next big development in Web3? While Arweave and Helium are notable players attracting significant attention, the new contender, Web3Bay, is creating a buzz with its unique project that shows immense potential. Arweave has made waves with a recent 37.83% spike in its price, bolstering positive market predictions due to its decentralized storage capabilities. Helium continues to expand its IoT network through Hotspots, despite a recent 10.53% drop in price, yet maintains a strong growth outlook. Web3Bay, on the other hand, is carving out a niche in the Web3 cryptocurrency market for e-commerce. It’s crafting a decentralized marketplace that brings blockchain technology into online shopping, offering promising ROI potential that positions Web3Bay as a particularly compelling option among emerging Web3 projects. Arweave’s Growing Impact with Decentralized Storage Arweave is attracting interest for its innovative approach to permanent, decentralized storage. Its blockweave technology enables users to store data indefinitely for a one-time fee, appealing to those seeking secure, long-term storage solutions. This feature has contributed to a positive trend in Arweave’s price, especially after a significant weekly increase of 37.83%. Arweave’s strategic expansion includes the acquisition of Odysee, which brought over 7 million new users into its ecosystem, and the involvement in the DeFi space with $260 million staked in its AO hyper-parallel computer. These advancements are solidifying Arweave’s position as a key player in decentralized storage, pushing its potential higher for those interested in crypto-based storage solutions. Helium’s Advancements in the IoT Space with Network Enhancements Helium is advancing in the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by developing a decentralized wireless network where operators can earn HNT tokens. Recent figures show Helium trading at $8.18, with a notable 8% increase over the last 24 hours, though it faced a 5% decline over the week. Despite this fluctuation, Helium’s network expansion continues to foster optimism for its future. A significant milestone for Helium this year was its transition to the Solana blockchain in April 2023, aimed at enhancing scalability and transaction efficiency. This move, coupled with a 21% increase in September due to new Hotspot deployments and growing subscriber numbers, has bolstered its standing. Helium’s expanding network and community involvement lay a solid foundation for sustained growth in the IoT field. Web3Bay: Pioneering the Future of E-commerce with Decentralization Web3Bay aims to transform the e-commerce landscape by positioning itself as the decentralized counterpart to Amazon and eBay. It offers a unique Web3 cryptocurrency platform that empowers users to buy, sell, and manage assets with unparalleled data control. This marketplace leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency and user ownership, thus providing a secure and standout alternative to traditional centralized platforms. As it embraces the Web3 paradigm, Web3Bay makes decentralized shopping accessible not only to cryptocurrency enthusiasts but also to those new to this digital shift. The 3BAY token, which fuels this ecosystem, has shown substantial ROI potential, surging 6430% from its initial presale price of $0.003 to $0.1959. This growth indicates robust demand as Web3Bay progresses towards its full launch, positioning the 3BAY token as a central topic of discussion in the cryptocurrency community. What distinguishes Web3Bay further is its community-driven governance model, which involves users directly in decision-making, enhancing their commitment and loyalty to the platform. With diverse payment methods, including PayPal, Web3Bay effectively bridges traditional and Web3 markets, broadening its appeal. Given its groundbreaking framework and potential for mass adoption, many in the industry view 3BAY as a potential 100x asset. This positions Web3Bay to potentially revolutionize decentralized e-commerce and spearhead a new era of growth in the cryptocurrency market. Key Highlights With each project offering distinct advantages, Web3Bay, Arweave, and Helium are making significant strides in the crypto landscape. Arweave’s robust storage solutions and Helium’s network expansions provide solid foundations for their respective areas. However, Web3Bay’s integration of a community-driven e-commerce platform with high ROI potential sets it apart, blending decentralized retail with blockchain advantages to position itself as a formidable force in the future of blockchain-based e-commerce.

Notably, the past three months have been highlighted by a remarkable Cardano surge that saw it break above $1 for the first time since early 2022 and peak at $1.3 on December 3, 2024. Although Cardano has managed to hold above the $1 mark since then, price action in the past 24 hours has been highlighted by a 3.77% decline alongside the rest of the crypto market. However, on-chain data shows that the decline has given crypto whales another opportunity to double down on their holdings. Surge In Whale Transactions Reflects Continued Confidence In Cardano A surge in whale activity on the Cardano network has brought forward another spirit of accumulation among the holder cohort, with prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighting the development on the social media platform X. Martinez noted that 687 transactions with a value of at least $1 million were recorded within the past 24 hours, pointing to increasing interest from large investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Moves Similarly To The Elliot Wave Count From 2017, Why Price Can Jump Another 80% According to data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment, this increase in activity is particularly notable, as the whale activity had been declining since the beginning of December. Particularly, Cardano whale activity declined from about 894 transactions on December 2, just before it reached its current 2024 peak of $1.3, to around 240 transactions between December 8 and December 12. Whale activity is one of the biggest indicators of a network’s performance and its price outlook. Although the whale activity could also point to whales exiting their positions, current market sentiment points to accumulation instead. Furthermore, the increase in whale activity is an indication of continued confidence in the cryptocurrency’s price outlook. The Path To $2: What Lies Ahead For Cardano? As it stands, the recent rejection at $1.11 has seen the Cardano price decline to retest the support at $1. At the time of writing, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $1.03, although there remains a risk of a further move to the downside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance However, the surge in whale transactions is one bullish signal that could send the cryptocurrency on a bounce upwards due to its counterweight action against selling pressure. The next target remains a final break above the $2 threshold, which might still be achievable before the end of the year. Reaching the $2 price target, which is about 94% from its current price level, would require a general bullish sentiment in the wider crypto market. Interestingly, crypto analysts at Changelly have presented a more cautious outlook with a year-end ADA price of $1.15. Nonetheless, Cardano has more than tripled in its value in the past six weeks and it could resume this momentum anytime soon towards $2 if the bulls can continue to hold above the $1 mark.

37809038,https://blockworks.co/news/onchain-user-activity-trends,1734544800,Base leads explosive growth: Flipside,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Focusing on EVM chains, the Flipside’s Onchain Users Report tracked both record growth and emerging challenges in maintaining engagement quality. Here are a few trends to watch in 2025. Record user growth Newly acquired users reached a record 19.4 million in October, with Base contributing 13.7m — “almost 8x the runner-up, Polygon,”​ the report notes. This explosive growth was attributed to Coinbase’s vast user base and Base’s focus on “trending sectors like memecoin trading and onchain AI via new initiatives like Based Agents.”​ An “acquired user” is defined as a user who has conducted at least two transactions in 2024​. Ethereum also saw consistent user growth, averaging 1.56m new users monthly. Arbitrum peaked in May with 3.3m acquired users, fueled by GameFi and SocialFi​. Bitcoin usership, however, remained relatively flat despite BTC reaching its historic $100k milestone . This reflects speculative activity rather than meaningful onboarding. Superusers: Base and Polygon dominate Flipside terms “superuser” as those who executed 100 or more transactions on a chain, at any point. Base led the way here with 15.1m wallets executing 100+ transactions, 38% more than Ethereum’s 10.7m superusers. Meanwhile, Polygon recorded 1.5m new superusers in 2024, underscoring its strength outside of DeFi. According to the report, “Polygon’s superuser activity also surpassed that of every other observed chain, with 867.7m monthly super-user transactions.”​ Ethereum retained its position as the DeFi hub with 10.9m DeFi-related superusers, more than Arbitrum and Optimism combined. Blast’s surge and sharp decline Among newly launched chains, Blast made headlines with a record single-month peak of 134.9k acquired users in June. This was driven by its ability to incentivize “a wide range of gamified onchain activities.” However, the chain experienced a significant user drop-off in Q4. Despite the evident exodus of points farmers from the chain, the report highlights Blast’s upside potential: “The remaining users are still active on multiple fronts, suggesting that the chain has the potential to outlive, and exceed, its initial hype.” Uniswap’s DeFi dominance Uniswap solidified its dominance, capturing 91.3% of DEX activity on Base and increasing its share on Ethereum by 27.72% compared to 2023. This points to a broader trend, “a ‘winner-takes-most’ DeFi market [that] disproportionately favors larger incumbent players with deeper liquidity and brand familiarity,” the authors said. Meanwhile, LFJ (née Trader Joe) retained its lead on Avalanche , growing its market share by just over 6% from 2023, thanks to innovations like Auto-Pools. The challenge While 2024 saw record user acquisition, Flipside emphasizes the need for quality engagement. As the report notes: “Behind the headlines of record user growth lies a deeper challenge: building ecosystems that create meaningful, lasting engagement, not just fleeting speculation.” For instance, despite Base attracting massive numbers of users, the report underscores the “narrow range of onchain actions its new user base is currently engaged in,” such as simply gambling on a memecoin or two. It’s not clear whether apps can execute on the opportunity to redirect users toward deeper activities like DeFi. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

It maintained a higher high and higher low pattern on the daily chart. A break above the monthly high could stir a fresh rally. Last week’s sudden sell-off is still causing panic among short-term buyers as they have struggled with volatility in the past few days. Though they have pushed back, their recent commitment is not strong enough to retake the previous high—marked at $147 earlier this month. The $131 level suppressed buying yesterday and as we can see, the price is currently weak on the day following a 5% loss overnight. Dropping below the holding $113 level could facilitate bigger losses. On the other hand, it must break above the monthly high for more positive actions. However, with the latest setup, LTC may post less loss in the next few days compared to some top altcoins, which are still in a downward range and looking for firm support to foot another bullish rally. Litecoin’s general market structure remains bullish on the daily chart. A break above the mentioned monthly high should confirm a new buying phase. But considering the current daily drop, the bulls may face a small hurdle before regaining control. For now, the next move is indecisive. LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Amid the latest drop, Litecoin may fall to $113 before advancing bullish. If this price fails to contain pressure, it may roll back to last week’s $101 low to reestablish support. The $88 level is another support to consider for more drops. If Litecoin shows strength again and manages to push above yesterday’s $131.5 high, the immediate resistance to watch for an increase is $147, followed by a break to $150 and $160 in no time. Key Resistance Levels: $131.5, $147, $160 Key Support Levels: $113, $101, $88 Spot Price: $120 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The bonds, issued by Quincy, Massachusetts in April, were sold using JPMorgan Chase’s private blockchain platform. This deal handled everything from issuance to settlement on the blockchain, completely bypassing traditional methods. The Quincy transaction involved $6.5 million in municipal debt purchased by BlackRock, a huge player in the financial world. A BlackRock spokesperson reportedly called it a part of their actively managed ETF, MEAR, which holds $750 million in client assets and has been in operation since 2015. Quincy Bonds and JPMorgan’s blockchain tech The city of Quincy made waves earlier this year when it issued bonds using blockchain tech instead of the traditional system. JPMorgan’s blockchain platform, Digital Debt Service, was at the center of this innovation. This platform managed everything. It cut out intermediaries, making the process faster and more efficient. The bonds stayed on the blockchain from issuance to settlement, a system that had never been attempted in municipal finance before. BlackRock is the first big player to jump into the Quincy deal. The firm updated its ETF’s prospectus to allow blockchain-based bond investments. This required a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which also outlined the risks, like limited liquidity and the possibility of bugs or errors in the blockchain application. Municipal bonds have traditionally been a conservative corner of the market, full of paperwork and delays. But not when the blockchain is in play. BlackRock’s ETF stays strong Its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), launched earlier this year, is smashing records. Over the past day, IBIT pulled in $740 million in inflows. It now manages over $51 billion in assets, making it one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. Over the past 24 hours alone, IBIT pulled in $740 million. Combined with Ethereum ETF inflows, BlackRock’s crypto ETFs hit $860 million in just one day. To put that in perspective, it has already outpaced BlackRock’s gold ETF, which has been around since 2005. Investors are pouring money into IBIT, while competitors like Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust are bleeding cash. Grayscale has suffered $21 billion in outflows this year. Bitcoin’s price trading above $108,000 has further fueled interest. Market watchers expect it to hit $110,000 soon, thanks to a dovish Federal Reserve policy and increased institutional demand.

In a pig butchering scam, bad actors form a relationship with victims online to gain their trust and convince them to invest in fake opportunities and/or cryptocurrency platforms that the scammers control. Once the victim has invested a significant amount of money, the con artist disappears with the funds. The fraudsters refer to their victims as “pigs” because they use elaborate storylines to “fatten up” the targets into believing they are in close relationships. Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recently raided a luxury building in Lagos where workers at a call center allegedly facilitated the scams, per a press release from the law enforcement agency. EFCC Public Affairs Director Wilson Uwujaren said foreign nationals used the building to train Nigerian accomplices. “All the floors are equipped with high-end desktop computers. On the 5th floor alone, investigators recovered 500 SIM cards of local telcos that were bought for criminal purposes. Their Nigerian accomplices were recruited by the foreign kingpins to prospect for victims online through phishing, targeting mostly Americans, Canadians, Mexicans, and several others from European countries. They usually arm them with desktop computers and mobile devices and create fake profiles for them. The Nigerian accomplices are equally provided with logs that allow them access to foreign communication lines and victims, which they chat with on WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It currently looks set for another upsurge following a bounce back. During the last bullish rally, XRP encountered resistance and quickly took a downturn after rejecting the key $3 level earlier this month. This led to a notable reduction and the price retraced to a low of $1.9, producing a sizeable discount for the bulls. Following a sharp bounce, the low level held as support and the price increased well above $2. Currently, it is priced at $2.6 due to a notable gain in the past few days. The bulls appeared back in action as they aim to claim more highs in the coming days. Currently, buying volume looks relatively low on the daily chart. A steady increase in the demand level could fuel a huge explosion capable of rallying the price to a new all-time soon. The previous high is an important level to watch for a break-up. Failure to break higher could result in a brief consolidation, causing a temporal halt in the existing bullish trend before rallying up. On the other hand, a breakdown from there could bring a setback in the market. Looking at the market structure from a technical standpoint, XRP is poised for a fresh increase. If this buy signal comes into play, we can expect a massive run-up in the next few days. The overall market still looks bullish, with a 15% gain weekly. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Flipping through the previous high of $2.9, it may encounter resistance at $3.3 (the current all-time high) before testing $3.7 and $4. If the volume increases, it may end this phase at $5. If XRP rolls back under $2, it may revisit the recent $1.9 support. Breaking lower could trigger more drops into the $1.63 and $1.28 range.

37808519,https://crypto.news/?p=14320522,1734544420,Top-rated crypto expert predicts 2 altcoins that can replace AAVE and surge 150% this December,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto expert predicts Fantom and IntelMarkets could surpass AAVE, surging up to 150% this December. Table of Contents AAVE: Breaking through the resistance level Fantom: A comeback in the making? IntelMarkets: The best bet this December Key takeaways As AAVE has been performing impressively for quite some time now, its ability to achieve further gains was questioned. A top-rated crypto expert has predicted two altcoins that could replace it. He predicted that Fantom (FTM) and IntelMarkets (INTL) would surpass AAVE and surge up to 150% this December. Read on to find out how they compare and why IntelMarkets is the more promising choice. You might also like: CryptosRus sees potential Cardano price breakout, IntelMarkets up 610% in presale AAVE: Breaking through the resistance level The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem player AAVE has consistently performed greatly in the market. Recently, we have seen AAVE surge up 44% since last week to $382, where it is currently trading. This surge can be attributed to a 150% increase in whale activity and the securing of 45% of the DeFi market share. Furthermore, this performance can be attributed to the moving of a significant amount of AAVE tokens to private wallets for long-term holding and an overall positive bullish market sentiment. However, these encouraging numbers have left AAVE’s development dependent on the growth of the DeFi sector. Increased competition, a large market cap, and the potential for a change of market sentiments can make it harder to achieve life-changing gains in AAVE. Because of that reality, the crypto expert has expressed doubts about AAVE forthcoming growth and predicted that Fantom and IntelMarkets would be leading December gains. Fantom: A comeback in the making? Fantom (FTM) is a high-performance, secure blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. It is one of the key players in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space, known for its fast transaction speeds and low costs. Currently trading at $1.39, FTM has risen by 11% in the past 7 days. Fantom has had an impressive performance following the U.S. elections and is up 257% since then. However, its price is still a far cry from its ATH of $3.46, reached in Q4 2021. With all these factors in mind, FTM’s future is unclear. While it may continue to perform greatly, the announcements of its migration to Sonic might have an unpredicted impact on its price. Furthermore, its large market cap of almost $4B is restricting its potential for massive gains. Despite these shortcomings, according to the crypto expert, Fantom will most likely continue to perform soundly, seeing moderate gains. But he has warned that for those seeking bigger gains, IntelMarkets is the better bet. IntelMarkets: The best bet this December According to the crypto expert, IntelMarkets (INTL) is the best crypto to invest in this December. By combining AI, blockchain technology, and DeFi, IntelMarkets’ unique platform is set to revolutionize crypto trading. Furthermore, INTL comes equipped with amazing AI trading bots that self-learn, analyze real-time data, and execute trades across multiple asset classes, providing users with maximum profits. The IntelMarkets eighth presale stage has raised over $4,800,000, with a sizable portion of those funds coming from Fortune 500 firms. Its ICO is priced at only $0.073, leaving room for exponential returns for early investors. With its enticing roadmap and a team of ex-OpenAI and MIT experts, INTL is destined to lead the next wave of AI-DeFi projects. Furthermore, with a projected 150% return this December and a 75x rally post-launch, IntelMarkets emerges as a top pick compared to AAVE and Fantom. Key takeaways While AAVE and Fantom remain solid players in the crypto landscape, their growth potential pales in comparison to IntelMarkets. As it prepares to revolutionize crypto trading with its AI-powered platform, INTL offers investors a rare opportunity to get on board themselves for life-changing gains. For those seeking explosive returns this December, IntelMarkets’ low entry point and transformative power could be a clear choice.

Although the pressure is currently low on the daily chart. It is slowly gearing up for another upward movement. Last week was a bit rough in the entire crypto space as several altcoins, including BNB, lost momentum after almost testing the $800 level. The price crashed but managed to hold above the $640 level. It recovered and slowly climbed back after holding the price level as support. However, BNB’s next move has been indecisive in the past week as the price traded calmly at around $710 after recovering well from last week’s crash. Painting a greenish scenario today following a 3% surge in the past hours, trading turned out positive as the price increased to a daily high of $737. The bulls appeared to have gained more control as volume enhanced on the intraday trading. A continuous increase in the buying volume could stir up a big surge in the coming days, although the $794 level is likely to pose a little threat on the way up. Looking at the volatility contraction on the weekly chart, the price may reach $1k by the end of the bull run. As of now, there are no signs of bears in the market. The bulls are taking charge at the moment. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $761 level is the closest resistance to watch on the way up. A surge above it could bring a full recovery back to the recent top of $793.4. It may face key resistance at $800 in case of a breakup. The higher level for an increase is $900. Currently, the market is supported by $687 and $642. If these mentioned price level loses grip daily, the next key level to consider for drops is $600.

Among the suspects, there were 148 Chinese nationals, 40 Filipinos, and others from different countries. The operation targeted a well-coordinated fraud network headquartered in the Big Leaf Building, a seven-story facility on Victoria Island, Lagos. Fraudulent Operations Uncovered According to investigations by EFCC, the foreign suspects trained Nigerian recruits to open fake online profiles. Through WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram, the recruits chatted with victims, luring them into the fraud. Victims were guided to a scam investment website called Yooto.com that required an initial activation fee of $35. The modus operandi of the scheme was to identify and groom victims across North America, Europe, and elsewhere while foreign operatives would then take over the transactions. This way, the Nigerian accomplices would be cut off to make tracing financial transactions more difficult. High-Tech Equipment Seized Recoveries made during the raid by EFCC investigators included over 500 SIM cards, high-end computer systems, and mobile devices used in the fraudulent operations. Other items seized included vehicles and other electronic devices that were integral to the perpetration of the scams. The foreign operatives specifically chose accomplices from Nigeria with considerable computer skills and typing proficiency. After a two-week training, the recruits impersonated foreign nationals to establish trust with victims before passing on the fraudulent engagements to their overseas handlers. Payments to local participants were made in cash or personal accounts, bypassing any corporate systems . What’s Next? EFCC Chairman Ola Olukoyede, speaking through Director of Public Affairs Wilson Uwujaren, announced that the suspects would be charged once investigations are concluded. He highlighted the sophistication of the scam and reiterated the EFCC’s commitment to tackling cybercrime in Nigeria. This is just one of several attempts by the agency to crush cybercrime networks that have sprawled across the country. With the rise in the complexity of fraud schemes across the world, the EFCC is still improving ways to help combat fraud incidents.

42390087,9a6b64f7-f606-4187-aab2-7f07169b3209,1734543949,Three Predictions For 2025,"No one can argue with 2024 being a breakthrough year for crypto. BTC and ETH ETFs launched, BlackRock spearheaded bitcoin adoption, a pro-crypto president was elected and BTC broke the 15-year all-time-high, to name a few. But the inflection point for crypto still awaits. Here are three predictions for 2025 that can help spark it:  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  1. DeFi is about to skyrocket  DeFi is becoming more complex, much like traditional finance, in terms of its product suite. We’ve already seen this trend emerging with the adoption of products like Pendle, Ethena, EtherFi and Lombard. In 2025, DeFi usage will explode, with a wave of adoption for products such as options, swaps, and other derivatives like the interest rate swap market — the latter’s market size is at 465.9 trillion USD in TradFi.  Moreover, new institutional players are entering the crypto ecosystem, nurturing a new category: On-chain finance. Participation is no longer limited to buying blue-chip cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH. These market participants also actively expand on-chain market depth by using tools such as lending markets and liquidity provision with RWA-backed digital assets, i.e. stablecoins. Securitize and BlackRock are great examples of companies pushing the frontier on this front.  DeFi is almost back to its all-time-high, Source: https://defillama.com/  2. Stablecoins will continue to grow as the crypto killer use case  Stablecoins aren’t just another crypto product; they’re poised to become the digital backbone of the global financial system. Tether is the most profitable crypto company with a $5.2 billion profit in H1 2024, surpassing BlackRock.  The political landscape is shifting dramatically in favour of stablecoins, with Operation Choke Point 2.0 coming to an end. They are finally being viewed as a national asset that can strengthen the dominance of the U.S. dollar and address growing public debt. This shift also paves the way for major banks and payment companies like Visa and Mastercard to expand their efforts in the sector, especially when you consider Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge for $1.1 billion (the biggest acquisition in crypto ever) and rumors of Revolut launching its stablecoin.  Stablecoins market cap is at an All-Time-High already at about $200 billion, Source: https://defillama.com/stablecoins  3. The race for retail adoption  ETFs will be key drivers for new capital to enter crypto. BTC ETFs are here, and soon we’ll see the success of Ethereum ETFs. After SOL’s undeniable growth over the last year, the SOL ETF will either catch the momentum and become a reality in the first half of 2025 or will delay until 2026 or later.  We’ll also see major Web3 social platforms compete with the LensChain mainnet launch and Farcaster’s further expansion. As the pie grows bigger, we can end up with the ""Twitter/X and Facebook of crypto"" platforms.  Notably, “Super Wallets” took off in Q4 2024. They aim to offer a comprehensive alternative to centralized exchanges for new users. The leading players are Infinex, launched by Kain Warwick, and DeFiApp, launched by seasoned builders in DeFi. Both are working on UX problems, something we have never done very well as an industry.

Don’t miss the first-mover advantage With its presale smashing through milestones, XYZVerse is shaping up to be a badge of honor for crypto and sports enthusiasts alike. Its audited contracts and dedicated team ensure confidence, while its community-first ethos fuels its meteoric rise. In a landscape where Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP are reclaiming their momentum, XYZVerse is the bold newcomer ready to steal the show and deliver next-level returns. Cardano Cardano (ADA) has been on an upward trend recently. In the past week, its price increased by 8.86%. Over the last month, it surged by 47.30%. Looking at the longer term, ADA has gained a remarkable 183.90% in the past six months. These figures show significant growth and increasing investor interest. Based on this data, the price of ADA might continue to rise. The current price range is between $0.94 and $1.22, which is above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $1.09 and $1.08. The RSI is at 53.92, indicating neutral conditions. This suggests room for the price to move higher. If ADA continues its upward momentum, it could test the nearest resistance at $1.35. Breaking this level might lead towards $1.63. Reaching $1.35 would be an increase of about 10% from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.78, a drop of around 15%. Traders should watch these levels as indicators of ADA’s potential movement. Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price dipped by 3.14%. Over the last month, however, it gained nearly 10%. Looking at the past six months, DOGE surged by an impressive 228.17%. This shows significant long-term growth despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, DOGE is trading between $0.3588 and $0.4603. Its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, around $0.403. The Relative Strength Index stands at 47.39, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is below 30, which might suggest the coin is oversold. The MACD level is slightly above zero, hinting at potential upward momentum. Based on these indicators, DOGE could be poised for a rise. If it moves up, it may face resistance at $0.5145. Breaking this level could lead to the next resistance at $0.6160, which is about 35% higher than current prices. On the downside, support exists at $0.3115. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 12%. The data suggests that DOGE has room to grow if it can overcome these hurdles. XRP XRP has experienced significant growth in recent months. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 436.51%. In the last month alone, it increased by 135.70%, and the past week saw a rise of 19.43%. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73, showcasing strong market performance. Technical indicators suggest this upward trend might continue. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.63, above the 100-day average of $2.45, indicating short-term strength. The Relative Strength Index stands at 63.73, below the overbought threshold, leaving room for further growth. Additionally, the MACD level is positive at 0.0520, signaling bullish momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $3.02. Breaking this could see XRP aiming for the second resistance at $3.73, a potential increase of around 37%. On the downside, support levels are at $1.61 and $0.9041, which may help cushion any pullbacks. Overall, the data points to a positive outlook for XRP, with potential for continued gains in the near future. Conclusion While ADA, DOGE, and XRP are strong, XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth as the first all-sport meme coin, blending memes and sports for community-driven success.

The network, called Ink, is based on the OP stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build their own rollups using Optimism’s technology. The team had originally planned for Ink to go live in early 2025, so the launch of its main network is ahead of schedule.  Kraken agreed to receive 25 million OP tokens (worth about $58 million) as part of a deal to build on the OP Stack. Optimism has acknowledged that handing out developer grants for participants building on the stack is part of its strategy, which in turn contributes back to the wider “Superchain” ecosystem.  Kraken competitor Coinbase said in August 2023 that it would build a layer-2 network with OP Stack. The product, called Base, is now the second-largest rollup network according to L2beat. At the time, Optimism said the Base team would receive up to 118 million OP tokens and, in return, would contribute the higher of 2.5% of its sequencer revenue or 15% of its profits to the Optimism Collective.  Other participants building a layer 2 with the OP Stack — including Uniswap, World Network, and Sony Blockchain Labs — have not said how many OP tokens they expect to receive as part of their deals.  “Today is just the beginning for Ink, and now our boldest work really begins – growing Ink,” said Andrew Koller, the founder of Ink, in a press release. “We’re pushing the boundaries of on-chain experiences to unlock new applications and opportunities for builders and users alike, layering privacy, security and UX enhancements on a foundation of deep liquidity.”  Read more: Kraken Picked Optimism's 'Superchain' After Getting a Pile of OP Tokens",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/12/18/kraken-s-ink-layer-2-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ab53b8cc2487b200d7d7ac3c9331fa8963e9813-1500x894.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

37808265,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629839,1734543524,The Fed expected to cut rates by 25 bp in today’s FOMC meeting,"A December 18 update from Singaporean digital asset firm QCP Group revealed that the Fed might announce a 25-basis-point interest rate cut during the last Fed meeting of the year. The rate cut during the meeting, which is set for December 18, will be the third cut the Fed initiated this year. The firm also speculated that the rate cut might be the last the Federal Reserve delivers in a while. According to QCP Group, the Fed will be ‘non-committal’ in its statement as there is no clear outlook about rate cuts once President-elect Donald Trump gets into office. The firm still expects that there will be three rate cuts in 2025. The central bank will release a statement at 2:00 PM ET, revealing its rate decision and next year’s ‘dot plot’. A New York Times report suggested that the borrowing rates will end at 4.4% after the expected rate cut. The Fed began cutting rates in September to lower consumer prices and improve employment and labor markets. The economy has stayed on target, showing significant growth. Labor markets and the country’s employment have also remained solid despite inflation stalling in November. During a recent New York Times event, the Fed’s chair, Jerome Powell, commented that he was content with the country’s current economic situation and monetary policies. Powell still mentioned that the Fed could afford to be ‟a little cautious.” November inflation report causes uncertainty about Fed rate cuts Inflation rose again in November, matching expectations from analysts in this year’s final report for rising consumer prices ahead of an expected rate cut. https://t.co/W8O9pMNzNK pic.twitter.com/YVkC1euxxg — Forbes (@Forbes) December 11, 2024 The U.S. National Bureau of Statistics recently released the November inflation report, causing economic uncertainty among analysts. The report indicated that consumer prices spiked 2.7% year-on-year compared to October’s 2.6% rise. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.2% from last month’s 3.7%. The U.S. producer price index (PPI) also rose by 0.4% from October. Some Fed officials mentioned that it was time for the central bank to slow down and find the policy balance. The current sentiment revolved around whether the implementations would tighten policies, leading to an economic slowdown, or ease policies, influencing economic growth. St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem suggested earlier this month that the Fed should slow down on rate cuts. Musalem still did not specify when the Fed was supposed to pause. The Fed official also stated that the central bank was nearing its employment and price stability goals. Richmond’s Fed Reserve president, Tom Barkin, also supported a slower approach to Fed rate cuts. Barkin explained that a ‘slower, more careful path’ would allow the central bank to reach a slightly restrictive policy level that could help it achieve the neutral rate sooner. QCP Group expects an insignificant effect on the markets QCP Group speculated that the rumored Fed rate cut might have little to no effects on capital and crypto markets. The firm still explained that investors should watch out for decreasing market liquidity, which could indicate ‘gappy moves’ and incoming large liquidations. The Singaporean firm further speculated on the BTC price movement after the Fed meeting, saying that the technical outlook was cautious. They suggested that today’s price movement indicated a bearish divergence. The coin has dropped by over 2.2% in the last 24 hours, trading at $104,910 at the time of writing. QCP still warned investors not to short their positions despite any price drop BTC might experience. The firm explained that the long-term outlook for the coin was bullish, especially with the incoming pro-crypto president, Trump.

37808023,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394838,1734543504,"TOP 7 Crypto Trends for 2025: Staying Ahead with Smart, Low-Cost Trading","The post TOP 7 Crypto Trends for 2025: Staying Ahead with Smart, Low-Cost Trading appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As 2025 approaches, we are likely to see the cryptocurrency industry still evolving and expanding , offering investors fresh possibilities. And some potential issues, too. It takes both knowledge of current trends and the implementation of wise trading techniques to stay ahead in an ever-changing market. Reducing transaction charges in low-cost trading might become the next big thing, as crypto is back on the right track. In this article, we will explore the most important crypto trends for 2025, focusing on the value of inexpensive trading platforms and how they enable investors to optimize their holdings. Source: https://www.pexels.com/pl-pl/zdjecie/stos-monety-finanse-inwestycja-8370747/ The Significance of 2025 for Cryptocurrency Investors 2024 was yet another year that proved to the world that cryptocurrencies have the capacity to reshape the financial landscape. With Bitcoin hitting an all-time high (ATH) , more and more people have become obsessed with crypto. Traders and investors started looking for new ways to make money, including using a Quick Exchange (like Quickex) mechanism to rapidly trade their assets. When it comes to 2025, the upcoming months promise some transformative developments. With new crypto trends in mind, traders are looking towards more opportunities for smart and low-cost trading. There are a couple of reasons this year might be significant for crypto investors: Worldwide Regulatory Developments . Globally, governments are becoming increasingly involved in cryptocurrency regulation. Take El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy, for example, which turned out to be a great success. In addition to giving the market more credibility, the emergence of clearer frameworks attracts new administrations. Trying to cut down expenses, governments will be looking for low-cost alternatives. Institutional Investor’s Growing Role . Crypto usage is expanding among institutions, affecting market dynamics. The use of digital assets by governments, hedge firms, and pension funds to diversify their holdings is improving market stability. To maintain competitive returns, retail investors can capitalize on this trend by utilizing low-cost exchanges. Continuous DeFi Involvement . Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which provides decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading options, is still upending established financial structures. High gas costs on some blockchains, however, continue to be an obstacle. Maintaining an active presence in the DeFi ecosystem requires the use of platforms with minimal transaction costs. TOP 7 Crypto Trends for 2025 The crypto euphoria of late 2024 is very likely to continue, so it would be best to prepare for some of the most interesting crypto trends for 2025. Trend #1: Low-Cost Quick Crypto Exchanges Every percentage of transaction fee savings adds up to better total returns as market rivalry heats up. Profitability may be greatly impacted by new and quick crypto exchanges for traders that do a lot of deals. Imagine a trader using a standard platform. This investor makes 50 trades a month at an average charge of 0.5% for each trade. Now, think about how much this person could save if they switched to a low-cost exchange, charging just 0.1% per transaction. As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surge, traders want to get more of their investments. Cutting down on any additional costs, such as exchange fees, is likely to become a major turning point for many crypto enthusiasts. Trend #2: Solutions for Layer 2 and the Need for Scalability Scalability continues to be a major concern as the blockchain ecosystem grows. These issues are being addressed by Layer 2 solutions , which expand upon current blockchains and lower costs while increasing contract speed. Platforms that make use of Layer 2 solutions, enable traders to take advantage of faster transactions and reduced fees . For active traders who depend on efficiency to optimize returns, this is especially crucial. Trend #3: The Rising Importance of Stablecoins In Trading In the ecology of cryptocurrency trading, stablecoins that are based on fiat currencies like USD are growing in significance. The most meaningful example is the USDT. Stablecoins’ adoption plays a vital role in storing money during market downturns since these assets lower volatility. They are also frequently utilized as collateral in DeFi protocols and for cross-border transactions. Furthermore, as stablecoins will continue being one of the most important crypto trends of 2025, users will be looking for low-cost exchanges allowing them to save money. Utilizing a system supporting well-known stablecoins like USDT and USDC is a must . As a result, traders may more easily protect themselves against market volatility without having to pay expensive transaction fees. Trend #4: The Involvement of AI-Powered Crypto Tools If you are looking forward to starting your own crypto investment in 2025, now is the best time to do so. With the wide implementation of AI-powered crypto tools , you can achieve satisfying results easier than ever before. Artificial intelligence (AI) keeps on transforming our lives in so many ways, cryptocurrency trading included. New and seasoned traders can utilize modern apps and tools in many different ways. Anyhow, two specific directions seem to play a vital part here: AI in Crypto Trading Market Analysis : AI systems are able to examine enormous volumes of data in order to spot patterns and forecast changes in price. Automated AI Crypto Trading : AI-driven bots are able to make transactions according to preset standards, doing away with human judgment. Quicker, easier, and more precise. AI crypto trends for 2025 are sure to reshape the way we view online trading and investments in new coins. These tools frequently depend on high-frequency trading, where even minor costs may have a big impact. Implementing such solutions on a low-cost exchange will additionally provide significant returns. Trend #5: Switching to Environmental Stability Whenever cryptocurrencies are becoming the main focal point for investors, potential environmental concerns always arise . The ecological effects of the cryptocurrency business are coming under more scrutiny, especially in relation to energy-intensive mining operations. As the market evolves, so does the approach to environmental stability across all blockchains. This is an ongoing crypto trend. For example, since Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models use a lot less energy than Proof-of-Work (PoW) models, many blockchain applications are switching to them. Modern quick exchanges also support the worldwide movement toward sustainability. It is made possible by enabling trading in eco-friendly cryptocurrencies, enabling investors to fund more environmentally stable initiatives without having to pay exorbitant fees. Trend #6: Wider Adoption of Blockchain Technology With the inauguration of Donald Trump as the President of the United States, the crypto industry is looking forward to a wider adoption of blockchain technology in the upcoming months. Among crypto trends for 2025, we might be seeing a growing potential for more use cases in such fields as: Real Estate Supply Chain Management Healthcare As the crypto landscape keeps on reshaping, it pushes towards new prospects in addition to cryptocurrency trading. These changes demonstrate how crucial it is becoming even for ordinary people to comprehend the foundations of blockchain technology. Throughout 2025, crypto trends might become a double-edged sword, affecting both experts and novice users . By tokenizing real-world assets like housing or artwork, blockchain systems already enable investors to exchange fractional ownership. This tendency is likely to expand. Trend #7: The Implementation of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) As governments investigate digital versions of their fiat currencies, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are becoming more and more popular. And they will continue to grow in importance as one of the major crypto trends for 2025. Especially with the concept of de-dollarization on the table. The goal of CBDCs is to bring together the efficiency of digital assets with the stability of fiat currencies . Despite not being cryptocurrencies in the conventional sense, their uptake may increase the number of people using the digital financial ecosystem, which would help the larger crypto market inadvertently. Thus, the next step for the crypto markets is to push toward the implementation of CBDCs on global crypto exchanges. Such an incorporation can quickly increase the visibility of the new digital assets. This could allow these currencies to be in a good position to meet the changing demands of modern investors. The wider CBDCs will be available, the more governments should think about issuing them via national central banks. How to Prevent Losses in the Crypto Market: Useful Advice for 2025 Recognizing crypto trends for 2025 is just the beginning. Investors need to implement realistic tactics that keep up with these advancements if they want to succeed in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency sector. Here are a few useful takeaways: Diversify Your Portfolio . Use major coins (Bitcoin, Ethereum) for stability, invest in stablecoins for risk mitigation, and buy emerging altcoins for promising yield. Choose Low-Fee Exchanges . Register of Quickex to safely and cheaply exchange hundreds of altcoins with the best rates on the market. Leverage Educational Resources . Stay ahead of any market changes, follow the latest signals, and follow credible news platforms to get the most reliable insights. Now or never. 2025 seems like the best moment to go all-in on crypto. However, always remember to follow the trends carefully, if you want to make the most of your investments. Success in the cryptocurrency landscape depends on remaining educated and implementing astute tactics . Reducing expenses, utilizing new technology, and diversifying portfolios are the keys to accomplishment in 2025.

In his latest article , Hayes noted that the crypto market may face a significant downtrend around January 20th, the same day Trump will be inaugurated as the 47th United States President. Here’s why he projects such a market turnout. Hayes Expects a “Harrowing Dump” During his campaign earlier this year, Trump won the hearts of most crypto community members with his digital asset-oriented promises . These included replacing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler with a pro-crypto individual, eliminating Bitcoin taxes, making the U.S. the world’s crypto capital, and creating a national BTC stockpile. As of this writing, the Republican president-elect has begun fulfilling some of these vows, such as selecting Paul Atkins as Gensler’s replacement . In his latest article, titled Trump Truth, Hayes stated that the president-elect cannot quickly make policy modifications upon inauguration as crypto investors anticipate. The BitMEX co-founder explained that most U.S. elected legislators commence campaigning by the end of 2025 ahead of the November 2026 mid-term elections. As a result, Hayes projects that Trump could begin any policy change after one year. As crypto investors realize this toward January 20th, the market could face what Hayes describes as a “harrowing dump.” “The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th. This realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades. [. . .] Investors are setting themselves up for severe buyer’s remorse,” he wrote. A Glimmer of Hope Toward the end of his article, Hayes stressed that there is a possibility that the bull market will continue after Trump’s inauguration. Whether or not the crypto market continues its bullish trends on the said date, the BitMEX co-founder explained that he is committed to buying the “dips and rips” of Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

With multiple innovative features, FXGuys dominates the niche among the decentralized platforms. FXGuys’ strong fundamentals, boosted by considerable growth potential, make its presale token the best investment in this bull market. On that note, $FXG is outpacing Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL). Here is why $FXG is enjoying increased attention from the crypto sector! >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE FXGuys: A New Crypto Project Dominating the Current Bull Market Although Dogecoin and Solana are great investments in this bull market, a new crypto has emerged with massive profit potential. This new token has multiple features and components that attract investors seeking long-term investments. Since its launch, FXGuys has dominated the crypto industry, with analysts believing it can explode 100x in 2025. The presale token is a great investment for many reasons.

Dogecoin’s Whale Activity Points to a Potential DOGE Rally Dogecoin recently underwent a mild correction, dropping from $0.4675 to $0.4393. Nonetheless, the meme coin did not break critical support zones, pushing analysts to insist that DOGE resume its surge in the current bull market. Interestingly, DOGE’s whale activity shows potential for a massive rally. IntoTheBlock data showed that whale activity involving Dogecoin increased by 41% to $23.35 billion. On December 8, 2024, over 9,400 whale transactions were recorded involving 60.9 billion DOGE coins. DOGE is still a favorite among the whales and Elon Musk, whose support has boosted its social presence. The meme coin’s presence in the top 10 cryptos by market cap highlights its appeal and resilience. Planned upgrades by the Dogecoin Foundation aim to boost its ecosystem, increasing optimism in this bull market. DOGE was valued at $0.4134 on December 10, down 0.79% in the past week. Analysts believe Dogecoin will surge to $0.4415 this month as whale demand intensifies. Amidst the bull market, investors have turned to a new crypto, $FXG, which has a massive profit potential. Solana Whales Accumulate More SOL, Reducing Selling Pressure Solana has attracted the attention of whales amid recent bull market activity. Whales took advantage of a correction to accumulate more tokens, transferring huge amounts from Binance to cold storage. The move by SOL whales is a bullish sign. Since then, Solana has been consolidating around 10% below its November 23, 2024 peak. Interestingly, Solana has briefly outperformed other altcoins before retreating. However, XRP and BNB have reclaimed their positions as SOL cools off. Nonetheless, analysts are optimistic about Solana’s prospects. IncomeSharks observed a possible retracement but highlighted strong Supertrend support since October, allowing SOL to rise above $230. Analyst Jelle says SOL will reach $600 in this bull market if it stays persistently above its previous all-time high of $225. SOL was trading at $217 on December 10, down 3.17% in the past week. Analysts say SOL will rise to $255 this month as whale demand increases in this bull market. Despite the expected rebound, a new presale token, $FXG, has attracted these whales’ attention as they look to diversify their portfolios for increased profits. >>>BUY $FXG TOKENS HERE $FXG: A Presale Token That Could Deliver the Best ROI in the Bull Market!

42416355,ce7eed6d-b7c4-439e-bff7-9f0ca443119b,1734542589,"Out With the “Altcoin,” in With the Asset Class","Following the U.S. presidential election, crypto’s headwinds have seemingly dissipated. Since early November bitcoin has reached $100K amid regulatory wins such as the nomination of crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler as SEC chair, the naming of crypto advocate David Sacks as the incoming White House “AI and Crypto Czar,” and Congressman French Hill’s appointment to head the House Financial Services Committee. With election season coming to a crypto-favorable close in 2024, some are forecasting “altcoin” season, a period of outperformance for non-BTC crypto assets, to continue in 2025 — but is this the right way to characterize digital assets broadly?  Market commentators sometimes hastily sort the crypto economy into two oversimplified groups: 1) bitcoin (and now for some, ether) and 2) alternative or “alt” coins. In the early innings of digital assets, this dual categorization made sense as bitcoin was pioneering the use of blockchain technology and other use cases were still finding their footing. Nearly 16 years since bitcoin’s inception, an explosion of crypto innovation and sector-specific applications has pushed blockchain assets beyond the binary classification of bitcoin and “everything else.” Investors must now treat crypto as a diverse multi-sector asset class.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Putting the constituents of the digital asset class in perspective  The “altcoin” moniker may give the impression that digital assets other than bitcoin lack in size and industry-specific purpose compared to components of other asset classes such as equity markets. Figure 1 below compares the market caps of similarly sized constituents of the S&P500 Index to those of prominent crypto assets ex-BTC, and shows similarities between these asset classes not only in terms of component size, but also in terms of sector diversification:  Figure 1: Market Caps of Top 25 (ex-BTC) Crypto Assets vs. S&P 500 Constituents Smaller than ETH  Not only do the stocks of certain well-known companies highlighted above resemble the top 25 crypto assets in size (ex: Solana has a market cap similar to that of UPS), but both asset classes also span a variety of industries within their respective markets. While the number of digital assets shown above is relatively sparse compared to the number of stocks, these crypto assets alongside the market’s new and innovative crypto projects are likely to continue expanding the size and breadth of the asset class even further over time.  Constructing diversified digital asset portfolios for the long-run  Taking a binary “bitcoin vs. alts” approach to digital asset investing may forgo portfolio construction benefits both within crypto investments and across your overall asset allocation. Obtaining thoughtfully constructed, diversified, and intentional exposure to all crypto sectors and use cases helps defray the risks of asset concentration, ensures your portfolio is exposed to the full value proposition of the asset class, and provides a larger number of return sources within your broader asset allocation. Given the fast-changing, innovative nature of the digital asset landscape, it is crucial to construct crypto allocations that can adapt alongside the breadth of the asset class. This can be accomplished by adopting a process to choose the universe of assets to include in your portfolio, adjusting this universe over time, and allocating sensibly to these assets via either passive or active management. Embracing the broader crypto economy as an asset class within your investment portfolio means allocating to digital assets via strategies that are built for the long-term.  Conclusions for an evolving asset class  Focusing on bitcoin vs. “everything else” may obscure the already meaningful and fast-growing footprint of many crypto assets and could cause investors to miss out on longer-term portfolio benefits associated with comprehensive investment within the asset class.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET,Max Freccia,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/12/18/out-with-the-altcoin-in-with-the-asset-class,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a79c379e0ab6bbcff1bc5f4c287adb12730c0a55-6144x3458.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37807823,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629803,1734542328,BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust broke the 1M Ethereum (ETH) holdings,"BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust now holds more than 1M Ethereum (ETH), solidifying its position as the second-largest ETF holder after Grayscale. The fund was also the most aggressive buyer in the past year, while other funds held under 100K ETH even after accumulation. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) holds a total of 1.025M ETH , breaking the milestone of 1M ETH after aggressive buying. The recent buying followed a previous series of ETH purchases in September, while the market drifted sideways. With the latest purchases, ETHA now holds over $3.9B in ETH, becoming the largest competitor to Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust. Grayscale still owns 1.96M ETH after divesting and transforming some of the holdings. After the initial sell-off, Grayscale retained its holdings, but BlackRock is the most actively bought fund, with the potential to catch up. BlackRock was the most aggressive buyer of ETH due to demand for its iShares ETF (ETHA). | Source: Farside BlackRock was behind the inflows in the past few weeks, where the ETF started attracting more aggressive investments after a period of selling. Ethereum-based ETFs hold a less significant amount of ETH compared to BTC buyers. ETH still has a supply of over 120.4M tokens, of which around 80M are in the hands of whales and investors. The recent ETF buying leads to passive holding of the tokens, though the possibility of a staking ETF is seen as an alternative. BlackRock surpassed smaller funds with recent buying BlackRock now owns more than 3x of the ETH held by the Ethereum Foundation. The fund is still surpassed by Robinhood with 1.4M ETH and other exchanges and entities that require large reserves. The BlackRock holdings are not represented by a single wallet, as they are held in custody through Coinbase Prime. BlackRock is the first fund in 2024 to achieve the 1M milestone through direct buying and inflows. The Grayscale haul was a legacy of its previous exchange-traded product (ETP). In the past few months, BlackRock surpassed other funds both in terms of daily purchases and long-term accumulation, repeating its buying pattern from its acquisitions for the BTC ETF. The recent level of 1M ETH was achieved within weeks, as BlackRock accelerated its buying in December. The recent buying expanded the holdings from a baseline level of 606M ETH. The only other fund with rapid expansion is Fidelity, which holds a total of $1.63B in ETH. The buying of BlackRock’s iShares is notably steeper compared to other ETF issuers. ETF as a whole still holds a relatively small reserve of ETH compared to other entities. However, accelerated buying may be a signal that ETH is catching up as a mainstream asset. In 2024, ETH failed the prediction that the ETF would take it to a price zone above $4,000. Despite the mainstream buying, ETH is still performing as a utility coin. The expectations for a higher price range are not entirely abandoned, allowing for a new wave of ETH mania for both crypto insiders and ETFs. BlackRock is also invested in the wider Ethereum ecosystem, as the provider of its BUIDL token. BUIDL is used to provide collaterals and locked value, due to its conservative mix of assets. BUIDL is spreading to Ondo Finance and other DeFi entities, retaining a total supply of 426K tokens. ETH remains under $4,000 ETH returned to $3,895.45, losing its recent gains above $4,100. The effect of ETF buying is relatively symbolic, as there are entities with a bigger capacity to lock in ETH. The ETH market cap dominance is also lower, down to 12.7%, the lowest level since 2020. ETH’s open interest has also stagnated, expecting a clearer message on the asset’s direction. For the past year, Ethereum proved indispensable for the DeFi ecosystem, still locking in over $77.17B. Ethereum also got a boost from the recent printing of up to 22B USDT, which moved into the market in the form of ERC-20 tokens. Ethereum once again became the biggest carrier of stablecoins, surpassing TRON. The mix of sideways trading and promising on-chain data suggest ETH may be undervalued and still capable of a breakout.

This decision comes as the Indian crypto exchange faces serious issues, including a new legal investigation ordered by the Delhi High Court related to the WazirX hacking case. Court Demands Fresh Investigation Into WazirX Security Breach Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, cited low trading volumes and the token’s failure to meet its updated listing standards for WRX’s removal. However, the delisting triggered widespread uncertainty among investors, leading to a steep decline in the token’s value. Analysts believe the decision has further dented investor confidence, which was already shaken by WazirX’s ongoing regulatory challenges. Adding to the woes, the Delhi High Court recently ordered a fresh investigation into a major security breach involving WazirX. This directive came after Justice Sanjeev Narula rejected the Delhi Police’s report on the incident. The court had earlier instructed law enforcement to conduct a criminal investigation into the hack. However, the court deemed the initial findings inadequate and asked for a new status report by February 13, 2025. Meanwhile, market observers suggest that Binance’s delisting and the intensified legal scrutiny could have long-term ramifications for WazirX. Today, WRX’s price crashed 60.54% to $0.09525 following the delisting news. The WazirX Breach WazirX, India’s leading crypto exchange Safe Multisig wallet on Ethereum, recently faced a major attack . As reported by TheCoinRise, approximately $234.9 million worth of funds from the safe Multisig wallet were transferred to a new address. The compromised assets included tether (USDT), Pepe (PEPE) , and Gala (GALA), which have been swapped into Ether (ETH). Recall that Polygon Labs CEO Mudit Gupta commented on the incident. He suggested that the nature of the hack points towards North Korean cybercriminals as the likely culprits. Gupta explained that the attackers upgraded the Safe Multisig wallet to a malicious version, enabling them to drain its funds. Also, the hackers tricked two signers into authorizing a seemingly normal USDT^ transfer, a malicious transaction designed to upgrade the Safe Multisig wallet. This led to the exploit transaction that upgraded the Multisig wallet to a malicious contract, ultimately transferring all the funds to the bad guys. Binance Terminate Relationship With WazirX Last year, WazirX continued its verbal tug-of-war with Binance over its ownership. As a result, Binance declared that it would not provide wallet services for WazirX and its customers. The digital asset service provider mandated that WazirX withdraw all its funds from the exchange. The feud began in 2022 when Nischal Shetty, the co-founder of WazirX, publicly announced that Binance had acquired its trading platform. However, Changpeng Zhao, the ex-CEO of Binance, argued that his company “never completed” the acquisition deal. Hence, they were just partners and nothing more. The exchange also denied responsibility for the WazirX hack .

37807406,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394829,1734542272,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can BTC 2x to $200,000?","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can BTC 2x to $200,000? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin hit a new high of $108,000 recently. President-elect Donald Trump confirmed on December 12th that he would implement a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and there are also rumors about Russia adopting a similar plan. These developments have sparked discussions about how they could affect Bitcoin’s price and other asset classes. Matthew Tuttle, CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management , recently joined David Lin for a conversation . He explained that several factors contributed to Bitcoin’s recent surge. Firstly, the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF was a game-changer, allowing more people to invest in Bitcoin through traditional brokers. Additionally, Trump’s pro-crypto stance has fueled enthusiasm and he also explained that while short-term price corrections are inevitable after a parabolic rise, he remains confident in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects and plans to buy on any dip. He prefers to analyze charts and pointed out that the $100,000 price level for Bitcoin is psychologically important, acting as key support. If Bitcoin stays above this level, it would be positive, but if it drops below it in the short term, that would signal a bearish trend. As for Bitcoin’s future potential, Tuttle said predicting its next move is difficult but said that it could continue to rise, with past cycles showing strong growth. When asked about Bitcoin’s potential to 2x from current price, he said that while a $100,000 to $200,000 jump may not happen overnight, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Bitcoin at $200,000 next year. He also believes the key drivers will be central banks and companies increasing their involvement in Bitcoin. Tuttle predicts more corporations will add Bitcoin to their treasury reserves, which could positively impact their stock prices. He added that as Bitcoin becomes more accessible through ETFs, individual investors will grow more comfortable adopting it.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-can-btc-2x-to-200000/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37807325,https://finbold.com/?p=220671,1734542091,"ChatGPT says Hedera (HBAR) will hit this target by December 31, 2024","Hedera ( HBAR ) has established itself as one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market, trading at $0.29 at press time. The token’s impressive rally has been fueled by robust ecosystem advancements and growing investor confidence, making it a focal point in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past month, HBAR has climbed 109%, adding to its extraordinary 229% growth since the start of the year. The token’s sharp ascent has sparked widespread speculation about its future, with market participants closely watching for signs of whether it can sustain its momentum as the year nears its end. HBAR one-month price chart. Source: Finbold Key factors driving HBAR’s rally Several factors are driving Hedera’s remarkable ascent in 2024, strengthening its foothold in the digital asset ecosystem. Integration with Chainlink’s decentralized oracles One of the key drivers of HBAR’s rise is its collaboration with Chainlink ( LINK ), which has brought Chainlink’s Data Feeds and Proof of Reserve mechanisms to the Hedera ecosystem. This integration strengthens the infrastructure for decentralized finance ( DeFi ) applications and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, offering developers reliable tools to gain access to accurate, tamper-proof market data critical for building decentralized financial products. By addressing risks like data manipulation, the move is expected to enhance liquidity and risk management in DeFi markets. Growing optimism around cryptocurrency ETFs HBAR has also gained traction in discussions around the potential approval of new cryptocurrency ETFs . Bloomberg analysts anticipate that Hedera could be among the next digital assets to secure ETF status, especially with the expected regulatory shift following the departure of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. His likely successor, Paul Atkins, is known for his pro-crypto stance, signaling a more favorable environment for digital asset investments. This optimism, combined with Hedera’s classification outside the realm of securities, positions it as a strong contender for ETF approval. Robust technical indicators and market participation HBAR’s bullish momentum is further supported by strong technical indicators and increased activity in derivatives markets. According to data from CoinGlass , trading volume has surged by 106.96% to $1.48 billion, while open interest climbed 3.32% to $319.61 million, reflecting growing confidence and participation among traders. HBAR derivatives data. Source: CoinGlass On Binance , the Long/Short Ratio stands at 2.4153, indicating a strong bias toward long positions. Furthermore, liquidation data reveals resilience, with $1.54 million in long liquidations outpacing $1.03 million in shorts, showing sustained bullish sentiment in the market. ChatGPT’s HBAR price outlook for December 31, 2024 To gauge HBAR’s future potential, Finbold analyzed market data and consulted ChatGPT-4o for its projections. The AI model estimates that HBAR will close 2024 trading between $0.40 and $0.45, reflecting a cautious outlook that considers potential profit-taking and short-term corrections. ChatGPT outlook on HBAR. Source: ChatGPT/Finbold However, the analysis also highlights the token’s strong underlying momentum. If Hedera’s ecosystem continues its rapid expansion and market interest remains robust, the model suggests that HBAR could even test the $0.50 mark by year-end, further solidifying its position as one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of 2024.

Here are the Opinions of Moody’s Chief Economist","The FED will announce its final interest rate decision at 22:00 today, and Chairman Jerome Powell will give a speech shortly after the decision. As markets eagerly await the outcome, experts including Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predict Powell will advocate a more cautious approach to future interest rate adjustments. Bond traders tracked by the CME are largely expecting a rate cut, and Zandi acknowledged that such a move is possible. But he expects Powell’s tone at the press conference to reflect a change in strategy. “I think Powell will argue that the Fed should go much slower in cutting rates going forward, and even lay the groundwork for a potential pause,” Zandi said. This caution stems from ongoing uncertainties, including fiscal policy, tariffs and economic policy changes under the current administration. The Fed may need more clarity on these factors before deciding on further rate cuts, Zandi said. Related News: Analysis Company Shares The Level Bitcoin Must Surpass - “If This Level Is Exceeded, These Are The Targets In 2025” According to a CNBC poll, nearly 90% of market participants polled expect the Fed to cut rates, while only 60% believe it should. Some policymakers within the Fed have also expressed reservations about further rate cuts. Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren have both voiced opposition to further easing, while Powell himself has previously signaled caution. But Zandi believes the rate cut is warranted, citing the Fed’s progress in its dual mandate of full employment and price stability. “We’re at full employment, inflation is trending down and all the trend lines look good,” he said, adding that the fed funds rate should eventually return to its equilibrium level of around 4%. Beyond today’s decision, Zandi expects the Fed could cut rates several more times next year, but then pause to reassess. He expects Powell to avoid speculating on the impact of the new administration’s potential policy proposals, focusing instead on economic fundamentals. *This is not investment advice.

37808261,https://invezz.com/?p=2393888,1734541587,InceptionLRT and Amphor Labs join forces to revolutionize DeFi restaking infrastructure in LATAM,"InceptionLRT and Amphor Labs announced a pioneering agreement to develop a modular restaking architecture for the decentralized financial (DeFi) world in Latin America. This collaboration aims to rethink how players obtain rewards and manage risks in the ever-changing world of decentralized finance. According to material given with Cointelegraph in Spanish, this endeavour introduces a modular aggregation layer that successfully integrates several restaking infrastructures into a single comprehensive framework. The newly created protocol promises to reduce fragmentation while increasing operational efficiency by using strong technological standards, notably those based on Amphor-supported ERC protocols. The Meta-LRT Vault is the collaboration’s flagship feature, providing diverse exposure across well-established platforms such as EigenLayer, Symbiotic, Karak, and Jito. This integrated strategy strives to provide users with seamless access to a variety of DeFi alternatives, capturing the core of what modular infrastructures should offer in the ever-expanding DeFi ecosystem. By allowing users to simplify their staking methods, the alliance touts itself as a forward-thinking option in the competitive DeFi sector. Bridge chains for enhanced liquidity The system also includes omnichain bridging capabilities via the xERC-20 standard, which facilitates liquidity movements across different blockchain networks. This feature not only improves usability, but it also expands potential allocation techniques across networks such as Optimism and Arbitrum. This development, which allows assets to effortlessly transfer between different settings, has the potential to greatly enhance liquidity management in decentralized finance. The emphasis on interoperability represents a concerted effort to build a more unified ecosystem in which users may easily take advantage of unique opportunities across many blockchain platforms. Promoting decentralized financial access in Latin America InceptionLRT’s commitment to advancing decentralized banking in Latin America is expressed in the words of Gonçalo Afonso, CMO of InceptionLRT. “At InceptionLRT, we are committed to introducing decentralized finance to everyone in Latin America. Our objective is to deliver comprehensive, secure, and accessible financial solutions that enable people to take control of their economic futures”, said Afonso to Coingraph. We believe blockchain has the potential to offer genuine opportunities, promote growth, and impact lives throughout the area.” Afonso’s perspective emphasizes the need for increased access to financial resources in neglected communities. This perspective is particularly relevant as traditional financial systems continuously struggle to serve diverse populations. By leveraging the capabilities of blockchain technology, InceptionLRT and Amphor Labs aim to create a more equitable financial landscape. Balancing security and performance The alliance has been precisely crafted to provide the optimal balance between security and performance.

37807032,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111709,1734541577,dTRINITY Launches Subsidized Stablecoin Lending Protocol on Fraxtal L2,"Singapore, Singapore, December 18th, 2024, Chainwire dTRINITY , a next-generation stablecoin liquidity protocol, has announced its mainnet debut on the Fraxtal L2 network. The platform is designed to lower interest expenses and improve yields for stablecoin users, addressing the key challenge of rising credit costs in DeFi. At the core of dTRINITY is a protocol-native stablecoin (dUSD), which serves as the unified liquidity layer between its money markets (dLEND, an Aave v3 fork) and external liquidity pools (e.g., Curve). dUSD is backed 1:1 by an on-chain collateral reserve consisting of stablecoins such as USDC, FRAX, and DAI, as well as yieldcoins like sFRAX and sDAI. Exogenous yields from the reserve are redirected to fund ongoing interest rebates for dUSD borrowers on dLEND, based on their outstanding debts, which reduces the effective borrowing cost. This mechanism not only stimulates borrowing demand but also drives more sustainable utilization and yields for dUSD lenders. dTRINITY is launching on Fraxtal as its genesis network in a strategic collaboration with Frax to optimize ecosystem liquidity and user incentives. Fraxtal is an EVM-equivalent rollup with a scalable smart contract platform and efficient execution environment powered by the OP stack. Users can take advantage of Fraxtal’s fast transaction speed, low gas fees, robust network security, and unique blockspace rewards, further enhancing their benefits. In the near future, dTRINITY plans to expand to Ethereum and other emerging blockchains, strengthening cross-chain liquidity and interoperability with Fraxtal as the network scales. Key Features of dTRINITY: Subsidized Interest Rate Model: dTRINITY’s innovative subsidized interest rate model lowers the equilibrium of stablecoin borrowing costs on dLEND vs. other protocols without impacting lending yields. In fact, rebates at low utilization levels could even result in negative interest rates for dUSD borrowers (i.e., borrowers could get paid to borrow). Liquidity Incentives: dUSD lenders and liquidity providers benefit from a combination of protocol rewards and external incentives from strategic partners (in both points and tokens) for supplying and bolstering liquidity in the ecosystem. Security & Risk Management: dTRINITY has successfully completed smart contract audits with three leading blockchain security firms: Halborn, Verichains, and Cyberscope. Additionally, the protocol disables rehypothecation of supplied collateral by default to minimize risk exposure. dUSD is the only borrowable asset on dLEND and it cannot be borrowed against itself. Strategic Partnerships: In addition to Frax, dTRINITY also plans to collaborate symbiotically with other major DeFi protocols. First, dUSD can be expanded to other lending platforms (e.g., Fraxlend, Morpho), providing their users with similar subsidy benefits. Secondly, dUSD can serve as a cheaper medium of leverage for loopers using other stablecoins/yieldcoins (e.g., Ethena, crvUSD), increasing demand for both projects. Furthermore, the dUSD reserve’s composition will be diversified over time, opening up potential partnership opportunities with more stablecoin/yieldcoin projects. dTRINITY’s core contributors include the co-founders of Stably. The project has been in development since Q2 2024 and secured 1st place at both the ETHVietnam and Fraxtal Hackathons earlier this year. Strategically, dTRINITY is advised by the co-founders of Frax, Convex, Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Coin98, and Promontory Partners, bringing a wealth of expertise from leading stablecoin and DeFi pioneers to the protocol’s development.

37806982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629761,1734541130,President Trump picks crypto billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA,"Jared Isaacman, a crypto billionaire and founder of fintech giant Shift4, has been selected by President Donald Trump to lead NASA. He is also known for piloting the first all-civilian mission into orbit. Trump announced the decision on Truth Social, crediting Isaacman’s track record of bold leadership in technology and finance. Isaacman, who built a $9.3 billion company from scratch, doesn’t come from the world of government bureaucracy or traditional space exploration. Instead, he’s known for disrupting the payments industry with his company Shift4, which reportedly processes transactions for over 200,000 businesses. From crypto deals to space missions In 2022, Isaacman hosted a meeting in his New York apartment near Central Park. The glass-walled room became a brainstorming hub for integrating blockchain technology into Shift4’s payment systems. Bitcoin had recently hit record highs, and the crypto market was thriving, but Isaacman wasn’t interested in hype. His focus was on stablecoins. Alex Wilson and Pat Duffy, co-founders of crypto donation platform The Giving Block, were part of the meeting. They had just begun talks to sell their company to Shift4. With a whiteboard behind him, Isaacman laid out ways blockchain could transform payments. He wanted his merchants to accept crypto in any form customers preferred, whether that was Bitcoin or stablecoins. Weeks later, in March 2022, Shift4 bought The Giving Block for $54 million, with an additional $246 million in potential earnouts. The deal opened a $45 billion cross-sell opportunity by combining crypto donations with traditional payments. By October, Isaacman’s team had rolled out a Pay with Crypto service across all Shift4 merchants, including hotels, restaurants, and stadiums. “It’s the biggest step toward crypto payments becoming mainstream,” said Wilson. Isaacman was reportedly hands-on during the acquisition, sketching out blockchain integration strategies. Shift4’s crypto team, now led by Wilson and Duffy, has become a leader in pushing crypto payments into everyday life. The bull run remains strong Bitcoin shot past $108,000 just last night, up 55% since election night. The total crypto market cap has soared to over $3.7 trillion. Pro-crypto Congressional wins have created a favorable climate for cryptos, and institutions are piling in. Spot bitcoin ETFs, approved in January, have driven much of the momentum. They’ve opened new doors for institutional investors, while retail traders are diving back into the market. Stablecoins, now valued at $200 billion, are becoming a go-to tool for cross-border transactions. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC dominate the stablecoin market, with a combined supply of $182 billion. Together, they account for 90% of the market. But competition is heating up. Ripple recently launched its RLUSD stablecoin yesterday. Robinhood and Revolut are reportedly working on their own tokens. PayPal entered the game last year with PYUSD, which briefly hit a $1 billion market cap before declining. Even with its growth, the stablecoin market has seen its share of problems. TerraUSD collapsed in 2022, wiping out billions and shaking investor confidence. More recently, Tether has come under scrutiny from the Department of Justice for alleged violations of anti-money-laundering laws. Tether denies the accusations, calling them “pure speculation.” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/president-trump-picks-jared-to-lead-nasa/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37806982.jpeg

This new exchange-traded product (ETP) provides investors with access to a dynamically adjusted basket of up to 13 blockchain tokens. New ETP Offers Dynamic Exposure to Top 13 Blockchain Tokens The DDA Heliad Dynamic Blockchain ETP offers a new approach to cryptocurrency investing by tracking a dynamic index of leading blockchain tokens. According to DDA’s X post from Dec. 17, the ETP tracks the Heliad Dynamic Blockchain Index, which selects 13 cryptocurrencies “with an exclusive focus on user adoption, market traction and usage-based performance metrics”.

Current composition of the DDA Heliad Dynamic Blockchain ETP. Source: DDA “As the first of its kind, our index focuses exclusively on fundamentals-based factors such as real user activity and valuation discrepancies. This approach has produced stellar backtest results as well as strong current performance,” said Christopher Garlich, Managing Director at Heliad Crypto Partners. The ETP not only offers dynamic exposure to a diversified basket of tokens but also provides the security and accessibility of a regulated investment product. “By leveraging DDA’s white-label ETP platform, we enable our partner Heliad to bring their crypto investment strategy to market, while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, seamless exchange listings, and efficient index tracking,” added Dominik Poiger, Head of Product Management at DDA. 100% Physically Backed and Regulated The DDA Heliad Dynamic Blockchain ETP is 100% physically backed. DDA ETPs replicate the performance of the underlying index with a 3.2% management fee and “give the holder of the note a claim on the predefined amount of the assets (basket of cryptocurrencies).” According to DDA, digital assets are securely stored with regulated custodians like Coinbase Germany GmbH and Aplo, eliminating the need for investors to manage their own wallets and private keys. The ETP trades like a stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) on major European exchanges, such as Deutsche Börse Xetra, Euronext Paris & Amsterdam, SIX Swiss Exchange and Börse Stuttgart, providing liquidity and ease of access. Additionally, German investors benefit from tax-free gains after a one-year holding period . Crypto ETPs Continue to Attract Investors The global crypto ETP market continues its upward trajectory. ETFGI, a research and advisory firm, reported that assets invested in globally listed crypto ETPs reached a record high of $91.69 billion at the end of July. This surpasses the previous record of $84.69 billion set in March 2024, and represents an increase of 506.4% since the end of 2023. According to ETFGI, this surge in assets is being driven by strong investor interest, with net inflows of $11.02 billion in July. Year-to-date, net inflows have already reached $56.62 billion, demonstrating a growing appetite for regulated and accessible crypto investment products. This trend is further evidenced by the increasing number of crypto ETP listings, with 208 products and 551 listings available on 20 exchanges in 16 countries (data as of August 2024).

Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" it surged in value in 2021, becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, exceeding $50 billion. This rise was influenced by social media and figures like Elon Musk. Dogecoin's potential lies in its strong community and widespread recognition.

The benefits of BTCfi SatLayer, Babylon’s designated restaking partner, strives to utilize BTC’s substantial liquidity, capital efficiency, and security for other systems like bridges, decentralized exchanges, and oracles. Using smart contracts on the Babylon Chain, SatLayer allows for fully programmable slashing with minimal trust assumptions.

In addition to this project, SatLayer will join forces on other major Sui projects, such as Navi, Suilend, Aftermath, Cetus, and Ika, to improve the utility of BVSes and Bitcoin on the wider Move developer ecosystem. Jameel Khalfan, Global Head of Ecosystem at Sui Foundation, expressed excitement with the collaboration: ‘Sui’s move into Bitcoin DeFi points to Sui Foundation’s commitment to be a destination for BTCfi. The combination of Bitcoin’s size and security with Sui’s speed and scalability gives developers and users new possibilities to build on Bitcoin. We couldn’t be more excited.’ Luke Xie, the co-founder and CEO of SatLayer, also commented on the benefits of this partnership: ‘Sui is the perfect Layer 1 blockchain to utilize Bitcoin’s unmatched security and liquidity.

Sharing the positive sentiment, Fisher Yu, the CTO of Babylon Labs said: ‘We’re excited to play a key role in bringing Bitcoin to Sui. By combining Babylon Bitcoin staking with SatLayer’s restaking framework, the Sui ecosystem now has the building blocks for a powerful onchain Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem.

Fantom (FTM) Eyes Breakout as Altcoin Season Approaches Fantom has experienced impressive growth, with its price increasing nearly 80% over the past month. Currently trading between $1.14 and $1.59, the coin is showing bullish momentum. Technical indicators like the RSI and stochastic suggest that Fantom is poised for an upward move. If it can surpass the immediate resistance at $1.75, it may ascend toward the next target at $2.20, which would almost double its current price. With simple moving averages aligning favorably and a six-month gain of over 140%, Fantom stands ready to capitalize on the anticipated altcoin season and could see substantial gains in the near future. dYdX (DYDX) Signals Potential Upswing Amid Growing Altcoin Momentum dYdX (DYDX) is showing signs of a potential upswing, trading between $1.65 and $2.69. Despite a slight dip of nearly 7% in the past week, it has impressively climbed over 48% in the last month and more than 35% over six months. The RSI is around 37, indicating it may be approaching oversold territory, which often precedes a price increase. If DYDX breaks through the nearest resistance at $3.20, it could target the next level around $4.24, marking a substantial gain. With the anticipation of an altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, DYDX might be poised for significant growth in the coming period. Kaia (KAIA) Eyes Breakout After 92% Monthly Surge Kaia (KAIA) has soared 92% in the past month, now trading between $0.24 and $0.34. The coin is approaching the key resistance level at $0.38. If it breaks through, the next target is $0.47, which could mean significant gains. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close at $0.27 and $0.28, showing consolidation. The RSI sits at 44.02, suggesting room for upward movement. With the global crypto bull run on the horizon, Kaia could rise further, potentially exceeding previous highs. Jupiter (JUP) Aims for Breakout as Altcoin Season Nears Jupiter (JUP) is trading between $0.91 and $1.32, showing signs of consolidation before a potential upward move. The nearest resistance is at $1.54; breaking above this could lead to a rally toward $1.95, a possible gain of nearly 50% from current prices. The 6-month price change is up 35.12%, indicating positive momentum. Technical indicators like the RSI at 44.66 and Stochastic at 30.96 suggest there is room for growth before reaching overbought levels. While the MACD is slightly negative at -0.0039, a shift to positive could signal the start of a new uptrend. With altcoin season on the horizon, JUP may be poised for significant gains. Conclusion Although FTM, DYDX, KAIA, and JUP may have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all.

Binance announced that it would be delisting WazirX, Kaon, and Bluzelle as part of a routine review of tokens that were no longer in compliance with its offering standards. The delisting of a token from major exchanges is frequently interpreted as a lack of confidence in the token’s viability or future.

Lastly, Binance has advised users to close any open positions and manage their holdings before the deadlines to avoid issues. The new probe on WazirX Following recent developments, the Delhi police’s status report regarding the WRX breach case has been rejected by the High Court, which has mandated a new investigation. Advocate Jaivir Bains submitted a petition to the court, which requested a criminal investigation into the WazirX hack. It is important to note that the Delhi police had initially declared that no case could be established. However, Justice Sanjeev Narula has requested a new status report by February 13, 2025.

However, WazirX has been criticized for its crisis management in relation to the processes of fund recovery and user communication. WazirX 2024 troubles WazirX was hacked in July of this year, resulting in a loss of $235 million in crypto holdings. The stolen amounts include $96.7 million in Shiba Inu, $52.6 million in Ether, $11 million in Matic, and $7.6 million in Pepe. Following the hack, the corporation launched a bounty campaign to track down the lost crypto. Cyfirma, a cybersecurity organization, finally identified the perpetrators of the crime as a North Korean hacker cell. Despite its efforts to retrieve assets, WazirX stated that 43% of customer funds have been irreversibly lost. In addition, WazirX claimed that Binance was responsible for repaying its creditors as it had allegedly acquired WazirX. However, Binance denied making any such deal, asserting in September that it had never owned or controlled WazirX. Although a contract had been signed between the parties, the anticipated transaction was never completed. Binance argued that WazirX is owned by Zanmai Labs, which is registered with the Indian Financial Intelligence Unit.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
37806146,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394816,1734539852,Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Reserve Is Unlikely; Warns BTC Sell-Off Under Trump,"The post Arthur Hayes Says Bitcoin Reserve Is Unlikely; Warns BTC Sell-Off Under Trump appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, has recently warned that Bitcoin may experience a “vicious sell-off” when Donald Trump takes office. In a detailed blog post , Hayes expressed skepticism about Trump’s ability to fulfill his ambitious promises regarding cryptocurrency, including making the U.S. “the crypto capital of the world” and establishing a Bitcoin reserve. Hayes Doubtful Over Trump’s Policy Implementation Hayes articulates that his administration will only have 12 months to enact his ambitious policies. He believes Trump will face significant political challenges, with much of his term overshadowed by the 2026 midterm elections, making it difficult to enact meaningful change.. “It is almost impossible for Trump to appease his base sufficiently to prevent the Democrats from retaking both legislative bodies in 2026. The people are impatient because they are desperate,” he writes. When this realization sets in among the markets, he says a “harrowing dump” lies in store for Bitcoin and other so-called “Trump trades,” he noted. Bitcoin Reserve Unlikely? Hayes also dismissed the idea of a U.S. Bitcoin reserve, suggesting it won’t materialize, and emphasized that the mere threat of such a reserve could create buying pressure. Arthur Hayes suggests that if the U.S. government devalues the dollar by printing more money and uses some of it to buy Bitcoin, the fiat price of Bitcoin will rise. This would trigger other nations to follow suit and purchase Bitcoin to keep up, causing its price to increase significantly. While Hayes believes that while long-term Bitcoin holders may eventually sell at a high fiat price, the U.S. Bitcoin Reserve (BSR) is unlikely to happen. He argues that politicians would prioritize using newly created dollars for populist measures to secure votes in upcoming elections. Rapid Devaluation Of USD Hayes believes that Trump, with the help of his economic advisor, Mark Bessent, will initiate a rapid devaluation of the U.S. dollar, likely through a dollar-to-gold devaluation in the first half of 2025. This move aims to create a competitive economic environment in the U.S., boost domestic production, and win support for the Republican agenda. Hayes predicts that “another pillar to the crypto bull market” could arise if Mainland Chinese investors are eventually allowed to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong. Additionally, Hayes predicted that EU leaders would secretly buy cryptocurrencies while ordinary citizens suffer from inflation. Hayes believes that Trump’s economic policies will trigger global shifts in currency values and financial systems, with Bitcoin and crypto acting as key beneficiaries in the medium to long term. Nevertheless, while Hayes remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, forecasting its rise to $1 million, he also remarked that the path to this goal will be volatile, with significant price corrections along the way.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-says-bitcoin-reserve-is-unlikely-warns-btc-sell-off-under-trump/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37806345,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99074,1734539771,Will The Next Ether Outflow Swing Solana Price Above $250?,"Crypto assets have picked up bullish momentum in the last 48 hours as macro sentiments flip green. Following Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high, altcoins have traded upwards in the same time frame. This surge has seen several analysts speculate fund movements between assets. Ethereum’s significant jump above $4K could lead to flows to other top smart contract blockchains like Solana. Solana To Gain On ETH Flows Solana has outpaced other altcoins in bull cycles and picked up flows from other networks’ decentralized finance (DeFi) volume. This is due to the network’s growing smart contract popularity and surging institutional demand as bulls await spot SOL ETF approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On Dec 17, early trading saw ETH retest the $4K mark, breaking past the psychological level. The asset is up 2% today and 7.7% in the last seven days, raising optimism about a wider swing in altcoins. Ethereum has also recorded flows to its DeFi ecosystem as activities spiked since the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections. With these inflows to the altcoin leader breaking a key resistance level as projected by analysts, other tokens are gaining traction. Solana, an institutional favourite, has been up 5% in the last 24 hours to trade at $225, while weekly numbers also grew by 5.2%. Aside from previous events in which Solana led the altcoin run, speculations on its price are propelled by key factors. Institutional flows on the back of anticipated ETF approvals have seen SOL notch major wins. Several bulls target a $250 price in the short term from the next price rally. While trading volumes are up 26%, the total volume locked on the ecosystem stands at $9.07 billion, with a surge in daily fees and active addresses. SOL Fundamentals Remain Strong SOL price remains bullish alongside the wider market, and coupled with whale accumulations , commentators suggest a major uphill swing is on the cards. The asset also outperformed Bitcoin after the latter’s institutional inflow cooled following the Q1 jump. Meme coins are also a major driver of the ecosystem with major tokens recording skyrocketing inflows. Crypto enthusiast Alpha_pls explained the growing dominance of SOL compared to other assets. “ SOL did spectacularly well against BTC because it became the leading L1 during the last 18 months. Much of the outperformance was a repricing based on fundamentals. It’s still in pole position with users and volume, if we are in a raging bull market in 2025 then all of adoption will continue to go up. I’m a fundamentals guy, not a trader or TA specialist. I firmly believe that fundamentals eventually reflect on the chart, though.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | SOL,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/will-the-next-ether-outflow-swing-solana-price-above-250/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

However, token holders appear to be dumping their holdings on exchanges, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Dogwifhat (WIF) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Today, December 18, 2024, the overall cryptocurrency market is witnessing a price decline. Amid this, some assets seem to be consolidating in a tight range, while others fail to hold crucial levels. Source: Trading View The WIF meme coin has failed to hold its critical golden Fibonacci level and the support of the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, this breakdown has shifted the meme coin into a bearish trend. Based on the recent price action, if WIF closes a daily candle below the $2.565 level, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 23% to reach the next support level at $2. $10 Million Worth of WIF Inflow This bearish outlook is further supported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from WIF’s spot inflow/outflow metrics revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant $10 million worth of WIF inflows in the past 48 hours. Source: Coinglass This substantial inflow indicates a bearish sign for holders, as inflow refers to the movement of assets from whale wallets to exchanges, showing a lack of interest in holding. This could result in selling pressure and further price decline. When combining these on-chain metrics with the technical analysis, it appears that bears are currently dominating the meme coin, which could support short sellers in achieving a 23% price decline in the future. Current Price Momentum At press time, WIF is trading near $2.52 and has experienced a price decline of over 12% in the past 24 hours.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price dipped by 3.14%. Over the last month, however, it gained nearly 10%. Looking at the past six months, DOGE surged by an impressive 228.17%. This shows significant long-term growth despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, DOGE is trading between $0.3588 and $0.4603. Its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, around $0.403. The Relative Strength Index stands at 47.39, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is below 30, which might suggest the coin is oversold. The MACD level is slightly above zero, hinting at potential upward momentum. Based on these indicators, DOGE could be poised for a rise. If it moves up, it may face resistance at $0.5145. Breaking this level could lead to the next resistance at $0.6160, which is about 35% higher than current prices. On the downside, support exists at $0.3115. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 12%. The data suggests that DOGE has room to grow if it can overcome these hurdles. Conclusion Though DOGE and other coins are strong, XYZVerse stands out, blending meme culture and sports, aiming for 20,000% growth in the ongoing bull market.

Recently, Terra has rolled out new updates as the community tries to revive the ecosystem after the infamous implosion in 2022 that saw huge losses. The new V3.3.0 upgrade seeks to attract developers to the network and restructures tax handling. Binance Backs Upgrade In a new announcement to its community, Binance noted that it will suspend deposits and withdrawals to support a smooth user experience during the network’s upgrade. Within the specified time, Binance will handle all technical issues for its users, stressing that trading on the network will continue smoothly. Following the upgrade, transactions (withdrawals and deposits) will restart when the network is deemed stable. The crypto community lauded Binance for supporting the ecosystem, with users calling for more collaboration. “ BREAKING: @binance announces support for the $LUNC v.3.3.0 upgrade.

Pepe ( PEPE ), the third-largest meme coin globally, fell to a low of $0.00002117, marking its lowest level since December 6. This decline coincided with broader cryptocurrency market losses. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell to $104,400, retreating from its record high of $108,000. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies dropped by 5% to $3.82 trillion. Pepe plunged in a high-volume environment. According to CoinGecko , its 24-hour volume was $2.2 billion, much higher than Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) $725 million. The ongoing crypto sell-off is happening as traders wait for the upcoming Federal Reserve decision . This will be an important decision because it will set the tone for what to expect in 2025. Analysts expect that the bank will slash interest rates for the third time this year and hint towards a pause in the coming year.

The coin initially formed a falling wedge pattern, a typically bullish indicator, but this pattern has now been invalidated. The coin has also dropped below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since November 26. Additionally, it has formed a three red crows pattern, which happens when three bearish candles follow each other. In the near term, Pepe’s price may continue falling. The bearish trend will solidify if the coin drops below the 50-day moving average at $0.00001933 and the Ichimoku cloud. Conversely, a bullish reversal would be confirmed if the coin surpasses key resistance levels at $0.000026 (the November 14 swing high) and the all-time high of $0.00002833.

Historically, similar fluctuations have preceded large price hikes. The whale that executed this transfer originally purchased the tokens for 0.0135 ETH (about $27), resulting in an amazing return on investment of roughly 1.9 million percent.

Technical figures support the positive vibe. Currently at $0.00002442, the 10-Day Moving Average shows short-term resistance; the 50-Day Moving Average indicates major support. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) comes out to be 54.4, suggesting neutral momentum with possibility for more development. The MACD also shows some positive activity, which supports the idea that a price increase is just around the bend. Healthy Crypto Market The cryptocurrency market as a whole is getting better, and this rise in whale activity is happening at the same time. This is especially true as Ethereum (ETH) gets closer to $4,000. In the past, other cryptocurrencies, even meme coins like PEPE, have grown along with ETH. Analysts are making comparisons to earlier this year, when similar whale moves happened before PEPE’s price went up. PEPE Price Set For Big Upside Analysts believe that if PEPE maintains its pace and breaks important resistance levels, it might reach values as high as $0.000058, or possibly $0.0001 in favorable market conditions. However, meeting such lofty goals will need ongoing investor interest and larger market trends. Related Reading: New ATH: Bitcoin Tops $106K—Is FOMO And Strategic Reserve The Game-Changer?

The RSI is at 53.92, indicating neutral conditions. This suggests room for the price to move higher. If ADA continues its upward momentum, it could test the nearest resistance at $1.35. Breaking this level might lead towards $1.63. Reaching $1.35 would be an increase of about 10% from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.78, a drop of around 15%. Traders should watch these levels as indicators of ADA's potential movement. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a mixed performance recently. In the past week, its price dipped by 3.14%. Over the last month, however, it gained nearly 10%. Looking at the past six months, DOGE surged by an impressive 228.17%. This shows significant long-term growth despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, DOGE is trading between $0.3588 and $0.4603. Its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, around $0.403. The Relative Strength Index stands at 47.39, indicating a neutral market. The stochastic oscillator is below 30, which might suggest the coin is oversold. The MACD level is slightly above zero, hinting at potential upward momentum. Based on these indicators, DOGE could be poised for a rise. If it moves up, it may face resistance at $0.5145. Breaking this level could lead to the next resistance at $0.6160, which is about 35% higher than current prices. On the downside, support exists at $0.3115. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of around 12%. The data suggests that DOGE has room to grow if it can overcome these hurdles. XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth in recent months. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 436.51%. In the last month alone, it increased by 135.70%, and the past week saw a rise of 19.43%. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.03 and $2.73, showcasing strong market performance. Technical indicators suggest this upward trend might continue. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.63, above the 100-day average of $2.45, indicating short-term strength. The Relative Strength Index stands at 63.73, below the overbought threshold, leaving room for further growth. Additionally, the MACD level is positive at 0.0520, signaling bullish momentum. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $3.02. Breaking this could see XRP aiming for the second resistance at $3.73, a potential increase of around 37%. On the downside, support levels are at $1.61 and $0.9041, which may help cushion any pullbacks. Overall, the data points to a positive outlook for XRP, with potential for continued gains in the near future. Conclusion While ADA, DOGE, and XRP continue to perform well in the current bull run, XYZVerse (XYZ) may stand out with its unique mix of sports and meme culture.

A wave of profit-taking has triggered a price correction, leaving investors wary of further declines. Meanwhile, 1Fuel has been making waves during this presale, showcasing a surge in investor interest and growing confidence in its future value. With analysts predicting exponential growth upon listing, major investors are pivoting away from Pepe and turning towards 1Fuel. PEPE Value Declines in a Week Pepe (PEPE), the third-largest memecoin, has experienced significant volatility over the past month. After reaching an all-time high of $0.00002830 on December 9, 2024, its value has since declined to approximately $0.00002365, with a market cap around $10.30 billion. Despite a 154% gain over the last month, recent trading sessions have shown a downward trend, with a 6.62% decrease in the past 24 hours. This decline in value and trading volume suggests a potential decrease in network activity and user interest. The drop in active addresses may indicate waning enthusiasm for PEPE, prompting investors to explore emerging altcoins like 1Fuel. 1Fuel offers unique features and presents an alternative to traditional decentralized wallets, attracting those seeking innovative solutions in the crypto space. 1Fuel Reveals Investor Confidence in Presale The 1Fuel live presale has made remarkable progress, reflecting growing investor confidence in the token’s potential. One key factor driving this momentum is the influx of PEPE whales switching to 1Fuel. They have recognized the value of securing the coin at an incredibly low price of $0.012. Analysts predict that 1Fuel could achieve an impressive 88x growth once it is publicly listed. This positions it as one of the altcoins to buy today, ahead of 2025. Stage 1 of the presale sold out rapidly and stage 2 is already 30% complete within a couple of days. As one of the most promising crypto coins, 1Fuel has already sold over 70 million tokens during the presale. It has revealed extensive features and a robust growth trajectory, especially with its DeFi features that set it apart from Ledger and Trust Wallet, and other traditional crypto wallets. Innovative DEX Features Drive 1Fuel OFT Growth 1Fuel OFT is transforming the crypto landscape with its cutting-edge features, leading to the token’s rapid growth. At the heart of 1Fuel’s appeal is its decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet which comes with cross-chain compatibility and one-click transactions. Unlike competitors like Ledger and Trust Wallet, the 1Fuel DEX wallet allows users to interact with multiple blockchains from a single interface. This eliminates the need for multiple wallets and simplifies transactional. 1Fuel also has unique features like cold storage and an inbuilt privacy mixer which allows your transactions to be done anonymously. Most traditional wallets like Trust Wallet and Ledger lack inbuilt security features while 1Fuel sets a new standards for privacy. As one of the most promising crypto coins, 1Fuel OFT is already gaining momentum in its presale stages. Analysts are predicting significant growth, especially as 1Fuel is positioned to lead the DeFi sector. Crypto Pros Switching to 1Fuel Crypto whales are switching to 1Fuel and trying to take advantage of the token before its public listing. With the presale offering the lowest price possible, investors can expect the value to skyrocket in 2025. 1Fuel’s innovative features and user-first approach set it apart as a reliable investment.

Donald Trump Meets Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek In a December 16 X post by Marszalek, the crypto mogul can be seen standing next to the incoming president with the caption: “honored to have a seat at the table.” Honored to have a seat at the table. pic.twitter.com/KvK0XyEdYZ — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) December 17, 2024 According to reports, the pair discussed the development of a federal bitcoin stockpile as well as generating a crypto-friendly regulatory framework . Shortly following the meeting, news broke that Crypto.com had officially dropped a lawsuit filed in October alleging regulatory overreach. “Improper SEC enforcement actions are part of the process of operating a legitimate and licensed crypto business in the U.S.,” an October statement from the company announcing legal action against the federal regulator reads in part. “While this is an unprecedented move for our company to file suit against a federal agency, actions by that agency towards our industry have left us no other choice,” Crypto.com continues. The cryptocurrency exchange’s decision to repeal its lawsuit against the SEC could signal its growing optimism over Trump’s approach to regulating the blockchain sector as a whole ahead of his inauguration next month. “We look forward to working with the new administration to develop and advance clear regulations for the crypto industry so the U.S. can become a global leader in digital assets and innovation,” a spokesperson for the Marszalek-led organization told Bloomberg. The Future Of U.S. Crypto Regulation Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has long pledged to enact crypto-friendly regulation in the U.S. “We will have regulations,” Trump stated at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference this past summer, adding, “but from now on, the rules will be written by the people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” In the leadup to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the former reality television star vowed to fire current SEC Chair Gary Gensler for his regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets. Gensler, who announced his resignation from the government agency last month, is slated to be replaced by former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins after he was tapped by Trump to spearhead the regulator. However, it remains to be seen just what crypto regulations will look like under Donald Trump.

Unlikely, but These 3 XRP Rivals Under $1 Could Turn $300 into $60,000 This Bull Run!","While XRP soaring to double digits seems improbable, the crypto landscape is brimming with low-cost coins poised for massive gains. Amid this bullish surge, some under-a-dollar tokens could transform modest investments into substantial windfalls, capturing the attention of keen market watchers. One such contender is XYZVerse (XYZ), an innovative memecoin uniting sports enthusiasts across various disciplines, aiming for explosive growth through community engagement and a unique blend of meme culture and athletics. Trump's Victory Sparks Crypto Chaos: $XYZ Meme Coin Ready to Deliver a 99,900% Knockout Donald Trump’s election victory has triggered a seismic shift in the crypto market, setting the stage for a bull run like no other. As the dust settles, major coins limp forward with uninspiring double-digit gains, while meme coins are stealing the show. PNUT’s recent 4,500% surge? FRED’s 6,000% explosion? Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge. Take the XYZ Side - The Undisputed Champion of Meme Coins $XYZ Breaks into the Ring to Knockout Meme Coin Legends Meet $XYZ - the first-ever all-sports memecoins for true crypto degens hungry for 1000X profits. This is the token for those who thrive on the thrill of competition. As Trump takes the reins, the crypto market is set to erupt so the competition is getting fierce. Only the strongest tokens can survive in this no-mercy arena. Here comes the dawn of a crypto era for those with balls of steel — the guys like Joe Rogan and Dana White — who’d proudly rally behind Trump’s team. With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

Kaspa (KAS) Kaspa is a new cryptocurrency that aims to be faster and more secure than others. It uses a special technology called GHOSTDAG. Unlike other blockchains that reject blocks made at the same time, Kaspa lets them coexist. This means it can process more transactions quickly. Right now, it creates one block per second, but it hopes to reach 10 blocks per second soon, and even dreams of 100 per second. With this speed, transactions can be confirmed almost instantly. Kaspa's advanced features like Reachability and Block data pruning make it stand out. These tools help manage the network efficiently and reduce storage needs. In the future, Kaspa plans to support layer 2 solutions, which can make the network even more scalable. In the current market, where speed and scalability are crucial, Kaspa looks very promising. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Kaspa's technology could give it an edge. Its focus on fast transactions and future-proof features might attract more users and investors. TRON (TRX) TRON (TRX) is shaking up the digital world by putting content creators first. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, TRON moved away from Ethereum to build its own network. Its main goal is simple: let creators own their work and earn more from it. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a big cut, TRON lets fans reward creators directly. This means artists, writers, and other creators can get fair pay for their efforts. But TRON isn't just about content. It's also a platform for building apps without middlemen. Developers can create decentralized apps, known as dApps, on TRON's network. This is similar to what Ethereum offers, but with fewer fees and faster transactions. In a world where transaction costs can hold back innovation, TRON provides a solution. With its focus on a decentralized internet and support for smart contracts, TRON could be a game-changer. As the market evolves, TRX stands out by offering real value to both creators and consumers. Compared to other coins, its dedication to empowering users makes it an attractive option. Conclusion While KAS and TRX are strong contenders, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends sports and memes, aiming for 20,000% growth and potentially turning $300 into $60,000 this bull run.

Hayes thinks the disparity between the crypto investors’ high expectations of the forthcoming President Trump government and reality will lead to a brutal sell-off in the cryptocurrency market. A Gap Between High Expectations And No Quick Solutions In his Dec. 18 “Trump Truth” blog post , Hayes noted that the market believes Trump will immediately achieve economic and political miracles.” However, there are “no politically acceptable solutions” for President-elect Trump to quickly make sweeping policy changes widely anticipated by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. “The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on around January 20th,” Hayes wrote. “This realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades.” Bitcoin and the broader crypto market saw a tremendous uplift following Trump’s presidential victory in early November. BTC soared over 50% since Trump’s win to a new all-time high of $108,135 on Tuesday. While questions remain about whether Trump will fulfill his slew of pre-election promises, including making the U.S. the crypto capital of the planet , others are confident recent developments are spurring momentum. U.S. Likely Won’t Buy Bitcoin Trump’s impending return to the White House has raised hopes of a drastic change in crypto regulation as the ex-POTUS recently promised to “do something great with crypto,” including a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. Although Hayes praised the BTC strategic reserve development, he doesn’t believe it will indeed materialize. In his opinion, politicians would prefer to spend newly created U.S. dollars on public goods than buy Bitcoin. Nevertheless, he remains optimistic about BTC’s long-term trajectory, observing that talks of a Bitcoin strategic reserve have created significant buying pressure in the market. The Maelstrom CIO added: “While I don’t believe the US government will purchase Bitcoin, it doesn’t affect my positive price outlook.” Hayes Predicts Catastrophic Crypto Drop Ahead The former BitMEX boss forecasted that before we enter the “crack-up-boom phase in this crypto bull market”, crypto will experience a “harrowing dump” around Trump’s coronation day on January 20. He indicated that his firm Maelstrom is planning to reduce its holdings in advance, expecting to buy at lower prices. That being said, Hayes admits his strategy could backfire by clearing positions early while the ballistic crypto bull rally continues through Trump’s January inauguration. “Knowing this, we are committed to admitting defeat if the bull market steamrolls through January 20th, licking our wounds and getting back on the bull,” he concluded.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/crypto-to-face-harrowing-crash-around-trumps-inauguration-before-absolute-monster-run-warns-arthur-hayes/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Donald and Elon are Best Buddies for Meme Coins Donald Trump’s love for crypto is no secret — he’s promised to make the U.S. the global crypto leader in his campaign.

Its RSI of 37.99 suggests it's not yet overbought, leaving room for more gains. If it breaks past $0.05857 resistance, it could aim for $0.07311, marking potential growth of over 40%. However, failure to hold support at $0.02949 may pull it lower. A 10-day SMA below the 100-day points to short-term caution but doesn't overshadow its impressive monthly climb. If bullish momentum continues, JasmyCoin could ride the wave into a much larger rally soon. VeChain (VET) Poised for a Breakout Amid Bullish Momentum VeChain is trading between $0.05 and $0.07 after a dip of 1.43% this week. Its monthly surge of 72.28% and six-month rise of 105.47% hint at strong recovery potential. The RSI at 46 suggests it’s not yet overbought, leaving room for growth. If VET breaches the $0.08 resistance, it could jump to $0.0982, offering a potential 40% rally from current levels. A slip to the $0.04 support could delay the rise, but bulls seem ready to push higher. Conclusion JASMY and VET show modest potential for short-term growth but may appeal to cautious investors. For those seeking massive returns, DOGEN stands out as a bold choice. It is crafted for high achievers, promising a 700% increase by the presale’s end and massive returns this altcoin season, inspired by previous market successes. DOGEN embodies leadership, luxury, and ambition.

37805584,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629729,1734538710,"UK November inflation soars to 2.6%, meeting economists’ expectations","UK inflation data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that inflation in the jurisdiction soared to 2.6% in November, aligning with economists’ forecasts. Data released by the Office for National Statistics shows that the UK’s November Year-on-Year (YoY) inflation rose to 2.6% from 2.3% recorded in the 12 months leading to October. This marked a second consecutive monthly increase. Consumer Price Index with housing costs (CPIH) surges by 3.5% According to the released data , the Consumer Price Index, including owner-occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH), surged by 3.5% in the 12 months to November 2024, up from 3.2% in the 12 months to October in the UK. The monthly CPIH increased by 0.2% in November 2024, compared with a 0.1% fall recorded in November 2023. The monthly CPI rose by 0.1% in November 2024 in the UK, compared with a fall of 0.2% in November 2023. The November Core Consumer Price Index (YoY) came in at 3.5%, falling short of Reuters’ 3.6% forecast by 0.1%. The November MoM Core CPI fell to 0.0% from 0.4%. Headline price rises that were initially expected to tick higher in the following months hit a three-and-a-half-year low of 1.7% in September. The projected uptick was partly due to an increased regulator-set energy price cap this winter. Joe Nellis, an economic adviser at accountancy MHA, projected that the upward trend could continue in the next few months, citing the long-term pressures of a tight domestic labor market as well as the energy market. Nellis also added that the underlying structural issues would be worsened and aggravated by the government’s recent decisions, which include higher public sector pay settlements and increased minimum wage. He also mentioned that the pressure on businesses caused by a surge in tax contributions could also inflame the structural issues. Inflation persistence hints at BOE unlikelihood to cut interest rates Inflation has persisted in the service sector, which makes up the dominant part of the economy of the UK. The rising inflation in the sector has led to a high likelihood of no interest rate cut during the Bank of England’s final meeting of the year. The Office for National Statistics reported earlier this week that regular wage growth strengthened by rising from 4.9% over July-September to 5.2% over the August-October period. The growth further reinforced speculations about the interest rate cuts. Research group Capital Economics supports the claim that the BOE will most likely rule out the expected December rate cut. According to George Dibb, associate director for economic policy at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), the overall inflation figures were broadly in line with projections made by the central bank of England. Dibb raised concerns that the UK’s weaker-than-expected growth now lags behind the Bank’s projections. If the Bank of England decides to leave the monetary policy unchanged in its final meeting, the central bank will complete the year with only two interest rate cuts that have brought the rates from 5.25% to 4.75%. Meanwhile, the U.S. central bank is expected to slash rates by 0.25 points during its last meeting on Wednesday, bringing its total yearly cuts to a full percentage point.

As part of the collaboration, a governance proposal was submitted to integrate sUSDe as the underlying collateral asset in WLFI’s upcoming Aave model. If the proposal is approved, WLFI users will be able to earn rewards in both sUSDe and WLFI tokens. This integration is expected to significantly increase the stablecoin’s liquidity and increase usage rates on the protocol, following the successful integration of sUSDe into Aave’s Core instance. The proposal aims to include sUSDe as a suitable collateral asset for WLFI’s Aave v3 model, allowing the platform to leverage Ethena’s Total Value Locked (TVL) and user base. The integration will also facilitate increased usage for stablecoin deposits. To support this, the Ethena Foundation has committed to co-incentivizing sUSDe deposits, which could further fuel market growth. The implementation of the proposal is subject to the full approval and activation of the Aave model by Aave management.

It enables fast and low-cost transactions and works without banks or central authorities. The currency is designed to be used globally and resists censorship or forgery. Its 100 billion supply was created at launch, and Ripple, a company connected to XRP, uses it to improve payment systems. Ripple placed most of this supply in escrow to control its release. XRP aims to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. Its decentralized and scalable technology could appeal to users and businesses seeking efficient financial solutions. The coin's value and adoption depend on its real-world use and interest in its innovative payment features. Cardano (ADA): A Scalable and Energy-Efficient Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts and decentralized apps. It uses ADA as its native cryptocurrency, supporting payments, staking, and storing value. Cardano is energy-efficient due to the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system. Its two-layer structure separates transaction processing from smart contract functions, enhancing speed and scalability. The platform can handle potentially up to a million transactions per second. ADA rivals Ethereum's ETH and enables secure, low-cost interactions. Launched with unique technical features, Cardano aims to be sustainable and adaptable. Its innovative technology and eco-friendly design make it an attractive choice in the current cryptocurrency market. TRON (TRX): A Decentralized Platform for Digital Content and dApps TRON (TRX) is a blockchain-based platform launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation. It started as an Ethereum-based token but transitioned to its own network in 2018. The project focuses on giving content creators full control and offering direct rewards from consumers without intermediaries. TRON supports smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and multiple blockchain systems. Its transaction system is based on a public ledger similar to Bitcoin. TRON aims to build a decentralized internet, allowing developers to create dApps and users to share content without high fees. This accessibility and focus on direct compensation make TRX a potentially appealing cryptocurrency in today's market. Toncoin: A Decentralized Cryptocurrency with Ecosystem Potential Toncoin is the cryptocurrency of The Open Network, a blockchain initially created by Telegram. After Telegram ceased its involvement in 2020, the project was continued by the TON Foundation and community contributors. This blockchain uses a proof-of-stake model, prioritizing scalability and low transaction fees. Toncoin supports features like decentralized storage, DNS, anonymous networking, and payment services. Analysts predict Toncoin could reach yearly highs of $30.30 by 2025 and $26.04 by 2030, depending on market trends. With its focus on efficiency and ecosystem development, Toncoin shows growth potential in the long term. Conclusion XRP, ADA, TRX, and TON show steady progress but carry limited short-term potential. In contrast, DOGEN stands out as a symbol of prestige and ambition. With an expected 700% presale growth and massive future returns, it mirrors the success of past tokens while fostering a strong community of market leaders.DOGEN targets those chasing excellence.

37806183,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320805,1734538580,"Hong Kong SFC Approves Four New Virtual Asset Providers, Expanding Licensed VATPs","The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has officially approved four new virtual asset trading platform (VATP) providers, significantly expanding the region’s regulatory framework for virtual assets. The newly approved entities—Hong Kong Digital Asset EX Limited (HKbitEX), Accumulus GBA Technology (Hong Kong) Co., Limited (Accumulus), DFX Labs Company Limited, and Thousand Whales Technology (BVI) Limited (EX.IO)—join three previously licensed platforms, bringing the total number of authorized providers to seven. Source: SFC.hk Hong Kong Virtual Asset Providers: Has Licensing Gotten Easier? Adding these four VATPs aligns with Hong Kong’s regulatory body’s objectives of enhancing investor protection and maintaining market integrity through transparent regulations. The licensed platforms are required to adhere to stringent compliance measures, including anti-money laundering protocols, robust cybersecurity systems, and transparency in operations. Among the newly approved platforms, HKbitEX and Accumulus have already garnered attention within the Hong Kong community for their innovative approaches to digital asset trading. HKbitEX offers advanced over-the-counter (OTC) trading solutions to bridge the gap between institutional and retail investors. Accumulus, on the other hand, offers crypto trading but emphasizes seamless integration into Hong Kong’s traditional financial systems. These platforms, along with DFX Labs and Thousand Whales, are expected to operate maximally in alignment with the regulatory rules. The SFC’s licensing process is meticulous. It thoroughly evaluates each applicant’s business model, governance structure, and compliance capabilities. Growing Virtual Asset Ecosystem In Hong Kong The expansion of licensed VATPs in Hong Kong is a pivotal moment for the global virtual asset ecosystem, particularly for the country itself. It is a shift towards greater regulatory acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream financial markets. The increased number of licensed platforms provides more choices and greater security assurance for investors. Licensed VATPs are held to high standards of operation, reducing the risks associated with unregulated platforms. Despite these advancements, challenges remain. While licensing VATPs is a step in the right direction, sustained efforts are needed to constantly educate investors about the benefits and risks of crypto trading. According to a report on December 17, Hong Kong will adopt the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) to enhance tax transparency and combat cross-border tax evasion. Hong Kong is set to implement the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework by 2026, enhancing tax transparency and tackling cross-border tax evasion in the crypto space! #Crypto #Tax https://t.co/MU2Cg6ac0D — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 17, 2024 The CARF was introduced in June 2023. It extends the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) to crypto assets and mandates annual account and transaction information exchanges between jurisdictions. Hong Kong plans to complete legislative amendments by 2026, with the first automatic data exchanges scheduled for 2028. This initiative builds on Hong Kong’s history of financial data exchange under the CRS since 2018 and aims to address the complexities of the rapidly evolving crypto market. Also, Hong Kong is accelerating efforts to establish itself as a global crypto hub by introducing a fast-track licensing process for trading platforms . Joseph Chan, Acting Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury announced that the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) plans to operationalize a consultative panel early next year to support licensed platforms. Since the crypto licensing regime began in June 2023, firms like OSL Exchange and HashKey Exchange have gained approval to serve retail investors. Alongside licensing, Hong Kong is advancing legislation to regulate stablecoin issuers. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) will license fiat-referenced stablecoins following global trends.

The platforms — Accumulus GBA Technology, DFX Labs, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology — must meet specific regulatory conditions before fully operating, according to the SFC. The licenses follow the SFC’s risk-based inspections introduced in June. These inspections are designed to evaluate compliance with Hong Kong’s virtual asset regulations, aiming to protect investors while fostering growth in the crypto sector. To proceed, the licensed exchanges must complete third-party vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. These tests identify and address potential security weaknesses, ensuring the platforms are capable of securely handling digital asset trading. The SFC will oversee the process and assess whether the platforms have resolved issues identified during inspections. The Hong Kong SFC has approved four new cryptocurrency exchanges. 1) Accumulus GBA Technology 2) DFX Labs 3) Hong Kong Digital Asset EX 4) Thousand Whales Technology This brings the total number of licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong to 7. #Bitcoin … pic.twitter.com/akt9NzpMFP — StellDex™ (@StellDex_HQ) December 18, 2024 You might also like: XRP price slips as RLUSD market cap hits $53m, liquidations rise SFC’s inspections and expecations According to Dr. Eric Yip, the SFC’s Executive Director of Intermediaries, the regulator has worked closely with the management of these platforms to clarify expectations and speed up the licensing process. This proactive engagement will continue into the second phase of assessments, during which external assessors will evaluate the platforms under SFC supervision. Upon successful completion of this phase and satisfaction of all conditions, the exchanges will be able to expand their business operations. The SFC has also issued a circular outlining the roadmap for the licensing process. This guidance aims to streamline the compliance journey for virtual asset trading platforms while reinforcing regulatory standards. For those unfamiliar with crypto regulation, licenses like these ensure exchanges operate legally and securely. Licensed platforms must implement measures to safeguard user funds, prevent fraud, and deter market manipulation.

The protocol is now live on the mainnet, allowing Sui Network developers, as well as their users, to transfer USDC across nine different blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana. Sui Network developers can onboard the cross-chain protocol for their applications to allow direct USDC deposits from different blockchains. The cross-chain protocol will also allow Sui Network users to meet withdrawal demand for the stablecoin on the user’s exchanges through a rebalancing process capped at 1:1. Users will also accept payments in USDC for e-commerce stores and online marketplaces across different blockchain networks. USDC cross-chain transfer now live on Sui Network The Sui DeFi ecosystem is even more connected today thanks to @Circle ’s CCTP 🤝 Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol enables $USDC to flow natively between chains, increasing liquidity and making the overall user experience on Sui even smoother. 😌 https://t.co/bBG0Sswfpw — Sui (@SuiNetwork) December 17, 2024 The cross-chain protocol capitalizes on Circle’s security technology to run a native burn-and-mint process that secures the movement of USDC from one decentralized network to another. The burn and mint process burns the original USDC on the source chain and mints a new native USDC on the destination network. The mechanism allows the value of USDC to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. The mechanism eliminates third-party liquidity providers from the cross-chain process, increasing capital efficiency and minimizing trust assumptions. Sui Network users will not need any lock-up liquidity or rely on third parties to process inter-blockchain transfers. The Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol will facilitate the transfer of USDC across nine blockchains, including Arbitrum, Avax, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, Solana, Noble, and Sui. SUI token has been among the largest crypto gainers in the last seven days, with a 30% surge. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the digital asset has a market cap of $13.5 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $1.5 billion. The Sui ecosystem now supports 72 unique routes for USDC transfers, allowing many-to-many asset transfers between the supported blockchains. Circle has expanded its reach to boost stablecoin usage in the crypto ecosystem. Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, announced it had initiated a strategic collaboration with Circle Internet Group Inc. to boost global USDC usage and crypto adoption. Circle’s USDC bridges multiple blockchain applications The cross-chain protocol is now supported on various applications, wallets, bridges, and exchanges such as Wormhole, Sui Bridge, Portal, Router, Interport, Mayan, and Wanchain. Wormhole allows cross-chain protocol functionality through its embeddable widget, Wormhole Connect. Wormhole Connect powers frictionless cross-chain asset transfers. The Sui Bridge embeds Wormhole Connect through the cross-chain protocol to facilitate easier USDC transfers through Wormhole Connect. Portal, a multichain application for token transfers, supports CCTP through the Sui network. The application capitalizes on CCTP by integrating Wormhole Connect for fast and easy USDC transfers. Interport also supports CCTP on Sui through its developer tools and cross-chain bridge. Mayan, a cross-chain auction protocol, also allows CCTP functionality and cross-chain bridging via Mayan Swap. Wanchain, a cross-chain platform, offers CCTP through its WanBridge, therefore enabling devs to enhance their capabilities for cross-chain transfer. The integrations boost further applications by powering more applications, wallets, exchanges, and other protocols. The cross-chain protocol, therefore, extends its USDC use cases to a variety of blockchain derivatives. More ecosystem apps like Bluefin, AlphaFiSUI, Ensofi, SuiLendProtocol, CetusProtocol, KriyaDEX, and Turbos_Finance have already gone live with CCTP routes for Sui.

37805029,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26651,1734537720,"Institutional Demand to Drive Bitcoin Price in 2025, Analysts Say","Bitcoin price dips will likely be brief in 2025 due to robust institutional demand, according to Bitfinex analysts. In a Dec. 17 market report, they forecast a best-case scenario where Bitcoin could double its current price by June 2025. Their minimum price estimates “stand at $145,000 by mid-2025, potentially stretching to $200,000 under favorable conditions.” Bitcoin Volatility Expected in Early 2025 “Our view is that any corrections in 2025 will remain mild, thanks to institutional inflows,” the analysts stated. They anticipate Bitcoin volatility in the first quarter of 2025 but believe the broader trend will favor price growth, fueled by inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and rising global adoption. As of now, approximately $36 billion has flowed into U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January, according to Farside Investors. “The BTC ETFs are one of the largest cohorts of Bitcoin holders at over 1.13 million BTC,” the analysts noted. At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at $105,360, according to CoinMarketCap. Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures, told Bloomberg Television on Dec. 17 that Bitcoin’s long-term value could grow nearly ninefold. “Long-term, I’m looking for Bitcoin to match the market cap of gold, which would price Bitcoin at $900,000,” Carter said. Potential for Higher Peaks Bitfinex analysts noted that if Bitcoin mirrors its 2021 cycle, rising 40% above its moving averages, it could reach $339,000. Alternatively, if the extended 2017 cycle repeats with diminishing returns, Bitcoin might peak around $290,000 by early 2026. US Bitcoin Reserve Speculation The incoming Trump administration’s potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve has sparked industry speculation. “If one country implements a Bitcoin strategic reserve, you can kiss goodbye to your 4-year cycles,” crypto analyst Tyler Durden posted on Dec. 17.

37805211,https://blockworks.co/news/microstrategy-btc-purchase-recap,1734537600,MicroStrategy spent $17.5B on bitcoin in the last 2 months,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . MicroStrategy is sucking most of the air out of the room right now. But there are even bigger forces at play. As debate rages over whether Saylor is a once-in-a-lifetime financial genius or just another overleveraged trader, stablecoins are bringing even more liquidity to crypto. At least, that’s in terms of raw dollar value being pumped into the space right now. MSTR has now spent $17.5 billion on bitcoin in the past two months alone, as shown by the orange areas on the chart below. Most of that cash has come from buyers of its infamous zero-percent convertible bonds. MicroStrategy’s purchases can then be viewed simply as accepting dollars with one hand and plowing them into bitcoin with the other. Fast and cheap liquidity in return for exposure. In the same period, bitcoin ETFs in the US have gained an additional $16.5 billion in net inflows. ETH ETFs have otherwise net added $3 billion, and together those flows are in blue on the chart. ETFs follow much the same process as MicroStrategy but without the bonds. They take investor cash to buy an equivalent amount of bitcoin or ether, passing on exposure to shareholders minus a fee. Stablecoins, MicroStrategy’s bitcoin buys and ETF inflows converged in November And then there’s stablecoins. Since mid-October, stablecoins issuers have collectively minted an additional $30.8 billion tokens. Over 92% of those inflows have gone to USDT and USDC. Outside of Sky’s USDS and the more exotic alternatives that have emerged, such as Ethena’s USDe and Usual’s USD0 , stablecoin managers generally take US dollars, buy short-dated Treasurys and other cash equivalents and then issue the same amount of fresh token supply to whomever wired them cash. Obviously, stablecoins flows aren’t really the same thing as ETF inflows or MSTR’s cash pipeline. But they do represent something similar: a widespread urge to enter crypto markets across a multitude of avenues. That’s now to the tune of almost $68 billion in the past nine weeks — easily the biggest liquidity wave on record, at least by my count.

The incoming administration has shown a willingness to talk about crypto market regulation and about how to keep future development in the U.S., the report said, adding that the president-elect has already nominated a number of people who will take part in the formulation of crypto policy and enforcement.  This means a floor has been established, in that the ""worst regulatory environment for crypto"" is in the past, the report said. The ecosystem is now expected to become a ""safer, more transparent, and more productive industry (from a regulatory perspective) from this point.""  Still, these positive tailwinds could take some time to have an effect. JPMorgan cautioned that the market might not see policy impacts for at least nine to 12 months into Trump's term.  Trump's nomination for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair is one piece missing from the administration's pro-crypto agenda, the Wall Street bank said. The position is important because of its likely role in regulating bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  A more productive regulatory environment would lead to the listing of more tokens by exchanges and brokers, and would also encourage more product innovation, the report added.

37804813,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375206,1734537436,Coinbase Fights Back Against BiT Global Lawsuit Over WBTC Delisting,"Coinbase has issued a rebuttal to a lawsuit by BiT Global, a Justin Sun-affiliated entity, challenging the exchange’s decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Paul Grewal, the firm’s Chief Legal Officer, announced the filing on X, saying that his company had offered its response to BiT Global’s effort to stop the delisting of WBTC before any discovery or formal response to their claims, which he described as bogus. Coinbases’ Defence In the submission shared by Grewal, Coinbase defended its actions, stating that BiT Global failed to clarify its ownership structure or address concerns about TRON founder Justin Sun’s involvement. The exchange argued that his potential influence posed significant risks to customers as well as the platform’s integrity. “BiT seeks to force Coinbase to do business with an entity that no longer complies with Coinbase’s standards due to Mr. Sun’s ‘material involvement,” read the document. It also highlighted that BiT Global delayed filing its lawsuit and motion for a temporary restraining order for nearly a month, therefore undermining any claims of urgent harm. The San Francisco-based exchange also dismissed accusations of financial and reputational damage as speculative, noting that WBTC constitutes less than 1% of its transaction volume. It also argued that any loss of confidence in the product came from its association with Sun rather than the delisting decision. Overall, the crypto platform defended its action as a lawful exercise of business judgment to protect itself and its customers, citing court precedents supporting the rights of tech operations to set their own standards. Additionally, it denied BiT Global’s legal accusations as baseless and urged the court to deny emergency relief. Backlash and Concerns Over Sun’s Involvement In November, Coinbase announced its decision to delist WBTC on December 19, attributing its decision to worries over the asset’s association with Sun. This move caused major backlash, with many in the crypto community accusing the firm of favoring its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC . In response, BiT Global filed a lawsuit on December 13, accusing the exchange of engaging in monopolistic behavior, using predatory tactics to undermine WBTC’s market position, and making false statements about the token’s compliance with listing standards. The TRON founder also fired back by criticizing the competitor’s offering. He claimed it lacks proof-of-reserve, has not been audited, and could allow the exchange to freeze user balances, therefore posing security risks to decentralized finance (DeFi). Coinbase, however, countered this by pointing out Sun’s history of allegations of financial misconduct, including assertions of fraud and market manipulation. The latest court filing pointed out that the 34-year-old has been sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is reportedly under investigation by several law enforcers.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The launch illustrates new applications of Runes, fungible BTC tokens traditionally known for slow transaction speeds, high fees, and sniping. As part of the initiative, Bitflow prioritizes security with audits from Coinfabrik and Clarity Alliance and offers a $100,000 Immunefi bounty program to promote community engagement. https://twitter.com/Bitflow_Finance/status/1855028595242287432 More speed and security in Bitcoin DeFi Activated at Bitcoin Block #867,867, the recent Stacks Nakamoto upgrade reduced Stacks’ block times from 10 minutes to a few seconds while offering BTC-tier finality. The new system relies on just one Bitcoin block and one Stacks block (5–10 seconds) to finalize trades, a drastic contrast compared to 3–6 block confirmations often required by other BTC bridges. In addition, all Runes AMM transactions have become as secure and irreversible as Bitcoin itself. The Runes AMM relies on the Pontis Bridge, a federated multi-signature system supported by industry leaders like Xverse, Asigna, OrdinalsBot, and Liquidium. Filip S, Core Contributor at Pontis, commented on the interoperability ensured by the new decentralized model: “At Pontis, our mission is to create a secure and seamless bridging experience for Runes and other metaprotocol assets by harnessing a consortium of trusted projects as node operators. In partnership with Bitflow, we are enhancing the user experience for BTC traders, enabling them to interact with Runes through liquidity pools on Stacks effortlessly.” Runes AMM comes with a liquidity pool structure inspired by Uniswap. As such, it offers deep liquidity, minimal slippage, and instant price discovery for Bitcoin assets. Users can trade directly through wallets like Xverse and Leather without navigating marketplace listings or manual pricing. sBTC integration Having launched alongside sBTC, a non-custodial, programmable 1:1 BTC-backed asset, the Runes enable swaps between native BTC, STX, and Runes with additional incentives like a 5% BTC yield on sBTC deposits. The integration of the Pontis Bridge into Bitflow’s app will further streamline asset transfers and trading on Stacks. The platform will initially support popular Runes like BILLION•DOLLAR•CAT, DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, LIQUIDIUM•TOKEN, BASED•INTERNET•PANDA, SHORT•THE•DOLLAR, PUPS•WORLD•PEACE, POOKA•CANNOT•BE•STOPPED, ROOOOOOOOOONS, and USDh, the first Bitcoin-backed synthetic dollar on Runes. If the demand is high enough, additional BRC-20 tokens and native BTC assets like ORDI and TRIO will be added in the future.

The lawsuit concerns improperly classifying retail clients as wholesale clients. According to the filing, this practice denied over 500 individuals key consumer protections mandated under Australian financial laws. The allegations focus on Binance’s conduct between July 2022 and April 2023, during which 83% of its Australian client base was reportedly affected.Binance Breaches of Consumer ProtectionsASIC claims that Binance failed to meet critical legal obligations, including providing required disclosure documents and access to dispute resolution mechanisms for retail clients. Retail investors trading financial products, such as crypto derivatives, are entitled to these protections under Australian law. The exchange allegedly neglected to determine the target market for its crypto derivative products, which is required under design and distribution obligations.The regulator further accused Binance of failing to ensure that its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly, and fairly. It cited inadequate compliance systems that exposed clients to high-risk speculative products without the necessary safeguards. This resulted in significant financial losses for many investors, with Binance compensating affected clients approximately $13 million in 2023.Broader Regulatory ConcernsASIC’s actions align with its broader efforts to enhance regulatory clarity for digital assets. Earlier this month, ASIC released a consultation paper to update guidelines on crypto-related financial products. The regulator has emphasized that many digital assets fall under existing financial product definitions and intends to strengthen oversight in the sector. It also pledged to use enforcement tools to protect consumers and uphold market integrity.Binance's Global Legal ChallengesThe case in Australia is not an isolated incident for Binance, which has faced legal and regulatory scrutiny worldwide.

This could pave the way for a new pro-crypto SEC commissioner. In the crypto wallet sector, Plus Wallet stands out along with the latest OKX update. Plus Wallet is favored for its comprehensive features, providing top-notch security and ease of use through its mobile app. Its strong security allows users to trade safely wherever they are. Additionally, the latest OKX update has introduced ‘Alpha Traders,’ an exclusive group for leading Web3 influencers. This initiative gives members early access to OKX updates, special events, and other unique benefits. XRP News: Carline Crenshaw’s Role in SEC vs. Ripple Dynamics Recent XRP news focuses on SEC Commissioner Carline Crenshaw’s ongoing renomination process, which is pivotal for the SEC vs Ripple litigation. Last week, her renomination was postponed due to procedural delays, with opposition blocking the process. This leaves a narrow window for confirmation. Should Crenshaw not be renominated, the next appointee, potentially a pro-crypto advocate, could alter the SEC’s stance towards Ripple, influencing the market’s future significantly. Conversely, if she remains, her position could decisively influence the SEC’s decision on whether to continue the appeal, marking a critical point in XRP news. OKX Updates: ‘Alpha Traders’ Community Inauguration OKX recently unveiled ‘Alpha Traders,’ an exclusive community targeting leading on-chain traders. This group is integral to shaping future OKX updates, offering feedback on product developments, enhancing wallet services, and steering community initiatives. Members enjoy privileged access to new OKX updates, exclusive events, and a host of perks such as monthly stipends, transaction fee refunds, and bespoke products. This elite community is composed of influential figures across platforms like X and Telegram, significantly impacting the trajectory of OKX updates and the broader Web3 trading landscape. Plus Wallet: A Blend of Security, Rewards, and Versatility As the crypto market evolves, an influx of new participants are looking to capitalize on the potential profits of cryptocurrency. Yet, as the market expands, it also attracts malicious entities intent on seizing valuable digital assets. Plus Wallet addresses these concerns with a comprehensive approach, integrating superior security, advanced features, and rewarding opportunities to help users safeguard their investments while enhancing their returns. Plus Wallet boasts a formidable security system, which secures user assets by storing private keys on the user’s own device. This ensures total control by the device owner and restricts access to their funds. To bolster data protection, Plus Wallet employs encryption alongside two-factor authentication (2FA), offering users the choice of Face ID or a PIN code to enhance security measures. These layers of security are critical, especially if the device falls into the wrong hands. Beyond security, Plus Wallet supports strong cross-chain functionality, enabling users to manage assets across multiple blockchain networks from a single interface. This feature simplifies interactions with various cryptocurrencies. Additionally, Plus Wallet encourages passive earning by rewarding users for every transaction made. Its commitment to security, cross-chain capability, and user incentives firmly establishes it as a leading choice for anyone needing a dependable and top crypto wallet. The Road Forward The future of the XRP market could be heavily influenced by the outcome of Carline Crenshaw’s renomination and its effects on the SEC’s approach to the Ripple case. Nevertheless, as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, the necessity for top-notch crypto wallets to secure digital assets becomes more apparent. The recent OKX update introduces the Alpha Traders community, involving influential figures in refining the platform. Meanwhile, Plus Wallet remains a standout with its robust security measures, user-friendly interface, cross-chain support, and earning potential, making it the best crypto wallet for both newcomers and seasoned users aiming for high security and profitability.

37804223,https://btc-pulse.com/?p=27777,1734536278,EU Securities and Markets Authority Issues Final MiCA Guidance,"EU Securities and Markets Authority Issues Final MiCA Guidance The European Securities and Markets Authority, or ESMA, has published its final guidance report for the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, with the aim of ensuring a consistent application of rules across EU member states. This guidance addresses ongoing challenges as the December 30 deadline for MiCA implementation approaches. Regulatory Transition Underway The implementation of MiCA regulations started in June 2024, which became a turning point in how cryptocurrencies and other virtual assets are regulated within the European Union. The final guidance is designed to help member states that have faced challenges in bringing their current regimes in line with MiCA’s requirements. It basically clarifies that the definition of financial instruments should be sufficiently clear to leave no doubt on the status of crypto-assets for various use cases. This becomes essential since EU members are moving towards clear, comprehensive regime under MiCA. Challenges in Meeting the Deadline Even though the implementation timeline is long, several member states reported that the interpretation and implementation of the provisions under MiCA were difficult; this included Belgium, Italy, and Poland. These challenges were brought about by the vagueness of the regulatory documents initially, making the determination of the legal status for most crypto-assets unclear. While the final guidance of the ESMA tries to address these concerns, it is not without its challenges. Stakeholders commented on the administrative burden the guidelines will place and cautioned about inconsistencies in the interpretation by national authorities. Stakeholder Feedback and Key Concerns During the consultation period, responses were received from many member states and industry participants. The responses highlighted 12 key areas of concern, with the majority relating to the criteria and conditions to be used for classifying digital assets. One significant issue was the risk of diverging interpretations among member states. To mitigate this, the ESMA provided illustrative scenarios to clarify regulatory conditions. However, the guidance deliberately avoided real-world examples, emphasizing the neutrality required in rulemaking. MiFID II and Crypto Integration The implementation of MiCA has also revived debates on the EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, better known as MiFID II. Member states have called for an update to more precisely outline crypto-assets within the current regime of financial instruments. The approach of ESMA here is to clarify MiFID II interpretations without changing its definitions-the right balance. Next Steps Although this is the last guidance before the deadline of Dec. 30, ESMA remains committed to working with the legislature and all stakeholders to improve regulatory clarity. This collaborative initiative further shows the drive of the EU toward developing a uniform and transparent digital asset regulatory environment. The finalized MiCA guidance represents a major milestone for the harmonization of cryptocurrency laws in the European Union, opening ways to innovation and stability in the field of digital assets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/eu-securities-markets-authority-issues-final-mica/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

37804157,https://finbold.com/?p=220635,1734536137,Economist slams Michael Saylor’s MSTR-Bitcoin strategy as a ‘shell game’,"American economist Peter Schiff is sustaining his critique of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) executive chairman Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) accumulation spree as a ‘shell game,’ questioning its long-term viability. This criticism comes as MSTR’s share price has experienced a bearish sentiment in the short term, dropping 8% in the past week despite Bitcoin trading at a new record high. MSTR one-week stock price chart. Source: Finbold According to Schiff, MicroStrategy’s sale of shares to finance additional BTC purchases is a move that props up its value while contributing to the company’s stock drop, he stated in an X post on December 17. “Shares of $MSTR were down by 5.5% today even as the price of Bitcoin rose. This likely indicates that Saylor was in the market selling more shares of MSTR to buy Bitcoin, thus supporting its price. The $42 billion question is how much longer can this shell game continue,” he said. The economist’s latest stance on Saylor emerged after the business intelligence company acquired an additional 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion, bringing its total haul to 439,000 BTC. The funding for this purchase came from share sales, part of an ongoing strategy to convert company equity into Bitcoin, which has been celebrated and scrutinized. Bitcoin and real estate debate Amid the criticism, Saylor drew an analogy between Bitcoin investment and buying Manhattan real estate, stating: “I would have bought Manhattan 100 years ago, 200 years ago, every year for the past 300 years. You pay a little bit more than the person that bought Manhattan before you, but it’s always a good investment to invest in the economic capital of the free world.” However, Schiff expressed the difference between leveraged real estate investments, which generate rental income, and Bitcoin, which does not produce any income to service debt. He has previously warned that Saylor is gambling with investors’ money. “It’s wrong for Saylor to compare his leveraged buying of Bitcoin to investors borrowing money to purchase Manhattan real estate. Real estate generates rents, which can be used to service and repay debt. Bitcoin doesn’t generate any income to make interest or principal payments,” Schiff added. In defense, Saylor pointed to the success of his firm’s strategy, highlighting that MSTR’s treasury operations have delivered a ‘BTC Yield’ of 72.4% year to date. Year to date, $MSTR treasury operations delivered a BTC Yield of 72.4%, a net benefit of ~136,965 BTC to our shareholders. At $107K per BTC, that equates to ~$14.66 billion for the year. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 17, 2024 It’s worth noting that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases have also been funded through convertible notes and significant debt. To this end, Schiff, a gold advocate, warned that the company’s cyclical strategy poses a risk: If Bitcoin’s value drops, MicroStrategy could struggle to cover its debts and may be forced to sell its Bitcoin to do so. MicroStrategy supporters In general, MicroStrategy’s investment plan has helped the stock become one of the best-performing in 2024, aiding the company’s entry into the lucrative Nasdaq-100 index. Among the supporters of this plan is investor Robert Kiyosaki , who has called Saylor a ‘genius,’ noting that Bitcoin has helped create wealth for MicroStrategy and its investors. While Schiff advocates for gold over Bitcoin, Kiyosaki, on the other hand, remains dismissive of this debate , noting that investors should consider both assets equally. Overall, MicroStrategy’s recent Bitcoin purchases partly fueled the asset to hit a new all-time high of above $108,000. As of press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $104,180.

The strategy’s long-term sustainability remains uncertain, as it has yet to be tested over time and relies heavily on Bitcoin’s volatile value.

37804144,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394804,1734536082,"Solaxy Launches Presale For First Solana Layer 2 Blockchain, Raises $1.1M in Past 24 Hours","The post Solaxy Launches Presale For First Solana Layer 2 Blockchain, Raises $1.1M in Past 24 Hours appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News New Solana layer 2 blockchain Solaxy ($SOL) has raised $1.1 million in the past 24 hours, taking its total raise to $1.7 million. The presale started just five days ago, showing a considerable appetite for this new project among investors. It’s currently available to buy at a price of $0.001566, but this will rise throughout the ICO. The next increase will occur in under 48 hours. Buyers can participate in the presale using ETH, USDT, and BNB. Presale investors can maximize their earning potential by staking their tokens. Currently, staking offers a 1,901% APY. Solaxy To Save Solana From Inevitable Bottleneck Solana is a victim of its own success. By becoming the largest and most active blockchain, the project has self-propagated its way to a major scalability issue. Despite being capable of 6,500 transactions per second, Solana regulatory sees 4 million daily active users or more. Its transaction throughput is quickly gobbled up, leaving users waiting longer for transaction finality, paying higher fees, and sometimes getting their transactions rejected. Solaxy’s layer 2 blockchain solves this issue, bundling transactions off-chain and reporting back to Solana for secure and decentralized finality. But it doesn’t stop there. Solaxy is a multi-chain titan. While solving the budding scalability issue posed on Solana, Solaxy also taps into the Ethereum network as well. As the first-ever Solana layer 2 blockchains, Solaxy is well ahead of the curve. Connecting The Two Leading Blockchain Ecosystems Solana leads in users and on-chain activity, and Ethereum leads in value. Solaxy benefits from both. While rolling up transactions into bundles and processing them quicker for Solana, Solaxy also benefits from the DeFi infrastructure of Ethereum, a combination with huge potential. In a nutshell, Solaxy takes what’s best about Solana and multiplies it: its ability to accommodate huge amounts of demand. Now, Solana will be able to facilitate volume that we’ve never seen on a blockchain before. At the same time, the $SOLX token is multichain, available on both Ethereum and Solana. The Ethereum network remains front-and-centre in terms of liquidity, and so $SOLX has access to a vast investor pool. Up to 25% Of Transactions Fail On Solana As discussed, Solana’s position at the forefront of crypto adoption means that it’s facing the industry’s technical issues head on. Network congestion and failed transactions are major ones. Meme coin and gaming related applications are major cultripts for high volume, and much of it is often spam. This leads to high congestion and ultimately transaction failures. Up to 25% of transactions on the Solana chain fail. Teams are working on solutions. For example, QUIC protocol has improved network reliability and Jump Crypto promises to raise real-world transactions per second. But this doesn’t negate the need for layer 2 blockchains. Rather, it amplifies that Solana needs solutions to continue growing – which leads to Solaxy. Solaxy Could Be The Next $1 Billion Layer 2 Blockchain The Ethereum layer 2 world is worth alot. In terms of market cap, Polygon leads the way with a $5.5 billion valuation across its two tokens, Mantle comes in second at $3.9 billion and Optimism follows at $3.1 billion. But by opening Ethereum liquidity to the first Solana layer 2 blockchain, this could well be a juncture that sends Solaxy to $1 billion and beyond. It’s clear that early investors expect something like this to play out – the Solaxy presale is growing at a substantial rate. After raising $600K in its opening four days, the presale raise shot up by $1.1 million in the past 24 hours. This not only confirms its vast market appeal, it also injects a sense of urgency for those yet to buy, knowing that the opportunity to be an early contributor is swiftly departing. How To Buy $SOLX At Presale Investors can participate in the $SOLX presale via the project’s website, or by using the Best Wallet app’s Upcoming Tokens feature. Those who buy via Best Wallet also get the advantage of being able to view their tokens before the presale ends and track key updates from the app. As the crypto bull market edges forward, crypto networks like Solana are faced with new issues brought on by unprecedented levels of activity. Solaxy is a response to the ever-changing crypto environment, allowing Solana to not only function fit-for-purpose, but also expand into new applications and utilities.

The blockchain solution is projected to dominate the market and may outperform Tron and other major blockchains. 1Fuel's token is on presale, and it's expected to yield 500% soon, making it a potentially rewarding cryptocurrency to buy. Find out more about the blockchain solution and its buzzing token below. 1Fuel: Groundbreaking blockchain solution with a unique ecosystem The new blockchain solution aims to succeed where others failed and will do this without compromising any functions. Unlike conventional blockchain, where cross-chain transfers are complex, users only need “one click” to complete transactions on 1Fuel . The blockchain solution will handle all complexities at the backend, leaving users with simple commands to follow. On 1Fuel, cross-chain and peer-to-peer transactions will be faster, simpler, and cheaper. The platform will also use cryptography technology to address the privacy issues that have become prevalent in DeFi for some time. The 1Fuel project aims to achieve this without compromising security, efficiency, or usability. It will create an ecosystem where everyone benefits. Token holders will enjoy staking opportunities, while liquidity providers and traders will also have dedicated incentives. By capitalizing on its growing significance in the DeFi space, 1Fuel is poised for market success. The approach is working, as the 1Fuel presale is gearing up for stage 3. The first stage sold out in record time, and stage 2 is going to be sold out in just a few days. 1Fuel has sold over 70 million presale tokens and is on course to raise $1 million before the weekend. The presale token is a great cryptocurrency to buy now, as its upward rally looks imminent. 1Fuel is currently currentlyvalued at $0.012 but could do about 100x after the presale. Tron: Leading blockchain for stablecoin transfer Tron is creating a name for itself as the go-to platform for high-volume stablecoin transfer. The Tron blockchain set a $587.2 billion successful USDT transfer in November 2024, beating its own $489.3 billion record in October. Analysts say Tron's efficiency in facilitating large-scale stablecoin transfers is due to its robust infrastructure and efficient nature. The Tron blockchain has fast processing speed and low transaction fees, making it appealing to users, especially those managing large amounts. The Tron blockchain also has high scalability, which guarantees the stability of transaction performance even when the volume rises. The blockchain's efficiency and reliability will further grow its adoption and positively impact the Tron token. The token is currently trying to defend its $0.3 price zone after a sharp decline from the $0.44 new all-time high it set two weeks ago. Tron is highly likely to surge impressively beyond its current price consolidation phase. The altcoin eyes a possible $3 milestone in the coming year and could be a good crypto buy optionfor 2025. Conclusion While Tron struggles as a token, the blockchain is enjoying increased usage, which could change the tides for the Tron coin in the coming year. However, Tron will face stiff competition from 1Fuel , the new crypto solution that looks prepared to blow everyone out of the water. The 1Fuel token is gaining massive traction and currently looks like the better crypto buy option. Join the presale.

37804108,https://crypto.news/?p=14320490,1734535960,"XRP price slips as RLUSD market cap hits $53m, liquidations rise","XRP price retreated on Wednesday as a sea of red spread across the cryptocurrency industry ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision. Ripple ( XRP ) dropped by over 5%, erasing most of the gains made on Tuesday after the RLUSD stablecoin launch . The decline led to significant liquidations of bullish positions, totaling over $15.19 million. Liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close positions due to insufficient margin. Short positions worth over $4.6 million were also liquidated, according to CoinGlass. Ripple’s retreat, which was anticipated , happened a day after the company launched the RLUSD stablecoin. According to CoinMarketCap , the stablecoin has started well as it attracted over $53 million in assets. Its 24-hour volume was over $550,000. The RLUSD stablecoin faces stiff competition in an already saturated market. Tether remains the dominant stablecoin, holding over 60% market share, followed by USD Coin, Ethena USDe, USDS, and Dai. Other notable stablecoins include First Digital USD and Justin Sun’s USDD.

For example, PayPal’s PYUSD has a market cap of $447 million despite the company’s massive fintech presence. Similarly, USDD, launched in 2022, has stalled at $745 million in the last two years. XRP’s price retreat may reflect profit-taking after the RLUSD launch and nervousness about the Federal Reserve’s final interest rate decision for the year. Economists expect a “hawkish cut,” with the Fed reducing rates by 0.25% while signaling a potential pause in 2025. Concerns stem from inflationary policies under President-elect Donald Trump, such as deportations and tariffs. Still, XRP has potential catalysts ahead. The new Securities and Exchange Commission may abandon its appeal and approve a spot ETF. Ripple Labs may also decide to file for an initial public offering. XRP price may be forming risky patterns XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart suggests XRP may be forming two risky patterns. First, it formed a shooting star candlestick pattern on Tuesday, which consists of a small body and a long upper shadow, often signaling a bearish reversal. Also, XRP price may be forming a double-top pattern at $2.89. This pattern is marked by two peaks and a neckline, which lies at $1.8958, its lowest level this month. As a result, there is a risk that XRP may continue to decline over the next few days as part of a mean reversion, given that it remains significantly above the 50-day moving average. More sustained gains would be confirmed if XRP price breaks above its year-to-date high of $2.89.

Pseudonymous trader Pentoshi tells his 834,500 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum may surge more than 23% from its current value and start outperforming against Bitcoin (ETH/ BTC ). “ETH likely to continue to outperform BTC in the short term in my opinion. ETH/BTC went up around 20% from the lows while going up in USD. Can’t complain. But every time it goes down 1% many get PTSD. Trends don’t happen overnight. They always start small. See no point in changing bias until proven wrong. So far it’s slowly creeping up.” He predicts that once ETH flips $4,000 into support on the daily chart, the top altcoin by market cap may soon surge to its all-time high of about $4,800. “I wonder what happens when ETH trades above the equal highs? Which is also a higher high (and clearly in an uptrend). It’s spent very little time trading above that price, and not much volume done. So there should be little resistance and $4,800 should be overall a quick move in my opinion.” Source: Pentoshi/X Ethereum is trading for $3,876 at time of writing, down 3.4% in the last 24 hours.

37804097,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627033,1734535800,Ethereum (ETH) vs. Lightchain AI Is the Smart Contract King Ready for a New Challenger,"Blockchain technology has come a long way since Ethereum (ETH) introduced smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to the world. As the first programmable blockchain, Ethereum has built a massive ecosystem of developers, users, and applications, maintaining a dominant position in the market. But the blockchain space is evolving faster than ever, and Ethereum now faces fierce competition from cutting-edge platforms like Lightchain AI (LCAI). One of the most exciting developments is the ongoing Lightchain AI Presale, giving early adopters a chance to be part of a platform revolutionizing blockchain with its AI-driven architecture. Join the Lightchain AI Presale here . Lightchain AI is shaking up the blockchain landscape by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence ( AI ) to enhance speed, scalability, and innovation. In this article, we’ll explore Ethereum’s current dominance, how Lightchain AI is setting new standards in blockchain technology, and whether Ethereum has what it takes to maintain its crown in the face of LCAI’s groundbreaking advancements. Ethereum: A Blockchain Titan Under Pressure Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with a current valuation of over $400 billion. Its groundbreaking smart contract functionality has been a significant catalyst for the growth and adoption of blockchain technology, empowering developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) that can operate without intermediaries. But Ethereum’s limitations in terms of speed and scalability have become major pain points as the platform struggles to keep up with increasing demand. The infamous CryptoKitties craze in 2017 brought the network to its knees, causing transaction fees to skyrocket and significantly slowing down processing times. Since then, Ethereum has continued to face congestion issues, leading to higher fees and delays in confirming transactions. Lightchain AI: The Future of Blockchain Meets Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is revolutionizing blockchain by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence (AI).

Sui (SUI), Bitget (BGB) and crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) are all soaring into the end of the year. Rollblock’s crypto gambling wager looks especially promising with 100x growth expected by 2026. This top altcoin is set to be 2025’s best performer once its crypto presale is complete. Whales Expect Rollblock’s Crypto Gambling Revolution to Dominate 2025 While the appetite of crypto whales may be drawn to the 1,000% potential of Sui and Bitget, this is nothing compared to their hunger for Rollblock’s projected growth. This top altcoin has achieved every milestone from its game-changing white paper, and now it is ready to explode higher out of its ICO as Bitcoin continues to see price increases. Rollblock has achieved its foundation of a crypto gambling platform with unparalleled sports betting and more than 7,000 casino games. All of this takes place through its blockchain, which offers security, transparency and convenience that were impossible before Rollblock’s crypto gambling innovations. Rollblock’s most important innovation is its signature gambling token, RBLK. This token is used to return a share of weekly casino revenue to token holders. RBLK tokens are bought back from the open market each week and then either distributed as rewards for staking or burned to drive market value. This revolutionary approach to crypto gambling has Rollblock on track to be the biggest token in this $500 billion industry by 2026. Rollblock already has tens of thousands of players, with more joining up each day. Whale Favorite Sui’s Real World Assets Wager Pays Off Following Bitcoin’s rally the Sui price was already soaring into the end of the year before its Real World Assets (RWA) shift sent it even higher. Sui has now racked up an over 600% gain for 2024, with this momentum expected to continue in 2025 as Bitcoin continues to trade above $100k. Sui’s shift to RWA has made it one of the top altcoins for crypto whales for 2025. RWA promises to be the fastest-growing sector next year, and Sui’s Layer 1 blockchain is the most promising platform for the tokenization of RWA. The Sui price is expected to top its 2024 performance with more than 1,000% growth in 2025 with some analysts anticipating that Bitcoin will reach $150k. Bitget Set to Be Top Centralized Exchange for Tokenization The Bitget price is also soaring on the enormous potential of tokenization, but in this case for the deployment of new tokens on its centralized exchange (CEX). Bitget’s CEX is now the ideal platform for the launch of fresh tokens, thanks to its low cost, ease of use and functionality. The Bitget price’s 2024 rally has now topped 500% with a massive last-minute surge. The ongoing demand for tokenization is expected to keep this momentum going for Bitget in 2025. Bitget is expected to see growth topping 500% again, with the highest estimates reaching 1,000% by 2026 should Bitcoin continue to rally. Rollblock Set To Reach New Highs As Bitcoin Stabilizes At $100k RBLK now has the potential to grow more than 100x out of its ICO from its current price of $0.0415. This blistering rally is expected to begin at the start of next year, once the last stages in its crypto presale are complete.

37803877,https://finbold.com/?p=220628,1734535607,Robert Kiyosaki just predicted Bitcoin price for 2025,"Renowned investor and author of the personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ Robert Kiyosaki , has been bullish on Bitcoin ( BTC ) for years. His first statement in support of BTC dates back to mid-2017 — a time when the price of a single Bitcoin was just $7,025 . Since then, he has stayed the course — Kiyosaki had long been a staunch advocate of precious metals like gold and silver, and even though he remains bullish on those assets , he has since made BTC his preferred store of value . Kiyosaki remains a controversial figure — with many pointing to his heavy use of debt , the bankruptcy of his company , Rich Global LLC, as well as the relatively sparse set of evidence supporting his claims of success. However, one can’t argue with results — and as of late November, his portfolio netted a year-to-date (YTD) return of approximately 76.03% . In the same timeframe, Bitcoin has seen returns of 151.54%. BTC price YTD chart. Source: Finbold Now, the famed investor has taken to social media and has set a new price target for the leading digital asset — and the outlook is optimistic indeed. Own more Bitcoin in 2025, says Kiyosaki Kiyosaki now expects to see the price of Bitcoin reach as high as $350,000 in 2025, as stated in a December 18 X post. https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1869351263634374978 This isn’t the highest price target the author has ever mentioned — most notably, on November 25, he shared the analysis of an unnamed artificial intelligence platform (AI) that predicted a price point of $500,000 . This new, lower price target still represents a huge 229.65% upside from BTC’s current price of $106,170. A noted critic of fiat currencies, which he has previously referred to as ‘ fake money ’, he also urged investors to ‘own more Bitcoin in 2025’, while also reflecting on President-elect Donald Trump as the first ‘Bitcoin president’, on account of his pro-cryptocurrency policy proposals and proposed Cabinet picks. Those are certainly valid bullish catalysts — but readers should note that Kiyosaki failed to specify a more precise time horizon, or even any background as to how he ended up with $350,000 as a price target. Just weeks ago, he predicted BTC could crash to $60,000 and set a 2025 Bitcoin price target of $250,000. He may very well end up being right — but at this point, it’s clear that his analysis boils down to general sentiment rather than a clear, precise thesis.

37806181,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320786,1734535562,Coinbase Criticized for Citing Justin Sun Risks in Wrapped Bitcoin Delisting,"Coinbase is facing criticism after deciding to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) from its platform, citing unacceptable risks linked to Justin Sun, the founder of Tron. The announcement of the suspension , made in November, has now become the subject of a lawsuit filed by Sun-affiliated BiT Global. Coinbase Faces Backlash Over Wrapped Bitcoin Delisting On December 17, Coinbase filed a response to BiT Global’s lawsuit, attributing the delisting to the “unacceptable risk” posed by Sun. It cited ongoing investigations and allegations of financial misconduct against the crypto billionaire. The dispute stems from BiT Global’s claim that Coinbase’s decision to delist WBTC was not based on technical or regulatory grounds but was a strategic move to promote its rival tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. BiT Global first filed the lawsuit in November, seeking an emergency injunction to halt Coinbase’s delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin. According to BiT Global, the decision was aimed at harming WBTC’s market position, spreading “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” about its regulatory standing while promoting Coinbase’s cbBTC token. The lawsuit also accused Coinbase of defaming BiT Global by suggesting its involvement with Justin Sun posed significant risks. Coinbase stated that Sun has “repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct,” which it believes reflects poorly on BiT Global’s reliability. Critics argue that Coinbase has failed to provide clear legal or technical reasoning for the delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin, instead basing its decision on what some see as “guilt by association.” Bitcoin enthusiast Pledditor expressed their dissatisfaction on X, stating, “It’s basically just they don’t like Justin Sun… just guilt by association.” So in a court filing today, @Coinbase gave their reason why they delisted wBTC, and it's basically just they don't like Justin Sun. That's really just it. They don't give any technical or legal arguments about why wBTC can't be listed. It's just guilt by association pic.twitter.com/bJmMnAue7x — Pledditor (@Pledditor) December 17, 2024 Despite Coinbase’s assertions, the lack of specific legal or technical details regarding Wrapped Bitcoin has left many unconvinced. Critics also note that WBTC has been widely regarded as a reliable token, bridging Bitcoin to Ethereum’s ecosystem. Past Controversies and Community Concerns Justin Sun’s name has frequently been at the center of crypto controversies. In 2023, he was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of fraud and market manipulation. While Sun denied the accusations, his involvement with several blockchain projects has made him a polarizing figure. The delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin has drawn attention to the token’s critical role in decentralized finance (DeFi). Despite the controversy, trading for WBTC continues across various platforms, though reduced liquidity could pose challenges in the long term. As the lawsuit progresses, its outcome could set a precedent for how exchanges handle tokens associated with controversial figures or entities. Some members of the crypto community see Coinbase’s actions as necessary to protect users from potential risks, while others view it as an overreach that undermines the principles of decentralization. In the meantime, figures like Gurbacs warn that Coinbase’s approach could backfire. As he put it, “Coinbase itself is under SEC and numerous other investigations, probably many more than Justin and his businesses. Questioning someone’s reputation this way might bring out skeletons from their own closet.” The post Coinbase Criticized for Citing Justin Sun Risks in Wrapped Bitcoin Delisting appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/coinbase-criticized-for-justin-sun-risks-wrapped-bitcoin-delisting/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37806181.jpeg

The project blends character traits of Pepe coin and Jordan Belfort, aiming to cultivate an army of degens who want to make the most of this bull market. It’s equipping them with all the tools for success. This includes trading signals, meme coin picks, a trading insiders group, staking, and trading rewards. https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 By investing in the $WEPE token, traders don’t just benefit from the viral potential of a Wolf of Wall Street-esque Pepe alternative – they get unrestricted access to a professional ecosystem geared toward making money. Unsurprisingly, this concept is taking the market by storm. $WEPE launched via a token presale just eight days ago, and it has already raised a staggering $29 million. It’s selling out fast, so prospective buyers have no time to waste. Visit Wall Street Pepe Presale Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Stars is another innovative meme coin project. It’s a meme coin staking platform that allows users to generate passive income on all the top projects. It supports Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Brett, Bonk, Mog Coin, Floki, and more.

As such, it’s not surprising that $STARS is in high demand. The token is available via a presale, and the total raise currently sits at $20 million. However, the presale ends in two days, and then $STARS will list on exchanges. Visit Crypto All-Stars Presale Solaxy This year, Solana has been the front-running ecosystem, continually attracting more users and generating more transaction volume than any other blockchain.

They’ll earn $FLOCK tokens for voting, which will not only create more ecosystem participation but also give the community a heightened sense of ownership and responsibility. It’s undergoing a presale and has raised $7 million so far. Visit Flockerz Presale Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained recently launched on the open market after the most successful ICO of 2024. It raised $70 million and then soared 500% from its initial listing price, hitting a $400 million market cap. After some profit-taking ensued, $PEPU has now found strong support and has over doubled in price in under 48 hours. However, it remains 70% from its peak, presenting a solid entry for those who missed the initial pump. This week, Pepe Unchained has received centralized exchange listings on MEXC, BingX, and LBank. There are now whispers that Binance is coming next.

The project also plans to launch Pepe Pump Pad, a two-click, no-code meme coin generator that will allow anyone to turn an idea into a meme coin in seconds. $PEPU is currently trading at a $65 million valuation. Visit Pepe Unchained Website Catslap Catslap is a meme coin that launched in November on the Ethereum network. It’s a cat-themed token, which has worked in its favor since Binance listed Simon’s Cat on Monday. Since the listing, speculation has circulated that Catslap may also be listed on the exchange soon. Catslap is more than your standard meme coin. It offers a “Slap-to-Earn” game akin to Popcat’s “Tap-to-Pop” game, expecting Catslap users to get paid to play. https://twitter.com/CatSlapToken/status/1868632734278586863 The project is also running an airdrop, which you can enter by playing the Slap-to-Earn game or completing social quests on Catslap’s Zealy page . Catslap also has features such as staking, burning, and buybacks, all adding to its growth potential.

The game’s design includes a bold new take on risk and reward that challenges you to trust your instincts, make daring decisions, and embrace the thrill of uncertainty. Here’s what makes it special – every move you make in Treasure Hunter feels significant. It’s the kind of game where you’ll find yourself sitting forward, weighing your options, and wondering just how far you’re willing to go to win. How Treasure Hunter Works The game features a 6×6 grid of tiles, each hiding a potential outcome. The mechanics are simple enough to dive into immediately but layered with just the right amount of strategy to keep you hooked: Reward Tiles (25 total) : These tiles build your earnings step by step. Each time you uncover one, your winnings grow. But there’s always that lingering question: do you cash out now or keep going? Multiplier Tiles (2 total): The real game-changers. These rare tiles amplify your total rewards, making them the ultimate prize to chase. Bomb Tiles (6 total): The risks in the game are as real as the rewards. Uncover a bomb, and it’s game over – all your winnings vanish in an instant. With every flip, you’re faced with a choice: secure what you’ve gained so far or take one more risk for the possibility of a massive payout. Why You Should Play Treasure Hunter What sets Treasure Hunter apart isn’t just the gameplay; it’s the thrill of every decision. The game model tests your strategic decision making. Imagine flipping tiles, one after the other, as your earnings climb higher. You’ve hit a couple of reward tiles already – should you press your luck and go for a multiplier? Or play it safe and cash out before a bomb ends your run? This dynamic makes each session feel like a fresh adventure. No two games are the same, and the stakes keep you coming back for more. The CEO of GalaChain, Benefactor, revealed that a massive 2 million burn for Treasure Hunt has already happened in just one day. A move that will spike up value and unlock rewards for the game players. The game is already a talking point in the GalaGames community. With lots of conversation already ongoing about the game, there is buildup of excitement about future developments. The thrill of Treasure Hunt is driving conversation for the development of similar games as gamers are visibly excited with the gaming experience. One community member asked if there are other similar games in the pipeline. Benefactor’s response below is enough to ensure interested gamers don’t miss out on this thrilling game. An Experience Built for Everyone One of the great things about Treasure Hunter is how accessible it is. The rules are straightforward, so anyone can start playing in minutes. But the strategic element – knowing when to stop and when to push your luck – keeps even seasoned gamers engaged. Right now, Treasure Hunter is only available in Congo, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay, Honduras, and Haiti. If you’re lucky enough to live in one of these regions, you can dive in today and see what the buzz is all about. Alternatively, if you are not in these countries, you can use a VPN to access the platform while a wider list of more countries becomes available soon. If you are curious and ready to test your nerve, flip those tiles and see if the fortune favours you, visit http://fortunes.gala.com/ to start playing and stacking rewards.",POSITIVE,없음,MINING,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/treasure-hunter-your-next-gaming-obsession-with-big-rewards/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

The meme coin market has been on fire, with tokens skyrocketing thanks to community hype, viral moments, and headline-grabbing drama. If you’re looking to make a play before Monday hits, you’re in the right spot. Let’s talk about the best meme coins to join this weekend: BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Peanut the Squirrel. Taking the lead is BTFD Coin , which has turned heads with its jaw-dropping presale performance. In just a few weeks, it’s raised over $4.1 million, proving it’s not just another flash-in-the-pan project. Meanwhile, Popcat is still riding the wave of its viral fame, and Peanut the Squirrel—oh boy—has stirred up some serious buzz after its unexpected encounter with Binance. So, whether you’re in for the hype, the gains, or just the pure entertainment of it all, let’s break down why these meme coins deserve your attention this weekend. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Keep Charging Past $4.1 Million If you haven’t heard about BTFD Coin yet, it’s time to wake up—this bull isn’t stopping for anyone. Built on the legendary crypto mantra “Buy the Dip,” BTFD Coin is everything a meme coin should be: fun, community-driven, and bullish to the core. But what really sets it apart is its rock-solid performance. The presale has already crossed $4.1 million, with more than 56 billion coins sold to a growing army of over 5,700 holders. Currently in Stage 12, the presale price sits at $0.00013, and momentum is only picking up. The Bulls Squad, a collective of meme-powered characters like Baby Bull and Nerdy Bull, are rallying the community to get in before prices rise. Let’s do the math. Say you invest $2,000 this weekend at the current presale price of $0.00013. You’d grab yourself a tidy 15.4 million BTFD tokens. Now, imagine BTFD Coin hits its post-presale target of $0.0006—that $2,000 investment turns into a cool $9,240. That’s a 4.6x return for getting in early. Not bad for a weekend move, right? With staking rewards offering insane APYs , a Play-to-Earn game, and Ethereum powering its ecosystem, BTFD Coin is proving that it’s more than just hype—it’s a meme coin with a plan. Popcat: The Internet’s Favourite Cat Stays Viral If there’s one thing the internet loves, it’s cats. Enter Popcat, the meme coin born from the viral Popcat clicking game that had millions of people mindlessly popping their way to internet glory. But Popcat isn’t just cute—it’s a serious contender in the meme coin space. Popcat’s charm lies in its ability to bridge the gap between meme lovers and crypto enthusiasts. Its recent price action reflects this, as the token hovers around $1.04 after a strong surge last week. With its fanbase growing rapidly across social platforms, analysts predict that Popcat could see another 2–3x pump as more investors jump in this weekend. What makes Popcat one of the best meme coins to join this weekend is its virality. It’s not just a token—it’s a cultural moment. As long as people love clicking cats (and let’s face it, they always will), Popcat has a place in the crypto world. Whether you’re in it for the memes or the gains, this one’s worth watching. Peanut the Squirrel: Binance Feud Sends PNUT Into a Frenzy Drama alert! Peanut the Squirrel, the adorable mascot behind $PNUT, has found itself in the middle of a legal nutstorm. Mark Longo, Peanut’s owner, has accused Binance of swiping the squirrel’s likeness to promote the $PNUT meme coin—without asking for so much as a crumb of permission. Now, Longo’s cracking open the legal vault, demanding Binance cease and desist before December 31, or risk a hefty penalty of up to $150,000 per infringement. Here’s the twist: Peanut isn’t just any meme-worthy rodent. Since 2017, it’s been a trademarked icon for animal welfare and education, which makes this meme coin controversy more than just typical crypto chaos. While Binance remains tight-lipped (probably dodging metaphorical acorns), the showdown could have a much bigger impact on the crypto world. Some legal experts argue this case might reshape how intellectual property is handled in the wild-west realm of meme coins. Despite the legal nutcracking, $PNUT is soaring. With a market cap sitting around $2.25 billion, the coin’s community is rallying behind their furry champion, pushing it even higher as the news spreads. Whether Binance bows to Peanut’s legal demands or fights back remains to be seen, but one thing’s clear—this squirrel’s got claws, and it’s not backing down. For investors looking to ride the hype, Peanut the Squirrel is a must-watch among the best meme coins to join this weekend. Make Your Move: Join the Bulls with BTFD Coin If you’re looking for the best meme coins to join this weekend, BTFD Coin is the standout choice. With $4.1 million raised, a presale price of $0.00013, and its sights set on even bigger milestones, now is the time to secure your spot before prices climb higher. Don’t miss the chance to be part of the bullish stampede. Visit the BTFD Coin presale today, grab your tokens, and ride the wave to potential life-changing gains.

37803305,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/is-gambling-at-an-online-casino-worth-it,1734534497,Is Gambling at an Online Casino Worth It?,"Is gambling at online casinos worth it? The answer depends on several things, but ultimately it all boils down to what your goals are in life and how well you’re able to manage your affairs. If you play casino online games for fun, and you practise gambling responsibly, it's one of the most enjoyable leisure activities there is. My name is Leon Górski. I am an online gambling expert and a key member of the team at PolskieSloty.com . I am passionate about gambling at online casinos and would like to take this opportunity to share that passion with you and tell you about the pros and cons of what I believe to be an exciting, fun, pastime. The Pros Far Outweigh the Cons If you enjoy having fun, gambling at a top online casino is right up there with the best leisure time experiences. There are really only a couple of cons. One is the danger of problem gambling. But, if you learn how to gamble responsibly, that issue will never arise. With help from Polskie Sloty to find the most trusted online casino at which you can develop your gambling skills, you’ll be in for a great time. The other con to be aware of is online safety. All online activities where money changes hands attract scammers. But the good news is that if you use a top casino review site, like Polskie Sloty, all the online casinos they recommend have been pretested and vouched safe and secure. Understanding the Lay of the Land The “house edge” is something that is designed to ensure that online casinos run out winners in the long term. You can’t expect to win every time you place a bet, and yes, you will face some losses when you play casino online games. But you will win some money too. How much you win – whether you just reduce your losses, break even, or land a jackpot win (some jackpots sums are life-changers), is in the lap of the gods. All top online casino platforms, like the ones recommended by Polskie Sloty, follow online casino best practice, by offering games, the outcomes of which are completely random. They use RNGs (Random Number Generators) and the most trusted online casino platforms have their RNGs regularly tested and certified to ensure they produce truly random outcomes regarding each spin, card dealt, or dice rolled. But, returning to the concept of the “house edge,” each game has an RTP (Return to Player) percentage, and you won’t find any over 100%. Most RTPs, however, are in the range of 94% to 99%. The Importance of Casino Review Sites like Polskie Sloty I already mentioned the role that top online casino review sites play in terms of player safety and security. But that’s not all they do. Polskie Sloty, for example, offers other key services, including casino reviews, casino game reviews, bonus and promotion offer reviews, and feedback from other online gamblers. Having access to genuine, unbiased reviews is invaluable. It provides you with all of the data and information you need to be able to pick the most trusted online casino that best suits your player profile. Help with Choosing the Right Bonus Offer All online casinos offer bonuses and promotions. Competition is fierce, and in order to attract new players, and turn them into regular visitors, they each try to outdo their rivals by offering the most lucrative bonuses. These include welcome bonuses, no deposit bonuses, low deposit bonuses, free spins bonuses, reload bonuses, cashback bonuses, and special daily or weekly promotions. All the bonuses offered by the top online casino sites and shown at Polskie Sloty are displayed in a way that makes it easy to choose the right one for you at the time. This is done by highlighting the key features of each deal. Help with Managing the Cost of Gambling I can’t over-express how important it is to gamble responsibly . You should never gamble more than you can comfortably afford to lose. Set a budget per session and stick to it religiously. Choosing bonus offers carefully is an excellent way of keeping your costs low, especially with things like matched welcome bonuses, whereby the casino matches the amount you deposit 100% or even more. Another useful aspect of Polskie Sloty’s most trusted online casino reviews, is the sections relating to a casino’s loyalty or VIP program. The higher you climb, the more rewards, free spins, and cashback deals you’ll be entitled to. Closing Thoughts Providing your main aim when you play casino online games is to have fun, and you gamble responsibly, gambling on the Internet is definitely worth it in terms of enjoyment. Many people land some nice jackpots in the process too, which make the experience even sweeter. But landing big jackpots should only ever be looked at as a bonus, not an expectation.

37803410,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629722,1734534194,“MUSK 2028”? How Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E could help him make history and become a US president,"Mr. Elon Musk doesn’t do small dreams. His name has become synonymous with tearing apart the old and building the new, which makes him so beloved in the crypto community. Now with his proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” ( D.O.G.E ), Elon could extend his ambitions straight to the Oval Office. We’re aware that Elon has said before that he’d never run for office, but guess who used to say the same thing? President-elect Donald J. Trump. Elon Musk clearly isn’t content with running Tesla, sending rockets to Mars, or making memes on X (formerly Twitter)—he wants to reshape the American government, one inefficiency at a time. The eccentric billionaire poured over $119 million into Trump’s war chest and rallied voters through his social media platform, making him the largest donor not just this cycle, but in Trump’s entire political history. Now, with Trump back in the White House, Elon is becoming a power player in how the country is run, carving out space for his business empire while also redefining how government could operate. In fact, Trump has crowned him the nation’s “First Buddy.” The D.O.G.E play: Elon’s big power grab D.O.G.E is Elon Musk’s brainchild. While the name is an inside joke to us in the crypto community, the concept is actually pretty serious. Elon envisions a federal agency that slashes bureaucratic red tape and reorganizes government operations to work more like a business. He claims this could save billions, but D.O.G.E also conveniently positions Elon to influence federal policies directly tied to his companies. D.O.G.E could help SpaceX, Tesla, and other Elon ventures secure government contracts more easily. Regulations that have slowed Tesla’s autonomous vehicle tech or SpaceX’s satellite deployments might disappear overnight. Experts are already raising alarms. Stephen Diamond, a law professor, called Elon’s relationship with the federal government “unprecedented” and warned about what happens when one person’s interests align too closely with public policy. But Elon doesn’t seem bothered. Elon Musk’s fingerprints are all over Trump’s win Elon’s role in Trump’s 2024 victory wasn’t subtle. He turned X into a political weapon, amplifying Trump’s message to millions of users and drowning out opposition voices. One of Elon’s most audacious decisions was a $1 million daily giveaway for registered voters in key swing states. Critics called it unethical, but Elon’s lawyers brushed it off, and the cash kept flowing. The strategy worked. Young men, a demographic Elon has a strong grip on, showed up in droves to support Trump. The numbers don’t lie — Trump’s victory in battleground states was razor-thin, and Elon’s influence likely tipped the scales. But Elon’s tactics weren’t just about cash and social media. If we’re being entirely honest, his platform was a breeding ground for misinformation during the election. False claims about voter fraud spread like wildfire, often amplified by Elon himself. Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, called X a “hellscape of disinformation” under Elon Musk’s control. Election officials in states like Michigan were forced to debunk Elon’s claims in real-time, but the damage was done. The tax code hustle: Elon’s billions on the line When Elon officially joins the Trump administration, his financial gains will be massive. Under Section 1043 of the federal tax code, public officials can defer capital gains taxes when selling assets to avoid conflicts of interest. For Elon, whose net worth hit $347.8 billion in late 2024, this could mean billions in savings. Critics argue that Elon’s potential role in Trump’s administration is less about public service and more about self-service. Relaxed regulations could open the floodgates for Tesla and SpaceX to dominate their markets. Federal contracts, which SpaceX already relies on heavily, could flow even more freely. D.O.G.E, if implemented, would hand Elon unprecedented access to the levers of government power. Why Elon can’t be president (for now) Here’s the thing though: Elon Musk can’t legally run for president right now. The U.S. Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen, and Elon, born in South Africa and naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2002, doesn’t qualify. It’s a roadblock Elon can’t hack his way through—not without a constitutional amendment. Changing the Constitution is no small feat, but it’s not impossible. It’d just require approval from two-thirds of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures. Though even Trump, with all his influence, would struggle to pull it off. But let’s all think back to when Trump himself first announced that he was running for president. How ridiculous was that? No one took him seriously. No one thought this was a real possibility. It was simply too silly. But he did. And he has done many more nearly-impossible things since then too, with this year’s election win as one of them. The man did survive *two* assassination attempts. If he wants to make Elon Musk a president, whether in 2028 or 2032, I’m willing to bet he can do it. He’s probably the only person on earth who can. Although Elon doesn’t seem to want his influence to stop at America’s borders. His secret meetings with foreign officials, including Iran’s UN ambassador, clearly show a man with a geopolitical agenda. It makes sense since he is the richest person on the planet and, to some extent, a pretty decent human being. Of course, the meetings have raised eyebrows in Washington, but Elon Musk’s defenders argue that his international ties are an asset, not a liability. Whether it’s negotiating satellite launches with foreign governments or exploring crypto adoption on a global scale, Elon is always playing chess while everyone else plays checkers. Either way, the next four years are going to give Elon Musk all the time he needs to prove himself to the American public. A public that currently doesn’t like him as much as Trump. But come on, if Congress could be convinced into agreeing to dump America’s gold for Bitcoin, by the time the nerds start tweeting “MUSK 2028,” the idea is gonna seem much less ludicrous than it does right now. The way we see it, D.O.G.E is Elon’s chance to prove to the American people that they can trust him. He’d be making the US government efficient and transparent. If he plays his cards right, he really can become the most powerful person in the world, on all fronts.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-elon-musk-doge-could-become-us-president/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37803410.jpeg
37803115,https://crypto.news/?p=14320474,1734534140,"4 coins below $10 with potential to grow a $500 bet into $50,000 in 2 months","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance, Sui, Cardano, and Hedera lead coins under $10 poised to turn $500 into $50K in crypto’s ongoing bull run. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The presale powerhouse, ready to soar Sui: Riding the DeFi boom Cardano: A $4 target on the horizon Hedera: A 506% surge with more room for growth Conclusion A few select coins under $10 are set for spectacular development in the ongoing cryptocurrency market bull cycle. Here’s how Rexas Finance , Sui, Cardano, and Hedera may turn a $500 investment into a $50,000 profit in just two months. Rexas Finance: The presale powerhouse, ready to soar Rexas Finance continues to impress investors with its unprecedented presale success. The project has already reached Stage 10 of its public presale, with each RXS token valued at $0.15. With an outstanding $28 million raised and 345 million tokens sold, Rexas Finance is well on track to meet its fundraising goals. Following the presale, RXS is scheduled to list on at least three of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges for an initial price of $0.20 per token. RXS’s growing demand is supported by a unique ecosystem centered on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. This new platform converts assets into fractionalized digital tokens, making accessing traditionally illiquid sectors like real estate and art easier. Investors are attracted to its no-code token generation tools, powerful AI-powered security mechanisms, and multi-chain yield optimization capabilities. Following a recent Certik audit, Rexas Finance has earned a reputation as a dependable and secure platform. Moreover, the project’s appearance on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap increases its legitimacy and visibility among bitcoin players. With 20 top winners, each getting $50,000 in RXS tokens, Rexas Finance is also running a $1 million promotion. This method encourages early adopters while also building a loyal and engaged following. The expected benefits for RXS are nothing short of incredible. Analysts foresee a strong climb to $0.50 following the exchange listing, with the possibility for further expansion to $2 in the coming months. A $500 investment at the current presale price of $0.15 may result in a possible return of more than $6,600 — an astounding gain — just by capitalizing on the presale to listing period. Sui: Riding the DeFi boom SUI, the native cryptocurrency of the Layer-1 Sui blockchain network, is seeing a notable increase following a recent rise. Rising 26% in 24 hours, SUI, trading at $4.85, peaked all-time. Its total value locked (TVL) just achieved a record $1.835 billion, indicating widespread use of its decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols such as Suilend and NAVI. A breakout from a double-bottom pattern and strong technical indicators support SUI’s bullish outlook. With analysts forecasting a breakout over $5, Fibonacci retracement models suggest additional gains to $6.12, $6.75, and perhaps $7.66. If positive momentum continues, the currency might reach $10 within weeks. Sui’s alliances, like its latest integration with Backpack, have significantly strengthened its ecosystem. Backpack’s usage of Sui’s high-performance blockchain has created enormous prospects, increasing trading volumes and user access. Moving from $4.85 to $10 would yield a return of more than $1,000, more than double the initial $500 investment. Cardano: A $4 target on the horizon Cardano (ADA) continues to gain attention for its excellent long-term potential. Despite recent market turbulence, ADA’s price has remained solid at $1.01, up 75% in the last month. Renowned cryptocurrency researcher Ali Martinez predicts a rebound to $4 or perhaps $6 if ADA maintains its major support levels. The current Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, indicating potential for future improvements. Furthermore, Cardano’s on-chain data shows significant accumulation near the $1 level, with more than 93,000 addresses owning 2.54 billion ADA tokens. This strong demand supports optimism about ADA’s price trajectory. For a $500 investment at $1.01, ADA reaching $4 would return $1,980, a nearly fourfold return. With the potential for a further rise to $6, returns may explode to $2,970, making ADA an appealing option for those looking for big gains. Hedera: A 506% surge with more room for growth With a 506% increase in the last 30 days, Hedera (HBAR) has been quite exceptional in the current market cycle. Currently trading at $0.39, HBAR shows a positive attitude while it keeps above the Ichimoku Cloud. Despite some consolidation, experts expect HBAR to hit the $0.40 resistance level, with further upside objectives at $0.45 and $0.50. Hedera’s rapid usage in enterprise blockchain solutions and DeFi applications supports its optimistic thesis. With a $500 investment at $0.39, achieving $0.50 would yield a return of $641. HBAR’s mix of technical strength and real-world utility makes it an appealing investment for those eager to capitalize on the momentum. Conclusion For crypto investors aiming to turn a $500 bet into $50,000, Rexas Finance , Sui, Cardano, and Hedera provide enticing chances. These coins’ unique value propositions, excellent adoption rates, and bullish fundamental settings make them ideal candidates for exponential development. Rexas Finance stands out as a presale powerhouse with the potential to generate tremendous returns. Its unique approach to tokenization and ecosystem expansion ensures that it will remain a top choice for anyone looking to optimize their cryptocurrency returns in 2024.

42388948,265e3013-90d6-4330-8ffa-9fc38ad4f418,1734534051,WBTC Episode 'Reopened Old Wounds' of Centralized Failures: Bitcoin Builders Association,"Earlier this year, some users of wrapped bitcoin wBTC were dismayed to find its issuer BitGo was sharing custody of their bitcoin (BTC) with BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto custodian partly owned by TRON founder Justin Sun.  The episode ""reopened old wounds inflicted by previous centralized custody failure,"" even though it did not expose any novel flaws, the Bitcoin Builders Association (BBA) said in a report on Wednesday.  ""These wounds cause BTC holders to be unwilling to trade off their self-custody for trusted solutions,"" the report said.  The BBA noted that there's been signs of growing distrust toward centralized entities. WBTC's supply has dwindled to 0.74% of the total bitcoin circulating supply from 1.5% over two years ago.  The collapse of numerous crypto entities in 2022 highlighted the risks of ceding custody of one's coins to centralized custodians, a lesson that many users are not willing to learn the hard way again.  WBTC Dominance  WBTC is an Ethereum-based token tradable 1:1 for BTC, allowing users to put their assets to work in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world which is largely unavailable in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  The token is comfortably the market leader in the tokenized BTC sector, accounting for a 60.4% share, according to the BBA. When added together with distant runner up BTCB (built on BNB), the two tokens have a market share of 87.2%.  However, this consolidation could be in the process of being broken up given the uptick in new tokens emerging of late. Of the 21 different participants in this sector, 40% have launched in 2024 or will do so in the near future, the BBA said.  The BBA listed each of these participants in the report and addressed some of the pros and cons of a select few. For example, wBTC is the most liquid token, is integrated across all the largest blockchains and has been stress-tested for over five years. However, the venture with BiT Global is a concern for many given the counterparty risk it introduces, ""especially considering the involvement of Justin Sun, known for controversial practices in the crypto space,"" according to the report.  On other hand, a token like Bitcoin layer-2 Stacks' sBTC has yet to be stress tested (having gone live only this week) and its novel programming language Clarity can make DeFi integration more tricky. On the plus side, it is more decentralized than wBTC and inherits the protection of the Bitcoin network's security.  The tokenized BTC market represents a mere 1.23% of the total bitcoin market cap, equal to around $25 billion at the time of writing.  ""This highlights the immense untapped potential for solutions offering a programmable version of BTC,"" the BBA said.

37803019,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664244,1734534038,"US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Push Price To $500,000: Expert","In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, shared his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, projecting significant price appreciation by the end of 2025. “We expect Bitcoin to be up above $200,000 by this time next year,” Hougan stated, attributing this forecast to three primary sources of demand: exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate investments, and governmental acquisitions. Hougan elaborated, “There are ETFs that are vacuuming up Bitcoin, public companies like MicroStrategy are accumulating Bitcoin, and now we’re seeing discussions about governments investing in Bitcoin. It ultimately boils down to supply and demand—there’s too much demand and not enough supply, which drives the price higher.” When probed about the sustainability of such demand, Hougan emphasized the gradual awakening of different investor segments to Bitcoin’s value proposition. “People just wake up to Bitcoin at different paces. We’ve seen retail investors engage first, followed by companies and financial advisors, and now institutions are recognizing that Bitcoin belongs in a diversified portfolio,” he explained. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Here? What Historical HODLer Selloff Pattern Says “Bitcoin is now a global macro asset worth a few trillion dollars, and virtually every investor should have some exposure. We still have a large number of investors to go, which is why I believe we’re still early in this journey. We have many quarters to go,” he added. How High Can Price Go If The US Buys Bitcoin? A pivotal aspect of Hougan’s forecast hinges on the potential establishment of a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). Addressing this, Hougan remarked, “If we do get a Bitcoin strategic reserve where the government is buying Bitcoin, as proposed in Senator Lummis’ bill for the government to purchase a million Bitcoin, $200,000 Bitcoin is going to be looking quaint. You’re going to be looking at three four $500,000 Bitcoin. It’s just too big a story because governments all around the world would have to do it.” Hougan admitted that he was first skeptical about Trump suggestions to establish a SBR. “But over the months, it hasn’t gone away in fact we continue to see leaders in the Trump Administration suggest that they’re open to it,” Hougan remarked. The Bitcoin CIO still thinks that the odds of the US government buying Bitcoin is less than 50%, but “it’s not zero,” he added. “If it happens or if we start to see it happening in other countries, you’re going to see a rip up in Bitcoin that will make 2024 look pretty docel in comparison.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned? Hougan also highlighted the role of institutional platforms, specifically citing Coinbase as a potential major beneficiary in the evolving crypto landscape. “Coinbase is currently about half the size of Charles Schwab, and we believe it could surpass Schwab in brokerage size,” he noted. “Coinbase hasn’t had major competitors bubbling up to challenge it; it’s sort of had a degree of regulatory capture, if you can believe it. As a result, it’s been able to sustain its high margins in brokerages and then layer on things like stablecoins. [..,.] It’ll also help if it gets into the S&P 500; you see institutions buying it broadly. I think it’s a really unique situation driven by the fact that there was so much regulatory uncertainty—it cleared the competitive fat path and now it’s going to reap those rewards and build a really, you know, maybe an unsalable position leading this industry in the US.” Looking ahead to the broader market, Hougan anticipated an influx of crypto-related companies entering public markets. “We can expect firms like Kraken, Anchorage, and Chainalysis to go public, further normalizing the industry,” he stated. “This influx will lead to increased Wall Street coverage and institutional investment, setting the stage for a robust IPO window in 2025.” Despite the optimistic outlook, Hougan acknowledged potential risks that could impede Bitcoin’s growth. “The biggest risk is that politicians don’t deliver on their promises—if we don’t achieve regulatory clarity or fail to establish a strategic reserve, the expected bull market might not materialize,” he cautioned. “Regulatory and political factors are crucial drivers for crypto in 2025, and any setbacks in these areas could pose significant challenges.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $104,212.

37804380,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52485,1734534020,Assessing Plus Wallet & Rabby Wallet: Who Leads in Boosting Gains Amid XRP’s Rise?,"This week spotlights thrilling developments for XRP holders, with expert forecasts suggesting notable price gains following Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch and potential resolution of ongoing legal issues. XRP might soon break past the $4 mark. In such an optimistic market, traders are on the lookout for top-tier crypto wallet s to maximize their gains. Both Plus Wallet and Rabby Wallet are currently in the limelight. Plus Wallet has captured the attention of active traders with its user-focused features that offer cross-chain support and passive income opportunities directly from its mobile app. Additionally, it empowers users by letting them vote on blockchain integrations, enhancing their control over asset management and strategic choices. On the other hand, Rabby Wallet is crafted to streamline DeFi operations, equipped with cross-chain support and token approval management to facilitate smoother transactions for its users. XRP Market Buzz: RLUSD Launch May Catalyze Breakout The latest buzz around XRP indicates a potential breakout on the horizon following nearly two weeks of price stabilization. Industry experts believe that the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, recently greenlit by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), could ignite this upward trajectory. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has announced that RLUSD will soon be operational on partner exchanges. While future XRP-based ETFs and outcomes of Ripple’s legal discussions might affect its long-term price, the RLUSD’s debut is poised to spur immediate gains. Analysts are speculating that once XRP crosses the $2.90 threshold, we might see it climbing towards $3.20 and even $4.40, opening lucrative opportunities for investors. Rabby Wallet: A DeFi-Focused Wallet for Seamless Cross-Chain Activity Rabby Wallet is designed for DeFi enthusiasts, offering a user-friendly interface with features such as token approval management and real-time slippage alerts to minimize trading risks. It supports key EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon, enabling efficient cross-chain interactions. The wallet also allows users to monitor detailed transaction data, including gas fees and balance changes, enhancing transparency. However, its credibility suffered earlier this year when a fake app mimicking Rabby Wallet duped users out of approximately $1.6 million, spotlighting significant security concerns. Plus Wallet: Empowering Users with More Control & Freedom Plus Wallet rocks the crypto world with its bold motto ‘more is more,’ ramping up user control, freedom, and rewards to new heights! It’s all about putting power back into the hands of the users, letting them call the shots on what new blockchains and features to introduce by casting their votes on social media. From Bitcoin to Solana and beyond, Plus Wallet’s got you covered with stellar cross-chain support. And guess what? They’ve just upped their game by adding Arbitrum and Base—two of the hottest Ethereum-scaling techs out there, all thanks to what users like you wanted! This move not only gives you the reins to steer your crypto journey but also opens up a treasure chest of fresh opportunities and assets to dive into. But that’s not all—Plus Wallet’s reward system is a game changer, dishing out passive income on every single trade you make. More trades mean more cash—it’s that simple. Throw in some top-notch security into the mix, and you’ve got yourself a crypto wallet that not only ensures your digital assets are locked down tight but also makes sure your wallet keeps swelling. Driven by constant feedback and never settling for less, Plus Wallet is the top crypto wallet, tailor-made for traders who crave the ultimate freedom, control, and value from their crypto exchanges. If you’re not on this train yet, you might want to hop on now! Concluding Insights The anticipated surge in XRP’s price, driven by the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD, presents an exhilarating opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. However, securing a reliable crypto wallet is crucial for safely leveraging these potential gains. While Rabby Wallet offers significant DeFi functionalities, its previous security incident might deter some users. In contrast, Plus Wallet shines with its user-centric approach, offering extensive cross-chain compatibility, robust security, and straightforward rewards. By allowing users to contribute actively to its evolution, Plus Wallet ensures it consistently meets their needs and grants them greater agency. For those looking for a secure, adaptable, and rewarding crypto experience, Plus Wallet remains the top crypto wallet on the market today.

37803321,https://blockworks.co/news/sonic-labs-unveils-sonic-mainnet-the-future-of-fast-evm-compatible-blockchains,1734534000,"Sonic Labs unveils Sonic mainnet: The future of fast, EVM-compatible blockchains","Sonic Labs has officially launched its Sonic mainnet, a next-generation EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain built to empower developers with robust features and compelling incentives. With the capability to handle up to 10,000 transactions per second and near-instant finality, Sonic sets a new benchmark for performance. It also features a native decentralized bridge that seamlessly connects to Ethereum, making it a powerful platform for building innovative, high-impact applications. Spearheaded by the team behind Fantom, Sonic is rooted in proven technology. The introduction of the S token propels Sonic far beyond Fantom and FTM, reshaping the landscape of DeFi. It’s engineered to provide developers with cutting-edge tools while offering users rapid access to abundant liquidity. For FTM holders, the transition to Sonic couldn’t be easier—thanks to a simple 1:1 token upgrade to S. Empowering Developers: Sonic’s Innovative Fee-Share Model Sonic Labs is revolutionizing how blockchain developers are rewarded. Unlike traditional platforms that prioritize extracting value, Sonic takes a radically different approach: channeling a substantial portion of network fees back to the developers themselves. This strategy reflects a strong commitment to fostering an ecosystem rooted in innovation, growth, and long-term sustainability. The Fee Monetization (FeeM) program is a game-changer. Developers can earn up to 90% of the fees generated by their applications—similar to revenue-sharing models seen in Web2 platforms like YouTube, but implemented within a decentralized environment. The model incentivizes app success, meaning developers earn more as their applications attract greater engagement and usage. By blending proven digital monetization strategies with cutting-edge blockchain technology, Sonic empowers developers to build, scale, and profit from their applications efficiently and sustainably. Introducing Sonic Gateway: The Decentralized Bridge As blockchain ecosystems grow, the demand for secure and efficient cross-chain solutions is at an all-time high. Unfortunately, many existing bridges rely on centralized structures, making them prime targets for hacks and failures. Sonic Gateway by Sonic Labs changes the game. This decentralized bridge seamlessly connects Ethereum and Sonic, offering a secure and user-friendly experience. Here’s what sets it apart: Uncompromising Security: Sonic Gateway prioritizes your asset safety. If the bridge becomes inactive for two weeks, a built-in fail-safe allows you to recover your funds directly on Ethereum. This permanent safety net ensures peace of mind and reliable protection. Blazing-Fast Transfers: Transfers occur in predictable intervals—every 10 minutes from Ethereum to Sonic, and hourly in reverse. Need faster access? Opt for the Fast Lane feature to bridge instantly by paying a minimal fee.

Mantra ( OM ) token rose to $4, slightly above the lowest level this week. This rebound pushed the token’s market cap to over $3.8 billion. Its rally occurred even as the staking yield dropped to 15.4%. This represents a decline of over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to StakingRewards . This drop happened despite the staking market cap rising by over 5% to $2.4 billion. Still, Mantra offers one of the highest staking rewards in the crypto industry. For instance, Polygon yields 5.6%, while Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) yield 3.2% and 6%, respectively. Staking involves delegating tokens to help secure a network. Yields typically come from the fees the network earns and are distributed monthly. You might also like: Chainlink price reverses as one whale keeps accumulating LINK tokens Mantra’s high staking yield has contributed to its status as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies this year, with its price increasing by over 7,200% from its lowest point. This rally intensified recently when the network launched MantraChain, a layer-1 network for building Real World Asset tokenization products. MantraChain aims to become the main blockchain for developers in the fast-growing tokenization sector. According to its developers, the chain addresses the blockchain trilemma of decentralization, security, and scalability by leveraging Cosmos SDK, one of the most popular frameworks in the crypto industry. The tokenization industry has grown significantly in recent years. For example, Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), a leading tokenization project, has accumulated over $600 million in assets. Other tokenized assets, such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX, have a combined total of over $1 billion in assets. Mantra price prepares a big move ahead Mantra price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that OM price has been consolidating in recent weeks following its vertical rally in November. This consolidation phase forms part of a bullish pennant chart pattern, a popular continuation signal. The pattern consists of a long vertical line followed by a symmetrical triangle. Assets typically experience strong breakouts when the triangle approaches its confluence point. If the pattern holds, OM price could rebound and initially rise to its year-to-date high of $4.5. A move above that level could signal further gains, potentially pushing the price to the next psychological level of $5. However, a drop below the support level at $3.5 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

In an updated list published by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), four new exchanges have received regulatory clearance to operate in the city. The latest licensing round takes the total number of crypto exchanges in Hong Kong to seven.Notably, the Hong Kong SFC granted the virtual asset trading platform (VATP) license to Accumulus Global Technology, DFX Labs, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology (BVI).Hong Kong Expands Its Crypto ReachThe approval followed an earlier commitment from the SCF. The regulators disclosed in October that they would approve some of the 15 pending applications.The newly approved firms join HaskKey , HKVAZ, and OSL Digital Services as the only licensed exchanges in the region. Notably, several exchanges, such as OKX and HTX, retracted their applications, citing unfavorable regulatory requirements.Meanwhile, the new VATP license receivers will confine their offerings to a limited scope until the SCF completes a full rectification action. The regulator noted it would further assess the firms and administer the vulnerability and penetration tests.According to Eric Yip, SFC’s executive director of intermediaries, the move aligns with Hong Kong’s innovation endgame. The director stated that SCF aims to allow retail investors access to digital asset innovation while protecting their interests.Hong Kong’s Crypto Hub PushThe latest development is part of Hong Kong's broader ploy to become a global cryptocurrency hub. The region has created an environment conducive to digital asset growth, aiming to attract the innovation amid an initial Western skepticism.This quest led to the approval and launch of the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) earlier in the year. Interestingly, Hong Kong’s crypto support came despite the crypto ban on the Chinese mainland.Moreover, Hong Kong’s crypto-friendly stance encouraged ZA Bank, the largest virtual bank in the state, to offer cryptocurrencies to retail customers.

Here Are the Details,"Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the blockchain-based service that simplifies address resolution, has announced plans to develop its own Layer 2 network, dubbed Namechain, using Linea’s advanced technology stack. Ethereum Name Service Partners with Linea to Build 'Namechain' Layer 2 Network ENS selected Linea, a Layer 2 solution based on zkEVM, for its ability to maintain full compatibility with Ethereum's existing smart contracts and tools. As ENS shared in a recent blog post, zkEVM technology enables reliable and seamless interactions between Ethereum’s Layer 1 and the new Namechain Layer 2. Linea is also recognized as the first Layer 2 team to implement a trust-minimized version of ERC-3668 and provide decentralized cross-chain name resolution for ENS altcoins. The Linea platform is powered by Consensys, a leading Ethereum-focused research and development firm. The Namechain initiative is at the core of ENSv2, an upgrade introduced earlier this year that aims to increase the scalability and affordability of the Ethereum Name Service. This upgrade includes: Tier 2 Adoption: Domain name registrations and renewals will move to Tier 2 Name Chaining, reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency. Layer 1 Integration: Name resolution services will remain on Ethereum Layer 1 to maintain ENS's decentralized infrastructure and compatibility. The move to Tier 2 is expected to increase ENS's capacity to process larger volumes of domain name registrations and renewals, improving overall user experience and cost efficiency. With Namechain, ENS aims to further expand its use in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other blockchain-based ecosystems. This development underscores ENS's commitment to remain at the forefront of blockchain innovation while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum's core network. *This is not investment advice.

37802877,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629689,1734533395,Binance sued in Australia over alleged consumer protection breaches,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has launched legal action against Binance Australia Derivatives, accusing the crypto trading platform of misclassifying over 500 retail clients as wholesale investors. According to ASIC’s press release , Binance’s misclassification allegedly stripped clients of vital consumer protections under Australian financial laws, prompting a lawsuit that could have significant repercussions for the platform’s operations in Australia. The legal action targets the crypto exchange’s conduct between July 2022 and April 2023, alleging that the platform wrongly classified 505 retail investors as wholesale clients. These 505 clients, making up 83% of Binance Australia’s user base, were denied access to crucial consumer rights and protections that retail clients are entitled to under Australian law. Binance Australia’s regulatory failures and legal violations Per ASIC’s laws, retail clients trading crypto derivative products are legally entitled to a Product Disclosure Statement (PDS), access to a compliant dispute resolution scheme, and a Target Market Determination (TMD). However, ASIC claims the crypto exchange failed to provide these protections, allowing clients to trade high-risk, speculative products without proper safeguards. As a result, many of these clients reportedly suffered substantial financial losses. ASIC’s legal filing outlines several key violations that the exchange allegedly committed during the period in question. These include failing to ensure that its financial services were delivered efficiently, honestly, and fairly and failing to comply with the conditions of its Australian financial services license. The crypto exchange is also under scrutiny for not adequately training its employees to handle compliance matters. ASIC’s Deputy Chair, Sarah Court, emphasized the seriousness of the violations, stating that Binance’s “compliance systems were woefully inadequate” and that the platform exposed more than 500 clients to unregulated financial risks. She highlighted that the mishandling of these retail clients’ classifications contributed to the significant financial losses many experienced. ASIC and Binance Australia’s tense relationship The legal action follows a targeted review by ASIC into the crypto exchange’s Australian financial services operations. In December 2022, the regulator began scrutinizing Binance’s classification of clients. This led to the issuance of a hearing notice under the Corporations Act 2001, aimed at considering the suspension or cancellation of Binance’s Australian financial services (AFS) license. The leading crypto exchange ultimately requested the license’s cancellation, which ASIC granted in April 2023. In addition to the lawsuit, ASIC has been overseeing compensation payments to affected clients. In 2023 alone, the regulator facilitated the return of approximately $13.1 million to clients who were misclassified and deprived of consumer protections. Binance faces additional legal challenges The lawsuit is just one of several legal hurdles currently facing Binance. The crypto exchange is also embroiled in a legal battle with the estate of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. In November, FTX filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, alleging that a 2021 share deal between the companies was fraudulent. The FTX estate claims that Binance and Zhao, along with others, sold a 20% stake in FTX and an 18.4% stake in its U.S. entity, West Realm Shires, back to the company in a transaction allegedly funded by FTX’s Alameda Research division. The lawsuit accuses Binance of facilitating the deal using Binance’s exchange tokens and dollar-pegged stablecoin, totaling at least $1.76 billion. Moreover, the crypto exchange is also trying to fend off allegations of IP theft from Peanut the Squirrel owner Mark Longo, who claims the exchange of using his trademark without authorization.

37804464,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105610,1734533064,BitMEX Founder Predicts ‘Harrowing Dump’ in Crypto Market Next Year; Here’s Why,"Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX and investment company Maelstrom, predicts a potential crypto market crash in January. The top crypto stakeholder made the shocking prediction in a recent Substack blog post . He noted that even though the recent crypto rally commenced following Donald Trump's re-election, the market will experience a harrowing dump around his inauguration on January 20, 2025. Factor That Could Trigger Major Dip Ahead of his inauguration, crypto investors are expecting Trump to start implementing key policy changes for the industry on his first day in office. Notably, Hayes acknowledges this high expectation among investors, which he claimed boosted crypto prices recently. However, he speculates that Trump might have only a year to effect key policy changes in the crypto industry.The BitMEX co-founder said once investors realize that Trump cannot meet their lofty expectations of him, it could result in disappointment. Consequently, investors might start selling their assets, leading to a heavy market crash, which he characterized as a ‘harrowing dump.’ Maelstrom Investment Strategy Hayes reveals the strategy his investment firm, Maelstrom, plans to utilize in anticipation of this massive market crash. According to him, Maelstrom will reduce its exposure to cryptos before the anticipated harrowing dump. Following the dump, the investment company will rebuy some core positions at discounted prices within the first half of 2025. This suggests that Hayes expects the prices of cryptos to rebound after the massive sell-off; hence, the company will rebuy some core positions in anticipation of a future rally. National Bitcoin Reserve Won’t Happen Furthermore, he commented on specific promises Trump made during his campaign, especially the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. Despite praising the initiative, Hayes asserted that the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile would not come to fruition under Trump’s administration. This indicates that the U.S. will not hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The Bitcoin strategic reserve initiative has sparked major debates within the crypto industry since Trump first hinted at plans to set it up under his administration. As a result, U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) proposed the Bitcoin Act 2024 as part of measures to strengthen the dollar. The bill requires the U.S. to accumulate 1 million BTC over five years, which will be held for 20 years. While some crypto stakeholders do not support the initiative, asset managers like VanEck have endorsed it. Meanwhile, Hayes’ bearish prediction comes as the crypto market witnesses a sharp decline, thanks to Bitcoin’s rollercoaster movement. The market has fallen by 3.12% over the past 24 hours to $3.65 trillion. Over the day, Bitcoin has fallen by 2.77% to $104,666, while Ethereum is down 3.52% in the same timeframe to $3,865.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/bitmex-founder-predicts-harrowing-dump-in-crypto-market-next-year-heres-why/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitmex-founder-predicts-harrowing-dump-in-crypto-market-next-year-heres-why,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png
37802451,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105608,1734532874,Germany’s Largest Bank Deutsche Bank to Launch an Ethereum Layer-2 for Financial Institutions,"Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany by total assets, is exploring the launch of an Ethereum layer-2 to address compliance issues for financial institutions. This is according to a report from Bloomberg today. Notably, the layer-2 network will especially be useful for mainstream financial institutions looking to get into blockchain but are hindered by compliance concerns. The Purpose of Project Dama 2Named Project Dama 2, the initiative seeks to improve transaction efficiency while ensuring stricter regulatory compliance for financial institutions.Public blockchains, such as Ethereum , hold great promise for asset tokenization and improving operational efficiency. However, they could present compliance challenges for regulated organizations, including risks of interacting with unauthorized or sanctioned entities. To address these issues, Deutsche Bank's Layer-2 solution will connect with Ethereum and leverage ZKsync technology to enable more efficient and affordable transactions.Boon-Hiong Chan, who leads applied innovation for Deutsche Bank in the Asia-Pacific region, stated that the Layer-2 framework enables banks to design a tailored list of validators for processing digital asset transactions. Notably, this method improves compliance by ensuring only approved entities are involved in validation. Furthermore, the platform is designed to provide regulators with exclusive oversight abilities, allowing them to track fund movements when required.For context, Project Dama 2 is a component of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) Project Guardian, a program that brings together 24 leading financial institutions to explore blockchain-based asset tokenization. Centralization Risks?Deutsche Bank's participation confirms its dedication to using blockchain for enhancing operations while adhering to stringent regulatory standards. The bank plans to release a minimum viable product of the platform next year, subject to regulatory approval.However, the project's design, which includes curated validators and exclusive oversight rights for regulators, raises concerns among blockchain enthusiasts who value decentralization as a core principle. With the decision to hand over regulators ""super admin rights"" and limit transaction validation to approved entities, the initiative could undermine the open and permissionless nature of blockchain. Deutsche Bank Warming up to Crypto and BlockchainMeanwhile, this development is not Deutsche Bank's first foray into blockchain and digital assets. In June 2024, the bank partnered with Austrian crypto broker Bitpanda to facilitate cryptocurrency transactions for its clients. This collaboration enabled Deutsche Bank customers in Germany to buy and sell cryptocurrencies through internal transfers, simplifying the investment process in digital assets. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank has been exploring crypto custody services. In May 2024, reports confirmed that the bank plans to offer digital asset custody solutions, aiming to provide secure storage for cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Before this, last June, Deutsche Bank applied with Germany's regulator Bafin to procure a digital asset custody license. Most recently, Deutsche Bank inked a partnership with leading exchange Crypto.com to help the platform bolster its banking support in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/germanys-largest-bank-deutsche-bank-to-launch-an-ethereum-layer-2-for-financial-institutions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=germanys-largest-bank-deutsche-bank-to-launch-an-ethereum-layer-2-for-financial-institutions,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The crypto mining platform, which has been a mainstay of the industry for over a decade, has announced its relocation to Zug, Switzerland. Zug offers a regulatory environment that aligns with NiceHash’s mission to operate transparently while supporting its global user base. While already running compliant operations in Europe, the shift of HQ demonstrates its determination to walk the walk. The transition, initiated in November and expected to conclude by mid-December, places NiceHash at the heart of one of the world’s most blockchain-friendly jurisdictions. The relocation not only enhances NiceHash’s ability to comply with the European Union’s evolving regulations but reinforces its reputation as a trusted platform in the crypto mining space. A Strategic Move Amid Tightening Regulations NiceHash’s decision to base itself in Switzerland comes as the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) prepares to take full effect by the end of 2024. MiCA introduces a comprehensive framework for crypto assets, mandating stringent requirements for issuers and service providers. Additionally, the Travel Rule obliges cryptocurrency platforms to collect and share customer information for transactions above specific thresholds, aligning crypto operations with traditional financial standards. By relocating to Zug, NiceHash can position itself as a proactive player in this new regulatory landscape. Switzerland’s clear and supportive legal framework ensures that NiceHash can continue to provide its services to European users while meeting the requisite compliance standards. Crypto companies operating across the EU are now rapidly falling into line with MiCA. Crypto Mining Comes in From the Cold While crypto exchanges have been widely regulated for several years now, it’s taken longer for the mining sector to follow suit. In an increasingly interconnected digital landscape, however, that intersects with fiat on- and off-ramps, compliance has become unavoidable. Aside from avoiding the wrath of regulators, mining firms that adhere to international standards stand to benefit from institutional capital, which is fast flowing into every major crypto vertical. Since its inception in 2014, NiceHash has focused on driving down the barriers to cryptocurrency mining by creating a marketplace where buyers and sellers of hashing power can connect. Sellers can monetize idle computing resources, while buyers gain access to on-demand computational power without the need for expensive hardware. This flexibility has made NiceHash a go-to platform for hobbyists and professional miners alike. Where NiceHash has led, other mining companies are likely to follow. The benefits of maintaining MiCA compliance aren’t just limited to keeping regulators at bay: they’re a signal to European crypto users that they’re open for business, and that best practices will be followed when it comes to custody, audits, data storage, and verification. The move to Switzerland marks another chapter in NiceHash’s mission to simplify mining while maintaining transparency. Operating under one of the world’s most forward-thinking regulatory frameworks ensures NiceHash will continue to lead the industry in user-friendly mining solutions. As MiCA and other EU regulations are rolled out, crypto companies are being compelled to adapt or risk falling behind. Most are choosing the former.

Marszalek is the latest in a long line of tech and digital asset industry CEOs to make the trip to Mar-a-Lago to meet Trump before his return to the White House. Crypto.Com Drops Lawsuit Against SEC Trump met with Kris Marszalek, Chief Executive Officer of Crypto.com at Mar-a-Lago, with the pair discussing appointments related to the crypto industry, including in the financial departments, Congress, and the incoming administration, according to a source familiar with the meeting. The pair also discussed the potential Bitcoin strategic reserve. The meeting coincided with Crypto.com’s decision to drop its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission in an attempt to align with the incoming administration. The exchange voluntarily dropped its case against the SEC and its commissioners with prejudice, according to a filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Marszalek’s meeting with Trump comes after Coinbase’s Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong held a discussion with Trump. A Coinbase spokesperson said the platform looks forward to working with the new administration and developing clear regulations for the industry. “We look forward to working with the new administration to develop and advance clear regulations for the crypto industry so the US can become a global leader in digital assets and innovation.” Crypto.com filed a lawsuit against the SEC in October to counter a Wells notice received by the platform. A spokesperson for the platform stated the platform withdrew its lawsuit to work with the incoming administration. “We withdrew our action against the SEC given our intent to work with the incoming administration on a regulatory framework for the industry.” A Crypto-Friendly Administration Trump has indicated he will strongly support the crypto industry and has appointed several pro-crypto individuals to key roles in the incoming administration. These include Cantor Fitzgerald LP’s Howard Lutnick as the Commerce Secretary and Paul Atkins as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chair. Trump also appointed venture capitalist David Sacks as an artificial intelligence and crypto czar. Crypto.com is not the only platform that clashed with the SEC.

The layer 1 blockchain, considered a cheap alternative to Ethereum, registered a total transaction tally of 66.9 million, the highest since its inception in 2020, according to data source Artemis. To highlight how busy it was, Solana's transaction count eclipsed the total of all other major chains combined.  Solana also led other blockchains in terms of daily decentralized exchange trading volume and daily active addresses but lagged Base, Ethereum and Tron in the stablecoin transfer volume.  Since the dawn of the ongoing crypto bull run in early 2024, Solana has been a go-to blockchain for retail investors looking to make a quick buck from memecoins, NFTs and other smaller tokens.  Tuesday was no different, as holders of original Pudgy Penguins, Lil Pudgys, Rogs, and Soul Bound Tokens (SBT) lined up for the PENGU airdrop, which began at 08:00 ET. The project reported over 100,000 claims in the first hour with over 4.7 million website views.

The technology company also acknowledged its compliance with Spain’s Securities Market Law (Ley del Mercado de Valores) and its alignment with European Union regulations such as MiFID II. The investment firm noted that it may provide investment services such as tokenization of financial instruments. It also said it hopes to operate a DLT trading and settlement system, which is pending approval under the Pilot Regulation. Apart from acting as an ERIR, the company said it can offer all these services within a regulated environment that ensures robust investor protection and operational transparency. “Our approval as an Investment Firm and namely the ability to act as an ERIR in Spain is an important milestone for Securitize.” – Carlos Domingo, Co-founder and CEO of Securitize. Domingo also revealed that the approval will enable the company to tokenize, manage, and facilitate the lifecycle of digital securities in Europe. The CEO hopes that the approval will create new opportunities for issuers to raise capital. He also believes investors will get to access innovative, blockchain-powered investment opportunities under one regulatory-compliant platform. Securitize continues its European influence The firm disclosed that it became the first platform to issue digital asset securities in both the U.S. and Europe. Securitize announced on July 23, 2023, that it commenced the issuance of tokenized securities in Europe. Domingo also acknowledged that the company is the first to be able to issue and trade tokenized securities in both the U.S. and Europe. He added that the firm is the first to do so under the EU’s Pilot Regime for digital assets. The company was allowed to proceed with issuing, managing, and trading tokenized securities in Spain and the broader EU. The firm’s CEO also acknowledged that European businesses will have a new way to raise capital via primary capital raises and obtain tax benefits and liquidity through secondary trading. In October 2022, the firm partnered with asset management firm Hamilton Lane to enhance investor exposure by offering tokenized securities. Amparo Garcia Flores, CEO of Securitize Europe Brokerage and Markets, said it is proving that what it has in the USA is also feasible in Europe. Flores also revealed why opening their markets to both sides of the Atlantic was important. She said that it effectively doubled the size of the company and the opportunities for issuers in Europe who previously had different opportunities than their American counterparts. The firm was allowed to deploy digital asset securities to a select group of businesses and investors under supervision from the Spanish General Secretariat of the Treasury and International Finance. The investment firm offers a range of services in the U.S., including issuance, dividend distribution, capital increases, redemptions, shareholder meetings, and facilitating securities trading in the secondary market.

Coins like Arbitrum, Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, and BlockDAG are standing out, each addressing key blockchain challenges with innovative solutions. From enhancing scalability to integrating real-world data and enabling efficient transactions, these projects are setting new benchmarks, unlocking massive potential gains for 2025 and beyond. Let’s explore these best long-term cryptos and discover which one will lead during the next bull run. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): World’s Most Advanced Layer 1 Blockchain BlockDAG (BDAG) utilizes the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure to push the boundaries of scalability and decentralization. Unlike traditional blockchains, the DAG design ensures higher transaction throughput, making it ideal for a rapidly growing user base. Paired with its robust Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, BlockDAG ensures top-notch security and integrity, fostering user trust. This unique approach makes BlockDAG the world’s most advanced Layer-1 blockchain. BlockDAG’s crypto presale clearly reflects its growing market appeal, raising a staggering $168.5 million in just a few months. With a 2,240% surge from its initial $0.001 batch 1 price to $0.0234 in the current batch 26, early backers have already seen significant returns. With rising demand for BDAG coins and a remarkable price surge, BlockDAG is rapidly advancing toward its $600 million presale target, solidifying its position as the best long-term crypto in the market. Adding to its appeal, BlockDAG recently introduced a 5-tier bonus system for BDAG buyers. Using the code BDAG250, buyers unlock escalating rewards, starting with a generous 150% bonus. As users proceed, hidden “mystery bonuses” are revealed, encouraging ongoing participation and maximizing returns. With this offer ending on January 8, time is running out for both new and existing BDAG holders to seize the chance to maximize their holdings before it’s too late. 2. Chainlink (LINK): Reliable Data for Smart Contracts Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that bridges blockchains with real-world data, enabling smart contracts to interact with external systems such as APIs and payment gateways. This integration is crucial for decentralized applications requiring reliable data feeds for accurate execution. Known for its secure and tamper-proof oracles, Chainlink plays a foundational role in blockchain ecosystems by providing trustworthy data inputs. While its use cases continue to grow, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi), the network faces challenges from emerging competitors in the Oracle space. Despite its widespread adoption, investors should carefully evaluate its long-term potential as the market evolves. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Enhancing Ethereum’s Scalability Arbitrum is a Layer-2 solution designed to improve Ethereum’s scalability by using optimistic rollups to process transactions off-chain. This reduces gas fees and increases transaction speeds, making it a preferred choice for developers building decentralized applications. As Ethereum’s congestion issues persist, Arbitrum offers a practical alternative, especially for users seeking cost-effective solutions. Yet, its reliance on Ethereum’s ecosystem could expose it to broader market fluctuations and competition from other Layer-2 solutions. While ARB provides utility for immediate transactions, evaluating its place among the best long-term crypto investments demands a closer look at its market performance and adaptability. 4. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Fast Peer-to-Peer Payments Bitcoin Cash was created to address Bitcoin’s scalability limitations, offering a larger block size for faster and cheaper transactions. It aims to function as peer-to-peer electronic cash, emphasizing everyday usability. While its utility for global transactions is a notable feature, Bitcoin Cash faces stiff competition from other cryptocurrencies focusing on scalability and payment efficiency. Additionally, the coin’s performance is closely tied to its adoption for real-world transactions, which remains a key factor for its growth. While it offers utility for immediate transactions, assessing its relevance among the best long-term crypto coins requires careful consideration of its market performance and adaptability. Final Analysis: Which Is the Best Long-Term Crypto? The crypto market is full of opportunities, with projects like Chainlink, Arbitrum, and Bitcoin Cash continuing to attract attention for their unique features. On the other side, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a combination of cutting-edge technology and impressive presale achievements. Its Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure provides unmatched scalability and security, setting a new standard in blockchain technology. With a record-breaking presale raising $168.5 million and an engaging 5-tier bonus system offering escalating rewards for BDAG holders, BlockDAG solidifies its position as the best long-term crypto to buy now, offering a unique blend of innovation and high ROI potential.

Ohio becomes the third US state to do so after Texas and Pennsylvania. House Bill 703, the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, proposes the creation of a state Bitcoin fund and grants the treasurer the authority to purchase the asset. Ohio Proposes State Bitcoin Reserve The bill, introduced by Ohio State Representative Derek Merrin, sees Ohio follow in the footsteps of Texas and Pennsylvania in introducing a bill that would authorize the state treasury to use public funds and invest in Bitcoin (BTC). However, the bill does not mandate such investments. Representative Merrin released a statement highlighting the rapid devaluation of the US Dollar, suggesting that BTC could act as an avenue to protect tax revenue and strengthen the state’s financial position. Merrin stated on X, “Today, I filed HB 703 to create the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve within the state treasury! Provides state treasurer authority & flexibility to invest in #Bitcoin This legislation creates the framework for Ohio’s state government to harness the power of Bitcoin to strengthen our state finances. As the US dollar undergoes devaluation, #Bitcoin provides a vehicle to supplement our state's portfolio and preserve public funds from losing value.” House Bill 703 amends section 2981.12 and enacts section 135.146 of Ohio’s Revised Code. However, it does not mandate portfolio allocations or specific Bitcoin purchases. Merrin argued that the Ohio state government could use legislation to harness Bitcoin and strengthen the state’s financial reserves. Merrin anticipates the bill will be used as a framework during Ohio’s next legislative session. The bill must be reintroduced in the 136th General Assembly, which will commence January 6, 2025, and last two years. Merrin hoped the bill would “pave the way for legislatures to address it quickly next year.” “Bitcoin is revolutionizing finance and will reshape world economies. We must have sound money — It’s like digital property rights for everyone who owns it. This legislative sets up the framework for Ohio’s state government to harness the power of Bitcoin and strengthen our state finances.” Similar Legislation In Other States Ohio joins a fast-growing list of other US states enacting similar legislation. Texas and Pennsylvania have also introduced bills to establish a state Bitcoin reserve following Donald Trump’s victory in November. Trump also proposed creating a Federal Bitcoin reserve. Texas House Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act proposing the state’s comptroller hold BTC as the state’s reserve asset for a minimum of five years. Pennsylvania House Representative Mike Cabell introduced its bill a month earlier, proposing allowing the state treasury to hold up to 10% in BTC on its balance sheet. Cabell stated Bitcoin could be used as collateral or as a hedge, offering stability during periods of economic uncertainty. Ohio State Senator Niraj Antani proposed a separate tax bill proposing to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high, trading at $107,487. The market outlook for meme coins remains uncertain, with the potential for further decline. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $107,487 yesterday. However, meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) failed to follow suit. This leaves investors wondering what to do next.

Crypto Whales Add $75 Million Worth of LINK The on-chain metrics for LINK’s spot inflow/outflow reveal that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $75 million worth of LINK . Further data indicates that this notable outflow occurred over the past three trading days. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, “outflow” refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallets, indicating that long-term holders are withdrawing tokens. Additionally, this substantial accumulation suggests a potential upside rally and an ideal buying opportunity.

Current Price Momentum Currently, LINK is trading near $27.22 and has experienced a price decline of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, the asset’s trading volume decreased by 18%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.

With 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), sub-second finality, and a native, decentralized gateway to Ethereum, Sonic empowers developers to build the next generation of applications on unparalleled infrastructure and liquidity. Developed by the same team behind Fantom, Sonic and its S token deliver a significant leap forward from both Fantom and FTM. Through a one-to-one upgrade process from FTM to S, existing FTM holders can seamlessly start using Sonic. Sonic leverages proven expertise to establish itself as a DeFi hub by revolutionizing developer incentives while providing users with smooth user experiences and access to vast amounts of liquidity. Fee Monetization: Developers Come First Fee Monetization (FeeM) on Sonic rewards developers with up to 90% of the network fees generated by their applications, adopting the Web2 ad-revenue strategies popularized by platforms like YouTube. While many blockchains offer limited developer incentives and primarily focus on value extraction, Sonic addresses this issue effectively through its FeeM model. “Recently, we've seen many new chains launch, especially centralized layer 2s where the founders pocket all network fees. This excludes developers from the equation, forcing them to impose extra fees on users to earn revenue. FeeM addresses this by coding developer rewards directly into the chain, ensuring that network fees are shared with developers from the start.”— Sam Harcourt, Business Development Lead, Sonic Labs Developers on the Sonic chain receive a share of network fees generated by the traffic and engagement their applications attract, offering a built-in mechanism for ongoing revenue. Fantom to Sonic: Upgrading FTM to S Fantom and its FTM token are officially transitioning to Sonic and the S token. Sonic Labs is facilitating the transition by offering a dedicated upgrade portal on MySonic that allows FTM holders to seamlessly upgrade their FTM to S on a one-to-one basis. “We are proud to launch the new Sonic chain as the next evolution of Fantom, building on its impressive track record of nearly 100% uptime since 2019. Sonic is a revolutionary platform that prioritizes developers, empowering them to create applications with seamless user experiences while earning a share of network fees.”— Michael Kong, CEO, Sonic Labs During the initial 90 days after Sonic’s mainnet launch, holders can freely swap between FTM and S using the upgrade portal. After this period, holders will only be able to upgrade from FTM to S. Sonic Gateway: Secure, Decentralized Interoperability With the rise of cross-chain activity, secure and trustless bridges are more crucial than ever. Traditional layer-1 and layer-2 bridging solutions often rely on centralized systems, risking billions in potential losses . The Sonic Gateway addresses these challenges as a decentralized and trustless bridge between Ethereum and Sonic, offering: Security: A fail-safe ensures user funds can be recovered on Ethereum if the Gateway is down for 14 days, guaranteeing asset protection. Speed: Asset transfers are batched efficiently (every 10 minutes from Ethereum to Sonic and hourly in reverse). The Fast Lane feature lets users pay a small fee to bridge instantly. Decentralization: Operated by Sonic’s validators on both chains, the Gateway is as decentralized as Sonic itself, preventing centralized manipulation. ""To empower users with effective and trustless control of their assets, we developed the Sonic Gateway, which provides liquidity from other platforms. Powered by our own validators and secured by a fail-safe, the Gateway lets users and apps safely leverage the benefits and incentives of bringing new liquidity to Sonic."" — Bernhard Scholz, Chief Research Officer, Sonic Labs Sonic Labs will expand the Gateway beyond Ethereum in the future, enabling direct, decentralized access to multiple blockchains’ native assets. Sonic Airdrop: Distributing the S Token To encourage network growth, Sonic Labs is distributing 190.5 million S tokens through an airdrop program focusing on both users and developers. The program includes two incentive structures : Sonic Points: Rewards end-users for early adoption, asset holding, and overall engagement. Sonic Gems: Rewards developers for creating applications that drive user activity and innovation. Developers can convert Gems to S and share the tokens with their users to incentivize continuous usage. About Sonic Sonic is an EVM layer-1 platform that offers developers attractive incentives and powerful infrastructure. The chain provides over 10,000 TPS, sub-second confirmation times, and a secure gateway to Ethereum for enhanced liquidity and asset security.

Bitcoin: 6 Charts You Need To See,"Summary As predicted, MicroStrategy's breakout did foreshadow Bitcoin's surge. If MSTR is a leading indicator for BTC, its early peak suggests that Bitcoin's own top may be imminent. I project Bitcoin’s executable high to be around $120,000 for this cycle. Spikes well above this level are likely but may be too short-lived to trade effectively. This final move could have crypto across the board going wild. In October, I wrote an article here saying that MicroStrategy ( MSTR) had broken out upwards, and this was heavily indicative of a coming breakout for Bitcoin. This was the last sentence: “One thing is for sure, this is a moment that traders should be watching Bitcoin closely because if MicroStrategy is a leading indicator then Bitcoin is about to break out and break out big.” That was at $65000, and I hope this was useful for my readers. This was the chart then. MicroStrategy (ADVFN) And to me, it was what Bitcoin holders were looking for in BTC, which, at that time, was going inscrutably nowhere. Bitcoin price chart (ADVFN) So, it turned out that the idea MicroStrategy was a leading indicator panned out. At the peak, the company’s value was at a giant premium to its Bitcoin assets. Subsequently, this is what happened. MicroStrategy and Bitcoin price charts compared (ADVFN) But that is not scaled; when scaled it is remarkably different. MicroStrategy versus Bitcoin (ADVFN) ‘Whooh’ is the correct reaction. Here is another chart to give further context. ADVFN This really is ‘not normal.’ So, for me, if MicroStrategy is a leading indicator, the early peak is intriguing. Had Bitcoin peaked first in MicroStrategy with the physical lagging behind? Is MicroStrategy tipping us off for an imminent top? I project Bitcoin, as I have now for a very long time indeed, to hit the $120,000 area as a terminal target peak for this cycle. Such a top can hit even more elevated levels; it is likely to pop and drop all over the place and make all-time highs that are much higher than the tradable range as they last for short hours or even minutes. However, the executable high I have suggested is in the $120k zone but, of course, that is not fate. Here is a doodle. ADVFN It is just a roadmap but if MicroStrategy is a leading indicator we should be watching its price – and not Bitcoin’s - like a hawk. This final move will have all sorts of crypto going wild. For those playing the second liners or the crazies, it is Bitcoin’s transit that will determine the ‘buy, hold or sell’ call, and it seems highly likely it is MicroStrategy’s stock price that will signal the turn for Bitcoin when it comes. While even I can project the monstrous levels the Bitcoin Maxis are calling for in my charts, I still believe that the upside of this Bitcoin cycle is percentages rather than multiples but, in any event, we will need all the signals we can get to keep the profits of this ‘crypto summer’ because the past shows us that the turns in crypto are brutal. I can’t help but expect that the Trump inauguration will be the end of this run. It is perhaps a prediction too far, but buy on rumour sell on fact remains an investment classic.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745075-microstrategy-vs-bitcoin-6-charts-you-need-to-see?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37801938.jpeg
37803065,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/crypto-price-analysis-12-18-bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-solana-sol-dogecoin-doge-uniswap-uni-algorand-algo-optimism-op,1734531936,"Crypto Price Analysis 12-18 BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, UNISWAP: UNI, ALGORAND: ALGO, OPTIMISM: OP","Bitcoin (BTC) reached an all-time high for the second consecutive day, going past $108,000 and reaching a peak of $108,286. However, the cryptocurrency declined dramatically after reaching this level and is currently trading below $104,000, down almost 3% over the past 24 hours. Traders are now eying the $110,000 mark and are increasing bets for further gains in the options market. Markets registered a decline overall as Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $4,000 after registering a drop of almost 5%. Dogecoin (DOGE) also registered a fall of nearly 4%, while Cardano (ADA) is down by 4.50%. Chainlink (LINK) , Tron (TRX) , Avalanche (AVAX), Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), and Aptos (APT) also registered notable declines. As a result, the crypto market cap is down almost 3% and is currently at $3.63 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) Sets Another All-Time High Bitcoin (BTC) surged to a new all-time high of $108,268 late on Tuesday before declining dramatically to its current levels. BTC rose almost 2.2% on Tuesday to reach its latest milestone but could not push higher as it retreated thanks to growing selling pressure. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has seen gains of over 150% this year, with traders confident it will hit $110,000 before the end of the year. Their confidence is highlighted by the increasing bets for further gains in the options market. Shiliang Tang, the president of crypto principal trading firm Arbelos Markets, stated, “We’ve seen buyers of $110k-$120k and $110k-$125k call spreads in Jan expiry, as well as rolling up of long strikes from $100k/$105k to 120k+ strikes.” BTC surged past the $100,000 milestone less than two weeks ago after President-elect Donald Trump announced he was nominating Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto views, as the incoming Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also registered strong inflows as institutional interest in the asset continued to spike. James Butterfill, the Head of Research at CoinShares, stated, “What is driving prices is the US election dividend, and in 2025, the prospects for the US owning Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset (likely not priced according to Polymarket, which sees it as having only a 27 percent chance of happening), geopolitical instability, looser monetary policy — these factors are likely to remain supportive in 2025.” Major Altcoins Emerge As Top Performers The crypto market cap surged past $3.7 trillion on Tuesday before declining to its current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high, while Ethereum (ETH) also registered gains before declining. With the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) starting its last meeting of the year on Tuesday, markets remained bullish, anticipating a third consecutive rate cut decision. Market watchers anticipate the US Federal Reserve will likely lower its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points at the end of its two-day meeting. If the Fed delivers an expected rate cut, it will likely rekindle investor demand for risk assets and bring a wave of capital to BTC and other altcoins. XRP Bullish Following RLUSD Launch With Ripple announcing the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin, analysts are turning bullish on XRP, with some predicting its value could surge to $22 by 2025. Popular crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto has predicted XRP’s market capitalization could reach a staggering $1.2 trillion during the ongoing bull cycle, which could continue well into the new year. CrediBULL Crypto shared his analysis on X, stating, “Zoom out a little so you don’t forget the big picture. The structure on XRP here looks so freaking clean and bullish, it’s actually insane. Forget what happens on these lower time frames—it’s noise (for a non-trader), the big picture is incredibly and unequivocally bullish.” XRP has registered an impressive rally since November, with its value increasing by 500%. However, its momentum has waned after hitting resistance around the $2.88 mark, leading to a decline and a brief struggle to stay above the $2 level. Bitcoin-Ethereum Combo Fund To Lead Wave Of Crypto ETFs In 2025 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchnas has said he expects an exchange-traded fund tracking BTC and ETH to be the first in a wave of new crypto ETFs in 2025. Balchunas shared an analysis by fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart, stating, “We expect a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once. First out is likely the BTC + eth combo ETFs, then prob Litecoin (bc its fork of BTC = commodity), then HBAR (bc not labeled security), and then XRP/Solana (which have been labeled securities in pending lawsuits).” Balchunas and Seyffart expect the first Bitcoin and Ethereum combo fund to be closely followed by a fund tracking Litecoin (LTC) or Hedera (HBAR). However, Seyffart noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had rejected multiple Solana ETFs, adding that SOL and XRP ETFs would have to wait until Paul Atkins took charge of the SEC before being seriously considered. Balchunas believes regulators view LTC and HBAR more favorably, so they would get ETFs before assets like XRP and SOL. LTC is likely to be greenlit because it is a fork of BTC and could be viewed as a commodity. Meanwhile, the SEC does not view HBAR as a security by the SEC, which could make it easier for it to receive approval. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) went past $108,000 late on Tuesday, setting yet another all-time high before declining rapidly during the current session, with the price currently at $103,760. But what is driving BTC’s latest surge, and could growing institutional interest lead to a supply squeeze? BTC’s post-election gains stand well over 50%, with its most recent rally beginning after President-elect Donald Trump proposed establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic reserve, which sparked considerable excitement in the market. Another major factor driving the rally is growing institutional interest and activity, particularly from MicroStrategy. The company recently purchased its latest tranche of BTC worth $1.5 billion, bringing its total holdings to a staggering 439,000 BTC, valued around $48 billion at current prices. MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index is also expected to significantly boost demand for its stocks, which could positively impact BTC. BTC’s price action was mixed last week, as it registered a substantial drop on Monday, dropping almost 4% to an intraday low of $94,185 before settling at $97,434. Bearish sentiment persisted on Tuesday, with the price dropping to a low of $94,313 before settling at $96,912. BTC recovered on Wednesday to register an increase of just over 4% to climb above $100,000 and settled at $100,900. Despite positive price action on Wednesday, BTC fell back on Thursday, dropping by 0.97% and settling at $99,923. A recovery on Friday allowed BTC to reclaim the $100,000 level and settle at $101,394. Source: TradingView The weekend began with BTC registering a marginal decline on Saturday before rising almost 3% on Sunday to settle at $104,181. BTC surged to an intraday high of $107,464 to set an all-time high on Monday as bullish sentiment gathered pace. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $105,750, registering an increase of 1.51%. Bullish sentiment persisted on Tuesday as BTC set a new all-time high, rising to $108,268 before declining and setting at $106,144. However, BTC declined during the current session, with the price down almost 2% at $104,246. Despite the decline during the current session, analysts are confident BTC will surpass $110,000 before the end of the year. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) dropped considerably after briefly crossing $4,000 at the beginning of the week as it failed to consolidate above it yet again allowing sellers to drive the price lower. ETH has been bullish since the US elections but registered a substantial drop at the beginning of last week, falling over 7% to a low of $3,536 before settling at $3,715. The price continued to drop on Tuesday, falling 2.30% to $3,630. However, ETH brushed aside the growing bearish sentiment on Wednesday, registering an increase of 5.62% and settling at $3,834. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rallied to an intraday high of $3,988. It lost momentum at this level and dropped to settle at $3,882, ultimately registering an increase of 1.26%. ETH went above $3,900 on Friday after rising 0.63% and settling at $3,907. Source: TradingView Despite registering considerable gains since Wednesday, ETH fell back on Saturday, dropping almost 1% to go below $3,900 and settle at $3,869. However, buyers returned to the market on Sunday as ETH rose 2.25% and settled at $3,956. The current week began with ETH experiencing significant volatility as buyers and sellers attempted to establish control. As a result, ETH fell to an intraday low of $3,882 and rose to an intraday high of $4,106 before settling at $3,985. ETH fell into the red on Tuesday as sellers returned to the market, dropping by 2.34% and settling at $3,982. The current session sees ETH continue to decline, with the price down just over 1% and trading around $3,850. If sellers can drive ETH below the 20-day SMA, it could drop to $3,500 before recovering. On the other hand, buyers will attempt to regain control and reclaim $4,000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continues to trade in a downward trajectory, with sellers having driven it below the 50-day SMA. SOL suffered a substantial drop at the beginning of the previous week as sellers decisively took control and lowered the price by 8.55% to $216. Sellers attempted to drive SOL below $200 on Tuesday as it fell to an intraday low of $203, briefly slipping below the 20-day SMA. However, it recovered partially to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $213, ultimately registering a drop of 1.47%. Despite the selling pressure, SOL recovered on Wednesday, rising over 6% and settling at $227. Buyers attempted to push SOL above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $234. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level and SOL dropped to $227, registering a marginal decline. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment persisted on Friday as SOL dropped almost 1% and settled at $224, and intensified on Saturday as the price fell to a low of $215 before settling at $219. SOL recovered on Sunday, registering an increase of almost 2%, but fell on Monday, dropping 3.55% to go below the 50-day SMA and settle at $216. Tuesday saw volatility return as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $211 and reached an intraday high of $228. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand and SOL settled at $223 after an increase of 3.23%. However, the current session sees SOL back in the red, with the price down almost 3% and trading at $216. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to recover after slipping below the 20-day SMA and has slipped below key support levels during the current session. DOGE experienced a significant drop on Monday as it fell over 11% to go below the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.414. Sellers continued to dominate on Tuesday as DOGE dropped almost 5% to $0.394. DOGE recovered on Wednesday, rising over 5% and settling at $0.414. However, despite the substantial increase, DOGE could not move past the 20-day SMA. As a result, it fell back on Thursday, dropping just over 2% and settling at $0.406. DOGE registered a marginal recovery on Friday, rising 0.89% and settling at $0.409. Source: TradingView With the 20-day SMA acting as a dynamic resistance level, DOGE fell back in the red on Saturday, dropping just over 3% and settling at $0.397. It recovered on Sunday to register an increase of 2.19% and end the weekend positively. However, bearish sentiment returned on Monday as DOGE failed to go above the 20-day SMA, allowing sellers to take control. As a result, DOGE dropped just over 1% and settled at $0.401. Sellers retained control on Tuesday, driving DOGE below $0.40 to $0.393. The current session sees DOGE down almost 3% and trading around $0.383. Uniswap (UNI) Price Analysis Uniswap (UNI)’s bull run came to an abrupt halt last Sunday after peaking at an intraday high of $19.47. UNI failed to stay at this level and plummeted on Monday, dropping almost 14% to $16.05. Sellers retained control on Tuesday a UNI dropped to an intraday low of $14.05 before recovering to settle at $15.24, ultimately registering a drop of just over 5%.

37801945,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26660,1734531924,"Sonic Labs Launches the Sonic Mainnet: EVM-Compatible, Verifiable 10,000 TPS, and Sub-Second Finality","George Town, Cayman Islands, December 13th, 2024, Chainwire Sonic Labs today announced the launch of the Sonic mainnet, an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain platform that offers developers attractive incentives and powerful infrastructure. With 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), sub-second finality, and a native, decentralized gateway to Ethereum, Sonic empowers developers to build the next generation of applications on unparalleled infrastructure and liquidity. Developed by the same team behind Fantom, Sonic and its S token deliver a significant leap forward from both Fantom and FTM. Through a one-to-one upgrade process from FTM to S, existing FTM holders can seamlessly start using Sonic. Sonic leverages proven expertise to establish itself as a DeFi hub by revolutionizing developer incentives while providing users with smooth user experiences and access to vast amounts of liquidity. Fee Monetization: Developers Come First Fee Monetization (FeeM) on Sonic rewards developers with up to 90% of the network fees generated by their applications, adopting the Web2 ad-revenue strategies popularized by platforms like YouTube. While many blockchains offer limited developer incentives and primarily focus on value extraction, Sonic addresses this issue effectively through its FeeM model. “Recently, we’ve seen many new chains launch, especially centralized layer 2s where the founders pocket all network fees. This excludes developers from the equation, forcing them to impose extra fees on users to earn revenue. FeeM addresses this by coding developer rewards directly into the chain, ensuring that network fees are shared with developers from the start.”— Sam Harcourt, Business Development Lead, Sonic Labs Developers on the Sonic chain receive a share of network fees generated by the traffic and engagement their applications attract, offering a built-in mechanism for ongoing revenue. Fantom to Sonic: Upgrading FTM to S Fantom and its FTM token are officially transitioning to Sonic and the S token. Sonic Labs is facilitating the transition by offering a dedicated upgrade portal on MySonic that allows FTM holders to seamlessly upgrade their FTM to S on a one-to-one basis. “We are proud to launch the new Sonic chain as the next evolution of Fantom, building on its impressive track record of nearly 100% uptime since 2019. Sonic is a revolutionary platform that prioritizes developers, empowering them to create applications with seamless user experiences while earning a share of network fees.”— Michael Kong, CEO, Sonic Labs During the initial 90 days after Sonic’s mainnet launch, holders can freely swap between FTM and S using the upgrade portal. After this period, holders will only be able to upgrade from FTM to S. Sonic Gateway: Secure, Decentralized Interoperability With the rise of cross-chain activity, secure and trustless bridges are more crucial than ever. Traditional layer-1 and layer-2 bridging solutions often rely on centralized systems, risking billions in potential losses . The Sonic Gateway addresses these challenges as a decentralized and trustless bridge between Ethereum and Sonic, offering: Security: A fail-safe ensures user funds can be recovered on Ethereum if the Gateway is down for 14 days, guaranteeing asset protection. Speed: Asset transfers are batched efficiently (every 10 minutes from Ethereum to Sonic and hourly in reverse). The Fast Lane feature lets users pay a small fee to bridge instantly. Decentralization: Operated by Sonic’s validators on both chains, the Gateway is as decentralized as Sonic itself, preventing centralized manipulation. “To empower users with effective and trustless control of their assets, we developed the Sonic Gateway, which provides liquidity from other platforms. Powered by our own validators and secured by a fail-safe, the Gateway lets users and apps safely leverage the benefits and incentives of bringing new liquidity to Sonic.” — Bernhard Scholz, Chief Research Officer, Sonic Labs Sonic Labs will expand the Gateway beyond Ethereum in the future, enabling direct, decentralized access to multiple blockchains’ native assets. Sonic Airdrop: Distributing the S Token To encourage network growth, Sonic Labs is distributing 190.5 million S tokens through an airdrop program focusing on both users and developers. The program includes two incentive structures : Sonic Points : Rewards end-users for early adoption, asset holding, and overall engagement. Sonic Gems : Rewards developers for creating applications that drive user activity and innovation. Developers can convert Gems to S and share the tokens with their users to incentivize continuous usage. About Sonic Sonic is an EVM layer-1 platform that offers developers attractive incentives and powerful infrastructure. The chain provides over 10,000 TPS, sub-second confirmation times, and a secure gateway to Ethereum for enhanced liquidity and asset security.

With 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), sub-second finality, and a native, decentralized gateway to Ethereum, Sonic empowers developers to build the next generation of applications on unparalleled infrastructure and liquidity. Developed by the same team behind Fantom, Sonic and its S token deliver a significant leap forward from both Fantom and FTM. Through a one-to-one upgrade process from FTM to S, existing FTM holders can seamlessly start using Sonic. Sonic leverages proven expertise to establish itself as a DeFi hub by revolutionizing developer incentives while providing users with smooth user experiences and access to vast amounts of liquidity. Fee Monetization: Developers Come First Fee Monetization (FeeM) on Sonic rewards developers with up to 90% of the network fees generated by their applications, adopting the Web2 ad-revenue strategies popularized by platforms like YouTube. While many blockchains offer limited developer incentives and primarily focus on value extraction, Sonic addresses this issue effectively through its FeeM model. “Recently, we’ve seen many new chains launch, especially centralized layer 2s where the founders pocket all network fees. This excludes developers from the equation, forcing them to impose extra fees on users to earn revenue. FeeM addresses this by coding developer rewards directly into the chain, ensuring that network fees are shared with developers from the start.”— Sam Harcourt, Business Development Lead, Sonic Labs Developers on the Sonic chain receive a share of network fees generated by the traffic and engagement their applications attract, offering a built-in mechanism for ongoing revenue. Fantom to Sonic: Upgrading FTM to S Fantom and its FTM token are officially transitioning to Sonic and the S token. Sonic Labs is facilitating the transition by offering a dedicated upgrade portal on MySonic that allows FTM holders to seamlessly upgrade their FTM to S on a one-to-one basis. “We are proud to launch the new Sonic chain as the next evolution of Fantom, building on its impressive track record of nearly 100% uptime since 2019. Sonic is a revolutionary platform that prioritizes developers, empowering them to create applications with seamless user experiences while earning a share of network fees.”— Michael Kong, CEO, Sonic Labs During the initial 90 days after Sonic’s mainnet launch, holders can freely swap between FTM and S using the upgrade portal. After this period, holders will only be able to upgrade from FTM to S. Sonic Gateway: Secure, Decentralized Interoperability With the rise of cross-chain activity, secure and trustless bridges are more crucial than ever. Traditional layer-1 and layer-2 bridging solutions often rely on centralized systems, risking billions in potential losses . The Sonic Gateway addresses these challenges as a decentralized and trustless bridge between Ethereum and Sonic, offering: Security: A fail-safe ensures user funds can be recovered on Ethereum if the Gateway is down for 14 days, guaranteeing asset protection. Speed: Asset transfers are batched efficiently (every 10 minutes from Ethereum to Sonic and hourly in reverse). The Fast Lane feature lets users pay a small fee to bridge instantly. Decentralization: Operated by Sonic’s validators on both chains, the Gateway is as decentralized as Sonic itself, preventing centralized manipulation. “To empower users with effective and trustless control of their assets, we developed the Sonic Gateway, which provides liquidity from other platforms. Powered by our own validators and secured by a fail-safe, the Gateway lets users and apps safely leverage the benefits and incentives of bringing new liquidity to Sonic.” — Bernhard Scholz, Chief Research Officer, Sonic Labs Sonic Labs will expand the Gateway beyond Ethereum in the future, enabling direct, decentralized access to multiple blockchains’ native assets. Sonic Airdrop: Distributing the S Token To encourage network growth, Sonic Labs is distributing 190.5 million S tokens through an airdrop program focusing on both users and developers. The program includes two incentive structures : Sonic Points : Rewards end-users for early adoption, asset holding, and overall engagement. Sonic Gems : Rewards developers for creating applications that drive user activity and innovation.

37802321,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320744,1734531767,Every Sixth German Would Like to Work in the Metaverse – Bitkom Survey,"While the metaverse remains a niche concept for many, a growing number of Germans are open to embracing this virtual world for education, socializing, and even for work. A recent survey of 1,149 German residents aged 16 and over, conducted by Germany’s digital association Bitkom, shows that the metaverse is gaining traction in Germany , with a majority of Germans (54%) now familiar with the concept. A year ago, only 41% of respondents were familiar with the metaverse. Currently, roughly one in every seven (13 %) respondents claims to fully understand this concept. Another 20 % have at least a rough idea of what the metaverse is, while 21 % are aware of it but cannot precisely explain it. Erstmals kennt eine Mehrheit (54%) das #Metaverse . Aber nur 13% können genau #erklären , was es ist. 15% würden dort #arbeiten , 24% #Freunde treffen. Gleichzeitig gibt’s #Skepsis : 63% befürchten, dass eine #Parallelwelt entstehen könnte. https://t.co/I4LfZ7jCmU — Bitkom (@Bitkom) December 17, 2024 Metaverse for Work and Play The survey also found that almost every sixth respondent (15%) would like to work in the metaverse . Attending meetings, collaborating on projects, and even training for new skills all within a shared virtual environment – this new virtual world of work is becoming more appealing to a segment of the German population. Many respondents are also open to using the metaverse for a variety of personal activities. For example, a quarter (24%) would like to meet friends in the metaverse. Nearly one in five is interested in attending virtual schools or universities (18%) and shopping in the digital realm (17%). 12% of respondents believe that attending concerts with friends will eventually move to virtual venues. Furthermore, 10% of respondents can even imagine spending a significant portion of their lives in the metaverse, while roughly one-fifth (21 %) would be willing to purchase special glasses for metaverse use. Skepticism Surrounds the Metaverse However, the survey also revealed a degree of skepticism surrounding the metaverse. Two-thirds (66%) of German respondents expressed concerns about the difficulty of verifying identities within virtual environments, and 63% feared the emergence of a virtual parallel world that could isolate individuals from real-life interactions. These concerns highlight the importance of addressing issues related to security, privacy, and responsible use as the metaverse continues to evolve . Metaverse: A Growing Force in the German Economy The metaverse is also becoming relevant to the German economy, as a Bitkom survey published in August revealed that a third of the 605 German companies surveyed consider the metaverse to be a critical technology for their future. While only a few companies have explored the metaverse, this number has more than doubled in the past two years, from 6% to 13%. A promising 22% of surveyed companies expect to invest in the metaverse after 2025. However, a lack of practical applications, technological immaturity, regulatory uncertainties, and a shortage of skilled talent are still major obstacles to overcome. Global Investment in the Industrial Metaverse Soars On a global level, an October survey of 907 companies in seven countries – Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, the UK and the US – demonstrates that investment in the industrial metaverse has increased significantly through 2024, with 62% of global companies increasing their spending on the technology. Metaverse spending comparison by company size (2023 vs. 2024). Source: Industrial Metaverse Research Study The study, conducted by S&P Global Market Intelligence 451 Research and Siemens, the German industrial automation and software company, also shows that 81% of companies are either implementing, testing or planning to implement industrial metaverse technologies. Nearly two-thirds of these companies are employing or testing solutions to enhance product development, operations, workforce management, and supply chain management. The remaining companies are making strategic investments in technologies like digital twins, industrial artificial intelligence (AI) or the Internet of Things (IoT) and planning to implement them in specific industrial metaverse solutions within the next three years.

To read full editions, subscribe . ICYMI: Crypto custodian BiT Global took action against Coinbase last week for delisting wBTC. Coinbase first announced its decision to delist wBTC back in late November, just a few months after it launched cbBTC, its own wrapped bitcoin. We regret and are surprised by Coinbase’s decision to delist WBTC. As the core team behind Wrapped BTC, we have always been committed to providing the community with the most compliant, transparent, and decentralized BTC tokenization product. Over the years, WBTC has established… — WBTC (@WrappedBTC) November 19, 2024 Growing up with a parent who was a lawyer, I was always told there are three sides to every story: Each party’s own side and then the truth. Last night, Coinbase responded to BiT Global’s suit, and both parties have made some, well, interesting arguments. We've filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We lay out why this lawsuit lacks any semblance of merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied. You can read it all for… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 17, 2024 Coinbase’s filing centers around Justin Sun, who’s been linked to wBTC since August. Basically, the firm said that wBTC failed its listing standards because of the “unacceptable risk” Sun poses due to his “material involve[ment].” “Consistent with that process, Coinbase conducted careful diligence, including asking BiT questions about who ultimately owned and controlled BiT. BiT refused to answer, presumably to conceal Mr. Sun’s role, much as it has done here. At the conclusion of its diligence, Coinbase concluded that Mr. Sun’s affiliation with—and potential control over—wBTC presented an unacceptable risk to its customers and the integrity of its exchange,” it said in its filing Tuesday. BiT, on the other hand, argued that Coinbase had ulterior motives to delist wBTC, which is to throw around its weight as one of the top exchanges — forcing users to only have access to its own wrapped bitcoin offering, rather than enabling a choice between the two. Coinbase’s decision to delist WBTC, without any concrete reason beyond a vague “recent review” goes against everything the DeFi and crypto industry stand for. It’s clear that Coinbase’s decision is an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, pushing forward their own wrapped… — BiT Global (@BiTGlobalTrust) November 20, 2024 “Having achieved the network effects that were its goal, it has now embarked on an effort to use that power to replace cryptocurrencies created by others with its own knock-off versions—with Coinbase taking short term-losses to keep profits for itself longterm as its knock-off gains market share. And wBTC is Coinbase’s first target,” BiT argued last week. BiT claims that this is “a tale as old as Silicon Valley,” and mentions that Google, Microsoft and Facebook have all tried to take out the competition. “A centralized platform gains more and more users from a first mover advantage. It creates a moat for itself using network effects which lock those users into its platform. And then it starts changing the rules that got it there. After the bait-and-switch, smaller entrepreneurs find themselves the victims of a corporate goliath that sees their innovations merely as a resource to be grabbed by any means possible and absorbed into itself,” it said. Coinbase, however, argued that the exchange makes up for a “de minimis (less than 1%) portion” of wBTC traded. Per Coinbase, there’s not enough evidence to justify a court executing a temporary restraining order to force the exchange to keep hosting wBTC. A hearing in California is set for later today, so we’ll soon see how both arguments play out. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

37801942,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629672,1734531587,"Arthur Hayes warns of potential crypto dip ahead, tied to Donald Trump","As the crypto market continues its rally, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has made an intriguing prediction. Arthur asserts that Trump’s return to office could potentially trigger a decline just as his previous actions spurred a rise in the crypto market. Arthur Hayes said, “The market will instantly wake up to the reality that Trump has at best one year to enact any policy changes on or around January 20th.” He added, “This realization will lead to a vicious sell-off in crypto and other Trump 2.0 equity trades.” Trump has one year to act because most US elected legislators start campaigning at the end of 2025 for the November 2026 mid-term US elections. Some of y'all don't believe Trump is about to trash the $ and print money. $BTC disagrees. Here is #Bitcoin leading vs. my new money supply indicator US Bank Credit. The market is speaking, listen up. More explanation in my essay ""Black or White"" that drops tom. pic.twitter.com/wsSVUK0RH2 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 10, 2024 Trump’s victory has heightened expectations for a significant shift in crypto legislation. This is because the former president promised to do “something great with crypto,” including establishing a national strategic reserve of Bitcoin. However, Arthur Hayes provides reasons why Trump’s pledges may not be realistic. Limited time for Trump to focus on an AOB-like crypto According to the Maelstrom CIO, Trump has one year to show progress on some of his goals to help Republicans keep the House and Senate. Arthur stated that the majority of elected legislators, including the entire House of Representatives, commence their campaigning for the midterm elections in November 2026 at the end of 2025. Therefore, he granted Trump one year to implement policy changes. Hayes stated, “Fixing the underlying domestic and international issues that negatively affect them would take even the most astute and powerful politicians over a decade, not just one year.” The crypto industry is not one of Trump’s most important objectives once he enters office. Arthur Hayes doubts Bitcoin’s strategic reserve possibility Hayes shared his thoughts that politicians would rather spend newly created dollars on goodies for the population to ensure their victory in the next soon-to-be-held election than on Bitcoin. He explained that the US keeps more gold than any other country. This shows that the US is financially stronger than all other countries, both online and offline. Therefore, if the US government devalues gold to make more dollars and then buys Bitcoin with some of those dollars, the value of Bitcoin will go up. He also stated, “The easy button is always the first thing politicians do. If the price of gold goes up to $20,000 an ounce, how does that affect the prices of Bitcoin and other crypto?” He concluded, “I still don’t believe the BSR will happen.” However, Arthur Hayes claimed that although he doesn’t think the US government will buy Bitcoin, his opinion remains that the price will still go up. He explained that, in the end, a drop in the value of gold provides dollars that need to be spent on real goods and services and financial assets. Source: Crypto Trader Digest He further explained that Bitcoin is limited in quantity and fewer coins are being used. Therefore, the price of Bitcoin will rise faster than the rate at which the global supply of dollars grows. Lastly, Hayes predicted that the value of the dollar would go down in the first half of 2025. How bad could it get – The crypto market lately Bitcoin rose over 50% since Trump’s win, bringing its price from around $68,000 to a record-high of $108,135. However, Arthur Hayes’s prediction of a crypto market collapse further lowered sentiments, resulting in a nearly 3% decline in the global crypto market cap to $3.64 trillion today. Today, Bitcoin’s price experienced a 2.5% decline to $104,140, following its recent ascent to its all-time high of $108,268.45 within the past 24 hours. Also, the recent Ethereum price surge has experienced a 3.4% drop, settling at $3,878, just a day after it briefly surpassed the $4K threshold. Cardano experienced a 4% pullback, and XRP saw a 1% decline. In addition, Dogecoin experienced a decline of nearly 4%, settling at $0.3845. Shiba Inu experienced a decline of approximately 5%, while Pepe coin saw a more significant retreat of over 7% in the past 24 hours. Arthur has additionally shown Trump’s hand in how nations are shaping their economies to fold into what could make POTUS happy. Arthur Hayes adds, “Even before Trump reascends the throne, countries are acting in ways I predicted, further enhancing my confidence about how money will be printed and the methods by which financial repression shall be enacted.” Xi Jinping, China, and crypto It would be foolish to ignore the economic power that comes with China. China’s economy and the policies it adopts have set a stage for the global economy to work under. During “sleepy Joe’s and Bidenomics” tenure, China, under the emblem of BRICS, has grown to a stature that should worry America. However, Arthur Hayes believes that Xi Jinping has two big problems that he needs to solve. President Xi needs to generate jobs for the over 20% of educated youth who are unemployed and stop property prices from declining. Then again, Trump is coming in with tariffs. What are the weapons at Xi’s disposal? According to Hayes, “China must engage in QE and, by extension, allow the yuan to float freely.” He adds “For those of you who are puzzled as to why the yuan must weaken because of QE, remember that QE expands the supply of yuan. If the yuan supply grows faster than another fiat currency, then mathematically, it weakens compared to that currency.” The question that crypto investors should be pondering is how wealthy Chinese investors will react to the signals that the PBOC will crank up the growth in the supply of yuan. Arthur ponders: Will capital flight through various legal channels in Macao (casinos) and Hong Kong (HK registered companies with Chinese owners) be allowed to operate normally, or will Xi shut them down to sequester capital onshore? Arthur Hayes According to Arthur Hayes, “For crypto, at least in the short term, Chinese capital will flow out through Hong Kong into dollars and purchase Bitcoin and other shitcoins. In the medium term, once Xi reciprocates and bans Chinese capital from escaping through the liquid and obvious channels, the question is whether Hong Kong crypto ETFs will be allowed to accept southbound capital flows from Mainland Chinese investors.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/arthur-hayes-warns-crypto-dip-donald-trump/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37801942.jpeg

Specifically, large holders with addresses containing 100 million to 1 billion XRP acquired 30 million tokens in a 24-hour window, according to on-chain data shared by prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez on December 17.

On December 16, Martinez also pointed out that the holders acquired 830 million XRP within 24 hours. XRP whale transaction chart. Source: Santiment/Ali_charts The buying spree coincides with the recent XRP price growth, and such accumulation has historically preceded substantial rallies. XRP’s potential bull case Meanwhile, Martinez had earlier highlighted the possibility of continuation in XRP’s price appreciation. He noted that once XRP breaks the $2.60 resistance, it could ‘head toward $4.’ This follows his December 12 analysis, in which he identified a bull flag pattern on the four-hour chart. A bull flag is a continuation pattern marked by a sharp rally followed by consolidation within a downward-sloping channel. To this end, if the pattern is realized, XRP could hit a long-term target of $4. A similar bullish outlook was observed by a cryptocurrency analyst with the pseudonym Dark Defender in an X post on December 18. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Dark Defender The analyst stated that XRP has broken out on the daily chart, signaling bullish momentum after rebounding from the $2.72 level. This move follows the completion of an A-B-C corrective wave, a reversal pattern indicating the end of a downtrend, and the start of a new upward move. Additionally, the breakout from a descending triangle—a bullish continuation pattern—confirms XRP’s strength, with previous resistance now acting as support. The expert projected that a potential retest of $2.42 may occur, as breakouts often revisit former resistance to establish a stronger base before continuing higher. The Fibonacci extension at 161.8% projects a near-term target of $3.43. Fibonacci levels are used to identify potential price targets in trending markets, and clearing this level could open the path toward $5.85, the next significant extension. Besides the technical indicators , XRP is backed by additional fundamentals, such as Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin rollout . In this case, RLUSD transactions burn small amounts of XRP, linking the two assets, a move likely to drive further growth. XRP price analysis XRP was trading at $2.54 by press time, having plunged by over 4% in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, the asset remains in the green, up almost 7%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Although XRP is exhibiting bearish sentiments in the short term, the overall market outlook remains bullish , supported by the current technical setup. At the current valuation, the Ripple-affiliated asset is trading above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $1.39 and the 200-day SMA of $0.75, signaling strong upward momentum both in the short and long term. On the flip side, investors need to be wary of a possible price correction or consolidation for the short term, considering the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 68, approaching overbought territory.

Shytoshi Kusama Reveals TREAT Powerful Use Case,"The Shiba Inu ecosystem continues to evolve beyond its origins as a meme coin, venturing into cutting-edge technology and practical applications in various sectors. In a tweet that led to significant discussions within the Shiba Inu community, Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead developer behind Shiba Inu, responded to The Shib, a Shiba Inu-focused information platform, shedding light on the expanding use cases for TREAT and its role in the ecosystem. The conversation began when The Shib highlighted Shytoshi’s announcement of TREAT’s application in powering fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) as part of a longevity research partnership with Ogai, a project focusing on technology advancements and human health. The platform posed a thought-provoking question: “Is $SHIB evolving beyond its meme coin roots?” In his reply , Shytoshi Kusama not only affirmed the relevance of TREAT in FHE but also hinted at its broader potential. He stated: “Of course it is! And $OGAI using FHE is just ONE use case of FHE. But $TREAT actually has many more uses outside just FHE, and we have many more pieces of tech too. Shall we discuss this?” Of course it is! And $OGAI using FHE is just ONE use case of FHE. But $TREAT actually has many more uses outside just FHE and we have many more pieces of tech too. Shall we discuss this? #36chambers $Treat #SHIBARMY #ENDGAME https://t.co/mVcRqs6ff5 — Shytoshi Kusama (@ShytoshiKusama) December 17, 2024 This response showcases Shiba Inu’s intention to integrate deeper into technological innovations, expanding its ecosystem beyond its initial identity as a cryptocurrency inspired by memes. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Its Implications FHE is a cryptographic breakthrough that enables computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first, preserving data privacy throughout the process. Shytoshi’s revelation that TREAT is involved in this domain demonstrates Shiba Inu’s commitment to addressing real-world problems with blockchain-based solutions. The integration of FHE within longevity research could have profound implications for secure data sharing in sensitive fields such as medical research, healthcare, and beyond. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Engagement and Vision The Shiba Inu community quickly rallied around Shytoshi’s statement, with one X user, Catzen, proposing a novel application of FHE in the healthcare sector. Catzen suggested that FHE-powered decentralized systems could revolutionize patient care by securing sensitive medical records while eliminating the barriers of centralized, profit-driven healthcare systems. This vision includes allowing individuals to control and potentially monetize their health data in collaboration with medical research, fitness tracking, and other industries. This idea aligns closely with Shiba Inu’s broader mission of decentralization and empowerment, reinforcing the narrative that SHIB and its associated tokens like TREAT are evolving to meet pressing societal needs. Expanding Beyond a Meme Coin The recent discussion marks another milestone in Shiba Inu’s journey to establish itself as a robust technological ecosystem. With initiatives such as Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain, and now partnerships exploring FHE and longevity research, Shiba Inu is steadily redefining its identity. The inclusion of TREAT as a versatile utility token further demonstrates the team’s strategic planning for an interconnected and impactful ecosystem.

At this point, the analyst stated that he sold some altcoins and instead invested in altcoins that he thought offered better investment opportunities. Deutscher, who listed the altcoins he would sell and replace in a recent video, said that he first added ONDO to the list of altcoins he would sell due to concerns that Ondo's upcoming token unlock could create price pressure. Stating that apart from ONDO, he will also sell off popular Layer-2 projects such as Polygon (MATIC), the analyst stated that instead of these altcoins, he will turn to more innovative and high-yield potential projects such as Chintai (CHEX) and Mode. Apart from these, Deutscher stated that Ethereum (ETH), which did not perform as expected in 2024, will perform well in the long term and stated that he converted his Solana (SOL)s into ETH. Expressing that his interest in artificial intelligence (AI) projects continues, the analyst stated that he added FET to his sales list because it did not meet his expectations and instead turned to new AI projects such as Virtuals Protocol. Finally, in the DePIN sector, he stated that he added RENDER to his sales list and focused on projects such as PinLink and AIOZ instead. *This is not investment advice.

Mainly because being the very first altcoin still in action, LTC failed to follow Bitcoin’s legacy. As a result, the token failed even to regain a 3-digit figure after the fallout in 2021. As a result, the token remains more than 70% away from its highs, which are restricted below $500 at around $412.96. Now that the LTC price has gained back, it’s lost attention. With over 200% rise in the daily trading volume in the past couple of days, the question arises whether it will gain the pivotal resistance above $125 in 2024? The spot ETFs have changed the entire market dynamics of the cryptos for which ETFs have already been launched. Hence, whenever a new crypto is added to the list, the market participants become more optimistic about the future prospects of the token. Recently, the market analysts and veterans believe the year 2025 could be the year of ETFs and LTC ETFs may be launched much before the others. Hence, the traders can expect monster moves incoming for the LTC price rally, which may even rise more than double of the current ATH. The daily chart shows a sudden spike in the LTC price that elevated the levels by over 100%. It was when the BTC price was struggling to achieve the $100K milestone. Despite the pullback, the price managed to revamp a strong rise to reclaim the resistance at $120 but the extended bearish pressure is preventing it from doing so. However, the current consolidation is expected to prevail for some more time, wherein the token may also drop below the ascending support but it could be treated as a good entry as the token remains bullish from the broder perspective. The MACD does not give confirmation of either a rop or rise in the selling pressure, due to which the token may remain uncertain for a while. On the other hand, the Bollinger bands are contracting, suggesting a drop in the volatility. This may suggest a breakout could be imminent with a greater intensity, while the direction could be depending on the volume induced. Considering the current market dynamics, the Litecoin (LTC) price has gained huge attention, which may offer a strong boost to it’s volatility favouring the bulls. Eventually, the price is believed to maintain a healthy upswing and is likely to close the yearly trade around $150.",POSITIVE,BTC | LTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/litecoin-regains-the-momentum-can-ltc-price-trigger-a-40-rise-ahead-of-the-yearly-close/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37801229,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375150,1734530727,The Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Run Could End Sooner Than You Think: Analyst,"TL;DR Bitcoin (BTC) surpassed $108,000 on December 17, with predictions of a possible $220,000 peak by March 2025. Bitfinex analysts foresee the bull run lasting until late 2025, with the price potentially hitting $339,000. Just a Few More Months? 2024 (so far) has been more than successful for Bitcoin (BTC), whose price has exploded by approximately 150%. Although BTC was going relatively strong at the start of the year, the actual resurgence seems to have started shortly after Donald Trump (who presented himself as the right choice for pro-crypto voters) won the presidential elections in America. Before the voting on November 5, BTC was trading at around $67,000, while approximately a month later, it surpassed the $100,000 psychological level. Earlier this week, the asset hit a new all-time high of over $108,000. In the past several hours, it experienced a correction and is now trading at around $104,600 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko Numerous analysts suggest there is much more room for growth, while others believe the bull run will not last long . The X user Ali Martinez , for instance, predicted that BTC could climb to as high as $220,000 in March next year, which could mark the end of the bull market. He based the forecast on the asset’s historical performance in 2017 and 2020. Martinez also assumed that the ride to the aforementioned peak might be a bumpy one: “If Bitcoin behaves like in 2017 and 2020, then there will be a brief correction after reaching $110,000, a steep correction after hitting $125,000, a big correction at $150,000, and the end of the bull market at $220,000.” Still Away From the Euphoria Zone? Contrary to the aforementioned prediction , analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex think the asset has not yet reached “euphoric peaks.” According to them, the crypto market might be in the middle of the bull run, with its cycle top expected in the second half of 2025. The analysts envisioned a BTC price rally to as high as $339,000, fueled partially by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The financial products “have emerged as a dominant force” and hold over 1.13 BTC. “While volatility is expected in Q1 2025, the broader trend points to further price appreciation, supported by ETFs, institutional adoption, and Bitcoin’s increasing prominence as a global asset. Investors should, however, remain vigilant for signs of overbought conditions as Bitcoin approaches its cycle top,” the research reads.

Chainlink ( LINK ) token fell to $27, marking a 13% decline from its highest level this year and bringing its market cap to over $17 billion. The retreat mirrored losses seen across other popular cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $105,000 from its weekly high of $108,000. Similarly, Ethereum, Ripple, and Solana were down by over 3%. Still, one whale continued to accumulate LINK tokens, betting on a potential recovery. According to LookOnChain, the whale withdrew 65,000 LINK tokens worth $1.8 million on December 18. This followed a trend that began four days earlier, bringing the whale’s total accumulation to over $17.3 million. The whale withdrew another 65,000 $LINK ($1.81M) from #Binance 40 minutes ago. In the past 4 days, this whale has withdrawn a total of 594,998 $LINK ($17.31M) from #Binance . https://t.co/09rrsXqyml pic.twitter.com/H4N9LkW8z9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 18, 2024 The accumulation came shortly after Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial acquired LINK tokens worth over $2 million. The upcoming Decentralized Finance platform has selected Chainlink as its oracle provider. Chainlink is widely regarded as one of the most fundamentally sound projects in the blockchain industry. Its oracle solutions are utilized by major DeFi players like AAVE, Spark, and Compound. The total value secured by Chainlink has grown to over $41 billion , surpassing competitors such as Chronicle, Pyth, and Edge. The number of Chainlink holders has also continued rising. According to data from IntoTheBlock , there are now over 688,000 addresses with LINK balances, exceeding the 30-day average of 686,000. This increase indicates sustained demand for the token. Chainlink Addresses | Source: IntoTheBlock Chainlink is also expected to benefit from its partnership with Swift Network and other large platforms leveraging its technology for tokenization. Furthermore, there are discussions about the potential approval of a Chainlink ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Chainlink price analysis LINK price chart | Source: crypto.news The 4-hour chart shows that LINK’s price peaked at $30.95, forming a small triple-top chart pattern—a bearish signal. It has since declined and dropped below the pattern’s neckline at $27.58. Currently, Chainlink is hovering slightly above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $26. It has also fallen below the middle line of the Andrew’s Pitchfork tool and the 50-period moving average. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising ahead of the Federal Reserve decision .

In Virginia, a man was convicted of funding ISIS with cryptocurrency, and in Nigeria, authorities dismantled a crypto romance scam ring linked to Chinese organized crime groups. Meanwhile, the U.S. and UAE imposed sanctions on people and entities tied to North Korea's crypto laundering network. Ledger Users Warned About Sophisticated Phishing Scam Phishing scammers are targeting Ledger users by impersonating the crypto hardware wallet provider's support emails in an attempt to steal users' wallet keys. Fraudulent emails claim that Ledger experienced a ”recent data breach” and instruct recipients to verify their private seed phrases to ”safeguard” their assets. According to a Dec. 17 report from BleepingComputer and screenshots that were shared on X, the emails seem to come from Ledger’s official support address but are actually sent through an email marketing platform. These emails direct users to a Ledger-branded website that looks very authentic and prompts visitors to ”verify your Ledger.” Once on the site, a popup asks users to enter their seed phrases. These phrases are a critical combination of words that grants full control over a wallet. Having these phrases allows scammers to drain funds. Ledger responded to concerned users on X, and clarified that the company will never request a 24-word recovery phrase via email, direct message, or phone call, and warning users to treat such requests as scams . It is still unclear if any Ledger users have fallen victim to this specific phishing attack. (Source: BleepingComputer ) This incident happened after a Dec. 13 report of a Ledger user who lost $2.5 million in Bitcoin and non-fungible tokens. Although the user claimed to have never shared their seed phrase online, Ledger and other blockchain security firms suggest that the loss resulted from a phishing scam dating back to February of 2022, but the funds were only recently stolen. Ledger faced other security challenges as well over the years, including a December 2023 breach of its connector library codebase. This is a tool that facilitates user access to decentralized finance applications. This compromise allowed an attacker to steal $484,000 from victims. Security experts warn that phishing scams are likely to rise during the holiday season as online transactions increase. Meta also warned users of scam campaigns targeting holiday shoppers, including fake gift promotions, fraudulent decoration sales, and counterfeit retail coupons. Phishing losses in the crypto space did, however, fall by 53% month-on-month in November. Virginia Man Convicted of Funding ISIS with Crypto Crypto crimes do not stop with phishing attacks. Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa, a 35-year-old resident of Springfield, Virginia, was convicted by a federal jury for making crypto donations to the terrorist organization ISIS. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed that Chhipa sent $185,000 worth of cryptocurrency to ISIS members in Syria between October of 2019 and October of 2022. Evidence presented in court showed that these funds were used to support ISIS in various ways, including financing the escape of female ISIS members from prison camps and aiding ISIS fighters. Chhipa raised funds through a combination of social media campaigns, electronic bank transfers, and in-person cash collections. The collected funds were then converted into crypto and sent to Turkey, from where they were smuggled into Syria to reach ISIS members. A British-born ISIS member residing in Syria was identified as Chhipa's primary co-conspirator, and helped him with raising funds for prison escapes and terrorist attacks. Chhipa was convicted on five counts, including conspiracy to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and four counts of providing or attempting to provide material support to such an organization. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 100 years if sentenced consecutively on all counts, although federal sentences are often less than the maximum penalties. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2025. Massive Crypto Scam Ring Busted in Nigeria Nigeria’s anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), arrested 792 people during a raid on a building in Lagos on Dec. 10. The building was believed to be a hub for a massive crypto romance scam operation. Among the suspects were 148 Chinese and 40 Filipino nationals, along with Nigerian accomplices. The EFCC spokesperson stated that the Nigerians were recruited by foreign leaders of the operation to lure victims online through phishing schemes. People from the United States, Canada, Mexico, and various European countries were their primary targets. Once trust was established, the foreign operators took over to defraud the victims. The operation involved seducing victims over social media or offering fake crypto investment opportunities, coercing them to transfer funds in a scam known as pig butchering. Ken Gamble, co-founder of cybercrime investigative firm IFW Global, shared that Chinese organized crime groups are increasingly expanding into regions with weaker cybersecurity frameworks, including Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. He explained that these groups provide the technology, infrastructure, and financial resources to boost local scam operations. Gamble also revealed that the Lagos operation was relatively small compared to larger schemes in Southeast Asia. Here, some groups employ thousands of people. Workers in these operations are often recruited through job ads and paid much higher wages than local standards. In Nigeria, for example, workers could earn $500 per month, which is ten times the minimum wage . According to the EFCC, it is collaborating with international partners to investigate potential links between this scheme and broader organized crime networks. U.S. and UAE Target North Korea’s Crypto Laundering Network The United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in collaboration with the government of the United Arab Emirates, imposed sanctions on people and entities that are accused of facilitating North Korea’s digital asset laundering operations. The sanctions target two Chinese citizens, Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, along with the UAE-based company Green Alpine Trading, for their roles in converting cryptocurrency and laundering funds used to support the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). According to OFAC, Lu converted cryptocurrency into fiat to buy goods and services destined for North Korea or its proxies. His activity spans from early 2022 to September of 2023. Zhang was also involved in currency operations and allegedly served as a courier for Sim Hyon Sop, an executive of Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation. Sim was sanctioned in April of 2023, and has been accused of orchestrating money laundering schemes and collaborating with North Korean IT workers to generate income illegally in the United States. Green Alpine Trading is based in the UAE, and is alleged to operate as a front for money laundering activities supporting Sim’s operations. The company’s website was also suspended. Reports indicate that groups tied to North Korea stole between $600 million and $700 million in cryptocurrency in 2023 alone, with estimates of $3 billion stolen between 2017 and 2023. Some of the techniques linked to North Korean actors include impersonating authorized workers, hacking crypto exchanges, deploying malware, and using crypto mixers to obscure transactions.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TRADING | WALLET,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6603/ledger-users-targeted-by-phishing-scam-claiming-data-breach,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Although we are yet to reach milestone XRP, three altcoins are predicted to make good enormity, that potentially can expand 10x. Included among them is Rexas Finance, a platform innovating the way investors access Real World Assets (RWAs) through tokenization. Among the most promising blockchain projects today is Rexas Finance, which offers innovative fractional ownership of high-value assets such as real estate, gold, and art. Rexas Finance revolutionizes investment in Real-World Assets Rexas Finance is changing the way we invest in real-world assets by allowing fractional ownership. The use of tokenization allows investors the opportunity to invest in assets such as real estate, gold, and art without needing to have tons of cash. It democratises investment into markets that have traditionally been limited only to investors from wealthy countries. For example, a user can delegate their tokenized share to a rental property in Europe while being physically in Asia and then earn rental income. Rexas Finance is unlocking more opportunities for investors who have typically been excluded from the market due to high capital and illiquidity barriers to entry. Rexas Finance is dispersed across key areas throughout the real estate market, which according to recent estimates already exceeds $300 trillion globally. The platform also aspires to move into commodities and art spaces — in the region of $121.2 trillion and $65 billion, respectively. By tokenizing, we can turn these assets into liquid and accessible digital ownership of fractional portions of them. That is where the Rexas Token Builder comes in so that users can tokenize their assets and sell them fractionally. There is a Rexas QuickMint Bot on Telegram and Discord to be certain the minting tokens is easy and that more people can get involved. Interest in presale for Rexas Finance has been tremendous, with nine stages already sold in a minute. However, at the moment, the price for the Rexas token (RXS) in the ongoing presale is at $0.150 and has a large part of the 42.5% allocated for the public. Instead of the venture capital focus, the platform’s intention to be inclusive is influenced by this focus on public participation. Analysts estimate RXS could sit over $10 by the early part of 2025, riding with returns up to 150x from the current price. The excitement is amplified by this The Rexas Millionaire Giveaway increasing the demand of the token with 1 million prize pool. Toncoin (TON) The Open Network (TON), with the backing of a TON Foundation, is a decentralized blockchain running a native cryptocurrency, Toncoin (TON). The project was originally developed by Telegram as the Telegram Open Network, but its progress was halted by the SEC in 2020. However, the TON Foundation has laid claim to the project since, and Toncoin has grown to become a strong player within the blockchain web. Its proof of stake consensus model is why it is scalable, fast, and cost efficient, which is why so many believe it could make significant growth in the coming months. Aptos (APT) Aptos is a new layer-one blockchain created by Aptos Labs that intends to fix the scalability problems that plague other networks. According to Aptos, by using their Move programming language, they can deliver a more secure and flexible Web3 platform than others. Aptos is focusing on bringing high transaction fees and network congestion down and can be a player to watch in the blooming blockchain world. As a result of its top technology and support, Aptos has gained popularity as one of the altcoins expected to grow considerably before XRP hits $10.

The recent social media exploit is the latest in a trend of high-profile attacks on mainstream corporations to shill a new token address. Anthropic, which split from OpenAI, is the latest high-profile account to be hacked and subsequently used to promote a crypto token address. Anthropic noticed the exploit early and quickly regained access to its account. Anthropic’s X account promoted the Venti AI agent The hacked Anthropic X account shilled Venti, a bot trained on X communication and style. The bot’s main task is marketing through content. Venti was irreverent, using the latest Internet jargon, and is considered aligned with the values and content of 4Chan. The hacker shared both VENTI and a token pretending to be official with the ticker CLAUDE. One of the coins linked to the hack pumped immediately, leaving the exploiters with around $100K after a rapid rug pull. anthropic got hacked and the account promoted a coin, it immediately got liquidated for a profit of around 100k. tweet got deleted in about 30 minutes. pic.twitter.com/qVmRAQkAgA — Q (@qtnx_) December 17, 2024 Crypto AI agents have gained popularity in the last months of 2024, first ignited by experimental accounts like Truth Terminal, Numogram (GNON), and their offshoots. Soon after that, high-profile AI agents like AI16Z combined their content with DeFi features. As of December 2024, there are hundreds of small AI agent accounts, all fighting for attention. While Anthropic’s Claude was gaining ground, minor agents tried to attract followers and traders with their specific brand of content. Even after the exposure, VENTI is still a relatively minor token a week into trading. The asset has been sliding since its launch, currently at $0.00025. In addition to the Anthropic hack, the token’s creators also caused a fast artificial pump, using it to rug-pull buyers who showed interest in the token. The choice of promoting Venti through a hacked account is also seen as an attack on the project itself. Venti aimed for organic growth while training on X content data. The promotion coincided with a rug pull, which hurt VENTI more than the promotion helped. Venti was promoted in a second X message, which quoted an account that is generally supportive of AI memes . AI agents are in a relentless tussle for mindshare. Even the original Truth Terminal is struggling to remain among the top 10 agents on social media. For Venti, the recent exposure for 11 minutes on the page of Anthropic is yet to translate into any significant following or token success. The AI agent space as a whole has a market capitalization close to $10B, though new and small tokens can hardly compete with legacy assets that pivoted into AI. Not all AI agents are the same, and there are tiers of specialization. Some are intermixed with DeFi, others are content generators, and some are used for AI market analysis. Promotion via hacked social media accounts is a growing trend Previous hacks have been used to promote regular meme tokens or other types of projects. This time around, Anthropic was used to drive interest toward a new AI agent and a new token pretending to officially belong to Claude. The latest hack follows attacks against corporate X accounts and influential persons. The account of AI agent Truth Terminal was also stolen briefly, although it has been recovered. X account hacks have been one of the most common attacks this year. Just days ago, the Cardano Foundation lost control of its social media, where hackers promoted another Web3 asset. Other notable hacks include the account of Philip Bankss, the artist behind the CHILLGIY image and meme. Even Drake’s account was compromised this week to shill a new meme token. The list also included McDonald’s Corporation and even the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The hacked accounts have promoted fake airdrops, new token launches, or have spread malicious links.

While BNB faces challenges, Chainlink ( LINK ) delivered stellar performance throughout 2024, showcasing impressive growth that analysts expect will amplify in 2025. Meanwhile, 1Fuel (OFT) is making waves from its presale, capturing substantial investor interest. With strong investor confidence and innovative features, many are rushing to accumulate OFT tokens, positioning 1Fuel as a trailblazer in the crypto space. BNB Eyes New High But Still Lags Behind Investors have been pretty optimistic about Binance Coin becoming one of the top crypto tokens , but lately, it has been lagging. The coin’s value grew by an impressive 199% since the start of 2024, now holding steady at $727.36. Throughout the year, BNB has demonstrated remarkable stability, hardly ever going below the average performance. However, recent setbacks have tempered its momentum. On Monday, BNB hovered around $720, down from its all-time high of $794 achieved on December 4. Despite its strong fundamentals, Binance Coin finds itself at a technical crossroads, as analysts evaluate its potential to break past resistance and regain its bullish trends. Investors are leveraging tools like Trust Wallet and Core Wallet for secure trading while BNB’s resilience makes it a token to watch closely. LINK Reveals 96.27% Growth in 2024 Ahead of Next Year Chainlink ( LINK ) continues to solidify its position as a cryptocurrency with good performance , closing 2024 with an impressive 96.27% growth and bringing its current value to $28.08.

Its support level would be $26.47 and analysts expect resistance at $39.58. Some optimistic projections even suggest that LINK could surge as high as $52.04 next year. As more investors use tools like Trust Wallet and Core Wallet to trade and store their LINK tokens, the cryptocurrency’s demand continues to grow. 1Fuel OFT is Quickly Accumulated by Investors 1Fuel (OFT) is making waves in the crypto space, with investors rushing to accumulate the token during its presale phase. The anticipation of 88x growth after public listing has created a buzz, making OFT one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies with good performance . Its stage 2 presale has already surpassed over 30% completion in record time. 1Fuel has sold over 72 million tokens and raised approximately $670,000 from the presale alone, and it’s just in stage 2. This indicates investor confidence in this new altcoin. The 1Fuel ecosystem is backing the OFT token, elevating its position among the top crypto tokens . The ecosystem has an inbuilt privacy mixer, which anonymizes transactions and provides a level of security not offered by Trust Wallet or Core Wallet . With cold storage, 1Fuel offers heightened safety for digital assets. 1Fuel also stands out with its cross-chain capabilities which allow for seamless interaction with multiple blockchains from a single wallet, a step ahead of Trust Wallet and Core Wallet . The P2P exchange ensures secure and direct trading, while the one-click capability simplifies complex processes.

As whales continue to join the spot Ethereum ETF, analysts predict $5000 as the next target for ETH price. Experts claim that the DTX Exchange is expected to surge just like the ETH price, pumping by a massive 880%! The hybrid platform has raised over $10 million in its presale at a token price of $0.12. Spot Ethereum ETFs Break A Key Record: ETH Price To Hit $5k! Spot Ethereum ETFs have had inflows in the last 16 consecutive days, breaking a personal record. The net inflow on Friday, Dec. 14, stood at over $23.6 million, bringing the total amount since inception to over $2.26 billion. According to SoSoValue, all spot Ethereum ETFs hold over $13.7 billion in assets. The Grayscale Ethereum ETF is still the biggest, with over $5.6 billion. It is followed by iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, Fidelity Ethereum Fund, Bitwise Ethereum ETF, VanEck Ethereum ETF, and Franklin Ethereum ETF. One reason for the spot Ethereum ETF inflows is the rising hope that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow staking. Such a move would mean that ETF holders will benefit as the coin’s price rises and from the staking reward. Data by StakingRewards shows that the staking yield stands at 3.26%. The spot Ethereum ETF inflows happened at a time when Ethereum was doing well. Its price is hovering near $4,000 and is just 25% below its all-time high of $4,870. It has jumped by 153% from its 2023 lows. ETH Price Analysis: Can ETH Hit $5,000? In a recent note, CryptoQuant predicted that the ETH price was on a path to $5,000, citing the demand and supply dynamics. On the weekly chart, we see that the ETH price has risen, and a strong barrier at $4,092 was found. It has failed to cross that level two times before — in March and May. Ether has remained above the 50-week and 200-week moving averages and the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the ETH price needs to break the resistance at $4,092 to invalidate the triple-bottom chart pattern. A move above that resistance will push the ETH price to an all-time high of $4,877 and the key level at $5,000. It needs to rise by just 25% to get to $5,000, which is achievable if the crypto bull run continues. DTX Exchange: Unprecedented Investment Potential and Groundbreaking Technology When it comes to DTX Exchange , fairness and utility take center stage. It brings a wide range of assets and up to 1000x leverage. Namely, you can trade crypto, stocks, ETFs, forex, equities, and CFDs. This allows you to diversify your portfolio to your heart’s desire. So, holders will finally be able to stop juggling multiple platforms while trading. Also, the 1,000x leverage opportunity helps holders to make massive profits. This is possible with both small and large trades! DTX traders will also be able to trade with incredible speed, as DTX Exchange uses the VulcanX blockchain for transactions. This blockchain can process over 100,000 transactions per second, making it faster than big names like Ethereum and Solana. Analysts have been going crazy about the DTX Exchange (DTX) public presale. DTX Exchange is a next-gen decentralized trading platform. It spans much beyond the crypto world. Namely, DTX Exchange gives access to stocks, ETFs, forex, and more. As the presale continues to gain momentum, investors are incredibly drawn to this innovative platform that can redefine how we approach trading as a whole. So, analysts see DTX going to massive highs in 2025 as more people learn about its utility! Key Takeaways The spot Ethereum ETF’s huge inflow has caused the ETH price to soar to all-time highs. Analysts expect that $5,000 will be the next target price for Ethereum as whales continue to join the spot Ethereum ETF. Experts predict that the DTX Exchange will rise by an astounding 880%, much like the ETH price did!

Notably, a key factor causing the drop is the selling activity by whales, who have been cashing out their coins to profit from their recent gains. Whales Trigger Sell-Off As per data from Santiment, over the past week, whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion ADA have sold about $200 million worth of ADA. This has added selling pressure to the market, signaling a loss of confidence in the asset. As a result, this could also result in panic selling by smaller investors may also sell, further driving down the price. Traders Lock In Profits The recent profitability of ADA transactions has led to increased selloffs. Data shows that ADA’s Network Realized Profit/Loss has been positive over the past week, indicating that traders are selling for profit. This has likely encouraged other investors to sell, contributing to the price decline in recent days. On-chain analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that Cardano whales took profits as ADA rose from $1.15 to $1.33. However, after the price dropped to $0.91, they started buying again, accumulating 160 million ADA since the dip. In a separate post he also noted that a massive surge in whale activity on the ADA network, as 687 transactions exceeding $1 million were recorded in the past 24 hours. #Cardano whales took profits on the way up from $1.15 to $1.33, but after $ADA dropped to $0.91, they started buying again.

This increase is the most significant observed compared to other wallet categories. Despite this positive trend, the overall market remains balanced between bullish and bearish sentiment. Currently, ADA is trading at $1.03, just below resistance at $1.07. If selling continues, the price could fall to around $0.92.

Interestingly the memecoin market cap surpassed $140 billion. Investors who were eyeing memecoins are in hot waters with a recent controversy over their licensing rights. The story revolves around, the iconic Doge meme, born from the Shiba Inu dog Kabosu, which continues to leave its mark on the crypto world. After Kabosu passed away, her owner, Atsuko Sato, adopted a new Shiba Inu named Neiro, which quickly became a symbol in the meme coin space. Following the news many Neiro-themed coins started flooding the market each claiming the identity of the original coin. Amid this IP mania, the Own the Doge DAO, a collective focused on preserving the legacy of the Doge meme, secured the official intellectual property (IP) rights for Neiro directly from @kabosumama. This move has put the DAO in a unique position to decide which Neiro token should be recognized as the “official” one, bringing clarity to all the Neiro-themed coins. This will help the community to stay safe from scams and fraud. We’re pleased to announce that @kabosumama has officially granted our DAO the Neiro IP. When Atsuko revealed the name of her new adopted dog, Neiro, many tokens were launched in an attempt to capitalize on her name and story. However, since then, these various tokens have… pic.twitter.com/HCAL0ghCNS — Own The Doge (@ownthedoge) December 16, 2024 To ensure a fair and decentralized decision-making process, the DAO will allow DOG token holders to vote on which token deserves the official title. Sato retains veto power, ensuring that the final decision aligns with her vision for Neiro’s legacy and the integrity of the Doge community. The entire community cheered this move. The love myself and the community for Neiro is unconditional, and uncomplicated. Our biggest mission is to make sure Neiro follows the footsteps of Doge, with the fun and fairness for all, we meme everyday, we protect everyday, and most off all, we do whatever it takes to keep… pic.twitter.com/aKVCFr3Sz9 — CryptoLogic (@Lebologic) December 17, 2024 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, ETH, & XRP Price Prediction For This Week: What’s Next As BTC Price Hits $106k? , Crypto Impact The stakes are high in this decision. One of the Neiro tokens, based on Ethereum, boasts a market cap of $663 million, while others, such as the Solana-based token, are valued at around $5 million. The outcome of this vote could dramatically reshape the landscape of Neiro-inspired meme coins, potentially elevating one token to dominance or rejecting all contenders. Recently the creator of Peanut the Squirrel , Mark Longo, sent a letter to Binance , accusing them of using his trademark without permission. Sparking debates over all memecoins legitimacy and legal rights. Since like altcoins, people are investing hugely in memecoins and such news can break this bullish momentum.

On Dec. 17, Coinbase responded to a lawsuit filed by Sun-affiliated BiT Global, which accused the exchange of harming the WBTC market by removing the token in November. In its filing, Coinbase cited risks tied to Sun, including allegations of financial misconduct and ongoing regulatory investigations. “Guilt by Association” The filing sparked backlash within the crypto community, with many arguing Coinbase failed to provide sufficient legal or technical justification for the delisting. Critics also pointed out that Coinbase itself has been under several regulatory investigations. Bitcoin enthusiast and Coinbase skeptic Pledditor took to X on Dec. 17, accusing the exchange of making a decision based solely on personal bias. “It’s basically just they don’t like Justin Sun,” Pledditor stated, calling it “guilt by association.” The filing referenced Sun’s alleged misconduct, claiming he has “reportedly violated industry and government standards intended to prevent fraud.” Coinbase expressed skepticism over BiT Global’s reliability, citing its association with Sun. “So too is any acknowledgment that he has repeatedly been accused of, investigated for, and sued for financial misconduct, and that reports of his alleged misdeeds abound in the press and crypto community more broadly,” the filing stated. Sun’s Regulatory Troubles Justin Sun, founder of the Tron cryptocurrency, has faced numerous legal challenges. In March 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged him with fraud and securities violations. He has also reportedly been investigated by the FBI and the Southern District of New York’s prosecutor’s office. Irony Noted by Critics Prominent figures like VanEck adviser Gabor Gurbacs pointed out the irony of Coinbase’s actions, given its own legal troubles. “It’s ironic that Coinbase is treating Justin Tron this way. Coinbase itself is under SEC and numerous other investigations, probably many more than Justin and his businesses,” Gurbacs said in an X post shared by Sun.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/crypto-community-criticizes-coinbase-over-wrapped-bitcoin-delisting/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37800840,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629587,1734529579,Polygon warns of threats to decentralization in ongoing dispute with Aave,"Ethereum sidechain Polygon has accused Aave of using anti-competitive tactics to muscle out competing DeFi protocols. This is a reaction to the proposal on Aave DAO about whether the leading DeFi protocol should exit the Polygon network. According to a post on Polygon’s official X account, the plan to use bridge funds for yield farming, which led to the current conflict, was simply a pre-PIP to gauge community sentiment. Therefore, the community’s pushback is a good sign of the community’s engagement and decentralized governance. However, Polygon criticized Aave leadership’s reaction to the plan, noting that it was an intimidation tactic and that its community should resist such attempts. It said: “Whether you support or oppose the Pre-PIP, no one should fear retaliation for proposing ideas or engaging in formal governance processes. Progress comes from constructive debate, not shutting doors on those who bring fresh perspectives.” Nevertheless, the network, which has around 40% of its total value locked on Aave, said it remains committed to a thriving, competitive, and truly decentralized DeFi ecosystem and looks forward to a constructive dialogue with Aave. Polygon co-founder accuses Aave of hypocrisy Criticisms of Aave also came from Polygon’s co-founder Saideep Nailwal , who claimed on X that Aave itself proposed a similar plan before now. According to him, the DeFi protocol is only pushing back after it became clear that it may not be the choice protocol. He said: “When this pre-proposal was first brought into discussion, Aave leadership was super excited about it and lobbied heavily to make sure the bridge funds go to Aave deployment.” The founder added that Morpho Labs’ proposal offered more benefits for the Polygon ecosystem while giving the community more control over smart contracts. This is why it got more traction, causing Aave to “threaten” decoupling from the network. He described the Aave proposal to discontinue its operations on the Ethereum sidechain as an attack on the network and a vicious threat that does not positively contribute to the dialogue. Nailwal said: “A vicious threat proposing to discontinue Aave deployment on Polygon PoS bringing huge hassle to their users, just to make sure that the biggest and fastest-rising competitor to Aave – Morpho — didn’t get the growth boost from STB.” He added that the move would harm the users that the Aave DAO was trying to protect, as it would disrupt their access to the DeFi ecosystem. The co-founder noted that the attack was personal, citing that an unnamed Aave leader tweeted “Operation Polygon(e).” Aave CEO pushes back on claims Meanwhile, Aave’s CEO Stani Kulechov has refuted claims by the Polygon team, noting that Aave’s decision was the right approach to managing risk as expected of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). According to Kulechov, Aave’s proposal was a proactive step to protect users who already opposed the plan. He said: “Framing Aave DAO’s proposal as anticompetitive behavior is inaccurate and diverts attention from the real issue: user security. Inheriting the risk of a third-party protocol without the consent of the DAO is not something the Aave DAO is interested in.” Kulechov further said that the Polygon team made inaccurate claims about Aave’s infrastructure. According to him, Aave’s infrastructure can support teams that want to create custom markets with features such as immutable governance and using their tokens for governance. Thus, Polygon could have used this if it wanted more control over its investment strategy. In his view, Polygon chose others as partners behind closed doors because of likely benefits, including a rumored token deal. He also clarified that its initial proposal to the Polygon community was different, and the sole reason it opposed the idea was because the majority of the community was against their funds being rehypothecated without their consent.

37800201,https://crypto.news/?p=14320446,1734528735,Deutsche Bank wants to build a ‘so-called’ Layer 2 on the Ethereum network: report,"Deutsche Bank is reportedly building a Layer 2 under an asset-servicing pilot project called Dama 2 as part of the lender’s goal to clear regulatory hurdles for institutions who want to use public blockchains. According to a Bloomberg report published on Dec. 18, German banking giant Deutsche Bank AG is in the process of building a “so-called” Layer 2 for a public network. The lender hopes the project will clear regulatory challenges faced by financial firms trying to incorporate public blockchains into their operations. Last month Deutsche Bank released a test version of Project Dama 2, which includes a Layer 2 that is built on the Ethereum ( ETH ) network, the second-largest cryptocurrency network by market capitalization after Bitcoin ( BTC ). Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific industry applied innovation lead, Boon-Hiong Chan said that public blockchains like Ethereum pose a risk for financial institutions entering the blockchain, as firms harbor worries of interacting with criminals or sanctioned entities within the ecosystem. This is because, according to Chan, institutions do not know “who exactly is validating the transactions” and whether transaction fees could fall into the pockets of sanctioned entities. There is also the looming threat of facing a “hard fork” in the ecosystem that could radically change the digital ledger. “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be able to be satisfied,” said Chan to Bloomberg, adding the bank is still waiting on regulatory approval but it hopes to launch the product as a minimum viable by next year. You might also like: Crypto.com partners with Deutsche Bank for corporate banking expansion Chan believes the built-in Layer 2 can pave the way for banks to explore new opportunities within public blockchains, allowing them to curate a “more bespoke list of validators” that will process digital-asset transactions to earn rewards. In addition, he stated that regulators could be given “super admin rights” that lets them monitor the movement of funds within the blockchain to spot illicit transactions. “You are not dependent on the Layer 1 for detailed transaction records anymore,” said Chan. Project Dama 2 is part of an even larger initiative formed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore called Project Guardian. Project Guardian brings together 24 leading financial firms that are exploring ways to utilize the blockchain to tokenize assets. Though, the project has raised questions on just how deep banks are willing to venture when it comes to the crypto sphere. The Dama 2 in particular was born from collaborations with crypto firms Memento Blockchain and Interop Labs. The platform was built using ZKsync technology. As early as May 2024, Deutsche Bank announced it was in the process of testing an unnamed Ethereum-based platform. The bank said the platform would offer services centered around tokenized funds. Deutsche Bank joined Project Guardian on May 14, aiming to test the feasibility of asset tokenization alongside other major banking firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., DBS Group, and Ant International among others.

The company had previously announced this acquisition on November 6, together with the proposed $144M share-settled acquisition of additional on-rack mining machines with 18 EH/s of hashrate from Golden TechGen. Cango specifically bought the on-rack miners from Bitmain Technologies Georgia Limited and Bitmain Development Limited (together ‘Bitmain’), indicating that Bitmain could continue serving as Cango’s colocation provider. The cash-settled transaction was concluded after the relevant closing conditions were satisfied. Closing of the share-settled transaction was subject to certain closing conditions that are yet to be satisfied. Cango Inc. deploys its unspecified Bitcoin miners to produce 363.9 BTC Cango Inc., a Chinese auto services giant, leveled up from cars to crypto-mining dominance by spending $256 million for 32 EH/s of hashrate from Bitmain. Cango and Bitmain closed the cash-settled deal by assigning all the mining machines’ hash computing power to the company. The transfer of the machines’ legal title to the company is, however, expected to occur later, as agreed by both companies. The company dove head-first into Bitcoin mining to significant results in November after mining 363.9 BTC with the deployed miners. The production made Cango the third-largest publicly traded company by deployed hashrate and the fifth-largest by realized hashrate. The company averaged a production of 18.85 BTC per day and did not sell any of its Bitcoin produced in November, which left its total BTC holding at 363.9 BTC. Its deployed hashrate of 32 EH/s managed an average operating hashrate of 29.75 EH/s. Cango Inc. did not specify the model of the on-rack mining machines it got from Bitmain, although the unit cost of $8 per TH/s suggested that it may have acquired 50 EH/s of the Antminer S19XP series imported by Bitmain since 2023. Blockspace Media confirmed the model of Cango’s initial fleet, citing a person close to the matter who mentioned that the miners consisted entirely of Antminer S19XPs. Cango Inc’s stock price skyrockets after the first month of BTC mining Cango Inc. reported that this year’s Q3 revenue came in at $3.84 million as of November 30. The company’s Bitcoin mining revenue in November alone was already a few times higher than its revenue from quarter 2 of 2024. Its stocks also jumped from $3.41 in mid-November to $6.91 as of December 17, reaching a market cap of over $500M. The company’s hosting costs are yet to be revealed in the fourth quarter earnings report, but its total current assets as of September 30 was $564 million. Jiayuan Lin, Cango’s CEO, said the company’s overall business performance remained stable in the third quarter of 2024. He added that the solid results were mainly driven by the company’s strict cost control and risk management strategies, significantly improving its operational efficiency. Lin said the company reinforced monitoring mechanisms and risk assessments, effectively maintaining a low nonperformance loan ratio and ensuring asset quality and stability. Lin disclosed that Cango is focused on high-quality projects that complement the company’s core competencies. He added that the company aims to showcase its strength and vision on a broader stage. Lin said the company is keen on strengthening its data analysis capabilities to gain a more accurate understanding of its target markets and user demographics. According to the CEO, Cango will build on this foundation to achieve more balanced global growth.

37800092,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664176,1734528610,Whales Snap Up 30 Million XRP As Ripple Launches Its RLUSD Stablecoin,"XRP whales have been on a buying spree as blockchain payments company Ripple officially launched its dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, on several global crypto exchanges this Tuesday. The stablecoin is now available for trading on platforms Bitso, Uphold, CoinMENA, MoonPay, and Archax, with additional listings expected soon. Ripple RLUSD Stablecoin Launches Amid Price Volatility RLUSD is designed to maintain a stable value in line with the US dollar and is compatible with both the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), the latter being developed by Ripple Labs alongside XRP. However, shortly after its launch, RLUSD experienced some volatility, trading at $1.50 on MoonPay early Tuesday—an unexpected premium above its intended value, Fortune Magazine confirmed. Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches $4,100 For The First Time In Over Three Years, Aiming For $5,000 Next David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), had anticipated potential price discrepancies in a prior post on X. He explained that early supply shortages could lead to RLUSD trading at a premium until the market stabilizes. Schwartz reassured investors, stating, “But rest assured, the price will come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. If it doesn’t, something is very seriously wrong.” Interestingly, RLUSD’s inflated price of $1.50 is a fraction of what it was previously listed at on Xaman, a crypto wallet for the XRP ledger. In the lead-up to the launch, Ripple supporters made bids for the initial RLUSD tokens, with some investors willing to pay as much as 511 XRP—approximately $1,300 per token. XRP Retraces To $2.52 After Initial Spike As the launch of RLUSD drives increased activity on the XRP Ledger, interest in XRP itself has surged. The token, used to settle transaction fees on the blockchain, saw a 6% rise in value on Monday, peaking at $2.71. However, it has since retraced to the $2.52 mark. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported that large investors, or “whales,” bought an additional 30 million XRP prior to the launch, further bolstering its price. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum experienced declines of 2.6% and 4.6%, respectively, in the same timeframe. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel The launch of RLUSD follows recent regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, positioning Ripple to enhance its presence in the payment network sector for cross-border transactions.

Omni Network launched its Core mainnet, introducing a unifying layer to streamline Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem, while Wormhole announced a collaboration with Nuffle Labs to expand EigenLayer’s restaking capabilities beyond Ethereum. Omni Network Launches Mainnet to Unify Ethereum Layer-2 Ecosystem The Ethereum scaling solution Omni Network has officially launched its Omni Core mainnet, marking a significant milestone in the development of Ethereum's layer-2 (L2) ecosystem. Announced on Tuesday, the Omni Core system aims to address the challenges posed by the increasingly fragmented Ethereum rollup landscape, serving as the foundational layer of Omni's Orderflow Engine. Omni seeks to unify Ethereum’s layer-2 ecosystem, allowing users and developers to interact with Ethereum as if it were a single, unified blockchain. The launch comes at a time when Ethereum’s rollups, which collectively hold $58 billion in Total Value Locked ( TVL ), are spread across more than 40 networks, creating barriers to seamless cross-chain functionality. “Fragmentation has limited the true potential of Ethereum . Liquidity is spread thin, and users face unnecessary friction just to move between rollups,” said Tyler Tarsi, Omni’s Chief Technology Officer. The growth of Ethereum rollups has been a double-edged sword. While layer-2 solutions such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism have drastically reduced transaction costs and created specialized ecosystems, they have also introduced significant fragmentation. This fragmentation has hampered liquidity aggregation, cross-chain interoperability, and the broader usability of decentralized applications (dApps). Omni Core addresses these challenges by introducing a cross-chain messaging protocol and a custom-built Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that abstracts cross-rollup interactions. These features are designed to create a “seamless user experience” by enabling Ethereum's fragmented networks to function as one unified chain. At launch, Omni Core supports interoperability between Ethereum’s mainnet and leading layer-2 rollups, including Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, which together account for over 90% of Ethereum’s layer-2 TVL. The mainnet rollout sets the stage for new innovations, such as cross-rollup stablecoins and DeFi primitives capable of aggregating liquidity from multiple sources. Omni is one of the first projects to harness the potential of restaking, a groundbreaking concept introduced through Ethereum's EigenLayer protocol. Restaking involves reusing staked assets like ETH to secure multiple blockchain networks and applications simultaneously, enhancing the efficiency and value of proof-of-stake systems. While restaking has been hailed as one of Ethereum’s most exciting and innovative developments, its practical applications have remained limited. Omni’s launch signals a new phase in the evolution of this technology, offering a real-world use case for restaking in the Ethereum ecosystem. Omni Core’s technological backbone combines several cutting-edge innovations: Cross-Chain Messaging Protocol: This protocol facilitates seamless communication between rollups, enabling transactions and data to flow freely across the Ethereum ecosystem. Bespoke EVM: Omni’s custom EVM integrates with its messaging protocol to abstract cross-chain interactions, reducing friction for developers and end-users. Octane Framework: The open-source Octane framework, developed by Omni, integrates EVM functionality with CometBFT, the high-throughput consensus engine used by the Cosmos ecosystem. Octane enables simultaneous execution and consensus processes, further enhancing transaction speed. Together, these components form the Orderflow Engine, a system designed to validate transactions and coordinate data between Ethereum's base chain and its layer-2 networks. Omni’s SolverNet, an additional layer of the Orderflow Engine, is expected to receive further updates in the near future. A Vision for Unified DeFi and Beyond By improving cross-chain interoperability, Omni Core sets the stage for revolutionary applications within the Ethereum ecosystem. Developers will gain access to tools that were previously difficult or impossible to deploy due to fragmentation. Examples include: Cross-Rollup Stablecoins: Stablecoins that seamlessly operate across multiple Layer 2 networks. Aggregated Liquidity DeFi Primitives: Decentralized finance tools that can pool liquidity from various rollups, enhancing capital efficiency and user experience. Omni’s mission to create a unified Ethereum ecosystem has the potential to drive innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and other blockchain-powered industries. Omni’s ambitious vision is supported by prominent investors, including Pantera Capital, Hashed Fund, Jump Crypto, and Two Sigma Ventures, among others. In 2023, the project raised $18 million in funding to develop its technology stack and bring its vision of a unified Ethereum ecosystem to life. Wormhole and Nuffle Labs Partner to Expand EigenLayer’s Restaking Beyond Ethereum In related news, Wormhole announced on Tuesday a partnership with Nuffle Labs to extend EigenLayer’s restaking capabilities beyond the Ethereum ecosystem. This collaboration leverages Wormhole’s cross-chain messaging architecture and Nuffle’s innovative NUFF protocol to enable restaking from any layer-1 or layer-2 blockchain—without relying on asset bridging. The initiative represents a significant leap forward in restaking technology, a rapidly growing area of research and development in the crypto industry. By allowing staked assets to secure multiple protocols and applications simultaneously, restaking has the potential to reshape the proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystem. Restaking has emerged as a critical area of innovation within the blockchain space. At its core, restaking enables blockchain applications to pool the security provided by already staked assets, avoiding the need for each protocol to establish its own independent security infrastructure. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of PoS networks but also paves the way for novel blockchain use cases. One of the key components of this model is the concept of Actively Validated Services (AVSs)—applications and protocols that utilize restaked assets. AVSs can create custom validation tasks or rules, providing tailored security solutions for specific use cases. Experts believe restaking could play a transformative role in several areas, including: Oracles: Ensuring off-chain data is securely delivered to on-chain smart contracts. Layer 2 Rollups: Augmenting the security of rollups while ensuring data availability. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Simplifying interactions between disparate blockchain ecosystems. By integrating Nuffle’s modular blockchain technology with Wormhole’s message-passing capabilities, the partnership will make all tokens facilitated by Nuffle’s infrastructure available to AVSs within EigenLayer’s shared security framework. This development opens the door to a more interconnected and secure blockchain ecosystem. Nuffle Labs, a spin-off from the NEAR Foundation, is at the forefront of modular blockchain technology. The company has been instrumental in developing key components of the NEAR ecosystem, including the NEAR Data Availability Layer and NEAR Fast Finality Layer. These innovations aim to improve blockchain scalability and enhance the efficiency of decentralized applications. Through this partnership, Nuffle Labs is extending its expertise to EigenLayer’s security model. By enabling tokens from Nuffle’s infrastructure to be restaked across EigenLayer’s AVSs, the collaboration enhances cross-chain functionality and reduces the need for bridging—one of the more complex and risk-prone aspects of blockchain interoperability. Wormhole’s Role in Cross-Chain Communication As one of the leading providers of cross-chain communication infrastructure, Wormhole is uniquely positioned to support the expansion of restaking technology. Its message-passing architecture ensures that data and transactions can flow seamlessly between layer-1 and layer-2 networks. By integrating with Nuffle’s NUFF protocol, Wormhole will facilitate direct restaking of assets across multiple blockchains, eliminating the reliance on traditional bridging solutions. This innovation marks a significant step toward a fully interconnected blockchain ecosystem where assets and applications can operate across chains without friction. The partnership between Wormhole and Nuffle Labs reflects a shared vision for a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Nuffle Labs CEO Altan Tutar articulated this vision in a statement. ”Over time, as every asset gets restaked and the industry becomes more interconnected, our vision is to create an ecosystem where you can do anything from anywhere. Whether it be lending, borrowing, or restaking, we aim to create a global marketplace for all.” This vision sheds light on the transformative potential of restaking as a cornerstone of blockchain infrastructure. By enabling assets to flow seamlessly across networks, the partnership aims to create a unified marketplace where users and developers can interact with multiple blockchain ecosystems as if they were one. The collaboration between Wormhole and Nuffle Labs has far-reaching implications for the blockchain industry: Enhanced Security: By pooling the security of staked assets across multiple blockchains, restaking reduces the need for standalone security measures and strengthens the overall ecosystem. Improved Efficiency: Direct restaking without asset bridging streamlines cross-chain operations, reducing costs and simplifying processes for developers and users. New Use Cases: The expanded capabilities of restaking could enable innovative applications in DeFi, gaming, and beyond, making blockchain technology more accessible and versatile.",POSITIVE,ETH | NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ARB | NEAR,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6605/omni-network-launches-core-mainnet-to-unify-ethereum-layer-2-ecosystem,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Virgin Voyages offers a $120,000 cruise pass payable in Bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption helps luxury brands target younger, tech-oriented customers. Bitcoin’s rise has caught the eye of luxury brand, Printemps. The French department store will now accept Bitcoin and Ethereum payments through a partnership with Binance and Lyzi. This move by Printemps reflects the growing crypto push among luxury brands , marking a significant step for crypto adoption in Europe. Printemps is the first European department store to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum. Currently, only a few high-end brands like Gucci, Balenciaga, Ferrari, accept cryptocurrencies. These brands are using crypto to redefine their branding and attract tech-savvy buyers.

37800030,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375136,1734528523,"Ripple (XRP) ETFs May Lag Behind Litecoin and Hedera, Bloomberg Analyst Predicts","As the crypto community gears up in anticipation of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) approvals or rejections in 2025, market analysts believe some assets have a higher chance of being greenlit earlier than others. The Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted that United States regulatory authorities could approve Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs before allowing issuers to launch similar products for Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL). LTC and HBAR ETFs Likely Launched First Balchunas explained that the market will likely witness the launch of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) combo ETFs first. These cryptocurrencies have spot ETF markets that have seen billions in cumulative inflows. Hence, Balchunas believes they have a higher chance of making it to listing platforms first because of their pre-existing markets. The second cryptocurrency with a higher chance of getting ETFs is LTC because it was created as a fork of the Bitcoin network. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has labeled many altcoins as securities and deemed them subject to appropriate laws over the years. However, LTC has been exempted from this classification. The same concept applies to HBAR, which has escaped being labeled a security in numerous lawsuits the SEC has dished out to crypto firms over the years. LTC and HBAR are not considered securities, so they are not part of any pending lawsuits between the SEC and crypto firms; hence, they would likely be seen as commodities by the SEC. Why Not XRP ETFs? Conversely, XRP ETFs appear far-fetched because of an ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple Labs, the developer behind the XRP Ledger. Ripple and the SEC have been entangled in a lawsuit since 2020 over XRP’s status as a security. Besides that, the cryptocurrency has also been mentioned in other pending lawsuits as a security. Although a judge ruled last year that XRP can only be classified as a security when sold to institutional investors, another Bloomberg analyst, James Seyffart, mentioned that XRP ETFs would be seriously considered when the complex legal issues surrounding the coin are resolved. According to his ETFs outlook report, this will likely happen when the new SEC administration takes control in 2025. Meanwhile, a few Solana ETF applications were recently rejected , and analysts linked the development to the coin’s classification as a security.

While the FED's critical interest rate decision and FED Chairman Jerome Powell's statement are awaited in Bitcoin (BTC) and global markets, Singapore-based cryptocurrency company QCP Capital shared its expectations for the FED and Bitcoin. QCP Capital analysts said in their daily analysis that they expect the Fed to make a 25 basis point cut and the statements to carry a slightly hawkish tone. Analysts said that Fed Chairman Powell's statements would not provide a definitive path for further rate cuts in 2025, and that they expected Powell to emphasize the difficulties that would arise if the Fed accelerated rate cuts. Analysts added that under current conditions, they expect the FED to make three interest rate cuts in 2025. “The final Fed meeting of 2024 takes place tonight and despite the festive Christmas season, we see little reason to celebrate. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points at this meeting. “We expect tonight's statement to carry a slightly hawkish tone, reflecting U.S. inflation holding above the Fed's 2% target and a strong labor market.” What to Expect in Bitcoin? Analysts who also evaluated the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market stated that liquidity in the markets has decreased and that this situation could cause major liquidations and sudden and sharp movements. Analysts pointed out that Bitcoin is showing a downward trend on the daily chart, and underlined that these declines will be short-term and that panic should not be acted upon. Analysts stated that 2025 will be a bullish year for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and that maintaining current positions will be profitable in the medium and long term. “The technical outlook for BTC looks cautious, with BTC trending bearish on the daily timeframe. If there is a decline, do not shake your positions. With 2025 expected to be a potentially bullish year for cryptocurrencies, it may be worth staying the course, especially with Trump in office.” *This is not investment advice.

According to a recent report by research firm Kaiko and Dutch crypto exchange Bitvavo, euro-denominated trading volumes have consistently exceeded 2023 averages throughout 2024. Peaks were observed in March and November, with monthly volumes surpassing $42 billion each. This marked growth highlights the euro’s increasing significance in global cryptocurrency markets , where it now ranks as the third most-traded fiat currency, capturing 7.5% of fiat-based trading volume. In comparison, the U.S. dollar and Korean won continue to dominate, with shares of 49.9% and 33.4%, respectively. The report underscores how Europe’s regulatory clarity, particularly through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), is fostering confidence and activity in the region’s cryptocurrency landscape. MiCA Reshapes Stablecoin Dynamics in Europe The introduction of MiCA has been a game-changer for the stablecoin ecosystem in Europe. These regulations, governing asset-referenced and electronic money tokens, began their phased rollout in June 2024. Notably, the full implementation expected by year-end. Tether’s strategic decision to discontinue its euro-pegged stablecoin EURt (EURT) on all blockchains in November was seen as a response to Europe’s evolving regulatory climate. Despite this, the euro-backed stablecoin market has flourished, with monthly volumes exceeding $300 million throughout the year. November was particularly notable, with trading volumes nearly hitting $800 million. MiCA-compliant stablecoins now dominate the European market. Circle’s EURC, Societe Generale’s EURCV, and Banking Circle’s EURI collectively accounted for 91% of market share by November. This dramatic shift reflects the growing alignment between regulatory compliance and market adoption. Binance and Coinbase Compete for Market Share Major exchanges are vying for dominance in Europe stablecoin sector. Binance has also gained major traction, nearly matching Coinbase’s market share after listing Banking Circle’s EURI in August. The steady growth of compliant stablecoins underscores the pivotal role regulation plays in shaping the future of cryptocurrency in Europe. As the euro gains ground in global markets and stablecoins adapt to new rules, Europe is positioning itself as a hub for regulated cryptocurrency innovation. With the MiCA framework now in place, the region is set to lead by example, demonstrating how robust regulation can coexist with dynamic market growth.

37799849,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375184,1734528140,"Ethereum Price Analysis: ETH Rejected at $4K Again, Is $3.5K Next?","Ethereum recently faced a minor rejection at the critical $4K resistance zone, underscoring the presence of sellers at this level. A pullback toward the $3.5K support area may follow, providing an opportunity for buyers to re-enter the market with the goal of reclaiming the $4K threshold. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum recently faced another rejection at the pivotal $4K resistance level, highlighting the strong presence of sellers in this zone. This has created a challenging environment for buyers attempting to sustain the uptrend toward a new all-time high. The price action suggests the formation of a double-top bearish reversal pattern, signaling the potential for a retracement toward the $3.5K support zone. Ethereum remains range-bound between $3.5K and $4K, with a breakout likely after the consolidation phase. A bullish breakout above $4K would pave the way for further upward momentum. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH showed renewed strength after buyers stepped in near the ascending channel’s lower boundary. This buying activity sparked a fresh rally, driving the price toward the channel’s middle boundary, aligning with the critical $4K resistance level. However, the asset encountered a rejection at this zone, leading to a decline. Ethereum is now oscillating between the lower boundary of $3.7K and the $4K resistance. In the mid-term, further bearish retracement toward the lower boundary, followed by a renewed attempt to reclaim the $4K resistance, appears likely. A successful breakout above $4K could signal the continuation of Ethereum’s bullish trend. Onchain Analysis By Shayan This chart illustrates Ethereum’s Binance liquidation heatmap, highlighting potential price levels where significant liquidation events could occur. The clustering of liquidation levels within a specific range suggests that the price will likely move toward that zone. These levels serve as valuable indicators for predicting price direction and identifying areas of potential convergence. As shown, there is a notable concentration of liquidity just above the critical $4K resistance, representing the liquidation levels for short positions. This makes the $4K region an attractive target for whales and large institutional players, increasing the likelihood of a bullish breakout in the mid-term.

37799778,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629631,1734527779,Pro-crypto Treasury Secretary Bessent to meet with anti-crypto Senator Warren,"Scott Bessent, Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury Secretary, will meet Senator Elizabeth Warren later today in a showdown between two people with radically different views on crypto. Bessent, an outspoken advocate for blockchain, is expected to face a grilling from Warren, one of the top haters of crypto in Washington. The meeting is part of a series of Capitol Hill discussions before his confirmation hearings next month. Bessent’s Capitol Hill itinerary also reportedly includes meetings with Republican senators Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, and James Lankford. Warren’s war on crypto Warren has made no secret of her disdain for crypto. She claims it undermines financial systems, enables illicit activities, and allows bad actors to sidestep U.S. sanctions. Her Anti-Money Laundering Act , which now boasts 21 Senate co-sponsors, is designed to clamp down on the crypto industry with stricter regulations. Warren has specifically called out crypto’s role in helping Russia evade sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine. “Crypto takes the sting out of sanctions,” she declared. The Senator frequently targets major figures in banking and finance, and Bessent’s nomination has already drawn her ire. After Trump announced his pick for Treasury Secretary in late November, Warren issued a statement accusing the administration of prioritizing Wall Street over working Americans. “Wall Street may be breathing a sigh of relief at Scott Bessent’s nomination, but working people see no help coming their way,” she has said . Bessent’s pro-crypto playbook Scott Bessent has been vocal about his belief in the transformative power of cryptocurrency. “Crypto is about freedom,” he said, adding that crypto attracts young investors disillusioned with traditional financial systems. His vision for the Treasury Department includes initiatives like establishing a national Bitcoin reserve and forming a crypto advisory council, which align with Trump’s broader pro-crypto policies. Before founding his macro hedge fund, Key Square Group, Bessent served as the chief investment officer at Soros Fund Management. He made headlines in the 1990s with a $1 billion profit from shorting the British pound and later with another big win against the Japanese yen in 2013. At its peak, Key Square managed over $5 billion in assets, cementing Bessent’s reputation as a strategic thinker. He has dismissed the notion that crypto should be defined by its bad actors. The Wall Street champion has also criticized Democrats for targeting the entire industry instead of addressing specific issues. “The crypto economy is here to stay,” he said. Given Warren’s influence in the Senate and her high-profile stance against crypto, today’s meeting will likely involve some tough questions about Bessent’s plans for the Treasury and his unapologetic support for blockchain technology.

XRP, Solana (SOL), and Lightchain AI (LCAI) have emerged as key contenders, each bringing unique strengths to the table. XRP’s institutional focus, Solana’s scalability, and Lightchain AI’s revolutionary integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) make them standout choices for traders and investors. In this article, we delve into the distinctive features of these altcoins, examine the factors driving their growth, and explore why Lightchain AI could potentially lead the pack in the race for altcoin dominance. XRP Banking on Institutional Adoption and Cross-Border Payments XRP has long been a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, renowned for its ability to streamline cross-border payments. Its partnerships with financial institutions worldwide and its use case as a bridge currency for international transactions make it a reliable choice for institutional adoption. With recent legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has regained momentum, positioning itself for further growth. Analysts believe that increased regulatory clarity and adoption by financial institutions could drive demand for XRP, reinforcing its relevance in the market during the upcoming bull run. Solana High-Speed Blockchain Scaling for a Growing Ecosystem Solana (SOL) has established itself as a leading blockchain for scalability and speed. Known for its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, Solana delivers high transaction throughput at low costs, making it a popular choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its robust ecosystem, which includes a wide range of DeFi projects and NFT marketplaces, has attracted developers and users alike. While Solana has faced occasional network stability issues, its continued innovation and ecosystem expansion make it a strong contender for dominance in the next bull run. Lightchain AI The Innovative Contender With Game-Changing Potential Lightchain AI (LCAI) is a revolutionary altcoin that combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. At its core is the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which replaces traditional mining and staking with meaningful AI computations, ensuring both network security and advancements in decentralized AI.

Amid the increasing XRP price and soaring Ripple momentum, analysts remain baffled about Ripple's future. AI shows a bullish price forecast for the Ripple network. However, experts claim that DTX Exchange will show a larger increase. DTX Exchange, an emerging hybrid platform, has raised a staggering $10.3 million in presale stage 6! Ripple: AI Predicts XRP Price To Increase The Ripple market has been witnessing major changes. Ripple USD (RLUSD) has made its way into the stablecoin market. Supported by Ripple Labs, the business behind XRP and its payment systems, RLUSD seeks to offer a regulated and steady digital currency. The network’s cryptocurrency, XRP, could benefit from the latest developments. Some believe that the XRP price could surge to $3. Amidst this, a few others were hoping the XRP price could maintain itself at its current level. The Ripple market recorded a notable spike over the past day. The XRP price was trading at $2.54, during price time, after surging by 5.43% throughout the past 24 hours. The XRP price went from a low of $2.34 to a high of $2.56. The asset’s monthly and weekly increases were also significant. XRP price surged by 138% and 16%, respectively. Despite its recent uptick, Ripple’s cryptocurrency continues to trade 34% below its all-time high of $3.84. The daily trading volume of XRP also followed suit. The market saw a 92% surge and is currently at $12.71 billion. The trading volume also hints at a highly bullish XRP price trajectory. DTX Exchange Turns Heads With $10 Million Presale Raise DTX Exchange emerges as a presale star. It is now in phase six and has soared by 500%, raising over $10.3 million. Not only that, DTX Exchange now boasts over 300,000 wallets, which shows the demand for this crypto coin. Interest in DTX is high since those holding it will benefit greatly. For instance, holders of this altcoin will get a percentage of the trading fee revenue generated by DTX Exchange, governance voting rights, and the ability to vote on future developments for this platform. One DTX costs just $0.12, a 500% rise from its starting price. However, this phase six presale price will rise to $0.20 after a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap lists it. DTX Exchange will redefine online trading by closing the gap between DEX and CEX. Therefore, users will find the best of both in one place. They will get to experience fast transaction speeds of 0.04 seconds, privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks, and access to over 120,000 asset classes (crypto coins, stocks, gold, etc.). These factors could make DTX Exchange a fan-favorite for millions and DTX one of the top altcoins in the future. Beyond the user experience, traders can access up to 1,000x leverage on the DTX Exchange project. With this, traders enjoy a generous amount of liquidity that allows them to aim for wider profit ranges. There is a lot of inclusivity in the DTX Exchange project. Firstly, the VIP Rebate Program on the project makes partners out of traders and returns 3% of its daily profits to them. Additionally, DTX Exchange users will be allowed to make suggestions on future projects, giving them a sense of belonging. Key Takeaways Since August, the XRP price has increased by more than 470%, demonstrating a massive surge by Ripple. Experts are baffled by the Ripple trajectory; some predict a crash, yet DTX is still unbeaten!

While Pepe Unchained is capitalizing on exchange listings and staking incentives to gain traction, iDEGEN is attracting attention with its AI-driven meme culture and unique presale model. Pepecoin (PEP) setback Pepecoin Network (PEP), originally a code fork of Dogecoin, has seen significant gains since its launch in January 2024, recently hitting a record high of $0.001736 and pushing its market cap to over $151 million. However, the past week has not been kind to PEP, with the token experiencing a substantial correction. The price has dipped by 26.1% over the week to $0.001172 at press time. This price adjustment follows a meteoric rise driven by speculative interest and listings on mainstream exchanges like CoinEx Global , XeggeX, and Nonkyc. The correction reflects a more common pattern in the volatile meme coin space where quick gains often lead to profit-taking and subsequent price retracements. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) gains traction In stark contrast to Pepecoin’s downturn, Pepe Unchained (PEPU), another Pepe-themed meme coin, has been experiencing a surge in momentum. Since its listing on BingX and subsequent announcements of staking rewards, PEPU has seen its price increase significantly. Over the past 24 hours, the memecoin’s price has risen by 44.6% to $0.02263 at press time. Besides BingX, the recent exchange listings on MEXC and LBank have bolstered its exposure, making PEPU one of the most traded tokens on Dexscreener. With a market cap of approximately $119 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $16.9 million, PEPU’s growth is fueled by increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors. The ecosystem itself, built on Layer 2 blockchain designed for meme-based innovation, includes features like a decentralized exchange, cross-chain interoperability, and a meme coin launchpad, positioning PEPU as a key player in the meme coin space. iDEGEN (IDGN) emerges with a fresh approach As Pepe Unchained rises, iDEGEN (IDGN), an AI-driven meme token currently in its presale phase, is carving out a distinct niche within the memecoin market. With a unique dynamic pricing model and a fusion of AI with meme culture, iDEGEN is attracting attention from both traders and investors in its ongoing presale . The token’s presale, which began on November 26, 2024, has raised over $6.1 million, reflecting a strong demand for innovative projects in the space. The presale is structured to encourage quick trading, with prices adjusting every five minutes based on market activity. If a single purchase is made within the span of five minutes, IDGN’s price remains unchanged in the next five minutes. However, if subsequent purchases are made, the price rises by 5% in the next interval and if no purchase is made the price decreases by 5%. This dynamic presale approach aligns with the speculative nature of the market and aims to reward consistent demand. When the presale ends, the token is expected to list on crypto exchanges at 10% higher than the last presale price, guaranteeing significant returns for early investors. iDEGEN’s slogan, “AI Born. Degen Raised,” captures its ethos of combining cutting-edge technology with the chaotic, community-driven spirit that defines meme coins. Notably, the community-driven approach of iDEGEN, characterized as the “fatherless AI,” engages users by responding to tweets and autonomously posting updates on X , without moderation. This dynamic interaction ensures that iDEGEN remains aligned with user feedback and market sentiment. The project is also set to launch a no-code meme coin launcher, Pepe’s Pump Pad, in January 2025, which could further drive interest and adoption, resulting in a sure in the IDGN price.

Investors participating in the round included Brevan Howard Digital, Haun Ventures, Galaxy Ventures, Lightspeed Faction, Superscrypt, Hashkey, Nomura's crypto arm Laser Digital, A Capital, 280 Capital, SV Angel, Reciprocal Ventures and others. The fresh investment round followed a $10 million seed fundraising in May led by Haun.  With the investment, the team plans to speed up the development of its own layer 1 blockchain. Plume's mainnet launch is slated for early next year, the press release said.  Plume aims to streamline bringing and investing in traditional financial instruments, or tokenized real-world assets (RWA), on blockchain rails with its tokenization engine, and is also developing an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain where users can trade assets. RWAs are a rapidly growing class of digital assets, with analysts forecasting to mushroom into a market worth several trillions of dollars over this decade as crypto firms and big financial institutions place assets like bonds, commodities and real estate on blockchains.  Plume said it has onboarded over $4 billion worth of assets to its ecosystem including private credit funds, renewable energy financing and mineral rights. The platform also brought niche products on-chain that often are not widely available to average investors such as graphics processing units (GPU) and carbon credits, noted Will Nuelle, general partner of Galaxy Ventures, one of Plume's investors.  ""RWAs have always had tremendous demand, but historically the infrastructure to bring these assets on-chain just hasn’t existed,” said Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of Plume. ""Through our technology and ecosystem, we plug them directly into our community, ecosystem, and liquidity and all in an open, permissionless and composable way.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SPONSORED,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/12/18/rwa-focused-network-plume-raises-20-m-from-brevan-howard-and-others-ahead-of-mainnet-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89299b84aa0e6453f740df07fc01c66775a2a51a-1200x630.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
37799401,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629635,1734527004,Coinbase under fire for linking WBTC delisting to Justin Sun,"The crypto community is lashing out against Coinbase’s reasoning for delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) after the exchange linked the decision to the “unacceptable risk” associated with Tron founder Justin Sun. On December 17, Coinbase filed a response to a lawsuit from BiT Global, a company affiliated with Sun. The lawsuit accused the exchange of harming the Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) market by removing the token from its platform in November. In its filing, Coinbase referenced concerns about Sun, citing allegations of financial misconduct and ongoing regulatory investigations as reasons for the delisting. According to the exchange, Sun’s involvement in the WBTC project presented significant risks that could compromise its platform’s integrity. However, this explanation has sparked sharp criticism within the crypto community, with many questioning the adequacy of Coinbase’s legal and technical justification for the move. Bit Global: WBTC delisting is ‘ill-advised’ In the lawsuit that BiT Global filed on December 13, it argues that the delisting was illegal and would lead to irreparable damage to WBTC’s economics. The lawsuit also criticized Coinbase for listing other tokens, including memecoins, which BiT Global claims are less serious than WBTC. Moreover, BiT argues that COIN’s launch of its own tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC, breaches antitrust laws and could lead to a monopoly in the tokenized Bitcoin market, potentially stifling competition. The exchange’s filing justified the delisting by pointing to Sun’s alleged past misdeeds, including accusations of fraud and market manipulation. It expressed skepticism about BiT Global’s credibility, highlighting the firm’s ties to Sun. The exchange contended that its internal process led to the decision to delist WBTC, based on concerns that continued association with Sun could jeopardize its platform’s security and customer trust. Court documents excerpts from the Bit Global vs. Coinbase case. Source: Coinbase Filing Despite this, BiT Global’s legal request to reverse the delisting claims that Coinbase’s decision was arbitrary and without merit, suggesting that the delisting would harm the token’s liquidity and market value. Crypto community uproar ensues Bitcoin enthusiasts and critics of the exchange, such as the prominent figure Pledditor, have lambasted the exchange’s actions, accusing it of relying on a tenuous rationale to remove WBTC. In a post on X, Pledditor described Coinbase’s decision as “guilt by association,” arguing that the exchange’s animus toward Sun overshadowed any solid legal or technical foundation for the move. So in a court filing today, @Coinbase gave their reason why they delisted wBTC, and it's basically just they don't like Justin Sun. That's really just it. They don't give any technical or legal arguments about why wBTC can't be listed. It's just guilt by association pic.twitter.com/bJmMnAue7x — Pledditor (@Pledditor) December 17, 2024 The crypto exchange’s justification also faces scrutiny due to its own legal challenges. Sun, who has been the target of multiple regulatory investigations, is facing charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for alleged violations, including fraud. Adding to the debate, VanEck adviser Gabor Gurbacs highlighted the irony in COIN’s stance against Sun, pointing out that the exchange itself is embroiled in significant legal battles. Gurbacs noted that Coinbase, which is under investigation by the SEC for allegedly offering unregistered securities, is hypocritical for focusing on Sun’s alleged misconduct while facing its own regulatory challenges. It’s ironic that @coinbase is treating @justinsuntron this way. Coinbase itself is under SEC and numerous other investigations, probably many more than Justin and his businesses. Questioning someone’s reputation this way might just bring out skeletons from their own closet. https://t.co/LsJx7iOhJR — Gabor Gurbacs (@gaborgurbacs) December 17, 2024 Meanwhile, the crypto exchange is also facing charges from the SEC, including one filed in June 2023, accusing the exchange of offering unregistered securities through various tokens listed on its platform. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, publicly called for a more constructive approach from regulators toward the cryptocurrency industry. In addition to the SEC investigation, Coinbase also settled with the New York Department of Financial Services in January 2023 for $100 million, addressing concerns about its compliance program.

This trend is consistent with the overall whale behavior observed in recent weeks. From $0.50 to $1.32 before leveling off at $1.16 as of this report, ADA has surged 260% in the past month. Whales' accumulation phase shows their conviction in the long-term viability of the initiative, which runs counter to ADA declines of smaller investors. Is ADA 400% Rally Imminent? Analyst Lark Davis has highlighted ADA's present resistance levels of $1.20 and $1.60, stating that a break at these levels might spark at least a 400% price surge. Longer-term forecasts indicate that ADA might rise to $4.80, $7.70, or even $10 during the current market cycle, potentially reaching a market valuation of $370 billion. Adding to the euphoria, technical analysis shows that an ascending triangle has formed on ADA's chart—a typical bullish indicator—with a short-term target of $1.50 in the coming weeks. While ADA remains far from its all-time high of $3.16, whale activity during consolidations and profit-taking during surges indicate a planned approach that could fuel a long-term gain. With ADA expected to reach $6 by mid-2025, investors are closely monitoring recent whale movements as a possible precursor to another dramatic price spike. Rexas Finance (RXS): Is This the Next Big Opportunity? While Cardano's potential upside garners news, Rexas Finance , an upstart blockchain project, is making waves with its novel approach to real-world asset tokenization. Rexas Finance wants to use blockchain technology to revolutionize asset ownership and management by tokenizing real and digital assets, allowing for fractional ownership and increased liquidity. Rexas Finance's ambitious ecosystem offers several interesting features. The Rexas Token Builder supports standards, including ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, and lets users create digital tokens and NFTs without prior coding experience. It simplifies tokenization for various applications, including loyalty programs and creative projects. Meanwhile, the QuickMint Bot, which integrates with platforms such as Telegram and Discord, allows for fast token production on smartphones, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. The platform also includes Rexas GenAI, an AI-powered NFT creation tool that creates customizable digital artwork, and Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield optimizer that automates compounding yields on cryptocurrency deposits across networks such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. Furthermore, Rexas AI Shield provides smart contract security through AI-driven audits and real-time monitoring, while Rexas Launchpad assists blockchain firms with funding, token distribution, and marketing. The project's potential is further emphasized by its strong presale results. Rexas Finance has successfully concluded its ninth presale round, surpassing its target by raising $28.50 million and selling 347 million tokens. RXS tokens are now priced at $0.15 and are expected to list at $0.20 once the presale ends. Analysts expect RXS to climb dramatically after listing, mimicking the spectacular growth observed in ventures such as Solana, which rallied from under $1 listing price to $259 within a year. A Certik audit strengthens Rexas Finance's credibility, providing investors with an additional layer of trust. The team intends to list RXS on at least three of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, boosting liquidity and market access. The project also runs a $1 million giveaway to increase community engagement, with 20 top winners each set to receive $50,000 worth of RXS. With a market scope that includes real estate, commodities, financial assets, and art, Rexas Finance's tokenization network reaches multitrillion-dollar marketplaces. This makes it a serious competitor in the blockchain scene, as it allows investors to participate in a transforming project with notable upside potential. Conclusion A rise in whale activity and bullish Cardano technical signs suggest a massive jump, with a 400% rally to a new all-time high not off the equation. As the bull cycle steams, ADA is among the top-watch cryptos. Similarly, Rexas Finance presents an appealing prospect for investors seeking exposure to a project at the forefront of blockchain innovation. With its user-friendly tools, broad ecosystem, and good presale performance, Rexas Finance is well-positioned to take considerable market share and produce substantial profits in the coming months.

37798991,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/4-coins-that-will-make-investors-super-rich-in-2025-why-ethereum-eth-wont-be-one-of-them,1734526462,4 Coins That Will Make Investors Super Rich in 2025: Why Ethereum (ETH) Won’t Be One of Them,"Ethereum (ETH), for many years, has been celebrated as the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency environment; it hosts a plethora of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi) services, and markets for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and its cure dominance has made it a key figure of the blockchain world. However, as we approach 2025, Ethereum's scalability limits, hefty gas fees, and growing competitiveness may need to improve its capacity to provide the kind of rapid returns investors are looking for. Although Ethereum will surely continue to be a big participant, other rising stars in the cryptocurrency field could overwhelm its potential for large gains. Here are four coins ready to make investors extremely wealthy in 2025, relegating Ethereum to the rearview mirror. Rexas Finance (RXS): Digital Wealth Made From Real-World Assets By allowing the tokenizing of actual assets (RWA), Rexas Finance is transforming the crypto market. Previously restricted for institutional players, this creative strategy lets regular investors partially own valuable assets including real estate, commodities, and businesses. Rexas Finance presents a range of strong tools over its whole ecosystem: A flawless platform for tokenizing actual assets is Rexas Token Builder. Rexas Launchpad: A safe area for token sales and supporting fresh ideas. Rexas GenAI is a creative tool enabling consumers to create NFT artwork easily. Tools meant for decentralized trading and yield optimization are Rexas DeFi and Treasury. Based on Rexas Finance's CertiK smart contract audit, security and openness are pillar stones of its platform. With its $1 million giveaway, where 20 lucky winners stand a chance to win $50,000 worth of RXS tokens each and avoid venture capital funding, among other community-first initiatives, the company has developed a dedicated investor base. With $27,834,764 raised in Stage 10—where tokens are sold for $0.15 apiece—the presale result is equally amazing. Early investors could enjoy more than 500% gains, given an expected listing price of $0.75. Rexas Finance is among the best investment prospects for 2025 based on its ecosystem and anticipated exchange listings. Polygon (POL): Respecting Ethereum's Future Polygon (POL) is a top choice, while Ethereum battles scalability and expensive transaction fees. Polygon, a Layer 2 scaling system, greatly lowers gas fees and speeds transactions, hence improving Ethereum's capabilities. This makes it essential in the continuing growth of dApps and DeFi initiatives. With a market cap of $1.60 billion and trading at $0.6879, Polygon is still inexpensive in relation to its use. Cooperation with multinational behemoths like Meta and Disney helps to increase its acceptance even more. Analysts estimate Polygon may experience a 2,200% return by 2025 driven by its growing ecology and rising acceptance. Polygon is an excellent candidate for investors seeking a project addressing Ethereum's flaws while profiting from its expansion. Solana (SOL): The Fastest Blockchain Possible Experts claim Solana (SOL) to be one of the fastest blockchains. It is also relatively cheap, considering the costs associated with using it. It’s not surprising that Solana (SOL) is becoming widely used, as it can support hundreds of transactions within a single second. Solana has become the first choice among developers who are looking for high-speed performance. Solana's flourishing economy of DeFi spans DEXs, trading, and various other implementations of blockchain technologies. It makes an average of around $223.31 and has a $106.13 billion capitalization. Solana is on the verge of massive growth as its technology is developed and investments are completed. Analysts estimate a 1,000x return by 2025 for individuals looking for significant returns, thereby presenting a high-potential investment. Shiba Inu (SHIB) from Utility Powerhouse to Meme Coin Shiba Inu (SHIB), first dismissed as a joke, has changed remarkably. With the Shibaverse metaverse and sites like ShibaSwap for NFT trading, SHIB today has actual value and a strong ecosystem. Retail investors still find SHIB to be rather easily accessible at its present price of $0.0000277. Driven by an aggressive token-burning mechanism, the project's deflationary tokenomics seek to progressively lower supply and increase value. Early adopters would benefit greatly from SHIB, which analysts project might reach $0.001 by 2025. Shiba Inu is an underdog worth seeing because of its capacity for reinventions and delivery of concrete use cases. Why Ethereum Isn't Among Them Although Ethereum is still the pillar of the blockchain ecosystem, several important elements limit its explosive expansion: Though the Ethereum 2.0 update to proof-of-stake addresses congestion and high gas prices, the network's appeal for smaller transactions is limited. Layer 2 solutions like Polygon and other blockchains like Solana solve Ethereum's flaws, therefore drawing developers and users away. Ethereum's valuation offers limited space for the exponential expansion witnessed in smaller, developing companies, given a market capitalization of about $500 billion. Ethereum's leadership prioritizes decentralization and security over fast scalability, which could turn off profit-driven investors. Ethereum will always be a major participant in the blockchain scene, but faster, less expensive rivals may eclipse its potential for outsized gains. Conclusion As the crypto market develops, there are many chances for those ready to go outside Ethereum. By tackling important market demands and providing creative ideas, Rexas Finance (RXS), Polygon (POL), Solana (SOL), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are positioned to provide large returns. Although Ethereum's contributions to the blockchain ecosystem are indisputable, its growth potential might be behind those of these rising powerhouses. These four coins show some of the most interesting prospects for investors looking for the next big thing in 2025.

Analysts stated that the declines that may occur in 2025 will be short and mild due to increasing institutional demand, and that the Bitcoin price will be volatile in the first quarter. “Our expectation is that Bitcoin could reach $145,000 by mid-2025, but if the conditions are right, the BTC price could potentially rise to $200,000. “Moreover, any correction in 2025 will be milder and shorter, thanks to institutional inflows.” Bitfinex analysts also offered different scenarios and price predictions for the BTC price. At this point, the analysts also added that if Bitcoin mirrors the 2021 cycle and shows an increase of about 40 percent above its moving averages, it could potentially reach as high as $339,000 this cycle. “In a less likely scenario, such as a repeat of the 2017 cycle with similar declining BTC returns, Bitcoin could peak around $290,000 in early 2026,” the analysts wrote, although this is unlikely. Bitcoin has retreated ahead of today's Fed decision and is trading at $103,700 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice.

37798815,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/how-solanas-ecosystem-growth-is-creating-new-opportunities-for-entrepreneurs-and-startups,1734526091,How Solana’s Ecosystem Growth is Creating New Opportunities for Entrepreneurs and Startups,"Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that has been gaining tremendous momentum in the past year. With its unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus algorithm and lightning-fast transaction speeds, Solana has quickly become a top choice for developers and entrepreneurs looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). This high level of interest in Solana has also attracted significant investments from major players in the industry, making it a formidable competitor to other blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Polkadot. One such investment is from Lightchain AI (LCAI) , an innovative revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) through its decentralized platform. In this article, we will explore how Solana's ecosystem growth is creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs and startups, including how it is driving competition and innovation in the emerging field of decentralized technologies. Overview Of Solana's Ecosystem Growth Solana's ecosystem has experienced significant growth, marked by increased developer activity, strategic partnerships, and rising on-chain metrics. As of Q4 2023, Solana hosts approximately 3,300 active developers, reflecting a tenfold increase since 2020. This expansion is supported by initiatives like hackathons and educational bootcamps. Strategic collaborations with financial giants such as PayPal and Stripe have enhanced Solana's credibility and adoption. PayPal's integration of its PYUSD stablecoin and Stripe's support for Solana payments underscore the network's scalability and low transaction fees. On-chain activity has also surged, with Solana's Chain GDP reaching over $300 million in October 2024, indicating robust revenue generation within its ecosystem. Additionally, Solana's total value locked (TVL) has surpassed $6 billion, reflecting growing confidence in its DeFi platforms. These developments position Solana as a formidable player in the blockchain space, attracting developers, institutional partners, and users alike. How Solana is Attracting Entrepreneurs and Startups Solana actively attracts entrepreneurs and startups through a multifaceted approach that includes funding, mentorship, and technical support. The Solana Foundation's Funding Program connects builders to appropriate funding sources, offering grants for projects that contribute public goods to the ecosystem. Colosseum, a key player in this ecosystem, has secured a $60 million fund to support early-stage startups. It organizes online hackathons and a five-week accelerator program, providing $250,000 in pre-seed investments to selected projects. This initiative has been instrumental in attracting developers and entrepreneurs to build on Solana.

The popular meme coin now trades at $0.41, showing an upward move and promising strong potential for 2025. On the other hand, one new viral presale called Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is making waves after it recently sold out early in Stage 1. On the other hand, Floki Inu (FLOKI) is losing ground as investors move their focus to potentially more lucrative chances. Dogecoin Reflects Past Bullish Phenomenon Dogecoin has been highly resilient for its part, gaining 8.84% this month. Now, DOGE price stands at $0.41, with analysts looking forward to a push towards $0.50 within the next few weeks. Combine this summer with historical bullish behaviour in past bull markets, during which DOGE rose to new heights. 1-month Dogecoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The strength of the doge community and its growing adoption continue to fuel momentum for DOGE price, as seen in its recent rally. There will also be an increase in social media activity with mentions and hype around the meme coin. Experts think that if its trend continues, Dogecoin’s price can reach $1 by 2025. Dogecoin’s retracement is impressive, but not the only one grabbing the spotlight. Another recent contender, Yeti Ouro, is already stealing the spotlight from investors with the record-breaking presale results. Stage 1 Of Yeti Ouro Sells Out In Crazy-Quick Time A leading contender among the most promising altcoins of 2024 is Yeti Ouro. The best thing about this viral token is merging gaming utility into the meme coin fun. Investors are rushing into Yeti Ouro for its fundamental strengths and room for massive growth. Here are the reasons Yeti Ouro is dominating the game: Stage 1 of Yeti Ouro’s presale sold out in record time, raising over $1.2 million. Gaming Ecosystem: Yeti Ouro fuels Yeti Go, a P2E racing game with intense PvP action, rewards, and staking. The mechanics of the game generate significant demand for YETIO tokens. Analysts forecast Yeti Ouro’s potential high returns similar to Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. As adoption grows, early buyers speculate 100x increase. Tokenomics: YETIO ensures scarcity with a fixed supply of 1 billion tokens and a token burn mechanism, which can further push the price upwards. Investors have been scrambling to get in on Stage 2 of the presale before the price spikes again. Features that Back Yeti Ouro and Its Momentum, Showing Its Potential to Beat Many Established Meme Coins Floki Inu Faces Challenges Floki Inu (FLOKI) is yet another highly sought-after meme coin, which still needs to have the stride to catch up with meme coin giants Dogecoin and Yeti Ouro. Unlike its competitors, FLOKI has remained stagnant despite its strong branding and community. 1-month Floki price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Floki’s ecosystem features projects such as Valhalla (a metaverse game) and staking options, but it cannot seem to replicate the Yeti Ouro hype. This should come as a strong catalyst for FLOKI, something analysts say is needed to restore investor confidence and bring in new interest. For now, Yeti Ouro remains in the spotlight due to its explosive potential for growth, thanks to gaming AND utility, which puts it in a premier position in the competitive arena of meme coins. Why Yeti Ouro Is Deserving The Crown The success of Yeti Ouro lies in its implementation of the P2E (play-to-earn) model for genuine use cases and its exciting tokenomics. Unlike traditional meme coins, like Shiba or Doge, Yeti Ouro has a dual appeal, targeting gamers and crypto investors alike, which bodes well for long-term growth. As Stage 2 of the presale has gone live, investors are racing to buy YETIO tokens before prices rocket. Yeti Ouro like early-stage opportunities before it has traditionally provided massive returns for those interested in high-growth opportunities.

37800441,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52491,1734525767,Expert Says XRP Holders Have No Idea What Is Coming. Here’s why,"With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, the XRP ecosystem is poised to witness significant improvements in transaction efficiency and liquidity. Crypto analyst Brett recently emphasized its impact, highlighting the potential transformation RLUSD brings to XRP. Here is an in-depth breakdown of RLUSD’s utility, its role as a stable medium, and how it could reshape the institutional adoption of XRP . RLUSD as a Stable Medium Traditionally, institutions purchasing XRP for large-scale transactions rely on fiat currencies such as USD. However, fiat currency volatility during the transaction process can create inefficiencies, particularly for high-volume purchases. RLUSD aims to solve this issue by serving as a stable, reliable medium of exchange. RLUSD eliminates volatility during purchases, ensuring seamless and uninterrupted large-scale acquisition of XRP. As it is pegged to the US dollar, institutions can execute transactions without concerns about sudden price fluctuations during settlement. This stability ensures institutions can confidently use XRP for their payments without unnecessary risk. Clearing the Order Book A notable benefit of RLUSD is its ability to streamline large buy orders for XRP on exchanges. Institutions or banks can utilize RLUSD to place substantial orders, which systematically clear sell orders from the order book. This process forces the XRP price to rise, as cheaper orders are exhausted and only higher-priced orders remain. For example, if an institution uses RLUSD to purchase XRP, the initial orders at lower prices ($0.50, $1.00) are quickly consumed. As liquidity at these levels diminishes, the price increases, reflecting a new baseline. This behavior can lead to rapid price appreciation, benefiting XRP holders and creating positive market momentum. Feedback Loop and Institutional Efficiency RLUSD further accelerates the feedback loop of institutional transactions. By eliminating inefficiencies seen in traditional fiat pair purchases (e.g., USD/XRP), the process becomes faster, more reliable, and more scalable. Institutions that rely on XRP for cross-border payments or settlements can capitalize on this speed advantage. Moreover, as XRP’s price rises due to consistent demand and reduced liquidity, institutions may continue using it for cost-effective payments. XRP’s core utility as a fast and low-cost settlement option becomes increasingly attractive, enhancing its adoption. Scenario of RLUSD in Action To understand RLUSD’s role, consider the following scenario: Initial Setup: A bank deposits $1 billion into RLUSD. This stablecoin is stored in Ripple-supported wallets or exchanges, ready for immediate use. Buying XRP: Using RLUSD, the bank purchases XRP on an exchange. Suppose the order book includes: 100,000 XRP at $0.50, 50,000 XRP at $1.00 and 20,000 XRP at $5.00, the $1 billion buy order clears all the cheaper sell orders, causing the price of XRP to rise into the $5.00 range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Escalation: Following the large purchase, XRP’s price jumps significantly. With low-priced sell orders exhausted, a higher price baseline is established. Ongoing Utility: Institutions use the acquired XRP for international payments. RLUSD continues acting as the intermediary for efficient and repeatable processes. Why RLUSD Matters The launch of RLUSD offers three critical advantages that could reshape XRP adoption: Faster Transactions: By reducing reliance on fiat pairs, RLUSD minimizes the time needed to convert and settle transactions, offering greater efficiency for institutional buyers. Improved Liquidity: RLUSD’s stability can enhance market liquidity, enabling large XRP purchases without unnecessary delays or volatility. This improved liquidity benefits both institutions and retail traders. Reduced Volatility: Because RLUSD is pegged to the US dollar, it shields institutions from fiat currency fluctuations. The stablecoin’s design ensures predictable and consistent XRP purchases. Crypto analyst Brett’s excitement reflects the potential impact of RLUSD, as it addresses critical challenges in XRP adoption. With its stability and efficiency, RLUSD could significantly boost demand for XRP, benefiting institutional users and retail investors.

With Bitcoin surging to an all-time high of $100,000, the government’s crypto stash is now worth over $620 million as of press time. This was a striking reversal of fortune for President Nayib Bukele, who made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021 and faced relentless criticism for it. however, while he’s flexing his profits on X, El Salvador’s economy is facing a grim reckoning. Trump’s immigration policies could send tens of thousands of Salvadorans back home, threatening remittance flows and straining an already struggling job market. Nayib’s administration is walking a tightrope, balancing the benefits of Bitcoin with the economic realities on the ground. Screenshot of El Salvdor’s Bitcoin holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence Nayib has many wins under his belt. For instance, the gangs that preyed on farmers, extorting money or looting supplies, have either been jailed, killed, or fled under his iron-fisted security crackdown. Yet, despite the newfound peace, the economic boom locals hoped for is nowhere to be found. “We’re not really seeing the peace dividend in terms of a rebound in economic activity,” Mauricio Choussy, a former central bank president, reportedly said . The harsh truth is that even with security improvements, El Salvador’s economy remains one of the weakest in the region. Bitcoin’s rise amid economic stagnation El Salvador’s Bitcoin gamble seemed absurd to many when it was launched. Nayib poured millions into buying Bitcoin, built a $200 million trust fund to stabilize its value, and incentivized businesses to accept it. Critics at home and abroad criticized the move, saying it was reckless and would bankrupt the country. But Trump’s pro-crypto stance and the appointment of a crypto-friendly U.S. securities regulator have turbocharged the market. Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally has been a lifeline for Nayib, whose Bitcoin reserves are now one of the government’s few success stories. A comparison of El Salvador’s economy with Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Source: IMF Yet, since he took office in 2019, El Salvador’s GDP growth has lagged behind neighbors, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Honduras, a long-time economic underperformer, surpassed El Salvador’s GDP last year for the first time in more than 30 years. “The economy is this government’s Achilles’ heel,” said Choussy. An estimated 750,000 Salvadorans live undocumented in the U.S., and their remittances account for over 20% of El Salvador’s GDP. If Trump follows through on his promises to deport undocumented immigrants, the effects back home would be catastrophic. Nayib’s economic team is already bracing for impact. An IMF deal worth $1.4 billion, currently in the works, will likely require public-sector layoffs, potentially leaving returning deportees to compete for scarce jobs. El Salvador’s security facing threats? Nayib’s iron grip on security has undeniably transformed El Salvador. The country, once dubbed the murder capital of the world, now boasts a homicide rate of just 1.9 per 100,000 people—lower than Canada’s. This has actually brought some wins to the economy. The IMF said El Salvador’s economy will grow by 3% in 2024. That’s better than the 2% average for Latin America and the Caribbean. The Central Reserve Bank (BCR) agrees and expects growth between 3% and 3.5%. In 2023, the economy grew 3.5%, thanks to public investment, private spending, and stronger exports. But his successes mask deep structural problems. In rural areas, roads are unpaved, illiteracy is rampant, and access to credit is almost non-existent. Tropical Storm Sara destroyed much of the coffee harvest in Tepecoyo, forcing farmers to sell at generic prices instead of the premium rates usually fetched by Salvadoran coffee. The housing market boom, fueled by Salvadorans returning from the U.S., has brought some relief. A four-bedroom apartment with an ocean view costs $385,000—affordable for Salvadorans who built wealth abroad but unattainable for locals. Construction companies call it the biggest housing boom since the civil war ended in 1992. However, while housing thrives, other industries struggle. The textile and apparel sector, El Salvador’s largest export industry, faces fierce competition from Asia, leaving factories empty and workers jobless.

37802450,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105548,1734525597,Analyst Identifies Promising Signs for Shiba Inu to Surge to $0.000070 Soon,"While Shiba Inu (SHIB) price actions continue to underwhelm holders, technical indicators suggest that a bullish trend is forming, with promising prospects. Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00002574, reflecting a 5% decline over the past week, with its monthly performance showing a modest 1.1% gain.Meanwhile, market analyst Klejdi Cuni on TradingView recently highlighted a bullish pattern on Shiba Inu's chart. Cuni acknowledged that SHIB has lagged behind other meme coins and altcoins during recent market surges. However, he now believes SHIB’s price action may be poised to catch up.Promising Signs on SHIB Daily ChartFirst, Cuni noted that the outlook for Shiba Inu remains promising when examined on the daily chart. He pointed out that since the trend reversal in September, Shiba Inu’s price has followed an upward trajectory marked by higher highs, forming an oval pattern on the daily timeframe. ""This steady rise indicates a clear bullish pattern,"" he said.Additionally, Cuni noted that Shiba Inu has established strong support around the $0.00002424 level, a zone that has held firm for about a month. In his view, this suggests significant accumulation is ongoing, and the period of consolidation could set the stage for a breakout in the coming months.Shiba Inu Price Targets Upon Break OutAccording to Cuni’s chart, Shiba Inu's price could reach several key targets if a breakout occurs. The first target is $0.00003232, representing a 25.6% increase from its current price.Cuni also highlighted the $0.00004 region, which SHIB lost ten months ago, as a key level to watch. Specifically, if Shiba Inu hits the $0.00004167 mark, it would have surged by 61.6% from its current level.The third target is $0.00005675, signaling a potential gain of 120.4% from the current price. Shiba Inu last saw this level in 2021.Finally, looking ahead to the first half of 2025, Cuni's most optimistic outlook for Shiba Inu is $0.00007012, bringing the asset near its all-time high. If SHIB reaches this target, it would have skyrocketed by 172.5% from its current price.

Notably, this would amount to around an 18X return for current holders. This analyst cited a bullish cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart as the foundation for this bold sentiment.Meanwhile, one analyst has warned of a crash to $0.000011 should the Shiba Inu bullish breakout fail.",POSITIVE,SHIB,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/analyst-identifies-promising-signs-for-shiba-inu-to-surge-to-0-000070-soon/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-identifies-promising-signs-for-shiba-inu-to-surge-to-0-000070-soon,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37798466,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/cardano-millionaire-believes-this-ada-rival-under-1-will-hit-21-within-8-weeks,1734525421,Cardano Millionaire Believes This ADA Rival Under $1 Will Hit $21 Within 8 Weeks.,"Few cryptocurrency presale events like Rexas Finance (RXS) have created a buzz. Already showing an impressive 400% increase in its presale, the project will likely significantly influence the blockchain ecosystem. One of the most exciting investments for early-stage buyers, according to a Cardano millionaire with a $6.2 million portfolio, Rexas Finance might explode to $21 in the next 8 weeks. RXS has shown its optimistic promise within the last few weeks, rising from $0.030 at Stage 1 to $0.15 at Stage 10. Not only hopeful, the ADA millionaire is all in, having been closely observing the presale's development, and has sold off $520,000 worth of ADA to buy RXS; he has put his trust in Rexas Finance since its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization and blockchain technology seems to produce rapid expansion. Why the ADA Millionaire Believes RXS Will Reach $21? The ADA millionaire's estimate of a 13,900% price rise for RXS within the next eight weeks is not unfounded. His trust in the project has strong justifications based on the underlying technology, market need, and its original tokenizing method. Rexas Finance presents an opportunity to democratize access to wealth-building assets, empowering everyone to make investments once reserved for the wealthy. Anyone with an internet connection can participate in the global economy with Rexas Finance, regardless of their desired investment—a fraction of a building or a portion of a famous painting. Rexas Finance’s Impressive Presale Progress Rexas Finance has already shown promise, seeing a spectacular 400% rise in its presale price from $0.030 at Stage 1 to $0.15 at Stage 10. This boom shows investors are thrilled about the technology and the chances for enormous gains. RXS's price will rise much more as the presale approaches its last phases. Before arriving at its launch price of $0.2 at the debut on top-tier exchanges in early 2025, the presale is predicted to climb by 35%. 346,469,125 RXS tokens have already sold at the time of writing, raising an impressive $28,095,711. Purchasers currently at $0.15 would immediately get a return on investment should the price increase. Rexas Finance stands out for its community-first approach, among other things. Unlike many initiatives that depend on venture capital financing, Rexas Finance has developed its momentum independently of outside investors. Instead, it has gathered a devoted collection of private investors believing in the platform's goal. Moreover, Rexas Finance's success is wider than its technology; it already has excellent market exposure. Two of the most reliable sites in the cryptocurrency space, CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko, have listed the project; they provide real-time tracking and all the data required to equip possible investors with the knowledge they need to make wise selections. Although security is always a worry in the cryptocurrency scene, Rexas Finance has exceeded expectations to guarantee the dependability of its platform. Following a Certik assessment, the project shows its dedication to openness and dependability, which adds another level of security. Certik is among the most reputable brands in the auditing field; hence, having their seal of approval lends the project credibility. Rexas Finance is running a $1 million giveaway with 20 lucky winners getting $50,000 worth of RXS for individuals wishing to raise their chances of success even further. Having 525,679 entries at the time of writing, this offer is a great chance to raise awareness of RXS tokens before the presale concludes. A Strong Future for RXS and Rexas Finance Rexas Finance and the native token, RXS, have great potential. With 1 billion RXS tokens and the likelihood of broad acceptance in sectors worth trillions of dollars, the skies are the limit for this innovative platform. As the Cardano millionaire advises, the token's value may change as Rexas Finance develops, approaching $21. Rexas Finance is a revolution in how we consider asset ownership and investing, not only another cryptocurrency initiative with its community-driven approach, safe infrastructure, and creative technologies. Now is the opportunity to enter while RXS is still under $1; the presale is fast nearing its latter phases. Rexas Finance has a promising future; those who act now could profit from its fantastic expansion in the following weeks.

Frustrated DOGE Holders Eye Viral Utility Altcoin for 34,050% Upside appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to spark a meme rally despite strong community backing and 4.9 Billion whale activity this week. The sellers continue to dominate the dog-themed memecoin as capital rotates into Bitcoin (BTC) this week, with its price nearing the $110K milestone after the Fed Rate Cut announcement on December 18. DOGE has failed to trigger a bullish comeback amid the broader meme coin segment facing selling pressures. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange emerges as a solid investment for frustrated Dogecoin holders, seeking skyrocketing gains in the ongoing bullish cycle through utility altcoins. In this write-up, we’ll see why Dogecoin (DOGE) has failed to display a bullish breakout and how DTX Exchange (DTX) steals the spotlight as the hottest coin to buy amid the market downturn. Dogecoin (DOGE) Fails to Breakout From The $0.40 Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) trend disappoints its holders as another breakout attempt from the $0.39 support level appears to fail. As analysts closely monitor the 50-day moving average, the DOGE price struggles to display enough buying pressures amid a significant drop in the trading volume from $10 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap While reduced speculative activity has slightly eased sell-off risks, it has done little to spark a bullish momentum for the frustrated investors. Since the 69% node hack news sparked panic among the DOGE community, Dogecoin charts show a very weak trading activity, hinting at a short-term stagnation. Adding to the uncertainty, recent whale activity involving $160 million worth of DOGE accumulation has not expectedly boosted the memecoin. Instead, many experts see the lack of a strong breakout as an indicator that Dogecoin may continue to trail behind other altcoins in the short term despite Elon Musk’s support on X. DTX Exchange Attracts Utility Investors With Its 34,000% Upside DTX Exchange (DTX) has gained recognition as an innovative trading platform, offering an all-in-one trading strategy with features like 1000x leverage. With access to over 120,000 digital assets across a wide range of financial markets, including cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and CFDs—the platform guarantees gas-free transactions and lightning-fast execution speeds through its first-ever hybrid layer-1 blockchain. Designed for global traders, DTX Exchange provides ease of use with its sleek modern UI, supported by advanced risk management tools and cutting-edge technologies like quant and algo trading. The platform prioritizes security with decentralized features, attracting huge investments from utility lovers for its $10.2M stage 6 presale. What truly sets DTX Exchange apart is its comprehensive suite of trading mechanisms, including advanced automation and real-time analytics, DTX tokens are currently available for just $0.12 with the price expected to surge 34000% after the 2025 listing. Experts say that now is the optimal time to invest early in the DTX presale before its value rises significantly after the live trading announcement. Conclusion Despite Dogecoin’s (DOGE) potential for a memecoin revival, its struggle to break key resistance levels and the recent stagnation in market activity signal a challenging road ahead for DOGE holders. In contrast, DTX Exchange (DTX) presents a compelling alternative for traders seeking high-growth opportunities. With its innovative trading features and cutting-edge technology, DTX is well-positioned for explosive gains in the coming years, particularly after its upcoming listing in 2025. As the market shifts toward utility tokens, DTX Exchange stands out as a prime candidate for those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto innovation and long-term profitability.

Meanwhile, this sudden rise follows the global launch of Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. As a result, XRP’s market cap now stands at $147 billion, surpassing USDT’s market cap of $140.5 billion. RLUSD Launch Skyrocket XRP Price On December 17, 2024, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, went live, sparking excitement in the crypto community and driving a 15% surge in XRP’s price. RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar and is designed to improve liquidity and trust in institutional payments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that RLUSD will be available on platforms like Uphold, MoonPay, and Bitso. The stablecoin will also be launched on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchain, ensuring broad accessibility. An enterprise-grade stablecoin for everyone. Ripple USD ($RLUSD) drops tomorrow on @UpholdInc , @MoonPay , @CoinMENA , @ArchaxEx and @Bitso , with @bullish , @mercadobitcoin , @ZeroHashX , @indepreserve , and @Bitstamp soon to follow. https://t.co/k3DrWO4PXA — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 16, 2024 However, some analysts predict that RLUSD’s market cap could surpass $1 billion early on, further strengthening its position within Ripple’s ecosystem. XRP ETF Incoming Soon! Alongside the RLUSD project, Ripple is also working on launching exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for XRP, aiming to attract traditional investors.

Gary Gensler has already announced he will resign on January 20, 2025. However, many believe that with new leadership, Ripple could see a more positive outcome in SEC lawsuits, potentially leading to a settlement or the case being dropped. XRP Eye Big Target: $5 to $8 Following the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, XRP saw a 15% surge in just 24 hours, reaching $2.70, and a 22% increase over the week. Whale activity has also grown, with over 830 million XRP purchased in the last day, showing strong confidence in the market. Analysts believe it’s important for XRP to stay above $2.52, with the potential to reach $5.85 or even $8.76. However, experts like Natalie Dormer and Impulsive Dom expect a short period of stability, followed by a potential rise to $4 or $5. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Binance said Wednesday that it was delisting WazirX’s WRX, along with Kaon (AKRO) and Bluzelle (BLZ), as part of a regular review of tokens that no longer meet its offering standards.  Delisting a token from major exchanges is often perceived as a lack of confidence in the token's viability or future, triggering a negative market sentiment around the affected token. Prices of AKRO and BLZ fell as much as 40% after the announcement, but WRX was the hardest hit.  WRX token exchange hands at 10 cents as of Wednesday, down 98% from a 2021 peak above $5.  The delisting is another blow for the once-darling Indian exchange WazirX. It was the biggest exchange in India by volumes and popularity before a $230 million hack in July, accounting for over 45% of the total user assets reserves cited by the exchange in a June report. The exchange has since filed for a restructuring process in Singapore to clear its liabilities.  The hacker laundered all the stolen funds to various addresses using Tornado Cash to obscure the transactions, as CoinDesk reported in September, further dampening hopes of a full recovery.  WazirX, still reeling from the financial and reputational damage, has worked to recover the funds with limited success. It has faced criticism for its handling of the crisis, especially concerning user communication and fund recovery processes.  The exchange is making various efforts to restart operations. The company said in a Wednesday post it plans to restart the business and launch a decentralized exchange, intending to keep the brand alive.  “We are gearing up for a fresh start with enhanced services and a recovery-driven approach for Scheme Creditors,” the company said on X. “Following Scheme approval (subject to legal and regulatory requirements), we plan to reopen the WazirX platform and launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) with innovative features to enhance user experience and provide a more robust platform.  That came a day after WazirX floated the concept of recovery tokens (RTs), which are proposed as a mechanism to compensate users for losses the hack.  These tokens will be airdropped to creditors based on their platform balances, offering recovery through future platform profits, potential buybacks, and trading on open markets, per a post.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/18/wazir-xs-wrx-plunges-60-after-binance-delisting-dampening-hopes-of-a-fresh-start,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82f4c6440c9242808167a395355087b22a389650-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-explode-13000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Each of these cryptocurrencies is making waves in its own unique way, offering solutions to real-world problems in the digital age. Qubetics has already raised over $6.9 million, making it one of the top contenders for your investment portfolio. With its innovative decentralized VPN (dVPN) solution, it’s tackling issues related to user privacy, security risks, and centralized control over data. On the other hand, Algorand has been on a wild ride, with its price recently surging 25%, while HNT is targeting a 30% upside as it continues to build out its decentralized wireless network. But what sets Qubetics apart in this trio? With over 350 million $TICS tokens sold and more than 10,300 token holders, Qubetics is clearly gaining momentum. Let’s dive deeper into each of these exciting projects and see why they are some of the best coins to join for 2025 . Qubetics: Revolutionizing Decentralized VPNs for the Future The digital world we live in today presents a variety of challenges, and one of the most significant is online privacy. Centralized VPN providers have been a staple for securing user data, but they also come with their own set of problems. For one, centralized VPN providers have access to your data, leaving you at risk of privacy breaches. This is where Qubetics steps in. Qubetics offers a decentralized VPN (dVPN) that gives users complete control over their data, ensuring their privacy is maintained at all times. By utilizing blockchain technology, Qubetics eliminates the need for a third-party service, reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing overall security. With Qubetics, users can access a secure network where their privacy is safeguarded against the prying eyes of corporations, hackers, and even governments. Qubetics’ presale has raised over $6.9 million, with tokens selling at $0.0342 each. More than 350 million $TICS tokens have been sold, and the project has already attracted over 10,300 token holders. This shows a growing trust in the platform and its decentralized approach to VPN services. With Qubetics, you’re not just investing in a token—you’re backing a future where individuals have control over their online privacy. The challenges of centralized VPN providers, such as data retention policies and limited transparency, are addressed directly by Qubetics. It is setting the standard for how decentralized solutions should work in the privacy sector. For anyone looking to join one of the best coins to join for 2025 , Qubetics is a clear frontrunner. For more information on this revolutionary project, you can watch this video . Algorand: A 25% Surge, and Still Going Strong Algorand (ALGO) is another powerhouse in the cryptocurrency space, and it’s making a strong case for being one of the best coins to join for 2025. The platform’s unique architecture enables it to offer scalable, secure, and decentralized solutions that are built for real-world adoption. Recently, Algorand saw an impressive 25% surge in just 24 hours, bringing it back into the spotlight. The recent price action of Algorand indicates a healthy upward momentum, with analysts predicting that $0.75 could be the next stop for ALGO. Its ability to process transactions quickly and securely has made it a favorite for developers building decentralized applications (dApps). With its growing ecosystem, Algorand has positioned itself as a key player in the blockchain space. What makes Algorand so attractive is its commitment to solving blockchain’s scalability problem. Unlike other platforms that struggle with transaction speed and high fees, Algorand has built a system that can handle thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. This makes it a suitable platform for enterprises, governments, and developers looking for a high-performance blockchain solution. For those considering the best coins to join for 2025, Algorand offers the perfect blend of performance, security, and real-world use cases. As the platform continues to gain traction, it’s likely to see more widespread adoption, making it a solid choice for investors looking for long-term growth. HNT: Helium’s Wireless Revolution and 30% Upside Potential Helium (HNT) is one of the most exciting projects in the crypto space right now, and it’s one of the best coins to join for 2025. Unlike many cryptocurrencies, Helium is focused on creating a decentralized wireless network that allows anyone to participate and earn rewards by providing coverage. Helium’s innovative approach to building a decentralized network of hotspots is transforming the way we think about connectivity. Recently, Helium has been eyeing a potential 30% upside in its price. Analysts believe that for HNT to break through its resistance levels, it needs to break the $9.80 mark. If it does, we could see a substantial price increase in the coming months. This makes HNT one of the most promising altcoins for 2025, especially if it manages to scale its network and increase its user base. Helium’s network is powered by the community. Anyone can set up a hotspot and earn HNT tokens for providing wireless coverage. This decentralized model is disrupting the traditional telecom industry, allowing individuals to earn passive income while contributing to the growth of the network. With more than 1 million hotspots deployed worldwide, Helium is well on its way to achieving massive scale. As the world continues to move towards a more decentralized internet, Helium’s wireless network has the potential to become a key infrastructure piece in the global connectivity ecosystem. Investors looking for innovative and high-growth opportunities should consider HNT as one of the best coins to join for 2025. Conclusion While Algorand and Helium are both strong contenders in the cryptocurrency space, Qubetics offers a unique solution to the pressing issues of online privacy and security. With its decentralized VPN, Qubetics is helping users take control of their data and protect themselves from the risks associated with centralized services. The project’s strong presale performance and growing community make it a top choice for investors looking for the best coins to join for 2025. As more people become aware of the dangers of centralized VPNs and the risks of data breaches, the demand for decentralized solutions like Qubetics will continue to rise. With over $6.9 million raised and more than 350 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is well on its way to becoming a leader in the dVPN space. For anyone looking to invest in one of the best coins to join for 2025 , Qubetics is a clear frontrunner. Join the future of privacy with Qubetics, and don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of a project that is redefining the way we think about online security.

Analysts suggest this meme-inspired token could outshine its rivals and soar to impressive levels. Speculations swirl over its potential to achieve rapid growth, even as Bitcoin’s next major milestone looms. Could this underdog redefine market expectations before the leader takes center stage? DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN. This meme token is for the real alphas who always win . HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop ! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Dogwifhat (WIF) Battles to Break Resistance Amid Growing Bulls Dogwifhat is trading between $2.38 and $3.52, trying to find direction. The RSI at 51.55 suggests balance, while its price is just below the 10-day moving average of $2.75 and the 100-day average of $2.83. A breakout above $4.19 could lead to a rally toward $5.33, which would mean a rise of over 50%. Failing that, support at $1.91 might be tested. The coin’s 6-month growth of nearly 37% shows potential, but recent dips of 9% and 23% over the last week and month raise questions. Momentum could shift quickly if bulls return. Bonk Price Eyes Breakout Despite Recent Pullback Bonk is trading between $0.00003055 and $0.00004474, holding near its support level of $0.00002431. Its RSI at 49.23 and Stochastic at 16.90 suggest it’s oversold, indicating potential for an upward move. A break above $0.00005269 could push it toward $0.00006687, representing a jump of over 50%. The 10-day and 100-day averages cluster near $0.000036, hinting at consolidation. Despite its 1-week drop of 7.48% and 1-month fall of 23.90%, the 6-month gain of 70.99% shows Bonk has resilience. Watch for bulls to step in if momentum builds above resistance levels. Conclusion DOGEN stands out as the ultimate choice for those pursuing luxury and success. With expected 700% growth by the presale’s end and massive gains during altcoin season, it surpasses short-term potential of BONK and WIF. Following successful peers, DOGEN is building a powerful community of leaders, offering real benefits and aiming for market dominance.

It combines innovation, scalability, and real-world solutions to create something extraordinary. If you’ve been waiting for your next big chance in crypto, this is it. XRP Changed Lives—Why Did People Miss Out? When XRP first launched, few people understood its potential. Early adopters believed in its ability to revolutionise cross-border payments, and they were rewarded as XRP skyrocketed. Those who dismissed XRP as “just another token” missed out on one of the most profitable rides in crypto history. Looking back, the missed opportunity stings. The reality is clear: timing matters. The crypto space rewards those who move fast and act on opportunities. Now, Qubetics presents a similar chance—a chance to join a blockchain revolution and avoid repeating the same mistakes.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitcoin hits $106k, Cardano eyes $5, while Yeti Ouro raises $1.2m, positioning itself as the next breakout altcoin in the P2E market.

This surge is fueled by institutional demand and positive investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) aims for $5 as it gains momentum heading into the new year. Yet, another rising contender, Yeti Ouro (YETIO), has turned heads by raising $1.2 million in stage 1 of its presale, signaling its potential for explosive growth. Bitcoin reaches new heights Bitcoin just won’t quit its rally. Breaking above $106k is a key psychological and technical level for the most prominent cryptocurrency in the world. Analysts cite increased institutional investment, particularly with BlackRock and MicroStrategy buying BTC. 1-month Bitcoin price chart- source: CoinMarketCap According to market data, BTC price has gained 16% in the last month. Over 24 hours, the volume exceeded $96 billion, signaling a vigorous trading activity. Experts expect to see Bitcoin price at $150k in 2025 if the bullish market conditions persist. That success has created optimism for the broader crypto market. The growing momentum of Cardano targets $5 Even Cardano has commanded investor interest. Cardano price currently stands at $1.10, and has gained over 44% this month. This rally is partly fueled by its push for scalability and real-world utility. Over the past couple of months, we have seen the Cardano ecosystem upgrade storage capacity at zero cost to users and launch several projects and DeFi applications. 1-month Cardano price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Analysts predict ADA price will reach $5 as soon as Q1 2025 due to greater adoption and partnerships. Its strong resilience over market cycles makes it appealing to long-term holders. As such, Bitcoin and Cardano rally investors are now searching for other potential break-out tokens. And that is where Yeti Ouro comes into play. Yeti Ouro has stage 1 completed with $1.2m raised A new viral presale token called Yeti Ouro is generating buzz in the crypto community.

Crypto traders speculated on PENGU’s price action post-launch, with one whale losing $1.6 million while another won $4.8 million. Precisely, the Solana whale account ‘ 998FDp…v6Lvc ’ turned a 15,300 SOL investment into around 8,100 SOL worth of PENGUs. According to Lookonchain , the SOL amounts had a nominal value of $3.46 million and $1.83 million, respectively. Yet, the losses are not entirely realized, as the whale still has 13.47 million PENGU valued at around 1,439 SOL or $369,000. As reported , the whale spent 15,300 SOL to buy 65.47 million PENGU. Then, it capitulated by selling 52 million PENGU for 6,661 SOL, worth $1.46 million. 998FDpWVwRcdp6sAStxsjUvPpNWktAB4SjVkYfBv6Lvc – DeFi Activities.

It continues to rule the cryptocurrency field thanks to its strong bullish momentum, which has market watchers wondering if it could soon shatter this record and reach a new all-time high. Reasons Behind the Rise The price surge of Bitcoin has been largely driven by institutional investment, as evidenced by the large purchases of Bitcoin by companies such as MicroStrategy and Riot Platforms, which have increased market confidence. In addition, the inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 stock market Index has further fueled optimism. Take precautions against inflation and economic uncertainty. The state of the economy and politics has also had an impact on the rise of Bitcoin. Speculation over potential federal Bitcoin reserves and inflationary pressures have led to a rise in investments as a hedge against economic instability. Developments in technology and network enhancements. With the help of network improvements and technological breakthroughs, Bitcoin’s technical indicators have demonstrated robust bullish momentum. Analysts anticipate more expansion since higher lows and the development of bullish patterns indicate a long-term upward trend.

37798249,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629660,1734524653,MicroStrategy to pause Bitcoin purchases in January,"A rumor is spreading that MicroStrategy may stop selling stocks and issuing convertible debt in January, cutting off its usual Bitcoin funding sources. If this happens, it would leave many of its investors, who rely on Michael Saylor’s regular Bitcoin purchases, disappointed. The company’s Bitcoin buying spree has become an expectation, but January might be a dry month. The claim came from a venture capitalist who reportedly said, “Saylor has a blackout period all of January — cannot issue any new converts to buy BTC.” Some investors think this rumored pause is tied to insider trading rules. While the SEC doesn’t outright forbid trading by insiders between a quarter’s close and earnings announcements, many companies impose their own blackout periods. These self-imposed blackouts, lasting two to four weeks, aim to avoid suspicions of insider advantage. As we’ve reported in the past, some people are accusing Saylor of manipulating both the stock and crypto market. Others believe this isn’t about insider trading at all. Instead, they link it to MicroStrategy’s recent addition to the NASDAQ 100 on December 23. Changes tied to this inclusion may involve restrictions impacting how and when the company can sell shares or issue convertible debt. Yet another theory focuses on ATM share sales rather than convertible debt. Investors aren’t clear whether the rumored January blackout applies to both funding methods or just one. There’s also confusion about the timeline. MicroStrategy’s earnings call is expected between February 3 and 5, 2025. Blackout periods often begin 30 days before earnings, which could mean the freeze starts in early January. Another possibility is January 14, but the exact dates remain unclear, per the report. MicroStrategy stays firm of Bitcoin in the long-term Right now, MicroStrategy owns 439,000 BTC, valued at around $47 billion, as the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. Their play is simple: make Bitcoin the backbone of their treasury reserve strategy and hold for the long haul. Last week, between December 9 and 15, they bought another 15,350 BTC for $1.5 billion. That’s an average price of $100,386 per Bitcoin. This came right after they spent $2 billion on 21,000 BTC the week before. Altogether, MicroStrategy has invested $27.1 billion into Bitcoin at an average price of $61,725 per coin. MicroStrategy’s stock is riding the Bitcoin wave. Shares have skyrocketed over 546% this year, pushing their market cap close to $100 billion. Though yesterday, their stock closed at $386.42, down about 5.4% for the day, thanks to Bitcoin’s usual price swings. Still, with prices recently breaking $108,000, investor optimism is fueling the company’s value. Right now, MicroStrategy controls about 2.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. They’ve got $7.2 billion in debt, but here’s the kicker—it’s unsecured. No BTC is on the hook as collateral, so creditors can’t force a sell-off even if Bitcoin’s price tanks. Analysts say this setup gives them breathing room, even during downturns, while the rising value of their Bitcoin stash keeps the risk manageable. Michael Saylor isn’t backing down. He’s as bullish as ever, saying he’s ready to buy Bitcoin at $1 million a pop if that’s what it takes. He’s positioning Bitcoin as the ultimate hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Analysts think MicroStrategy will keep issuing equity at high prices to buy more Bitcoin, despite concerns over profitability in their software division. For Saylor, it’s Bitcoin or bust.

37798074,https://crypto.news/?p=14319977,1734524628,Key strategies on how to make DePIN mainstream | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. The web3 ecosystem is a hotbed of innovation, offering bold solutions that promise to decentralize systems and empower individuals. Yet, for all its potential, web3 has yet to become a mainstream phenomenon. Adoption remains slow, hindered by a steep learning curve and significant barriers to entry. You might also like: What DePIN got wrong and how to fix it | Opinion Decentralized physical infrastructure networks —otherwise known as DePINs for short—represent a new frontier in this space, with the potential to transform industries by making infrastructure faster and cheaper to deploy. However, taking DePIN from a niche concept to a widely adopted model requires more than just technology. These insights come from my journey as a founder tackling the challenges of building a DePIN project. Scaling to tens of thousands of users and mapping millions of miles has taught me invaluable lessons about adoption and decentralization—lessons I believe can guide others aiming to make DePIN mainstream. In this article, I explore three pillars for DePIN projects to achieve mainstream adoption: leveraging existing hardware, broadening accessibility, and prioritizing tangible utility. Pilar 1: Maximize existing hardware Building new hardware introduces significant hurdles, such as manufacturing challenges and component shortages, which limit scalability—a crucial factor for global adoption. To gain mainstream traction, DePIN projects must look to existing commodity hardware as a launchpad. Smartphones, with a projected user base of 7.1 billion globally by 2024, present an ideal foundation. Smartphones are not just communication tools; they are powerful mini-computers with advanced sensors, cameras, and connectivity options. This vast network of existing hardware provides an ideal foundation for DePIN projects. For example, the Solana Saga, an Android smartphone designed by Solana Labs, integrates seamlessly with the Solana blockchain, offering a straightforward experience for decentralized applications. However, the approach isn’t limited to blockchain-native devices. At NATIX, we leverage the power of smartphones to create a decentralized camera network without the need for new hardware. Similarly, Silencio uses smartphones to monitor and reduce noise pollution, showcasing how DePIN projects can use smartphones to scale quickly. Pillar 2: Broaden web3 accessibility beyond crypto In the web3 space, we’re accustomed to cryptocurrencies, digital wallets, and decentralized finance. However, a significant portion of the population is not. Many people are unfamiliar with or even unaware of these concepts, creating a barrier to mainstream adoption. To make DePIN projects accessible to everyone, it’s essential to incorporate non-crypto rewards alongside crypto incentives. Integrating gift cards, discounts, or other recognizable perks ensures participation isn’t limited to those already immersed in crypto. Inclusivity doesn’t stop at rewards; it’s also about creating a user experience that feels familiar and intuitive. For instance, offering registration options via email or SMS instead of only wallet-based sign-ups can make it easier for non-crypto users to get started. Projects that combine crypto and non-crypto incentives alongside intuitive design are likely to attract a more diverse audience. By balancing inclusivity with innovation, DePIN can bridge the gap between web3 and the mainstream. Pillar 3: Prioritize utility over token earnings No matter how novel the technology is, a project can only succeed by delivering real value to its users. While tokens may attract initial interest, retention hinges on the project’s ability to provide lasting benefits that enhance daily life. DePIN projects must focus on tangible applications that solve real problems. The goal should not be to create entirely new habits but to improve on existing ones, making it easier to adopt your product. Whether addressing traffic congestion, monitoring air quality, or enhancing data privacy, DePIN projects should prioritize user-centered solutions over speculative tokenomics. Addressing the challenges: Scalability and retention While leveraging existing hardware and broadening accessibility offers a pathway to scale, challenges remain. One lesson we learned at NATIX is that smartphone-based DePIN models, for example, often struggle with lower user retention compared to hardware solutions that operate passively. Nevertheless, if done right (e.g. by leveraging gamification, offering utility for the users, etc.), it can become a hyper-scalable way of building infrastructure. Combining increased utility with a gamified user experience worked wonders for projects like Silencio and NATIX, increasing retention rates and opening a new avenue for smartphone-based DePIN innovation. At the same time, scaling infrastructure requires strategic partnerships and community involvement. Collaborating with local organizations or municipalities can help integrate DePIN projects into broader ecosystems, reinforcing their value and adoption. Building DePIN for the mainstream Just as the iPhone revolutionized the way we think about and use mobile technology, well-thought DePIN models can transform how we interact with the physical world, making decentralization not just a concept, but a daily experience for billions. The journey to mainstream adoption for DePIN and web3 as a whole is not about flashy technology or complex innovations that only a select few can understand. It’s about taking what already exists—whether that’s smartphones, user habits, or everyday problems—and making it better, more accessible, and more valuable through the power of crypto and decentralization. By aligning technological vision with practical user needs, we can bring DePIN—and web3—to the mainstream.

The collaboration is set to build a unified global blockchain ecosystem to abet innovation and talent exchange between India and the UAE. It will also provide Indian blockchain companies with easy entry into the UAE market through RAK DAO’s ecosystem of over 400 companies, in addition to its legal and regulatory framework. On the other hand, IBA’s extensive network and domain knowledge of the blockchain landscape in India has over 115 million crypto users, and a booming startup ecosystem will be available for UAE-based companies. IBA’s founder, Mr. Raj Kapoor , says the company is trying to bridge the environmental , social, and governance deficit on blockchain, encouraging sustainable practices and responsible innovation. Their emphasis on transparency and decentralized governance harmonizes developments in the blockchain industry with ESG requirements, providing ethical and sustainable growth. In a direct message to crypto.news, Kapoor said: “We are observing how such frameworks are leveraged, their impact, and how these best practices could be adopted at a national level. This partnership aims to foster meaningful policy transformation back home.” Kapoor emphasized the need to optimize existing structures, consume less energy for blockchain work, and make sure technological advances are in line with sustainability goals. He noted that innovative technologies like blockchain contribute toward transparency and ethically sourced products in industries like agriculture, fashion, and electronics. This allows strict adherence to ESG regulations to be tracked in real time with blockchain-based certificates.

Led by Republican House Leader Derek Merrin, the bill enables the state treasury to diversify assets by purchasing Bitcoin. Citing concerns over the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, the measure positions Bitcoin as a hedge and financial opportunity. Ohio’s initiative follows similar moves by Pennsylvania and Texas, signaling growing state-level adoption. While the current session ends December 31, Merrin plans to reintroduce the bill in 2025, further boosting Bitcoin’s institutional appeal.

Market optimism stems from potential pro-crypto policies under President-elect Donald Trump, alongside growing institutional adoption. The dollar strengthened following strong November retail data, but analysts argue that a rate cut—currently priced at 97%—could ease dollar dominance and drive “risk-on” sentiment in cryptocurrency markets.

37797826,https://crypto.news/?p=14320350,1734524082,Hong Kong pushes forward with stablecoin bill in legislative council,"Hong Kong presents a stablecoin bill to solidify its digital asset regulatory framework. At a legislative council meeting on Dec. 18, Christopher Hui, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, presented a stablecoin bill in its second reading. In light of fiat stablecoin issuers’ increasing significance in the financial sector, the law aims to provide a legal framework for them. The suggested regulation requires stablecoin issuers to have reserves equivalent to the value of circulating stablecoins, made out of liquid, high-quality assets. The right to redeem stablecoins at face value without exorbitant fees or delays would also be ensured for holders. The framework also incorporates strict risk management procedures, disclosure requirements, and anti-money laundering safeguards. You might also like: What are stablecoins and how do they work? The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) would have the power to license stablecoin issuers, keep an eye on compliance, and look into infractions to guarantee monitoring. Widespread support for the bill during last year’s public consultation strengthened Hong Kong’s resolve to regulate virtual assets sensibly and by international norms. Hui also mentioned in his speech that, “fiat stablecoins have the potential to develop into a generally accepted medium of payment, thus posting a more urgent risk to monetary and financial stability.” He explained that the rapid adoption of stablecoins if left unchecked, could disrupt traditional financial systems, undermine monetary policies, and create vulnerabilities due to their reliance on private entities for issuance and reserves. These concerns are amplified by the growing significance of stablecoins , which have reached a market capitalization of $220 billion at the time of writing. Leading the market are issuers like Tether , with a market capitalization of $142 billion, and Circle’s USDC , valued at $42 billion. While these assets provide stability in a notoriously volatile market, their size and reliance on centralized issuers pose systemic risks. Hui’s concerns highlight that such large-scale reliance on private entities for issuance and reserve management could disrupt financial stability, particularly if reserves are mismanaged or redemption guarantees are not met during periods of economic stress. This urgency for regulation is further emphasized by Hong Kong’s efforts to distinguish its digital asset framework from the stringent cryptocurrency restrictions in Mainland China. The stringent cryptocurrency regulations in Mainland China stand in stark contrast to the Hong Kong plan. While China focuses on its central bank digital currency , the digital yuan, Hong Kong’s regulatory framework seeks to provide clarity and oversight to private issuers like Tether and Circle. Hong Kong is working to promote a more diverse digital asset ecosystem, while China has outlawed the majority of private cryptocurrency activity. By implementing these steps, Hong Kong aims to close the gap between established financial systems and the emerging digital asset market by implementing these steps. Clarity in regulations may help draw Web3 innovators and stablecoin issuers looking for a stable and safe working environment.

According to a local source, Prosecutors have requested a six-month prison sentence for Kim , accusing him of deliberately falsifying asset declarations submitted to the National Assembly. This has been handled as a high-profile case because of the growing debate surrounding cryptocurrency taxation and governance in South Korea. JUST IN: South Korean Congressman Kim Nam-kuk is sentenced to six months in prison for concealing $6.8M in crypto holdings. pic.twitter.com/V9tmybnBV2 — Coinwaft (@coinwaft) December 18, 2024 Congressman Concealed $7.5M Crypto Holdings: Is Crypto Illegal? Prosecutors allege Kim actively sought to deceive the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee, which is responsible for reviewing lawmakers’ financial disclosures. During his 2021 and 2022 asset declaration processes, Kim reportedly took deliberate steps to obscure the extent of his cryptocurrency wealth. In 2021, Kim declared total assets of approximately 1.2 billion won. However, prosecutors argue that he actually held around 9.9 billion won in cryptocurrency at the time. To disguise this disparity, Kim allegedly transferred a portion of his crypto holdings into a regular bank account, making it appear as though he had converted his digital assets into fiat currency. Additionally, he reportedly converted other cryptocurrency holdings back into coins to ensure the total assets matched the declared amount. This scheme, prosecutors claim, allowed Kim to evade proper scrutiny by the National Assembly Ethics Committee and mask the significant profits he had made from crypto investments. Kim manipulated his financial disclosures to prevent the committee from accurately reviewing his assets, a violation that has severe legal consequences in South Korea. Political and Legal Implications Kim’s actions come at a time when the Democratic Party is actively debating virtual asset taxation policies. Kim has been vocal in criticizing his party’s push for stricter crypto tax regulations, labeling them ineffective measures to garner public support. Despite these criticisms, the Democratic Party has proposed revising tax laws to increase the tax deduction limit for virtual assets to 50 million won. A report in November shows that South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) has confirmed plans to implement a long-delayed cryptocurrency tax in January 2025 . Initially set for 2022, the 20% tax (22% with local taxes) faced delays due to investor backlash, but adjustments to ease concerns are now being made. Key amendments include raising the tax exemption threshold from 2.5 million won ($1,795) to 50 million won ($35,919) in annual gains, significantly reducing the number of affected investors. The plan also allows taxpayers without detailed purchase records to calculate taxes using a percentage of the sale price. Notably, a crypto case similar to Kim’s occurred recently. According to a December 18 report, a former Woori Bank employee in South Korea was sentenced to 15 years in prison for embezzling $12.4 million to fund a failed crypto investment spree. The employee, who was in his 30s, forged loan documents under the names of 17 customers. He then embezzled the money from acquaintances’ accounts before transferring it to his own. He spent over $10.4 million on cryptocurrencies, losing $4.35 million in failed investments. The remainder went toward paying off personal loans and living expenses. Despite confiscating $3 million worth of assets, the court deemed at least $4 million unrecoverable and ordered the defendant to pay the bank $7.3 million in damages. The court’s forthcoming decision on Kim’s punishment is expected to set a significant precedent for crypto taxation in South Korea.

They predict BTC could reach a minimum of $145,000 by mid-2025, with a best-case scenario of $200,000 under favorable market conditions. The analysts highlighted that while some volatility may occur in Q1 2025, institutional inflows, particularly into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are expected to keep corrections mild. Since their January launch, U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs have already amassed $36 billion in inflows, according to Farside Investors. “The BTC ETFs have emerged as one of the largest Bitcoin holding groups, with over 1.13 million BTC in their possession,” the analysts noted. This growing adoption is seen as a key driver for the cryptocurrency’s sustained growth. Long-Term Potential At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,360, but many experts believe this is just the beginning of a much larger rally. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, recently told Bloomberg Television that Bitcoin could rise nearly ninefold in the long term to match the market cap of gold, which would place its value around $900,000 per coin. Andy Edstrom, a well-known Bitcoin author, echoed this sentiment, stating, “$1,000 price moves are now less than 1%—a clear sign of how far Bitcoin has come.” Bitfinex analysts also projected scenarios for Bitcoin’s peak in the coming cycles. If the current cycle mirrors 2021, BTC could rise 40% above its moving averages, potentially reaching $339,000. However, if the cycle reflects the extended 2017 pattern, with diminishing returns, the peak may land closer to $290,000 by early 2026. Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Could Rewrite Market Cycles Adding another layer to the speculation, pro-crypto legislation could soon reshape Bitcoin’s role in global markets. Following Donald Trump’s recent election win, Senator Cynthia Lummis announced plans to propose a bill for the U.S. to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, held for at least two decades. Crypto analyst Tyler Durden remarked on December 17 that such a move could fundamentally alter Bitcoin’s four-year cycles. He believes that if one country starts a Bitcoin reserve, it would a game-changer.

Hayes said he plans to adjust his investment strategy to mitigate potential losses, including reducing certain positions ahead of the expected volatility. It also stated its intention to repurchase underlying positions at lower prices in the first half of 2025.

The company’s stock options reportedly showed up on several brokerage accounts. Despite the continued speculation, Semler Scientific has not made any official announcement to confirm the news. The company aims to increase investors’ investment options through trading SMLR stock options. Semler Scientific chairman Eric Semler revealed in a December 5 press release that the company had requested options exchanges to approve trading options as it met the requirements. Options trading gives investors the right to buy or sell a stock before a given time at a specific price. A company’s shares must reach a price of between $3 and $5, record 500,000 to 1 million shares daily trading volume, and a project with a market cap of $75 million and above to be eligible for options trading. According to Nasdaq data, SMLR is trading at $74.41 at the time of writing. At the previous close, Semler Scientific’s market capitalization stood at $557 million. The data further indicated that the company’s average trading volume was slightly above $1 million. Semler Scientific shares have grown significantly this year The company’s shares have soared this year after Semler Scientific adopted a Bitcoin reserve strategy in May. According to Google Finance data from May 28, the SMLR stock spiked by over 30%, reaching $30.38. The company’s shares have increased by over 39% since then. Chairman Semler explained that its strategy and increased BTC purchases would create a store of value for the company. The chairman further argued that BTC would present a compelling investment among shareholders. The medical technology firm pointed out Bitcoin’s finite supply, which increases its scarcity. The chairman highlighted that the coin’s characteristics placed it at a vantage point as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven in case of global economic instability. Semler further mentioned that the company weighed other alternatives before settling on BTC as the right option. Since then, Semler Scientific has accumulated 2084 BTC, with the latest purchase being on December 16. The company bought 211 BTC worth approximately $21.5 million at about $101,890 per BTC. According to Semler, the investment has attained a BTC Yield of 67% quarter-to-date and 92.8% since the adoption of the Bitcoin Treasury in May. The company’s Bitcoin strategy is similar to MicroStrategy, with some referring to Semler Scientific as “MicroStrategy II.” Other companies, including Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms, have also joined the BTC accumulation trend.

Semler also indicated in the filing that the ATM offering has generated $100 million from the sale of over 1.9 million shares of its common stock since the registration. The addition would push the amount under the ATM to $150 million. The company’s boost of funds under the ATM increases the amount Semler Scientific has dedicated toward more BTC purchases.

This launch comes as the company continues to face significant regulatory challenges in the United States, where efforts to introduce a similar Solana ETF have been stalled. The BSOL ETP offers up to 8% annual rewards, presenting an attractive alternative to US-based ETFs which cannot include staking rewards due to current securities laws. Bitwise’s expansion into Europe with the Solana staking ETP Bitwise’s decision to launch the BSOL ETP in Europe follows its recent acquisition of a European ETP issuer in August, which facilitated a smoother entry into the market. The launch underscores the firm’s strategy to diversify from US-based ETFs, which are prohibited from providing staking rewards due to current securities laws. By focusing on the EU, Bitwise aims to capitalize on more favorable regulatory conditions for staking products. The region has seen the introduction of similar Solana staking ETPs, such as VanEck’s offering, reflecting a growing acceptance of these products in Europe. Solana’s market appeal Despite the current Solana’s price market corrections, Solana (SOL) continues to exhibit relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies, maintaining investor interest. While the BSOL Solana staking ETP has not yet had a noticeable impact on Solana’s price, it provides European investors with a compelling option to earn staking rewards while gaining exposure to Solana (SOL). Bitwise’s strategy highlights the firm’s adaptability and suggests that, if US regulations remain restrictive, the company may deepen its focus on Europe. However, if a more crypto-friendly SEC emerges in the US, there could be renewed interest in launching a Solana ETF domestically, potentially allowing for staking features. For now, BSOL offers a unique value proposition for European investors looking to engage with Solana and benefit from staking rewards.

The analyst drew similarities between the current price and that of 2023 while revealing what could happen next for the flagship crypto. What Next As Bitcoin Price Mirrors 2023 Move In an X post, Charting Guy revealed that the Bitcoin price is still following 2023. The analyst predicted that the flagship crypto could hit the $110,000 to $120,000 area on this leg up, with this surge expected to happen later this week or early next week. Bitcoin looks to already be on its way to this price target, having recently hit a new ATH at $108,000. Related Reading: Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend Charting Guy also predicted that the Bitcoin price would tap the resistance on the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), forming a triple bearish divergence, marking a slight local top for the flagship crypto. Once that happens, the analyst believes that Bitcoin will consolidate between $105 and $115,000 for a few weeks. The Bitcoin price could then record a fakeout move up to the $125,000 to $130,000 range into Donald Trump’s inauguration with a quick dump afterwards. Charting Guy predicts that this dump could maybe lead to a final retest of the $100,000 psychological level. Once that is done, Bitcoin could then begin the final leg up, starting from mid-February to the 1.618 Fibonacci level at around $170,000. The analyst opined that this could mark the final cycle top. What Happens As BTC Consolidates As the Bitcoin price consolidates from around Christmas to Donald Trump’s inauguration, Charting Guy believes that altcoins will go “absolutely insane.” The analyst also predicts that these altcoins will witness another parabolic rally roughly one month after Bitcoin tops in late March. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash Incoming? Tron’s Justin Sun Unstakes $209 Million ETH From Lido Finance These altcoins are expected to rally higher while the Bitcoin price makes lower highs. Charting Guy noted that different altcoins could top at different times. Some could happen at the start of next year, some during the Inauguration, and others when BTC tops in March or possibly extend to April. The analyst is confident that all these altcoins will get a major top in the first quarter of next year, with an extension to April possible for some coins. Charting Guy stated that the exact top for these altcoins will depend on each altcoin and its chart structure, wave count, Fibonacci levels, and other technical indicators. Specifically, the analyst highlighted LINK and XRP, stating that both coins could have their wave 3 topping in early Q1, with a wave 4 correction into the summer and a fifth wave higher high into August and September. The analyst added that the fifth wave isn’t really guaranteed and is speculative.

But what if this popular choice isn’t all it’s cracked up to be? Crypto expert Alex Kolicich offers a fresh perspective on why MSTR may not be the smartest route to take for Bitcoin exposure. Let’s dive into his insights and discover why some investors might want to reconsider their strategy. MSTR: Trading at a Premium for Less Exposure Currently, MSTR is priced at $386.42, reflecting a 10.96% increase in the past 30 days. However, Kolicich believes that MicroStrategy is overpriced as a Bitcoin proxy, trading at a 140% premium to its net asset value (NAV). There is so much misinformation out there about $MSTR It isn’t a “synthetic call” on bitcoin, nor is it even a leveraged way of buying Bitcoin. It’s a poorly structured, tax-inefficient fund that trades at a 140% premium to NAV A thread: — Alex Kolicich (@AlexKolicich) December 16, 2024 Bitcoin Exposure and Pricing Issues MicroStrategy holds over 439,000 BTC, worth about $45.78 billion, or around 2.09% of Bitcoin’s total supply. This translates to an NAV of roughly $177.60 per share of Bitcoin. Despite this, Kolicich points out that for every $1 spent on MSTR, investors get less than $0.45 worth of Bitcoin exposure. In his view, buying MSTR provides less exposure to Bitcoin compared to simply purchasing BTC directly. Convertible Debt: Shorting Volatility and Diluting Exposure Kolicich also highlights the issue with MicroStrategy’s strategy of issuing convertible debt. This tactic effectively reduces volatility by selling a bond and a call option. However, unlike traditional call options, MicroStrategy doesn’t offer any leverage on the invested dollars. Kolicich warns that when Bitcoin prices rise, the conversion of this debt dilutes the Bitcoin exposure for MSTR shareholders. Double Taxation Risk As a C-Corp, MicroStrategy’s structure is different from that of ETFs, and Kolicich points out a major drawback: the gains of a C-Corp are generally subject to double taxation — both corporate and personal taxes. This makes MSTR less tax-efficient compared to other investment options for Bitcoin exposure. A Better Alternative: BITX Kolicich suggests that products like BITX offer a more efficient and cost-effective way to gain Bitcoin exposure. BITX provides 2x leveraged Bitcoin exposure without trading at a premium to NAV, unlike MSTR. Kolicich urges investors to carefully consider MSTR before investing. With its premium pricing, tax inefficiency, and limited Bitcoin exposure, alternatives like BITX could offer a smarter and more profitable way to invest in BTC.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-microstrategys-premium-pricing-hurting-bitcoin-investors/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
42416278,c3e04680-1663-4e5a-ac06-f25e7dec0642,1734523200,Crypto Daybook Americas: Pre-Fed Derisking Marked by PENGU Liquidity Squeeze,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)  The crypto market is derisking ahead of today's Fed rate decision. Everyone's buzzing about the likelihood of another rate cut that will supposedly galvanize risk-taking in the economy and financial markets.  Here's the twist: The central bank is expected to signal three rate cuts for 2025, not the four it projected in September, as well as revise growth and inflation forecasts higher. No surprise, then, that bitcoin and ether are trading nearly 2% lower, driving bigger losses in small-cap tokens. Among them, Pudgy Penguins' PENGU token, which has slumped over 50% since Tuesday's airdrop.  The front-end call premiums in both BTC and ETH have already taken a hit, signalling a more cautious vibe in the market. Traditional markets are also factoring in a hawkish cut.  Now, seasoned traders will tell you that when expectations lean too heavily one way, there's always room for disappointment. Put more simply, if interest rate projections stay the same or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell eases concerns about sticky inflation during his press conference while maintaining a data-dependent approach, we could see a nice bump in risk assets — cryptos included.  VIRTUAL, the native coin of AI and tokenization platform Virtuals Protocol, might shine in that case, having risen 11% in Asian hours. ""AI within crypto is shaping up to be a fascinating trend, especially in social trading, where data-driven insights and automation can empower traders,"" said Neal Wen, head of global business development at Kronos Research.  Leading on-chain perpetuals platform HyperLiquid's HYPE token is another candidate, trading 4% higher at press time. Social media chatter points to limited exchange availability and token retention as a catalyst for the rally.  That said, don't let your guard down. Some observers say the pace of future rate cuts really hinges on Friday's core PCE data, the Fed's preferred inflation measure.   As Valentin Fournier, an analyst at BRN, put it: ""The Federal Reserve is set to announce a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut today — it's last for the year. Future cuts may rely heavily on Friday's Core PCE report, which is expected to hold steady at 3.3% year over year. Any surprises with rising inflation could rattle the markets, especially since bitcoin is already feeling some bearish pressure and is lacking the upward momentum.""  Additionally, the decline in Chinese government bond yields has folks over at the Wall Street Journal raising red flags about the world's second-largest economy facing a depression, a prolonged period marked by a sharp drop in economic growth and rising unemployment.   These concerns could easily destabilize global markets, so it's definitely a good time to stay alert.

The token of the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem token debuted amid massive hype on Tuesday. Its charm was its association with an already popular NFT collection, leading to a frenzy of buying with hopes of quick gains. But the token had garnered the necessary liquidity at launch, meaning early, enthusiastic buyers bought the token at a $5 trillion market capitalization.  Liquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset without causing a significant price change. For PENGU, the initial liquidity pools were shallow, meaning there weren't enough buyers and sellers to keep the price stable.  One unlucky trader lost big on the airdrop, turning $10,000 into less than $5 in seconds. Just before the official airdrop, they had swapped 45 wrapped Solana for PENGU but got only 78 tokens due to a glitch in Jupiter's decentralized exchange. The trade was sent to a low-liquidity pool on Raydium, inflating the token's price to an unrealistic $14 trillion market cap. This mishap was due to low liquidity, where even small trades can cause huge price swings.  The PENGU token was created weeks before its launch, leading to premature trading and significant losses for those who jumped in too early without checking the market cap.  Derivatives Positioning  Positioning in BTC futures is heating up, with open interest approaching the November high of 663.71K BTC. Meanwhile, ETH open interest has hit a record of over 339K ETH.  Funding rates in perpetuals tied to major coins are holding steady at around an annualized 10%, bang in the middle of the -200% to 200% range, which marks the extremes for bearish and bullish sentiment.  Front-end BTC and ETH puts are trading at a premium to calls, highlighting demand for downside protection ahead of the Fed's interest-rate decision.  Top BTC block trades include a bear call spread involving calls at strikes $104,000 and $105,000 and a standalone long position in the $95,000 put expiring on Jan. 3.

Is it now time for the memes to bounce? What are the best price levels to pick up $DOGE, $PEPE, and $WIF? Time to take a position in $DOGE? Source: TradingView The $DOGE price is in an ascending channel on the daily time frame. Having just touched the bottom of the channel, and currently sitting on some good horizontal support, this could be the time to take a position. If the price does bounce from here, the top of the channel is at around $0.50. A breakout of the top of the channel, with confirmation above, could lead to a measured move of at least $0.60, depending on where the breakout occurs. If, on the other hand, the price falls through the bottom of the channel, and makes a lower low, the uptrend would be negated and it would be back to the drawing board once again. That said, a continuation of the trend seems more likely. $PEPE retests - now the bounce? Source: TradingView $PEPE has been in a local downtrend for the past nine days now, and the price has almost come down to retest the top of the bull flag. The price has retested the 0.618 Fibonacci, and there is the potential for a wick to come down and retest the bull flag trendline, and also the 0.786 Fibonacci. Source: TradingView With the main trend still very much to the upside, it would not be expected that the price breaks back inside of the bull flag, although if it did, a price below $0.00001730 would make a lower low. That said, this level is very good support, as can be seen in the chart above. $WIF at very strong support Source: TradingView $WIF does look primed for a bounce here. The price has come all the way down to the deepest Fibonacci level for this move at the 0.786, which also happens to be a very strong horizontal support level. If the price did wick through, the ascending trendline, as well as the descending trendline from the all-time high, would act as good support. In conclusion, all three of the above memecoins look as though they are ready for a bounce. As usual, much will depend on Bitcoin. The $BTC price will either have to go up, or remain relatively stable for a while. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

37798588,https://invezz.com/?p=2393555,1734522709,WazirX (WRX) plunges 50% as Binance delists token amid fresh probe,"WazirX (WRX), the native token of the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX, has suffered a dramatic 50% price drop after two major developments shook investor confidence. Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, announced plans to delist the token, and the Delhi High Court ordered a fresh probe into the exchange’s handling of a significant security breach. Delhi High Court orders fresh investigation into WazirX In a major blow to WazirX, the Delhi High Court has rejected the Delhi Police’s earlier status report on the exchange’s alleged hacking case and called for a new investigation. This decision came in response to a petition by Advocate Jaivir Bains, who demanded a thorough criminal inquiry into the hack that led to a $230 million loss from the platform earlier this year. Initially, the Delhi Police claimed no actionable case could be made against the exchange. However, Justice Sanjeev Narula dismissed the report, expressing dissatisfaction with the findings and instructing the police to submit a new status report by February 13, 2025. The hack, one of the largest crypto security breaches this year, has raised serious concerns about WazirX’s security protocols and operational transparency. With the court refusing to give the exchange a clean chit, the management now faces further scrutiny, adding pressure to the embattled platform. Source: CoinMarketCap Binance delisting sends WRX tumbling The challenges for WazirX were compounded by Binance’s announcement to delist WRX along with two other tokens, Akropolis (AKRO) and Bluzelle (BLZ). Binance cited the need for all listed tokens to meet its “high standards of quality and compliance” as the reason for the delisting. As a result, WRX’s price plummeted 52.65% to $0.1132 after peaking at $0.2494 earlier in the day. Its 24-hour trading volume also took a hit, declining by 19% to $21.87 million. According to Binance’s official statement, trading pairs for WRX/USDT, AKRO/USDT, BLZ/BTC, and BLZ/USDT will be removed from the platform starting December 25. The exchange emphasized that its decision followed a comprehensive review process to ensure all listed assets align with its industry standards. What’s next for WazirX? These developments mark a challenging period for WazirX. The hack, coupled with regulatory scrutiny and Binance’s delisting decision, raises questions about the exchange’s future in a highly competitive and compliance-driven market. While some in the crypto community have welcomed the court’s fresh investigation as a step toward greater accountability, others are urging more clarity on WazirX’s plans to address its operational and security issues. As the February 13 deadline for the new status report approaches, all eyes will be on how WazirX navigates these mounting challenges to restore investor trust. For now, WRX’s sharp decline and the ongoing probe indicate a tough road ahead for the Indian exchange.

In Europe, Bitwise launched a Solana staking ETP to expand its market presence, while Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. surpassed gold ETFs in assets under management. Analysts now predict that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025, driven by spot ETF inflows and adoption. Bitcoin and Ether Combo ETF Expected to Pave Way for New Crypto ETFs The crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) landscape in the United States is poised for major developments in 2025, and a Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) combo ETF is expected to lead a new wave of crypto funds. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas and fellow analyst James Seyffart believe that this inaugural ETF will be followed by others tracking assets like Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR). Seyffart acknowledged that there are still some regulatory challenges faced by certain crypto assets, especially after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rejection of Solana (SOL) ETFs on Dec. 7. He explained that ETFs tied to assets like SOL and XRP are unlikely to advance until a new SEC chair is selected and assumes office. The analysts pointed out that Litecoin and Hedera are viewed more favorably by regulators, which increases their likelihood of approval. Litecoin’s status as a Bitcoin fork and its potential classification as a “commodity” boosts its chances as well. The fact that Hedera is not labeled as a security by the SEC also gives it a regulatory advantage. In contrast, XRP and SOL face more serious regulatory hurdles. The SEC classified both as securities, and Ripple is already engaged in a legal battle over XRP’s status. Despite these challenges, Balchunas and Seyffart are still a bit uncertain about the investor demand for Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, even if they are approved. The potential shift in the SEC’s stance on crypto is linked to Trump’s expected nomination of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto businessman and former SEC commissioner, as the agency's next chair. This move could start a shift toward de-regulation and more crypto-friendly policies. The current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced his resignation , effective on Trump’s inauguration day on Jan. 20. Bitwise Launches Solana Staking ETP in Europe Solana’s regulatory hurdles are not holding everyone back. Bitwise launched a Solana staking exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe under the stock ticker BSOL to strengthen its presence in the European crypto market. The ETP was introduced on Dec. 17 in partnership with Marinade, a self-custodial automation tool, and offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.48%. This is more than competitors like 21Shares, which provides an APY of about 5.49%. BSOL’s very competitive management fee of 0.85% also challenges its European rivals, including 21Shares. The ETP was launched as Bitwise still awaits regulatory approval for a spot Solana ETF in the United States. In November, the firm registered a statutory trust in Delaware as a precursor to filing with the SEC. While Bitwise awaits the green light, VanEck’s head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel is still confident that the approval odds for a U.S. spot Solana ETF will be “overwhelmingly high” by the end of 2025. Bitwise’s European expansion started in August with the launch of its first Solana ETP, ESOL, which does not offer staking rewards. The introduction of BSOL addresses this gap by providing an integrated staking feature. Bitwise’s European footprint was also boosted by its acquisition of ETC Group, adding nine crypto ETPs to its portfolio and raising its assets under management to over $4.5 billion. The ESOL product currently holds about $24 million in assets under management. (Source: Bitwise ) Bitwise is still optimistic about the future of crypto markets. Investment chief Matt Hougan and research head Ryan Rasmussen predict that at least five crypto unicorns, including Circle and Kraken, will go public by 2025. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold in AUM Balchunas and Seyffart might be right about Bitcoin’s power in the ETF space. Net assets in U.S. Bitcoin ETFs surpassed those in gold funds for the first time. On Dec. 16, Bitcoin ETFs collectively reached $129 billion in assets under management (AUM), surpassing U.S. gold ETFs, according to K33 Research. Eric Balchunas pointed out that the AUM figure includes both spot Bitcoin ETFs and those tracking the crypto through derivatives like futures. He also shed some light on the very rapid growth of Bitcoin ETFs, and stated that it is remarkable that they are competing with gold only 11 months after spot Bitcoin ETF launched. If spot ETFs alone are considered, Bitcoin ETFs hold $120 billion compared to gold’s $125 billion. The rise of Bitcoin ETFs started in January with the launch of spot BTC funds after a lengthy approval process by the SEC. Since then, Bitcoin ETFs have grown very quickly, and broke the $100 billion in net assets by November. Analysts believe this impressive growth was due to a more positive outlook for Bitcoin, which was spurred by market dynamics after Donald Trump’s election victory. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market by managing close to $60 billion in assets, and surpassed BlackRock’s own iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in November. Investors are increasingly turning to Bitcoin and gold as part of a “debasement trade,” which is a strategy aimed at hedging against economic uncertainties. JPMorgan noticed this trend back in October, and linked it to rising geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation concerns, and high government deficits. Bitcoin Poised for $200K by 2025 Bitcoin’s price is expected to see a lot of growth in 2025, driven by strong institutional demand and increasing adoption, according to analysts at Bitfinex. In a Dec. 17 market report , they predicted that Bitcoin could reach a minimum of $145,000 by mid-2025, with a best-case scenario of $200,000 under more favorable conditions. While they still predict some price volatility in the first quarter of the year, they believe any dips will be short-lived because of large inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rising global and institutional adoption. Since the launch of U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, these funds attracted approximately $36 billion, making them major players in the market with holdings exceeding 1.13 million BTC. This institutional interest is considered to be a key factor in stabilizing Bitcoin’s price during market corrections. The current Bitcoin price of around $104,000 is already prompting long-term bullish projections from well known voices in the crypto industry. Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures suggested that Bitcoin could eventually reach $900,000 to match gold’s market cap. Bitfinex analysts shared various scenarios for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. If the price mirrors the 2021 cycle, it could potentially reach $339,000, which is a 40% increase above its moving averages. In a more conservative scenario resembling the extended 2017 cycle, Bitcoin might peak at around $290,000 by early 2026. Speculation around the United States creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve also adds another layer of intrigue. After Donald Trump’s election victory, pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis shared her plans to propose legislation for the U.S. government to buy and hold Bitcoin for at least 20 years. Crypto analyst Tyler Durden believes that such a move by any nation could disrupt the traditional four-year market cycles and create a new narrative for Bitcoin’s price trajectory.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6597/bitcoin-and-ether-etf-expected-to-lead-us-crypto-funds-in-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37797101,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629567,1734522222,Elizabeth Warren demands Trump answers for Elon Musk’s ‘conflicts of interest’ in the government,"Senator Elizabeth Warren wants clarity on the ethical standards applied to billionaire Elon Musk in his role as a top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team. In a letter to Trump, Warren emphasized the need for Musk to address potential conflicts of interest if he is to continue advising the incoming administration. The letter from Warren highlights existing rules published by the General Services Administration. These rules mandate that transition team members avoid both real and perceived conflicts of interest. The democratic party Senator from Massachusetts pointed out that members are prohibited from engaging in matters that could affect their financial interests. Despite these stipulations, it remains unclear whether Musk, whose net worth is valued at $474 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaire Index , is subject to these standards. Musk, renowned for founding Tesla and SpaceX, holds a dual role in the transition process. He is not only serving as an adviser but also co-leading a proposed advisory board aimed at eliminating government waste, named the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Warren questions Musk’s ethics and political influence Speaking to MSNBC, Warren expressed alarm over Musk’s unchecked influence, especially given his business empire’s entanglement with government contracts and regulatory issues. Warren argued that multiple of the Tesla CEO’s companies are directly involved with the US government. To her, Musk’s close relationship with US President-elect Trump could possibly make those companies “richer.” “These are conflicts of interest in levels that have never been seen before,” she said in the interview. Elizabeth Warren takes issue with @elonmusk advising Trump on efficiency. Apparently creating electric cars, reusable rockets, and brain interfaces counts as ""nothing for society"" in her world. pic.twitter.com/sHps2kQuXC — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) December 18, 2024 Musk has been a visible and vocal supporter of Trump since his presidential campaign. His efforts included hosting events, making media appearances and funding initiatives to boost voter turnout. Notably, Musk’s advocacy for Trump’s platform aligns closely with his business interests. For instance, Trump has pledged to accelerate federal initiatives, such as SpaceX’s Mars exploration programs, while Musk’s Tesla benefits from federal subsidies for its electric vehicle infrastructure. “Putting Mr. Musk in a position to influence billions of dollars of government contracts and regulatory enforcement without a stringent conflict of interest agreement in place is an invitation for corruption on a scale not seen in our lifetimes,” Warren’s letter remarked. The US Senator also noted that ethical oversight is critical to ensuring the government does not become a vehicle for enriching America’s wealthiest individuals. Ties to the Trump administration The extent of Musk’s involvement in the administration extends beyond advocacy. He has emerged as a central figure in shaping government policies and spending priorities, raising questions about impartiality. Meanwhile, several of Musk’s ventures, including Tesla, SpaceX, Starlink, and Neuralink, face regulatory scrutiny or have contracts with federal agencies. Tesla is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for pedestrian accidents involving its vehicles. Additionally, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised potential securities fraud concerns regarding Musk’s recent activities. Other enterprises, such as Neuralink and Starlink, also have pending regulatory matters before federal authorities. When questioned by Time magazine about potential conflicts of interest, Trump dismissed concerns, stating that Musk prioritizes the country over his business interests. “ He considers this to be his most important project, ” Trump said. However, Warren’s letter contests this narrative, citing Musk’s vast financial stakes and the potential for ethical breaches. She called for transparency and a robust conflict-of-interest agreement to safeguard public trust in the administration. In a statement addressing Warren’s concerns, Trump’s transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt dismissed the senator’s critique as political theater. “… Pocahontas (Warren) can play political games and send toothless letters, but the Trump-Vance transition will continue to be held to the highest ethical and legal standards possible—a standard unfamiliar to a career politician whose societal impact is 1/1024th of Elon Musk’s .” A Step-By-Step System To Launching Your Web3 Career and Landing High-Paying Crypto Jobs in 90 Days.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/warren-demands-trump-to-answer-for-elon-musk/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37797101.jpeg

37797272,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52476,1734522028,Beyond DOGE and SHIB: 5 Hidden Gems That Could Turn $10 Into $1 Million by Mid-2025,"The crypto world is full of surprises, where small investments can lead to massive payouts. While famous meme coins have captured headlines, lesser-known digital assets quietly hold the potential for life-changing returns. Exploring five under-the-radar tokens, this article dives into promising opportunities that could transform a modest sum into a fortune by the middle of 2025. DOGEN: The First Memetoken for Alpha Males Who Demand the Best Unleash your inner alpha with DOGEN, the meme token built for those who want to live a beautiful life. DOGEN is the alpha dog that never misses a chance to win big . This is the token for winners who won’t settle for anything less. Think luxury cars, stacks of cash, and beautiful women — that’s the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle! HODL Like a Boss, Conquer the Market Ready to live like an Alpha DOGEN and enjoy the finer things in life? It’s on the runway, gearing up for a 700% takeoff by the end of the presale — and that’s just the start. With DOGEN, you’re looking at potential thousand-fold returns as memetokens lead the hottest trend of this altcoin season. The earlier you jump in, the more you win! It’s a deal that others will envy, and you’ll be at the top of the pack. Missed WIF, Popcat or Ponke rise? DOGEN is the new doggie on the Solana memetokens ground alongside BONK, WIF, and Popcat known for their astonishing 1000% growth . Currently undervalued, DOGEN is poised to take this crypto narrative to the next level, potentially breaking records in this bull run. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a short-lived hype; it’s a growing movement . The team behind DOGEN is laser-focused on building a thriving community of alpha leaders who refuse to settle for less and are geared up to dominate the market. This token offers real value , from exciting campaigns to exclusive perks for early adopters. DOGEN is an opportunity to be part of something that lasts. DOGEN’s multi-level referral program is as fierce as it gets: You’ll score 7% from every token your direct bros (1st level) buy using your referral code. Plus, there are more rewards down the line — you can grow your profits as your referrals bring in even more users. Hold DOGEN and let others envy you! Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! BONK: A Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It was designed to shift influence away from venture capital tokens and empower the Solana community. Half of its total supply was distributed via airdrops to users in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. After being listed on Coinbase, its value rose over 100%, becoming the third-largest memecoin by market cap in late 2023. BONK has gained traction with initiatives like BonkSwap, a decentralized exchange. Its large supply and the nature of memecoins create challenges, but continued development in the Solana ecosystem makes BONK a relevant cryptocurrency in today’s market. It appears attractive for those seeking involvement within the Solana space. Dogwifhat: A Dog-Themed Meme Coin on Solana Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain inspired by the Dogwifhat meme. It is part of a growing trend of dog-themed tokens in the cryptocurrency world. These coins focus on building communities and creating online engagement. WIF uses the Solana network, known for its speed and low transaction costs. The coin’s appeal lies in its playful theme and the strong potential for viral attention. Its value depends heavily on maintaining interest and community growth. In the current market, its attractiveness depends on trends in meme coins and market conditions. Like all meme coins, success is tied to community efforts rather than underlying technology or utility. PEPE Memecoin: Tribute to an Internet Icon PEPE is a deflationary memecoin inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. It was launched on the Ethereum network to honor this early internet phenomenon. The coin stands out with no transaction taxes, a focus on memes, and no utility claims, staying true to its comedic roots. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a market cap of $1.6 billion, sparking global interest in memecoins. It uses a burn mechanism to reduce its supply and rewards long-term holders. Listed on major platforms like Binance and KuCoin, PEPE benefits from Ethereum’s secure network. Whether PEPE remains attractive depends on market interest in memes and tokens with limited practical use. Floki Cryptocurrency: From Meme Coin to Expanding Ecosystem Floki began as a meme coin influenced by Elon Musk’s tweet about naming his Shiba Inu “Floki” in 2021. It has since moved toward a more utility-driven approach. The coin supports projects like the NFT game Valhalla and DeFi platform FlokiFi. It also enables real-world transactions via its prepaid Floki Card and partnership with NOWPayments. Floki works on charity initiatives, such as building schools in Laos and Nigeria. Its recognition as a leading meme coin in 2023 shows its growing potential. Floki’s mix of NFTs, decentralized finance, and charitable aims makes it stand out among meme coins, presenting an attractive option for those seeking utility-focused cryptocurrency projects. Conclusion BONK, WIF, PEPE, and FLOKI show promise but may take longer to deliver significant gains. DOGEN stands out as a token built for those who demand the finest. With an expected 700% growth by the end of its presale and the potential for explosive returns, DOGEN targets market dominance and offers exclusive perks to its loyal supporters.

37796596,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394671,1734521721,How Bitwise Solana Staking ETP Delivers Top Staking Rewards,"The post How Bitwise Solana Staking ETP Delivers Top Staking Rewards appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Good news for the crypto enthusiasts in the European Union. The famous crypto asset management firm, Bitwise, just launched its Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (BSOL). They launched the product on Deutsche Börse Xetra. It is a great product for investors looking for institutional grade exposure to Solana. It is paired with the benefits of staking rewards. This launch shows the growing dominance of Solana in the blockchain space . Why This ETP Stands Out This isn’t Bitwise’s first rodeo in staking ETPs. They previously introduced Ethereum and Aptos staking ETPs, but the new Solana focused product feels special. Solana is famous for its incredible speed of 65k transactions per second and scalable architecture. The blockchain is quickly becoming a favorite among developers as well as investors. With Bitwise Solana Staking ETP, the firm taps into its potential and gives European investors low cost and transparent access to Solana staking. BSOL is designed to provide superior staking returns, which are like dividends for crypto. But unlike regular staking, this product removes the complexities. It’s fully backed and linked to the Compass Solana Total Return Monthly Index, ensuring transparency in tracking performance. Solana is one of the finest blockchains available in the market with a whole ecosystem surrounding it. This launch represents Bitwise’s confidence in Solana’s future. As Hunter Horsley, the company’s CEO, pointed out, Solana is becoming a rising star in the crypto asset world. The ETP underscores Bitwise’s strategy to offer high-quality staking products that meet the needs of serious investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Solana Struggles Below $215: Is It Going To Recover? , What to Expect The company’s total client assets have already surpassed $12 billion in 2024, and its recent acquisition of ETC Group solidifies its position in Europe. BSOL is part of a broader European push, following earlier hits like their Ethereum staking ETP and physically backed Bitcoin ETP. With Bitwise Solana Staking ETP , retail investors will get easier access to innovative crypto products. The asset management firm plans to keep expanding its European portfolio with more cutting-edge offerings while maintaining its commitment to transparency and low costs. This product launch is a step forward in making crypto more accessible and rewarding not just for institutions but for retail investors as well. The future looks promising, and Bitwise seems determined to lead the way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a Dec. 18 announcement, the Solana (SOL)-based staking ETP has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Xetra trading venue in partnership with Marinade, a self-custodial automation tool. At the time of publication, Bitwise had not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for additional details about the partnership. The new ETP offers an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.48% for stakers, surpassing European competitors like 21Shares, which provides an APY of 5.49%. Competitive Fees to Challenge Rivals BSOL’s management fee is set at 0.85%, significantly undercutting 21Shares’ 2.5% fee. In November, Bitwise registered a statutory trust in Delaware for its proposed spot Solana ETF, though it still awaits further regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bridging Gaps in Solana ETPs Bitwise’s first Solana ETP in Europe, ESOL, debuted in August following its acquisition of ETC Group. While ESOL lacked staking rewards, BSOL integrates this feature, addressing a key gap in the market. The acquisition also added nine European-listed crypto ETPs to Bitwise’s portfolio, boosting its assets under management to over $4.5 billion. Currently, ESOL holds $24 million in assets under management. Bullish Outlook on Crypto ETFs VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, predicts a high likelihood of U.S. approval for a spot Solana ETF by the end of 2025. Bitwise executives Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen recently forecast that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 or more by the end of 2025 and potentially surpass gold’s $18 trillion market cap by 2029. They also expect at least five “crypto unicorns,” such as Circle and Kraken, to go public in 2025.",POSITIVE,SOL,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitwise-launches-solana-staking-etp-in-europe-amid-us-approval-wait/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

One of the factors that made the company eligible for inclusion was a market gap gain, driven by gains in Bitcoin, an asset that MicroStrategy holds in vast quantities. MicroStrategy is financing its Bitcoin buys with equity and debt. This creates risks for shareholders. Equity dilution becomes a major cost when the asset bought with share issuance proceeds declines in price. Debt servicing can become an issue when asset prices collapse enough. For these reasons, I consider MicroStrategy stock unsuitable for most investors. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) made headlines Yesterday when it was picked for inclusion in the NASDAQ-100 index. The company’s index inclusion was spurred in no small part by a series of well-timed Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) purchases, which took its market cap to a level where it was eligible to be added to the index. Although many investors were optimistic that MicroStrategy’s index inclusion would lift the stock, MSTR actually dipped in the days after the NASDAQ inclusion news was announced. It should be noted that MSTR’s actual index inclusion does not occur until December 23. The stock may yet experience a post-inclusion rally. However, investors who anticipate the inclusion may be making bets on the effect of index inclusion already. There is significant money to be made by front-running index fund buys, and MSTR will be in NASDAQ-100 index funds soon enough. Tuesday trading in MSTR seems to indicate that investors either don’t think that index inclusion will lift MSTR much, or think it will have a positive impact that will be outweighed by issues facing the company. Speaking of issues: MicroStrategy would face a large one if Bitcoin were to embark on a large, long-lasting drawdown–something BTC has, in fact, done many times in the past . The company is using a mix of debt and equity to finance its Bitcoin purchases, and these both come with problems in the event that the asset purchased goes down in price. Debt comes with interest expenses, which in MSTR’s case were already high as a percentage of the company’s revenue before the Bitcoin purchases. Equity issuance, on the other hand, reduces the percentage of the total enterprise that is owned by the pre-issuance shareholders. In other words, unless the asset purchased appreciates or pays income exceeding the amount of dilution, the dilution makes each share worth less. It’s certainly possible for MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying strategy to work out. Bitcoin has many advantages over other cryptocurrencies, including its supply cap, higher hash rate and greater decentralization . Cryptocurrency is useful for people who have one reason or another to be wary of their spending being tracked–a category that includes not just black market participants, but also political dissidents. As long as this use case remains, Bitcoin is likely to enjoy some measure of non-speculative demand. If that’s the case, then Bitcoin’s market value represents more than just a bubble, and its price could keep going up. With all that being said, Bitcoin’s historical volatility indicates that drawdowns far in excess of 50% are possible if not likely. Since its creation in 2009, Bitcoin has undergone at least five crashes greater than 50% , and three of those were greater than 80%. Therefore, it would be wise for those holding Bitcoin and its corporate proxy, MicroStrategy, to model for scenarios where the cryptocurrency declines by that much, to see whether their portfolios would survive it. As for Bitcoin itself: history teaches that it would likely recover from such a hypothetical crash. It has done so in the past, and it still has both its use case and its advantages over other cryptos. However, it’s not necessarily the case that Bitcoin holders would survive such an event. A retiree holding an asset at heavy weighting prior to it declining 80% in price would be in trouble, as would a person at any age holding the asset while being in debt. That latter category includes MicroStrategy. As of its most recent financial report, MSTR had 12% more debt than equity , and 343% more operating costs than revenue. The company cannot finance all of its obligations from operations alone. MicroStrategy does have more revenue than interest expense, with a ‘revenue interest coverage’ ratio of 6.4. That sounds reasonable but remember that that revenue has to pay interest along with operating expenses; the company’s deeply negative operating income cannot cover interest expenses. So, it looks like either Bitcoin sales, operating asset sales or debt refinancing will be needed to keep those interest payments at bay. For this reason, MicroStrategy is highly vulnerable to the price volatility inherent in Bitcoin, and is not a buy for risk-averse investors. Equity Raises Shortly after the release of its third quarter earnings, MicroStrategy announced a plan to buy $42 billion worth of Bitcoin, financed by 50% equity and 50% debt. Both the debt and the equity components of this plan have their risks. The risks of equity are the easiest to explain, so I’ll start with those. The risk of issuing equity is that doing so threatens to make shares that existed prior to the issuance, worth less than before. When equity is issued, the immediate effect is to replace a percentage of per-share ownership with an equivalent value in cash. Initially, the effect on shareholder wealth is zero, less a small impact from investment banking fees. However, as time goes on, the company has to invest the newly raised cash in lucrative opportunities, otherwise inflation and opportunity costs erode the value of the cash raised to the point where it reduces shareholder wealth in real terms. So, MicroStrategy’s equity raises present a risk to shareholders if the new Bitcoin purchases don’t work out. With MSTR continuing to buy Bitcoin at all-time highs, the possibility of said purchases not working out is real. With that being said, the risks with the equity raises are not existential ones. It’s a different story with debt. Debt The debt that MicroStrategy is taking out to finance its Bitcoin purchases is an existential threat in a scenario where Bitcoin declines precipitously in price. The reason is simple: debt creates interest expenses, and MicroStrategy does not generate enough operating income to cover those expenses. Therefore, the company will need to either sell Bitcoin or refinance its debt to keep covering its interest expenses. In the event that Bitcoin crashes, that becomes hard to do. How steep a fall in the price of Bitcoin would be required in order for MSTR to experience solvency issues? We can get at that by reviewing some facts: MicroStrategy had $4.21 billion worth of debt, bearing $18 million in quarterly interest expenses at the end of the third quarter. The future amount of interest is higher because the company issued a $1 billion interest-bearing bond right before the quarter ended (on September 20 ). The yield on the $1 billion note was 0.625%, meaning it adds $6.25 million in annual interest expenses. It’s likely that none of this showed up in the third quarter income statement because the new bond does not make its first payment until March 15, 2025. Therefore, forward annual interest expense is likely $78.25 million ($6.25 million plus $72 million from the previously mentioned $18 million quarterly payments). The company issued $3 billion in convertible debt since the end of the third quarter (with no interest attached to it). That brings the total debt to $7.21 billion. It has $2.05 billion in maturities coming up in the next five years. MSTR’s Bitcoin was worth $44.5 billion at the time of this writing. Given the above facts, what level of Bitcoin price decline would cause serious problems for MSTR? One thing we know is that, at an 84% price decline, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin value would drop below the value of its debt. Such a decline would take the company’s Bitcoin to $7.12 billion. That’s not such an immediate threat in itself because the company’s debt carries very little interest. However, it could be a threat over time: $78.25 million in interest is a little over 1% of $7.12 billion, so MicroStrategy having to sell Bitcoin at such a level would gradually chip away at the value of the BTC holdings. Also, MicroStrategy has two maturities totaling $2.05 billion coming up in 2027 and 2028, which would eat up 28.8% of the company’s Bitcoin in a scenario where BTC were down 84% from today’s level. Last but not least, MicroStrategy had about $398 million more operating costs than revenue last quarter, which works out to $1.59 billion per year, and that also has to be covered somehow. Unless the operating business were sold off, these expenses would eat up all of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin in 4.47 years, in a scenario where BTC had declined 84% in price. Considering the maturities, interest expenses and operating expenses all together, the costs would burn through all of MSTR’s Bitcoin in about three years–again assuming it’s down 84%. That would be a real solvency risk for MicroStrategy. Now, of course, the above assumes that MicroStrategy doesn’t refinance its debt or sell its operating business. Selling the operating business is an option, although it only kicks the can down the road a few years. Refinancing debt creates issues because, if Bitcoin were down 84%, then MicroStrategy’s stock would likely be down too, meaning there’d be little appetite for convertible bonds and the company would probably have to issue at very high interest rates to get any takers. For these reasons, I believe that MicroStrategy would be existentially threatened in a situation where Bitcoin declined 84% in price. Valuation An additional concern for anybody considering going long MicroStrategy today is that the company is arguably overvalued, even in a scenario where Bitcoin trades flat or goes up slightly. The company currently trades at 21.94 times last quarter’s book value . It also trades at 162 times sales. The “actual” price/book ratio is likely somewhat lower now because of the gains Bitcoin has made, but is still probably greater than one. This begs the question: why pay a premium for a stock that has become essentially a bet on another asset? MicroStrategy’s operations are nowhere near profitable; if the company has anything going for it, it’s the Bitcoin horde. However, it trades at very high multiples to said horde, and its heavy amount of leverage creates severe problems in a scenario where Bitcoin declines precipitously in price. MicroStrategy multiples (Seeking Alpha Quant) A Concluding Note Before concluding, I should address one critique that could be made of the argument I outlined in this article: that the scenario I modelled (a -84% BTC price change) is very extreme. It is extreme, but not unprecedented: as I showed at the start of the article, BTC has declined more than 80% in price at least three times. It’s plausible to think it will do so again. Additionally, sometimes extreme scenarios can illustrate general principles. Although MicroStrategy would not become insolvent with Bitcoin down 40%, 50% or 60%, the issues that appear in my -84% scenario appear in milder forms in smaller BTC price crashes. Does MicroStrategy cease existing because of a 50% Bitcoin price dip? No, but the general problem that my model uncovered–the problem of having to sell off Bitcoin at unfavorable prices to cover operating expenses and interest–definitely starts rearing its ugly head in such a scenario. For this reason, I think that MicroStrategy faces too much tail risk to be investable. Sure, the company will thrive if Bitcoin keeps rising, but it isn’t prudent to just assume that a raging bull market will continue forever. It’s in the nature of volatile assets to come down in price sometimes, and Bitcoin is nothing if not volatile.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4745030-microstrategy-too-exposed-to-bitcoins-volatility?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37796611.jpeg
37796610,https://zycrypto.com/?p=99040,1734521571,"Expert Details Why Spot Litecoin ETFs Could Hit Market Before XRP, Solana ETFs","Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst expects multiple new crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to launch in 2025 amid anticipated changes in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) leadership since Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Wall Street is pushing for Ripple’s XRP to win a U.S.-listed spot ETF, following in the footsteps of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), which scored their own spot ETFs earlier this year. However, the Bloomberg analyst suggests that an XRP, or even Solana (ETF), will likely happen after a Litecoin ETF launches. Bitcoin, Ethereum Combo Funds To Lead ETF Wave Of 2025 Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas took to X to reveal that he expects “a wave of cryptocurrency ETFs next year, albeit not all at once”, sharing an analysis from fellow ETF analyst James Seyffart. Balchunas anticipates Bitcoin and Ethereum combo ETFs hitting the market, as well as potential offerings for Litecoin, XRP, Solana, and HBAR. In fact, he is certain that the new Bitcoin and Ether combo funds will be greenlighted first, followed by ETFs tracking Litecoin (LTC) or Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) ETFs. Notably, asset managers, including Bitwise, Hashdex, and Franklin Templeton, have already filed to introduce the Bitcoin and Ethereum combo ETFs. The SEC is widely expected to embrace a more crypto-friendly outlook next year after pro-crypto Paul Atkins was nominated to replace crypto foe SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Gensler announced that he would step down from the agency on the day of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. However, this does not mean that XRP ETFs will be greenlit shortly after Atkins takes office, according to the Bloomberg ETF expert. XRP, Solana ETFs Not Coming In Near Future? Notably, Balchunas doesn’t think the Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve spot XRP and SOL ETFs. As you know, both XRP and Solana have been named as securities in pending lawsuits in the US. As such, these issues must first be resolved before the SEC can grant its approval. But, neither LTC nor HBAR has ever been called a security by the SEC, which makes their path to spot exchange-traded funds less complex than larger market-cap assets like XRP and Solana. Moreover, Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin, hence it may be considered a “commodity”, just like its progenitor. While Balchunas sees HABR and LTC as having a higher likelihood of winning SEC approval, he said it is unclear whether there is enough investor demand for the ETF products. As of press time, Canary Capital is the only asset manager that has filed registration documents for a spot LTC ETF with the SEC.",NEUTRAL,LTC | SOL | XRP,BTC | LTC | REGULATION | SOL | XRP,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/expert-details-why-spot-litecoin-etfs-could-hit-market-before-xrp-solana-etfs/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

ASIC claims that Binance misclassified over 500 retail investors as wholesale clients, denying them important consumer protections under Australian law. The charges are serious and Binance needs strong evidence to come out clean as in worse worst-case scenario they might lose their licence in Australia. What Happened? Between July 2022 and April 2023, Binance Australia allowed retail investors to trade risky crypto derivative products. However, these investors were wrongly labeled as wholesale clients, which meant they didn’t receive essential protections like proper disclosure statements and access to dispute resolution schemes. This misclassification affected 83% of Binance’s Australian clients. ASIC’s Concerns ASIC has accused Binance of not operating fairly and abiding by the laws. According to the regulator, Binance’s compliance systems were inadequate and not transparent, as an outcome many clients reportedly suffered financial losses. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court stated that Binance failed to meet the requirements of its financial services license. What’s Next for Binance? Binance compliance issues are not new and many countries have taken down Binance’s violations strictly like Nigeria, India, and US agencies even linked the firm to illegal money laundering cases to fund terrorist groups in Hamas. Currently, Binance is facing an Intellectual property theft case in the US. In the meanwhile, Mark Longo, who owns Peanut the Squirrel , has asked Binance to stop using the name “PNUT” for its memecoin, saying it violates his trademark. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : South Korean Ex-Lawmaker Accused of Major Crypto Tax Evasion , ASIC Crypto Crackdown Before Binance, ASIC fined Kraken , a major crypto platform, for offering illegal margin trading products in Australia which caused local traders to lose over $8 million. For investors, these recent cases are reminders of the importance of proper protection and the risks involved in trading crypto derivatives. While the US is planning to bring crypto-friendly regulations other countries are still struggling to streamline crypto asset challenges with old restricted crypto policies. Will it be too late for Australia to realize the real crypto game?

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Here’s Why Analysts Think So,"Analysts suggest Dogecoin is on the cusp of resuming its uptrend after an extensive consolidation period. Shortly after Donald Trump's election victory, the leading meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE) surged 220% from $0.15139 to $0.48434 as investors speculated that the incoming administration would support crypto. While this rally has stalled in the past few weeks, with the doggy-themed crypto shedding some of its gains to trade around $0.38429, analysts now suggest it is ready for its next move.Dogecoin (DOGE) Uptrend to Resume?Crypto trader ""Olivier Đ X"" has suggested that Dogecoin's price rally is set to resume. The analyst disclosed this in an X post on Tuesday, December 17, asserting that the meme coin was staging a price reversal to the upside on its 4-hour candle chart.Per Olivier Ð X's analysis, DOGE is completing a breakout of a descending channel on the 4-hour candle chart. According to the trader, the asset should resume its uptrend after breaking an emerging resistance around the $0.4140 price point. This pattern notably also has the potential to expand into an ascending triangle chart pattern. Chart showing Olivier D X's analysis of Dogecoin/USDT 4-hour candle chart.

The move comes as Bitwise continues to await U.S. regulatory approval for its Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). Launched on December 17, the new ETP offers investors an annual percentage yield (APY) of 6.48%, surpassing similar offerings from competitors like 21Shares, which provides a 5.49% APY, the firm said in a recent press release . Bitwise Sets BSOL’s Management Fee at 0.85% The management fee for BSOL is 0.85%, significantly lower than 21Shares’ 2.5% fee. The product was developed in partnership with Marinade, a self-custodial automation tool. The launch of BSOL follows Bitwise’s earlier introduction of ESOL, a Solana-based ETP that debuted in August after the firm’s acquisition of nine European-listed crypto ETPs from the ETC Group. While ESOL does not support staking rewards, BSOL aims to address this gap by incorporating the staking feature. “Solana is one of the rising star assets in the space, and we’re thrilled to be launching BSOL, the third staking ETP we are launching this year, after the Ethereum and Aptos staking ETPs in February and November respectively,” said Hunter Horsley, CEO and Co-Founder at Bitwise. Bitwise’s efforts to expand in Europe come as it continues to pursue regulatory approval for a spot Solana ETF in the United States. In November, the firm registered a statutory trust in Delaware, a step toward filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BREAKING: This morning, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETP (Ticker: BSOL, ISIN: DE000A4A59D2) has officially been listed on Xetra. BSOL is designed to offer the best possible outcomes for investors looking to access Solana’s total return profile through staking: Competitive… pic.twitter.com/URcYZ5YaNH — Bitwise Europe (formerly ETC Group) (@Bitwise_Europe) December 18, 2024 Industry insiders remain optimistic about the potential for a U.S.-approved Solana ETF, with VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, predicting high chances of approval by the end of 2025. The addition of BSOL is part of Bitwise’s broader strategy to expand its crypto ETP offerings, which now account for over $4.5 billion in assets under management. The ESOL product alone currently holds $24 million in assets. Bitwise’s chief investment officer, Matt Hougan, and research head, Ryan Rasmussen, have also made bold forecasts, predicting Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by 2025 and eventually surpass gold’s $18 trillion market cap by 2029. Solana Outpaces Ethereum in Terms of New Developers Bitwise’s focus on Solana products comes as the ecosystem continues to attract more users and developers. A recent developer report by Electric Capital revealed that Solana has attracted more new developers than Ethereum for the first year since 2016. This is because, in July, Solana onboarded more developers than Ethereum. The report found that 7,625 out of 39,148 new developers in 2024 used Solana as their first blockchain. Meanwhile, 6,456 have explored Ethereum this year. Furthermore, institutional investment in Solana-based blockchain applications rebounded in the third quarter of 2024, with Solana’s decentralized applications (DApps) attracting $173 million across 29 funding rounds.

At the time of writing, data from CoinGecko showed that the token had fallen by 57.8% within 24 hours to settle at $0.02892. Airdrop Aftermath The highly-anticipated airdrop launched on December 17 saw about 62.8 billion PENGU tokens distributed to millions of qualified NFT holders, traders, and team members. However, following an initial surge that catapulted the token into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, it suffered a swift sell-off that saw its value plummet by more than 60%, falling from a high of $0.06845 to a low of $0.027. Interestingly, the damage wasn’t limited to the cryptocurrency, with Pudgy Penguins’ NFT collection suffering a similar fate. Within a single day, it saw its floor price plunge by more than 48% to 17.1 ETH, about $64,450, a stark contrast to its all-time high (ATH) level of 36.33 ETH. The downtrend notwithstanding, information from CryptoSlam showed an increase in trading activity, with the collection’s daily sales volume skyrocketing 258% to $21.7 million. While some investors cashed out their holdings, others used the opportunity to buy the dip, with the average sale price currently sitting at 19.89 ETH. A Pattern of Post-Airdrop Volatility While the rapid drop in PENGU’s market value may have raised some eyebrows, the phenomenon is not particularly new, with several other cryptocurrency giveaways leading to a market frenzy. Some observers have attributed this to an emerging trend among airdrop recipients who quickly cash out their holdings, leading to a marked price instability at the beginning of a coin’s post-distribution trading. For example, NFT marketplace Magic Eden’s ME token and Movement Network’s MOVE also experienced similar patterns following their respective airdrops. Both of them registered sharp divestment, with ME in particular losing 80% of its value as thousands of claimants exited their positions. However, regardless of the turbulence, PENGU still retains a market cap just shy of $2 billion, placing it at #78 among the largest cryptocurrencies in the market. Additionally, as of this writing, its price had made some marginal recoveries and was 10.5% above its lowest level recorded only hours ago.

Known for its strict regulatory standards, the NYDFS approval underscores RLUSD’s compliance and credibility within the digital asset market. RLUSD, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar, offers transparency, stability, and reliability for users globally.

We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Unlocking New Use Cases and On-Chain Liquidity The introduction of RLUSD is expected to drive liquidity and innovation within the XRP Ledger (XRPL), a decentralized and open-source blockchain network. Known for its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, XRPL will benefit from RLUSD as a stable, on-chain asset for payments, lending, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other financial services. Schwartz highlighted RLUSD’s role in creating “countless opportunities” for developers and users. The stablecoin’s launch allows developers to build applications with reduced volatility risks, offering reliable solutions for cross-border transactions, decentralized applications (dApps), and financial products. Ripple’s Long-Term Vision for XRPL Adoption RLUSD’s launch aligns with Ripple’s strategy to expand the utility of XRPL and accelerate blockchain adoption globally. As a trusted stablecoin, RLUSD is expected to attract new participants to the ecosystem, improving liquidity for businesses and users while fostering innovation in financial services.

37796285,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629560,1734520881,Scammers use fake Ledger data breach emails to steal crypto,"A new phishing campaign is reportedly targeting Ledger hardware wallet users through fake data breach notification emails. Security researchers at BleepingComputer reported that scammers are sending emails that appear to come from Ledger’s official support address to users. According to them, the message claims users must verify their recovery phrases due to a security breach. The scam reportedly began on December 15, 2024, and uses Amazon AWS infrastructure to appear legitimate. These phishing attempts are designed to steal users’ 24-word recovery phrases, which would give attackers complete access to victims’ cryptocurrency funds. The campaign appears to be particularly effective because it exploits real concerns stemming from Ledger’s previous 2020 data breach, an episode when customer information was actually exposed. Crypto phishing campaign appears official The fraudulent emails follow a careful pattern designed to appear official. They arrive with the subject line “Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase” and appear to come from “Ledger support@ledger.com.” However, investigators found that scammers are actually using the SendGrid email marketing platform to distribute these messages. When users click the “Verify My Recovery Phrase” button in these emails, they are redirected through multiple stages. The first redirect leads to an Amazon AWS website at a suspicious URL: product-ledg.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com. From there, users are sent to a phishing site. The phishing website shows clear technical capabilities. It includes a verification system that checks each entered word against the 2,048 valid words used in cryptocurrency recovery phrases. This real-time validation makes the site appear more legitimate to victims. The attackers also added another deceptive element: the site always claims the entered phrase is invalid to encourage multiple attempts and to probably doublecheck that they received the correct recovery words. Additional versions of this scam have also been identified. Some emails claim to be firmware update notifications, but they share the same goal of stealing users’ recovery phrases to gain access to their cryptocurrency wallets. Each entered word is transmitted immediately to the attackers’ servers. Screenshot of the fake page attempting to steal Legder users’ recovery phrase. Source: BleepingComputer Ledger has issued several security reminders Ledger has since issued several security reminders in response to this phishing campaign. The company emphasizes that it will never request recovery phrases through email, websites, or any other means. Some security recommendations shared since then have reminded users that the only legitimate use of a recovery phrase is during the initial setup of a new hardware wallet or when recovering access to an existing wallet – and these actions should only be performed on the physical Ledger device itself. Security recommendations for users to protect themselves have also reminded them to always type Ledger’s web address (ledger.com) directly into the browser rather than clicking email links. Second, users were advised to treat any email claiming to be from Ledger with extreme caution, especially those mentioning data breaches or requiring immediate action. Third, users were reminded about offline storage of recovery phrases, preferably in a secure physical location away from digital devices. For those who may have already interacted with suspicious emails or websites, they advised immediate action. Users who entered their recovery phrase into any website should transfer their funds to a new wallet with a fresh recovery phrase immediately. The original wallet should be considered compromised and should no longer be used for storing cryptocurrency.

Own The Doge DAO, a collective that holds the original ‘doge’ meme, on Tuesday said it had acquired the rights to use pet shiba inu Neiro’s images and was holding a community discussion on which NEIRO token can continue to use the dog’s liking.  “We’re pleased to announce that @kabosumama has officially granted our DAO the Neiro IP,” Own The Doge said on X. “When Atsuko revealed the name of her new adopted dog, Neiro, many tokens were launched in an attempt to capitalize on her name and story.”  “However, since then, these various tokens have battled each other to become the ‘real’ Neiro, with no agreed criteria. But it does not have to be this way. Our DAO owns the IP rights for Neiro,” the post said, adding that the doge community could join the DAO and vote for which token they considered the “real” one.  The ongoing discussion will let the community and outside members comment and find a way forward to use Neiro’s IP, before being put into an actual on-chain proposal voted on by DOG token holders.  Neiro is the shiba inu adopted by the human owner of Kabosu, the dog that inspired the “doge” meme, after she passed away in July. The announcement of a new dog spurred the creation of numerous NEIRO tokens on Solana and Ethereum at the time — with two such tokens surging to hundreds of millions in market capitalization and enjoying active communities as of Wednesday.  As far as Neiro’s owner Kabosumama was concerned, none of the tokens were legitimate.  “I see many tokens related to Kabosu and Neiro. To clarify, I do not endorse any crypto project except @ownthedog $dog because they own the original Doge photo and IP,” she said in an X post at the time. “They are committed to doing only good every day, charitable works, and Doge culture.”  “Please watch out for token scams,” she said.  The discussion has sprouted opinions from various token teams that use or are around Neiro — each claiming to be the first or claiming to be better than the other.  “We believe the Neiro IP should correspond with the first Neiro meme coin on-chain,” @Neirowoof, the first NEIRO token on any chain, said on the discussion page. “This being the original Neiro with a dedicated community who’s mission has been to guard the legacy of Kabosu since the day Atsuko made her blog post announcing Neiro’s adoption.”  “Unfortunately, we have been up against several power-hungry forces whose only goal was to usurp the narrative for a quick financial gain. Being the first Neiro means something special, as we are the true Sister of DOGE and the Guardians of Kabosu’s Legacy. We will never stop loving both Kabosu and Neiro for the lovely creatures and memes that they are,” the team added.  The discussions come as IP-backed memecoins start to become an important topic in the world of memecoins, which have so far operated without any legal troubles.  IP, or intellectual property, can include characters from memes, video games, or any cultural phenomenon that have officially been trademarked or copyrighted before their tokens were offered to the public.  Tokens are starting to face the risk of legal action from IP holders if they do not own or securing rights to the IP they emulate or represent. Non-IP tokens like chillguy (CHILLGUY) and pnut (PNUT) are already facing legal challenges despite being popular and widely traded.  On Monday, Mark Longo, the owner of Peanut the Squirrel which inspired the PNUT token, issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, accusing it of trademark infringement for listing and offering the PNUT memecoin.  Longo claimed Binance used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness without permission, noting he has been using the PNUT brand for educational and animal welfare initiatives since 2017.

Linea, backed by Ethereum research and development firm Consensys, is also credited with developing a trust-minimized version of ERC-3668, which supports decentralized cross-chain name resolution for subnames. Namechain is Part of the ENSv2 Upgrade The launch of Namechain is part of the broader “ENSv2” upgrade introduced earlier this year. The upgrade shifts primary .eth domain activities, such as registrations and renewals, to the Layer 2 Namechain. However, name resolution will continue to be handled on Ethereum’s Layer 1, maintaining seamless integration with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. By utilizing Layer 2 technology, ENS aims to increase transaction throughput, enabling higher volumes of domain registrations and renewals. The shift is expected to make ENS services more flexible and cost-effective for users. “Our joint development roadmap will focus on protocol enhancements for ENS and Linea, in addition to the broader mission of serving L2s and their users,” the announcement reads. “This technical foundation will enable innovative applications in cross-chain name resolution, decentralized hosting, and identity verification.” Big news from ENS Labs We’ve officially partnered with @LineaBuild to build Namechain, our Layer 2 solution for scaling ENS to the next level. Here’s why this matters for decentralized identity and the future of ENS pic.twitter.com/LqDMmZW7YS — ens.eth (@ensdomains) December 17, 2024 ENSv2 Works in Tande With Namechain It is worth noting that ENSv2 will work in tandem with Namechain to improve the user experience. ENS serves as a blockchain-based alternative to traditional domain name systems like “.com” and “.org,” offering a human-readable format for Ethereum addresses. ENS Labs previously revealed in February that it was actively researching ways to create its own layer 2 solution. Although ENS Labs hinted at collaborating with a major industry partner for the expansion, details of the partnership remain undisclosed. In recent months, ENS has expanded its functionality, including integrating with payment platforms PayPal and Venmo in September, enabling crypto transfers for over 270 million users in the United States. The excitement around Namechain has also positively impacted the ENS token, which has gained over 16% over the past week. The token is up by around 130% over the past month, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37795884,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375126,1734520323,Good News for Ripple? Anti-Crypto SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw Might Not be Renominated,"TL;DR Ripple supporters are optimistic about potential SEC leadership changes, including departures of anti-crypto officials. Donald Trump’s nomination of pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins as the next SEC Chairman fuels speculation that the agency may adopt a more innovation-friendly approach, possibly leading to a settlement in the case against Ripple. The XRP Army Cheers the Rumors Despite Ripple’s numerous partial court wins, the legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains ongoing. The tussle was close to a final resolution earlier this year when Federal Judge Torres ordered the company to pay a $125 million penalty for violating certain laws. While Ripple was ready to abide by the ruling, the securities regulator appealed a 2023 verdict, thus extending the case. After all, the aforementioned fine represented just a fraction of the $2 billion that the SEC initially insisted. According to some industry participants , though , Ripple has a better chance to emerge victorious due to a combination of factors. Perhaps the most important include the upcoming resignation of the SEC’s Chairman Gary Gensler. He stayed in charge for over three years, during which the agency filed numerous lawsuits against crypto businesses. The end of his reign was rather expected since Donald Trump promised to fire him after officially becoming president of the United States. Most recently, the Ripple community celebrated another potential change in the structure of the SEC. According to Eleanor Terrett (journalist at Fox Business), Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw will not be renominated to her position. She is known for her anti-crypto stance, warning about the potential for fraud and manipulation in the sector. Earlier this year, Crenshaw even opposed the approval of the spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. Those cheering her potential absence from the SEC include popular X users like Moon Lambo and Zach Humphries. Fred Rispoli – an American attorney who has been following the developments of the Ripple v. SEC case – also seemed pleased. The New SEC Leader The Commission might indeed go into a pro-crypto direction next year under the leadership of the upcoming Chairman, Paul Atkins, who was nominated by Donald Trump. He has been a proponent of the cryptocurrency sector, advocating for a regulatory approach that fosters innovation in space while ensuring investor protection. It will be interesting to see whether the SEC will become less hostile toward the industry during his reign and whether the Ripple case will finally conclude with a settlement.

The Tokyo-based company revealed on December 18 that it expects to generate ¥890 million ($5.8 million) in revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, a significant jump from ¥261 million the previous year. Operating profits are projected at ¥270 million, a remarkable turnaround from a ¥468 million loss in the previous fiscal year. A major part of this success stems from Metaplanet’s Bitcoin put option strategy , which brought in ¥520 million in income. The firm attributes this performance to a surge in Bitcoin’s value, further amplified by its decision to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset in April to hedge against currency depreciation. The company also benefited from strong performance in its hospitality business, which includes operating the Royal Oak Hotel in Tokyo’s Gotanda district through its subsidiary, Wen Tokyo Co. Bitcoin as a New Core Business Line Beyond using Bitcoin for treasury management , Metaplanet is taking steps to integrate Bitcoin into its core operations. The company recently announced the establishment of a new business line focused on “Bitcoin accumulation and management.” This initiative involves leveraging financial instruments such as loans, equity, and convertible bonds to expand its Bitcoin holdings while continuing to generate income through put option sales. For each put option contract sold, Metaplanet earns a premium, regardless of whether the option is exercised. In cases where the option is exercised, the company gains an opportunity to acquire Bitcoin at a pre-determined strike price, aligning with its strategic goals. The firm has also diversified its Bitcoin-related activities by obtaining a license to operate a Japanese version of Bitcoin Magazine, signaling plans to tap into Bitcoin-related marketing and media revenue streams. Metaplanet Eyes Top Spot in Asia Metaplanet now holds 1,142 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $119.4 million, making it Asia’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after Boyaa Interactive . The company also issued its fourth bond worth ¥4.5 billion on December 16, further supporting its Bitcoin strategy. With Bitcoin at the core of its turnaround, Metaplanet is achieving financial stability and carving a niche in the rapidly evolving crypto economy.

Could this correction lead to a major crash for Ethereum?Ethereum Price AnalysisAfter a double-top reversal at the key $4,000 resistance level, Ethereum's price has dropped by 4.41% over the past 24 hours. The bearish retracement is nearing a local support trendline. Ethereum Price chart The double-top reversal suggests a potential decline toward the $3,600 mark. A fall to this level will materialize if Ethereum breaks below the local support, which could trigger increased selling pressure.Currently, Ethereum is trading at $3,837, reflecting a 1.43% intraday drop from the opening price of $3,837.

37795536,https://finbold.com/?p=220449,1734519609,Crypto expert reveals final Bitcoin high of this bull market,"Since it reignited the bull run in earnest in early November, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has rallied 56.52% to recent highs above $108,000, and, even when the latest drop to the press time price of $105,644, the cryptocurrency remains 52.17% in the green within the time frame. BTC 6-month price chart. Source: Finbold The relatively continuous strength of BTC and the fact that the market has been rising for approximately 12 months by press time on December 18 have led many to question if the upsurge will persist or if the next ‘crypto winter’ is around the corner. One way investors and analysts have been trying to gauge when Bitcoin will peak in this cycle has been by examining the historical charts and, based on a December 18 X post, the prominent on-chain expert Ali Martinez may have identified where BTC will top. Here’s how high Bitcoin will go in this cycle Having superimposed the gains of previous bull markets – the 2017 and 2020 ones, to be precise – Martinez concluded that Bitcoin will be free of noteworthy pullbacks until it hits $110,000. Such an estimate appears plausible as, earlier this week, BTC broke the recent trend of experiencing a Monday drop after a Sunday rally. Furthermore, investors appear to have gotten used to MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR )-induced shocks as the latest news of a massive purchase did little to drive Bitcoin lower, unlike, for example , on November 24 and November 25. Still, Martinez foresees two major correction zones in the relatively near future. Specifically, the cryptocurrency analyst forecasted that a significant pullback would occur after $125,000 was reached and that hitting $150,000 would generate an even greater downturn before the rally could continue. Finally, the on-chain expert concluded that whether the current cycle mimics the 2017 or 2020 bull market , Bitcoin will not go higher than $220,000 before the next crypto winter. Where BTC will top in the current cycle based on historical patterns. Source: Ali Martinez Why $220,000 might not be a realistic Bitcoin price target Interestingly, such historical pattern analysis runs contrary to multiple experts and prominent investors. Indeed, the author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Robert Kiyosaki , as well as the legendary Wall Street analyst Tom Lee, both forecasted BTC would hit $250,000 before 2025 is over. Simultaneously, cryptocurrency lobbyist Perianne Boring went even further with a prediction Bitcoin would climb to at least $800,000 next year. Elsewhere, all three targets may prove overly ambitious as, despite the undeniable upward momentum, the world’s premier cryptocurrency is already up some 150% in the last 12 months, and, despite historical rallies being even greater, cycle gains have been diminishing as BTC price increased.

37795548,https://coinpaper.com/6599/remote-unveils-usdc-payments-for-contractors-in-69-countries,1734519600,Remote Unveils USDC Payments for Contractors in 69 Countries,"Global businesses are increasingly turning to stablecoins to streamline payments and improve financial infrastructure. London-based stablecoin provider BVNK secured $50 million in a Series B funding round to expand operations into the US, while payroll platform Remote introduced USD Coin (USDC) payments for contractors in 69 countries. Global Payroll Provider Remote Introduces USD Coin Payments for Contractors in 69 Countries Remote, a leading global payroll provider, announced a groundbreaking partnership with payment giant Stripe. This collaboration enables US-based companies using Remote's platform to pay their contractors in USD Coin (USDC) across 69 countries. The new offering, powered by the Coinbase-developed Base blockchain, aims to simplify and enhance cross-border payments, catering to the evolving needs of a post-pandemic workforce. Remote’s announcement brings attention to the increasing demand for seamless, fast, and reliable contractor payment solutions. According to the company, the integration of stablecoin payments enhances its suite of automation features, which include contractor onboarding, invoicing, and payroll processing. “Stablecoin payments complement Remote’s powerful automation features for onboarding, invoicing, and paying contractors,” the company noted in its statement. This development aligns with the shifting global hiring models, which have accelerated since the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in remote work and cross-border hiring. By adopting USDC —a dollar-pegged stablecoin—Remote ensures that contractors have a reliable means of storing value in US currency. This is particularly beneficial in regions where economic instability or inflation erodes the value of local currencies. Remote contractors will now have the option to receive payments directly in USDC through wallet addresses on Base , Coinbase’s layer-2 network launched in August 2023. Employer companies will continue to fund these transactions in US dollars, ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks and maintaining operational simplicity. Job van der Voort, Remote’s co-founder and CEO, highlighted the customer-driven nature of this innovation. “We’re adding a feature that has been highly requested by our customers, enabling them to pay contractors how they prefer, while maintaining the compliance and simplicity Remote is known for.” The integration of USDC payments introduces several advantages for contractors and employers alike: Hedge Against Inflation: In many countries, where local currencies face devaluation, receiving payments in USDC provides contractors with a stable store of value pegged to the US dollar. Rapid Settlement: Stripe’s USDC infrastructure facilitates near-instant settlements, eliminating the delays associated with traditional bank transfers and foreign exchange conversions. Global Reach: Unlike conventional payment systems, USDC on the Base network provides a truly borderless solution, enabling faster and more efficient transactions across different jurisdictions. Stripe’s role in this initiative marks its continued resurgence in the cryptocurrency space. Once a pioneer in crypto payments, Stripe introduced Bitcoin payment services in 2014 but discontinued them in 2018, citing volatility and inefficiencies. However, 2024 marked a pivotal year for Stripe, as it re-entered the crypto ecosystem, launching USDC payment services over the summer and establishing a partnership with Coinbase to support USDC transactions on the Base network. Stripe’s return to crypto comes as businesses increasingly demand innovative financial solutions that leverage blockchain technology. The agreement with Coinbase in June 2024 to facilitate USDC payments on Base was a critical step, and Stripe formally initiated its USDC payment service in October. Simplifying Global Payroll Compliance Remote and Stripe’s partnership addresses not only payment speed and stability but also compliance. Remote conducts robust Know Your Customer (KYC) verification during contractor onboarding, and Stripe follows suit with its own KYC processes. These measures ensure that payments remain compliant with local and international regulations, offering peace of mind to both employers and contractors. The integration of USDC payments is part of a broader trend of cryptocurrency adoption in global payroll systems. As remote work continues to reshape traditional employment models, solutions like those offered by Remote and Stripe are helping companies overcome the logistical and financial challenges of managing an international workforce. For contractors, the ability to receive payments in USDC represents a significant step toward financial autonomy and resilience. For employers, this innovation provides an efficient, secure, and scalable way to manage payments across borders without the complexities of traditional banking systems. BVNK Secures $50 Million Series B Funding to Drive US Expansion London-based stablecoin infrastructure company BVNK has successfully closed a $50 million Series B funding round, signaling its ambitious plans to penetrate the US market. Led by Haun Ventures, the funding round saw participation from prominent investors, including Coinbase Ventures, Scribble Ventures, DRW VC, and existing backers Avenir and Tiger Global. The fresh capital injection brings BVNK's valuation to an impressive $750 million. The funding will facilitate BVNK’s entry into the United States, with plans to establish offices in San Francisco and New York City. These hubs will focus on developing local banking infrastructure and securing operational licenses to cater to American companies. “Stablecoins represent the most significant infrastructure upgrade to global payments in decades. [...] This is the kind of innovation that defines the future of finance,” said Diogo Mónica, General Partner at Haun Ventures, highlighting the transformative potential of stablecoins in financial services. The United States is poised to be the largest market for stablecoins, with legislative clarity anticipated to further validate their role in the global financial system. BVNK’s move comes at a time when the US stablecoin sector is witnessing significant momentum, buoyed by regulatory advancements and a growing focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This latest funding round builds on BVNK’s prior successes, including a $43.2 million funding round led by Tiger Global in 2022, which valued the company at $327 million. In just two years, BVNK has more than doubled its valuation, driven by robust growth metrics. The company claims to have processed over $10 billion in annual payment volumes, achieving 200% year-on-year growth. BVNK offers white-label infrastructure, enabling businesses to manage stablecoin payments internally. It boasts partnerships with global stablecoin giants such as PayPal, Circle , and First Digital, solidifying its position as a key player in the sector. As BVNK enters the US, it will face competition from established stablecoin infrastructure providers such as Paxos, Circle, and Ripple. However, its strong track record and innovative offerings could give it a competitive edge. BVNK’s co-founders—Jesse Hemson-Struthers, Donald Jackson, and Chris Harmse—bring a wealth of experience from the financial services industry, positioning the company as a formidable challenger in the space. The stablecoin industry is on a steep growth trajectory, with the total market capitalization currently at $203 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Experts predict the sector could surpass $1 trillion by 2035, driven by increasing adoption for cross-border remittances and DeFi liquidity solutions. The entry of more companies into the stablecoin ecosystem is indicative of the sector's potential. Ripple recently launched its regulated stablecoin, RLUSD, after receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), further demonstrating the market’s maturity. Stablecoins: Transforming Global Payments BVNK’s expansion comes at a time when stablecoins are being recognized as a game-changing innovation in the payments industry. Their ability to offer fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions has made them increasingly popular for both businesses and consumers. By enabling seamless cross-border payments and serving as a hedge against inflation in unstable economies, stablecoins are becoming integral to global financial infrastructure. With its ambitious US expansion, BVNK aims to capitalize on the stablecoin industry's growth potential while navigating a complex regulatory landscape. The establishment of local operations in the US will be pivotal in ensuring compliance and delivering tailored solutions to American businesses. As BVNK takes its next steps, it joins a growing list of innovators reshaping the future of finance. Its entry into the competitive US market, bolstered by strong investor confidence and a proven track record, marks a significant milestone in the evolution of stablecoin infrastructure. The surge in stablecoin-focused projects and investments highlights the sector’s bright future. BVNK’s story is a strong indication of the transformative power of stablecoins in modern finance, paving the way for faster, more inclusive, and more reliable global payments. As the stablecoin industry continues to mature, companies like BVNK are at the forefront of a financial revolution that promises to redefine the way value is transferred worldwide.",POSITIVE,USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | USDC,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6599/remote-unveils-usdc-payments-for-contractors-in-69-countries,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

A Texas man received a two-year prison term for hiding significant gains from Bitcoin ( BTC ) trades between 2017 and 2019, which led to over $1 million in unpaid tax. The case highlights the federal government’s growing abilities to trail blockchain transactions and hold crypto users accountable for tax compliance. https://t.co/RsL0ZAa9dl — TaxDAO (@TaxDAO_DC) December 18, 2024 Ahlgren, who started investing in BTC early on in 2011, purchased 1,366 BTC through Coinbase in 2015. He had sold 640 BTC by Oct. 2017, pocketing $3.7 million in profits to buy real estate in Utah. However, when he filed his 2017 tax returns, Ahlgren inflated the purchase price of the BTC to decrease his reported capital gains severely.

To disguise his transactions, Ahlgren used a number of tricks designed to cover his tracks, including moving BTC between multiple wallets , cash-for-offline-BTC exchanges, and crypto mixing services that disguised transaction details. These strategies, which aimed to exploit the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain, did not go unnoticed by the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. Federal officials pointed to the importance of this case in recognizing cryptocurrency as a taxable asset and subject to the same legal scrutiny as fiat currency. The DOJ and IRS have come a long way in forensic blockchain capabilities, which allows them to follow the trail of digital transactions through wallets and platforms.

As the first criminal tax evasion conviction related to cryptocurrencies in the United States, the ruling sets a significant precedent for crypto investors who may try to evade paying taxes.

According to a press release published on Dec. 18, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission accused Binance Australia Derivatives of misclassifying more than 500 retail clients as “wholesale clients.” As a result, the exchange did not provide the necessary consumer protection for these clients who were exposed to high-risk crypto assets. According to the Australian financial services laws, firms are required to provide retail clients with a product disclosure statement and give them access to a compliant dispute resolution scheme. The Australian body alleged the exchange failed to do so for 83% of its Australian client base from a time period that spanned July 7, 2022 until April 21, 2023. ASIC Deputy Chair, Sarah Court, claimed that Binance failed to ensure proper customer protection for its services in accordance with the Australian financial services license, which Binance Australia held at the time before it was cancelled in April 2023. “Many of these clients suffered significant financial losses. In 2023, we oversaw compensation payments by Binance of approximately $13 million to affected clients,” said Court in a statement. You might also like: Australia’s ASIC seeks stricter oversight of stablecoins, wrapped tokens According to the document , ASIC also accused Binance of failing to make a target market determination, not having a compliant internal dispute resolution system, and being unable to ensure its employees were “competent to provide the financial services provided,” inferred from how the client wholesale assessment was conducted. As a result of these allegations, ASIC stated that it shall take further legal action by seeking penalties, declaration and adverse publicity orders. “We are consulting with the sector to improve regulatory clarity, and ASIC will continue to use the full range of regulatory and enforcement tools to safeguard consumers and uphold market integrity in the digital asset sector,” added Court. On April 6, 2023, ASIC cancelled the Australian financial services or AFS license held by Binance Australia Derivatives in response to a cancel request from the firm. In July 2023, Australian authorities launched a raid on the office of Binance Australia’s derivatives division as part of an extensive investigation conducted by ASIC.

37795606,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629544,1734519502,South Korean congressman gets six months for hiding $7.5M in crypto,"A South Korean lawmaker has fallen from grace, sentenced to six months in prison for hiding $7.5 million worth of crypto. Kim Nam-kook, a former Democratic Party member, reportedly manipulated his asset declarations during his tenure in the National Assembly to cover up the fortune he amassed from crypto trading. During hearings at the Seoul Southern District Court, prosecutors accused him of deliberately transferring coins into bank deposits and then back into crypto to misrepresent his finances. Judge Jeong Woo-yong, presiding over the 9th Criminal Division, heard the case and handed down the prison term, branding the concealment an intentional obstruction of official duties. Kim’s deception started with his 2021 property declaration. He reported his total assets as 1.2 billion won ($900,000) but conveniently left out the 9.9 billion won ($7.5 million) in cryptocurrency stashed in his accounts. The next year, he did the same thing, hiding 990 million won ($750,000) in coin deposits. “The defendant intended not to declare the coins he owned,” the prosecution said in court. They further explained that his actions obstructed the ethics committee from conducting accurate evaluations. By moving his crypto holdings between bank accounts and digital wallets, Kim made it nearly impossible to track his actual wealth. South Korea’s crypto explosion South Korea has one of the world’s most active crypto markets, where digital assets rival stocks in popularity. The country’s love affair with crypto started as early as 2013, when exchanges like Korbit and Bithumb began operating. By 2017, South Korea was deep into crypto fever, with around 10% of the population investing in Bitcoin and other tokens. The “kimchi premium” phenomenon emerged, with local crypto prices soaring 20-40% above global averages. But the boom came with risks, forcing the government to act. In 2017, regulators banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), citing concerns over scams and speculative bubbles. The crash of 2018 further spurred the implementation of stricter policies, including real-name trading systems requiring exchange users to verify their identities through bank accounts. In 2021, South Korea took its crypto regulations up a notch. A new law required Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules . Despite its regulatory grip tightening, South Korea remains a crypto powerhouse. Recent trading data proves this. By December 2024, daily crypto trading volumes reached $18 billion, surpassing the stock market by 22%. Exchanges like FameEX, Upbit, and OKX dominate the scene, handling billions in transactions daily. FameEX alone reported $8.7 billion in trades on a single day in November. The government, however, continues to wrestle with how to tax this market. A planned 20% capital gains tax on crypto profits was supposed to go live in January 2025. But facing public backlash and concerns over stifling investment, lawmakers postponed it until 2027. The delay buys time for debates on balancing regulation with market growth.

A new all-time high of just over $108,000 may not last long, with buying likely to ramp up ahead of Trump’s inauguration in January. Ohio, Pennsylvania, and other states, introduce Bitcoin legislation Along with the institutions and the nation states , some of the states within the US are also looking at the practicalities of introducing strategic Bitcoin reserves. The latest state to consider such a move is Ohio . It proposes the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve fund in order to hedge against the debasement in the US dollar. Another state with similar interests is Pennsylvania, which recently introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act. This would allow its state treasury to invest up to 10% of its funds into Bitcoin. Texas , Florida, and others are preparing legislation which is likely to follow a similar path. Both Texas and Florida are big states with huge budgets that are bigger than those of most countries. Could Europe go in the same direction? European MP Sarah Knafo recently called for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the European Union. Her statement ‘No to CBDC, yes to Bitcoin’ is a call to action against the “totalitarian temptations” of what would be a government-controlled currency as opposed to a decentralised Bitcoin. She believes that Bitcoin would act as a hedge against fiscal mismanagement and government overreach, and sees Bitcoin as financial sovereignty for European citizens. $BTC correction after a week of uptrend Source: TradingView After a week of uptrend, the $BTC price has finally begun some kind of correction. The price hit the top of the ascending channel and has been rejected. It now remains to see how far down the price might go. It has already touched the 0.382 Fibonacci, so it might even bounce here. Generally, it might be expected that a deeper correction would take place, and that the price would come down to the bottom of the channel, hitting the 0.618 or the 0.786, which are reasonably strong support levels. Also, the ascending channel chart pattern would statistically see a breakdown rather than a break up out of the pattern. However, this is Bitcoin, and Bitcoin in what could be the final parabolic stage of the bull run. Therefore, normal expectations probably go out of the window. When will this Bitcoin bull market end? Source: TradingView Much is spoken about the length of this bull market. Some say that it will follow what is the current 4-year cycle, which is what Bitcoin has done so far in its history. If this is the case, there is still around a year left in the cycle, which would end in Q4 of 2025. However, some are saying that the bull market could be much shorter, and that the top could come in either Q1 or Q2 of 2025. If this is the case, the price probably has time to make one more reasonable correction. This could take $BTC back to the 0.382 Fibonacci at $85,000, or even the 0.618 Fibonacci at around $71,000. The possibility of a double top would then come into play, with the second top being higher, just as it was in the 2021 bull market. This second top could also hit the ascending trendline and get that final rejection that would bring $BTC down into the bear market. This is all conjecture, and with nation states potentially about to get into a buying race, the 4-year cycle might appear to be the more probable scenario. Whichever scenario we get, and Bitcoin might have its own improbable move up its sleeve, things are going to be incredibly exciting as we move into 2025.

Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance that if the United States were to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the price of Bitcoin could skyrocket to $500,000. He added that the US adopting BTC as a reserve asset or similar actions by other countries would cause a huge increase in the value of Bitcoin and would be a bigger rally compared to the 2024 bull market. The Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) recently prepared a blueprint for the new US administration under President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset. Additionally, several US state legislatures, including Texas and Ohio, have introduced state-level bills for Bitcoin reserve strategies. Matt Hougan also drew attention to altcoins with upward potential other than Bitcoin. At this point, Hougan stated that altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) have upward potential and predicted that they could make a big explosion in the future. Hougan stated that investors are no longer focused solely on Bitcoin and that the altcoin market is starting to attract more attention.

Rumors swirl about a token that could transform small investments into massive gains within a few years. This could be a second chance for those who missed out on earlier meme coin explosions. DOGEN: The Ultimate Memetoken for Real Alphas Who Always Win Imagine living a dream life — posh cars, fat stacks of cash, and women who turn heads. That’s the DOGEN lifestyle ! If you’re the kind of guy who’s always looking to level up, you need to check out DOGEN . This meme token is for the real alphas who always win . HODL Like a Beast, Dominate the Market This thing is about to explode! We’re talking about a 700% surge before the presale even wraps up — and that’s just the beginning. DOGEN is heating up to those insane thousand-fold gains that memetokens are famous for this season. Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain , running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point. Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run. You don’t want to miss out on this one. Got that DOGEN spirit? Good, ‘cause they’re holding an airdrop ! All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! Dogecoin Poised For a Breakout: Will $0.50 Be Its Next Target? Dogecoin is trading between $0.3588 and $0.4603. It’s near the 10-day and 100-day moving averages, hinting at a balanced market. The RSI at 47.62 shows it’s neither overbought nor oversold. If DOGE can break the $0.5145 resistance, it could surge by 12%, and hitting $0.6160 could lead to a 34% gain. However, a drop below $0.3115 might push it down 13%, with $0.2100 as the next support. Momentum indicators like Stochastic and MACD suggest mild bearish sentiment, but DOGE’s long-term 6-month gain of 227.6% reflects strong growth potential. A rally toward $0.50+ seems possible if the market turns bullish soon. Conclusion DOGE may see slower growth in the short term. DOGEN stands out as the ultimate token for those seeking luxury and success. With a projected 700% rise by presale’s end and massive potential this altcoin season, it mirrors the rise of BONK, WIF, and Popcat.

The crypto market is experiencing a sudden surge in selling pressure, leading to $418 million in liquidations within 24 hours.

Is a further decline in Binance Coin price imminent?BNB Coin Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, the Binance Coin price initially showed a bullish breakout from a triangle pattern. However, the BNB price quickly lost bullish momentum due to the broader market correction and shifted to a bearish trend. Binance Coin Price Chart After failing to surpass the 61.80% Fibonacci level at $739, the price faced four consecutive bearish candles on the 4-hour chart. As a result, the price is now threatening the $700 psychological support level.At press time, BNB traded at $708, reflecting a 1.32% intraday decline. With a lower rejection of the price, BNB is testing the 38.20% Fibonacci level.The previous bullish breakout is nullified as the coin retests its levels and breaks through the symmetrical triangle pattern. Additionally, the MACD and signal lines have crossed into bearish territory, signaling a shift in trend.However, the 4-hour RSI suggests a slight possibility of a bullish recovery, showing a minor divergence. Nevertheless, the overall technical indicators continue to point to a sell signal.Binance Coin Price TargetsGiven the lower price rejection, a post-retest reversal could help the BNB coin price reclaim the 50% Fibonacci level at $722.If this occurs, the price could continue upward, potentially targeting the 78.60% Fibonacci level at $763.40.On the bearish side, the critical support level below the $700 psychological mark lies at $684, the 23.60% Fibonacci level.",NEGATIVE,BNB,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/binance-bnb-faces-700-support-test-bears-threaten-684-low/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=binance-bnb-faces-700-support-test-bears-threaten-684-low,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

However, crypto casino Rollblock (RBLK) is leveraging the greater growth potential of GambleFi and threatening the top altcoins of GameFi. Rollblock’s GambleFi wager has produced shocking estimates of 100x or higher growth by 2026, starting when its crypto presale ends. Rollblock’s GambleFi Takeover of GameFi Potential Fuels Enormous Growth Estimates for 2025 Rollblock has flipped the script on Toncoin, Tron and Avalanche by shifting users from GameFi to GambleFi. This top altcoin offers a far more entertaining and profitable experience through GambleFi, and it is now pulling users from GameFi to the $500 billion gambling industry instead. Rollblock has accomplished this game-changing sector shift by turning the enormous potential revenue of the gambling industry into token value for its players and investors. Rollblock’s own gambling tokens are the way it returns value by using them as staking rewards or in weekly burn events. Rollblock buys its own tokens back from the market each week with a portion of the casino’s revenue to fund these operations. GameFi tokens have no way to compete with RBLK’s potential to return enormous value before the cards are even dealt. Rollblock has also created the most vibrant and entertaining platform on the internet, with global sports betting, 7,000 casino games and a massive social media ecosystem. Toncoin to Repeat 2024 Rally on Rapid GameFi Growth The Toncoin price was expected to be the biggest beneficiary of 2025’s GameFi revolution. Toncoin has a potential user base of almost 1 billion people thanks to its association with the Telegram messaging app. Toncoin is expected to onboard an enormous share of these users to GameFi applications by 2026. Toncoin already rallied 300% in 2024 on the rapid expansion of GameFi. Now analysts think the Toncoin price could repeat this rally in 2025. Tron Blends GameFi Potential With Additional Revenue Sources Tron is perhaps still the biggest name in GameFi, after being the only platform in the sector for years. While Tron has to share the stage with other GameFi tokens now, it is still the most popular platform for developers. The Tron price enjoyed an over 200% rally in 2024. Moreover, Tron is also a popular platform for stablecoins and DEXs. Therefore, the Tron price could also see over 300% growth in 2025 on a mix of GameFi and other revenue. Avalanche 9000 Makes Platform Ideal for GameFi Developers Avalanche recently entered the GameFi sector thanks to its latest upgrade. The Avalanche 9000 upgrade makes it much easier for developers to deploy signature blockchains. Therefore, Avalanche is likely to be another favored platform for GameFi developers. The Avalanche price was already on course for 100% to 200% growth in 2025. Now this GameFi boost is expected to send the Avalanche price soaring 200% or higher toward all-time highs. Rollblock Set To Revolutionize GameFi While Toncoin, Tron and Avalanche could offer strong returns, Rollblock’s GambleFi takeover of GameFi’s potential is projected to see RBLK soar over 100x higher out of its crypto presale. The current RBLK price of $0.0415 is also expected to steadily increase over the next few weeks as it crosses through its final presale stages before its big launch in early 2025.

The inherently volatile meme token became even more risky after an exploiter attacked other traders. A sandwich attack led to another price slide for HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu 2.0 (BITCOIN). The attack affected a relatively new token with only 657 holders. The sandwich attack made use of the meme token’s liquidity pool, which was compromised by a logic flaw in its smart contract. The meme token is also causing confusion, as it spoofs the original BITCOIN token of the same ticker, but a different smart contract. The relatively obscure token is trying to make its presence on social media, though still having a market cap under $1M. The token only started trading at the end of November, and has gone through several boom and bust cycles, before becoming the target of a hacker. Unlocked liquidity allows the hacker to perform a trading attack The hacker chose a token that was a version of the more high-profile meme with almost the same name and ticker. However, this token has much smaller liquidity pools . The attack withdrew $243K, which was later mixed through TornadoCash. The draining of the liquidity affected the BITCOIN/WETH pair on Uniswap V1, while other pairs for the same asset are unaffected. All DEX pairs for this asset only contain limited liquidity, which is still unlocked and unsecured. The unlocked liquidity allowed the hacker to gain access to the pools, in addition to the smart contract exploit. The attack added and removed liquidity at high frequency, causing price fluctuations. Together with the liquidity attack, the hacker also set up trading orders, benefitting from the price volatility. Traders of the small and relatively illiquid token did not use sufficient MEV protection, and were vulnerable to additional sandwich trades. Not all pairs and tokens face the same level of MEV attacks , and traders also have different layers of protection. The attacked token saw mostly small-scale activity, and the hack exposed it to whale-sized trades. The attack also raised questions on the original and larger BITCOIN meme token, which has a wider social media footprint. Despite the higher liquidity, the meme asset still trades with unlocked liquidity. Even after the recent attack, memes continue to trade with unlocked pools, adding to their price volatility. The attack was relatively small compared to overall sniping and sandwich activity. However, the exploit underscored the risk of small, unsecured liquidity pools. The risk is even higher as the BITCOIN meme token is seen as one of the more accessible assets. Traders can be spoofed by both small and illiquid pairs, and tokens with an entirely different smart contract. The recent hack shows that even for illiquid tokens with a relatively obscure profile, DEX trading allows for significant value extraction from traders. In this particular token, the hacker could deploy liquidity, making use of the low volumes and the lack of other whales and bots. MEV bot attacks have slowed down for Ethereum, after peaking in the early days of DeFi. Not all assets and pools are equally affected, and bots often picked specific DEXs with unprotected users. Since 2022, more Ethereum users have turned to block builders for protection. The tokens most often targeted by MEV attacks are WETH, USDC, and USDT, pointing to deploying sandwich bots on decentralized exchanges. The recent attack against a minor meme token suggests there may also be small-scale sandwich exploiters, looking for niche opportunities with fewer protections. Ethereum may have lost up to $1.3B in value due to MEV and sandwich attacks. A recent report revealed the hidden costs of front-running trades. Even with protections, Ethereum users need extra spending to ensure the best trading outcome. In addition to open and visible sandwich attacks, Ethereum may be targeted by hidden sandwich trades, originating from otherwise safe private pools and block builders.

In this case, Binance has decided to delist the following spot trading pairs, BNT/ETH CYBER/TUSD EUR/AEUR HMSTR/BNB SUI/TUSD These changes will take effect on December 20, 2024, at 03:00 UTC. Despite the delisting of these pairs, Binance reassured users that the tokens would still be available for trading against other pairs on the platform. Token Prices Plunged Massively After Binance’s announcement, the prices of the affected tokens have already taken a hit. Meanwhile, Hamster Kombat (HMSTR) saw a sharp 9% drop in just 24 hours, trading at $0.0030 . Similarly, Sui (SUI) also saw a 6% decrease, followed by the Bancor (BNT) and Cyber (CYBER) experienced 6% and 7% drops, respectively. Anchored Coins (AEUR) also saw an 8% decrease in its value. These declines highlight how significant Binance’s influence is on the market. Binance Announcement for Users Binance also announced that Spot Trading Bots for the affected tokens will be discontinued after December 20, 2024. Users are advised to update or cancel their trading bots to avoid any potential losses. While this move is part of Binance’s standard process to maintain the quality of the platform, it has certainly caused a stir among investors.",NEGATIVE,BNB | SUI,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB | SUI,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/binance-to-delist-sui-hmstr-bnt-cyber-and-aeur-on-december-20/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The launch, highly anticipated by the crypto community, follows approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Ripple USD (RLUSD) is now live on global exchanges. An enterprise-grade stablecoin built for everyone, $RLUSD combines fiat stability with blockchain efficiency: Instant global payments, 24/7 Seamless on/off ramps Access value in real-world assets.… pic.twitter.com/lJ43GdoDGR — Ripple (@Ripple) December 17, 2024 RLUSD is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin fully collateralized by US dollar deposits, short-term US government treasuries and other cash equivalents. Initially available on Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL) and the Ethereum mainnet, Ripple plans to expand RLUSD’s availability to other blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols over time. Focus on Instant Cross-Border Payments Introduced in June 2024, Ripple USD (RLUSD) began beta testing in early August. Preview listings appeared on data providers like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap prior to its official launch. In October, Ripple announced the exchange partners that will drive the global distribution of its stablecoin. These include Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, CoinMENA, among others. Today at #RippleSwell , we’re proud to announce our Ripple USD exchange partners. Upon regulatory approval, $RLUSD will be globally available for institutions and users from @UpholdInc , @BitStamp , @Bitso , @Moonpay , @Indereserve, @CoinMENA , and @Bullish . https://t.co/iZ7L1MHpn3 — Ripple (@Ripple) October 15, 2024 According to Ripple , RLUSD is “designed to facilitate real-time global payments” by enabling instant payouts and simple on/off ramps for conversion between fiat currencies and the stablecoin. RLUSD’s key features include full backing by US dollar reserves to minimize price volatility. This makes it suitable for cross-border payments, where fluctuating exchange rates can be a concern. To ensure “responsible development and regulatory compliance”, Ripple has formed an advisory board for RLUSD, including former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair and Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. B2C2 and Keyrock will support RLUSD liquidity. Additionally, Ripple will publish monthly, third-party audited attestations of reserve assets to ensure more transparency and trust. RLUSD and Ripple’s native token XRP will complement each other within its cross-border payments solution. XRP will contribute to RLUSD’s liquidity, while the stablecoin will offer price stability for Ripple’s institutional clients.

These include partnerships and new product developments from Ripple Labs, such as the launch of the first tokenized money market fund on the XRP Ledger and the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD is positioning itself as a direct competitor to major stablecoins such as USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ). Rumours also suggest that Ripple could use its substantial XRP escrow holdings to back RLUSD. This could increase confidence in the value of the stablecoin, potentially reduce the supply of XRP in circulation and increase the liquidity of the XRP Ledger. 911 Alert: $XRP Rumors are swirling thru the cryptosphere that @Ripple might custody its entire $XRP escrow and use it to establish the initial reserve for $RLUSD .

Major asset management firms, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise, have recently filed applications with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch spot XRP ETFs. These ETFs would provide a more accessible way for institutional investors to gain direct exposure to XRP, and the SEC’s approval of these ETFs could significantly increase liquidity within the XRP ecosystem and boost XRP price . According to Jacob Canfield, an independent cryptocurrency trader, XRP’s current price surge is similar to past rallies, but with Bitcoin’s (BTC) price now 5x higher, XRP could potentially reach $6.60, double its previous high. This prediction is based on Fibonacci extensions and represents an “ideal FOMO target.” However, XRP might face resistance around $2.75-$3.00 before breaking all-time highs or experiencing a pullback. The only difference between this $XRP move and those in the past is the price of Bitcoin is 5X higher than it was in 2017. If we use Canfield Fibonacci extensions to give us an idea of where this move may take us, it would be at the 11.09 fib exension.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-surge-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Bitwise Debuts Solana Staking ETP in Europe,"Leading asset manager Bitwise has launched a Solana staking exchange-traded product in Europe, raising optimism that such a product might enter the US soon. Bitwise, a $10 billion asset manager, has debuted a Solana-focused investment product—with ticker BSOL—that allows staking services. Per reports, the ETP issuer will allow European users alternative exposure to the high-caliber crypto asset while offering staking rewards.Notably, the milestone came in partnership with Marinade. The Solana staking firm will provide Bitwise with staking services, offering dual incentives to BSOL holders.Bitwise Expands ETP OfferingsThe Bitwise Solana Staking ETP will charge users a 0.85% management fee for the dual offering. Furthermore, the asset manager disclosed that it would pay BSOL holders a competitive 6.48% staking yield.Notably, these parameters pose a competitive edge over other funds offering the same product. For instance, VanEck’s Solana staking ETP charges an annual fee of 2.5% and pays users 5.49% in staking retributions.Meanwhile, Bitwise has an existing Solana ETP in Europe. The asset manager secured the offering by acquiring London-based ETC Group.The Solana exchange-traded product trades with the ticker ESOL. Notably, the fund has accrued a net asset of $24 million, with the absence of staking services contributing to its lack of traction.It bears mentioning that an exchange-traded product (ETP) differs from an exchange-traded fund (ETF). An ETF is a type of ETP, an investment vehicle that allows investors indirect exposure to the underlying asset and trades on a stock exchange.Is the United States Next?Meanwhile, Bitwise has filed for a Solana spot ETF in the US. The asset manager joined VanEck, 21 Shares , Grayscale , and Canary Capital as applicants for the investment product.However, the application does not include staking services. Notably, none of the ETF filings in the US have included the offering due to regulatory unclarity.The current SEC hierarchy views crypto staking services as offering securities to investors. It was on the premise that the Gary Gensler-led Wall Street regulator pursued legal actions against Ethereum.Nonetheless, a change in the SEC hierarchy has sparked optimism that the staking clause will transition with the outgoing administration.

Ethereum Has Two Major Support Centers Just Below Current Price In a new post on X, IntoTheBlock has discussed about how the on-chain demand zones for Ethereum are looking right now. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the amount of supply that the investors bought at the price ranges near the current spot ETH value. As is visible in the graph, the Ethereum price ranges up ahead have only small dots associated to them, meaning not much of the supply was last purchased at those levels. It’s different for the price ranges below, however, with the $3,772 to $3,892 and $3,892 to $4,011 ranges in particular hosting the cost basis of a significant amount of addresses. In total, the investors purchased 7.2 million ETH (worth almost $28.4 billion at the current exchange rate) at these levels. Related Reading: Solana Struggles Against Bitcoin & Ethereum: Glassnode Explains Why Demand zones are considered important in on-chain analysis due to how investor psychology tends to work out. For any holder, their cost basis is an important level, so they can be more likely to make a move when a retest of it occurs. When this retest occurs from above (that is, the investor was in profit prior to it), the holder might decide to purchase more, thinking that the level would be profitable again in the near future. Similarly, investors who were in loss just before the retest might fear another decline, so they may sell at their break-even. Naturally, these effects don’t matter for the market when only a few investors participate in the buying and selling, but visible fluctuations can appear when a large amount of holders are involved. The aforementioned price ranges satisfy this condition, so it’s possible that Ethereum retesting them would produce a sizeable buying reaction in the market, which would end up providing support to the cryptocurrency. During the past day, Ethereum has seen a slight dip into this region, so it now remains to be seen whether the high demand can push back the coin above $4,000 or not.

According to ChatGPT, VET is expected to climb approximately 9.6% from its current level and reach $0.06 by Christmas Day. This optimistic prediction comes despite VET trading at $0.05472—down 2.90% in the past 24 hours. ChatGPT’s forecast reflects a moderate yet encouraging increase, which aligns with the broader bullish sentiment surrounding VeChain. In response to market analysis and ongoing trends, ChatGPT shared the following insight: “Given VeChain’s recent performance and underlying market sentiment, an approximate 9.6% price surge to $0.06 appears realistic for Christmas Day. This target factors in VeChain’s strong momentum from earlier in December and recent pullbacks, which often signal a buildup for the next leg upward.” VeChain’s Recent Price Action Fuels Optimism VeChain has been one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market as of late. The blockchain platform experienced a 40% price surge within the first three days of December, a continuation of its impressive rally throughout November. During that month, VET gained over 110%, emerging as one of the best-performing assets in the crypto space. This exceptional performance has attracted the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Despite recent minor corrections, VET has managed to maintain a position near the critical $0.06 price level. Analysts believe this resilience could serve as a launchpad for further gains in the near term. EGRAG Crypto’s Bold Prediction: A 3,000% Surge? Market analysts have also offered incredibly bullish projections for VeChain. Notably, crypto analyst EGRAG has suggested that VET could skyrocket by as much as 3,000% over the next 100 days. This ambitious forecast places VeChain’s price at approximately $0.63, a figure that would surpass its all-time high of $0.2798 achieved in April 2021. While EGRAG’s prediction is significantly more aggressive than ChatGPT’s short-term outlook, it highlights the growing confidence among analysts regarding VeChain’s long-term potential. If VET records such a surge, it would mark a monumental turnaround for the asset and its ecosystem. What’s Driving VeChain’s Growth? Several factors are contributing to VeChain’s bullish trajectory: Real-World Utility: VeChain is a supply chain-focused blockchain that offers practical solutions for businesses. Its partnerships with major enterprises such as Walmart China, BMW, and PwC underscore its real-world adoption. Positive Market Sentiment: The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced renewed optimism, with many assets rebounding strongly after a prolonged bear market. VeChain has capitalized on this momentum. Technical Strength: VET’s ability to hold above key price levels, including $0.05 and $0.06, signals strong buying interest and technical support, further reinforcing a bullish outlook. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Short-Term Outlook: $0.06 by Christmas As of now, VET faces minor resistance in its quest to hit ChatGPT’s predicted target of $0.06. Analysts point to the asset’s ability to hold above its recent multi-year highs as a sign of strength. If market conditions remain favorable and VeChain continues to ride the wave of positive sentiment, achieving this target by Christmas Day appears entirely plausible. While ambitious predictions like EGRAG’s 3,000% surge provide a long-term perspective, ChatGPT’s more grounded outlook offers investors a realistic short-term milestone to watch. As the cryptocurrency market heads into the final days of 2023, VeChain’s performance will remain one to monitor closely. For now, all eyes are on VET’s ability to hit $0.06 on Christmas Day, a move that would further solidify its status as a standout performer in an increasingly bullish market.

37809642,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663432,1734517753,Ripple’s Legal Battle with SEC: Impact on XRP and the Cryptocurrency Market,"The cryptocurrency landscape stands at a historic crossroads as the battle between XRP and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enters its most critical phase. Since December 2020, this legal confrontation has shaped the future of digital asset regulation, with implications reaching far beyond the immediate case. The potential impact of Donald Trump’s election adds another layer of complexity to an already intricate situation. The Evolution of SEC’s Cryptocurrency Stance Under SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s leadership, the commission has maintained an aggressive enforcement approach toward digital assets. The SEC’s strategy of classifying various cryptocurrencies as securities has led to numerous enforcement actions against industry players. This strict interpretation of securities laws has particularly affected the relationship between Ripple and Coinbase, with many exchanges temporarily delisting XRP following the initial SEC lawsuit. Related Reading: 3 Reasons Ripple (XRP) Could Pump to $10 Before Trump’s Swearing-In on January 20 The commission’s approach has sparked intense debate within the crypto community. Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty has repeatedly challenged the SEC’s interpretation, arguing that XRP functions as a digital currency rather than a security. This position gained significant support when Judge Analisa Torres issued her landmark ruling in July 2023. Institutional Interest and Market Evolution In XRP The institutional landscape for XRP has transformed dramatically since the initial SEC filing. Major financial institutions are no longer sitting on the sidelines, with Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett reporting unprecedented levels of interest from traditional finance. Investment firms are particularly drawn to XRP’s potential in cross-border payments, with transaction volumes reaching historic highs in Asian markets. The evolution of institutional involvement extends beyond simple trading activities. Banks are developing comprehensive blockchain strategies, incorporating Ripple’s technology into their existing frameworks. This integration represents a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets, with XRP at the forefront of this transformation. XRP Market Metrics and Performance The daily trading volume for XRP has consistently exceeded $2 billion since the partial court victory. Institutional inflows have reached unprecedented levels, with major investment firms allocating significant portions of their portfolios to digital assets. The potential approval of an XRP ETF could further accelerate this trend, opening new channels for institutional investment. The XRP price shows significant potential as the market digests recent developments. After reaching its highest level since 2022, analysts suggest the token could soar beyond current levels. Recent price analysis indicates strong support at key levels, particularly as crypto enforcement actions create market volatility. | Source; https://www.tradingview.com/x/wG67AyhZ/ Technical Analysis and Price Projections Market analysts provide detailed projections based on technical indicators and fundamental factors.

Long-term Projections Looking ahead to 2025, analysts factor in multiple variables: Potential resolution of the SEC case under new leadership Increased institutional adoption driving demand Expansion of cross-border payment networks Integration with traditional financial systems As we approach 2025, the convergence of legal resolution, political change, and market development suggests a transformative period for XRP and the broader crypto industry.

DTX Exchange is the best crypto investment for traders trying to optimize profits, consolidate assets, and keep ahead in the quick-paced financial markets as a whopping 300,000 wallet addresses/users are already onboard. Ethereum (ETH) Aims For $5,000 and Beyond With a 27% rise over the previous month and momentarily crossing the $4,000 mark, the Ethereum price has been on an amazing run. Although opposition at $4,000 has momentarily stalled the Ethereum price pace, analysts anticipate a rally to $5,000 by year-end and a possible comeback to its all-time high of $4,891 as early as next week. This Ethereum price prediction shows that an additional 20% gain for holders could happen before year-end. Ethereum’s (ETH) place as one of the top altcoins for long-term profits is firmly established by its strong fundamentals, institutional adoption, constant upgrades, and relentless community support. Looking ahead, a 2025 Ethereum price prediction points to the altcoin trading between $4,000 and $7,600. But as Ethereum (ETH) faces bearish pressure at $4,000, new and fast-rising tokens like DTX are taking the front stage. Within a few months, DTX has exceeded Ethereum’s (ETH) 80% yearly returns by delivering an amazing 440% ROI. Cardano (ADA) Surges 50% In a Month With a stunning 50% increase despite minor weekly consolidations between $1.19 and $0.90, the Cardano price has shown an amazing increase over the previous month. The Cardano price quickly rebounded after plunging to $0.93, climbing back over the $1 mark and preserving bullish momentum. Positive signals on the Cardano price chart from technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages are strengthening the altcoin’s optimistic view. Many analysts think Cardano (ADA) may soon go back to its all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 given strong community support and favorable chart patterns. Cardano (ADA) is one of the top altcoins to hold for investors hoping to profit in the long term. The Cardano price chart shows that a bullish breakout could be imminent. Though the sentiment toward Cardano (ADA) is bullish, the token’s $37 billion market capitalization might restrict the rate of exponential price surges. Here is where DTX offers a pleasing substitute. Particularly for early-stage investors, DTX presents a far better potential for exponential returns having a far smaller market capitalization of around $57 million. DTX Exchange Could Outshine Ethereum and Cardano While Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) still thrill investors with the possibility of recovering their all-time highs before year-end, DTX Exchange (DTX) is offering an amazing 440% ROI in just a few months. For those prepared to ride the next great crypto wave, DTX has better chances for exponential gains compared to Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). With its presale price of just $0.12, forthcoming Tier-1 exchange listings, and the promise of up to 500% returns upon launch, the window for joining the DTX presale is already closing as the token sells out fast.

37802445,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105571,1734517447,Donald Trump’s Executive Order to Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Drafted,"The Bitcoin Policy Institute has drafted the executive order to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the United States Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The draft aims to position Bitcoin as a national strategic asset for the U.S. under President Donald Trump. The proposed order outlines measures to ensure the United States remains competitive in the evolving global digital economy. Notably, this policy requires approval and signing after Donald Trump’s inauguration to take effect.Details of The Bitcoin Reserve and Policy ObjectivesThe executive order emphasizes integrating Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system to strengthen economic security and global leadership. According to the draft , Bitcoin’s decentralized and limited supply characteristics make it a valuable asset comparable to digital gold. The proposal recommends designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset within the ESF to diversify holdings, attract innovation, and promote domestic industry growth.Under the draft’s provisions, the Treasury Secretary would oversee the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), with an allocation of $521 billion for Bitcoin acquisition. The proposal mandates that all Bitcoin held by federal agencies, such as the U.S. Marshals Service, be consolidated into the SBR within seven days of the order’s issuance. Notably, it prohibits the sale of any Bitcoin from this period. Additionally, the draft directs the Treasury to implement a detailed acquisition plan within 60 days to establish the United States as a global leader in Bitcoin holdings and innovation.Safeguarding Bitcoin HoldingsThe draft order includes stringent measures to ensure the security of Bitcoin reserves . Initial custody of Bitcoin would rely on reputable third-party custodial service providers while the Treasury develops a robust self-custody framework. The proposed self-custody measures involve collaboration with agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to implement multi-signature controls, geographic distribution, and cryptographic reserve proof verification.Additionally, the Treasury would be responsible for regular audits and transparency measures, including quarterly public proofs of reserve and detailed annual reports. These reports would assess the strategic advantages of Bitcoin holdings, acquisition strategies, and economic impacts. The plan aims to maintain public trust while safeguarding national economic interests. Donald Trump's Executive Order for Bitcoin Reserve Global Context The draft order arrives amid growing global interest in Bitcoin. Sarah Knafo, a French member of the European Parliament, has urged the European Union to establish its own strategic Bitcoin reserve. She opposes the proposed digital euro, describing it as a potential tool for central control, and instead supports Bitcoin as a decentralized alternative. Citing El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, Knafo pointed to its success in boosting economic returns and national sovereignty.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/donald-trumps-executive-order-to-establish-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-drafted/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=donald-trumps-executive-order-to-establish-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-drafted,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

What Options Do I Have?,"So you just remembered you bought some Bitcoin when it was still valued at $30 a piece and now, with the price currently floating above $100,000, it feels like the time is right to cash out! But how can you go about doing so? There are many ways to cash out crypto to fiat because there are many reasons why someone might want to do so. If you’re a crypto trader, you might be tempted to cash out to realize your financial gains. Alternatively, if you’ve kept some crypto for a rainy day and need to use those funds to meet your financial obligations, it might make sense to exchange some of them for “real” money. Or if you’re an investor, you may just want to rebalance your portfolio by selling some crypto to put those funds in another asset. Whatever the case, there are many different ways we can convert crypto fiat, with some of the most common being cryptocurrency exchanges, crypto on- and off-ramps, peer-to-peer platforms, crypto credit, and debit cards, and even crypto ATMs. Crypto Exchanges Crypto-to-fiat exchanges such as Binance , Coinbase , Kraken , Kucoin , and Gate.io , to name just a few, are essentially marketplaces through which anyone can buy hundreds of different cryptocurrencies at the click of a button. They’re one of the main onboarding methods for crypto users, and they’re widely used by traders hoping to profit from the volatility of digital assets. With them, you can deposit fiat using various payment methods, and use those funds to buy and sell crypto to your heart’s content. Exchanges also offer users the chance to cash out at any moment, and they support a variety of payout methods, such as withdrawing it to a bank account or putting it on a card that can be used in real world stores. With exchanges, most users just send the fiat directly to their bank accounts, but beware that many of these platforms can be slow and expensive. Transfer times can range from a few minutes to hours to even days, depending on the kind of asset you’re trying to cash out of. They also charge expensive fees for cash withdrawals. It’s also necessary to point out that most crypto exchanges are centralized, which means giving up custody of your crypto while it’s deposited in their wallets. Crypto On-Ramps and Off-Ramps As an alternative, one of the most popular methods for cashing out crypto (and buying in) are crypto on- and off-ramps. Examples include Ramp Network , which offers a dedicated mobile app for exchanging crypto to fiat and vice versa, and also integrates its services directly with hundreds of other decentralized Web3 applications. The advantages of using a service like Ramp Network are speed, simplicity, and security. Users only have to sign up once and pass KYC once, and after that, they’ll be able to use its platform to cash out their crypto from any compatible dApp. It supports a wide range of digital tokens, not to mention multiple deposit and payout methods. For instance, users have the choice to cash out their crypto to fiat and send the funds directly to their bank, credit card, or an app like Google Pay or Apple Pay. What’s more, some payout options are almost instantaneous, with the funds appearing in the user’s bank account within just a couple of minutes at the most. Users can send their crypto directly from their wallet using Ramp Network, or if they have their coins in a dApp, they can immediately cash out directly from that dApp, using Ramp Network’s payout services, making for an extremely convenient experience. The experience is non-custodial, meaning Ramp Network never holds the user’s tokens or fiat currency, increasing security. Peer-to-Peer Services Another intriguing option, especially useful for those who want to remain anonymous, is peer-to-peer services such as Paxful , LocalCoinSwap , and HodlHodl . Using these services, it’s possible to connect directly with other individuals who want to buy and sell crypto, meaning you can cash out without any kind of intermediary involved. For instance, on LocalCoinSwap, you can just browse through a list of users who are advertising the rate at which they’ll buy Bitcoin, ETH, USDC, or another kind of crypto. After choosing a merchant, you simply enter the amount of crypto you want to sell, then once the other party agrees, the coins will be deposited into a kind of escrow smart contract. The buyer will then send the fiat directly to your bank account, at which point you then release the tokens to them. Alternatively, you can even arrange to meet up and perform the transaction face-to-face, in public. There are a lot of upsides to peer-to-peer services, but the downside is that most buyers charge considerable fees, so you’ll typically lose 3% to 4% of the value of your crypto. There are also a lot of fraudsters who will attempt to scam unwitting users. So be sure to exercise caution and carefully vet any counterparty you intend to trade with. Crypto ATMs These are physical terminals that allow you to deposit crypto, and withdraw fiat currency in exchange. They bridge the gap between the worlds of digital and traditional money and can help make cashing out much more straightforward. Crypto ATMs operate somewhat similarly to traditional ATMs, and they also allow users to purchase crypto. You simply enter your wallet’s private key or use it to scan a QR code, to initiate a transaction. These ATMs are popular because they can support offline transactions, and they can be found in shopping malls, convenience stores, and airports. Some of the top crypto ATM providers include Coinme and Bitcoin Depot . Benefits include convenience and 24-hour availability, but most crypto ATMs only offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies, so it’s harder to cash out more obscure tokens using them. They also come with high fees, and they can be difficult to find in many countries. OTC Trading Also known as over-the-counter or pink sheet trading, this refers to a method of trading crypto that bypasses public exchanges and occurs between two individuals. It’s possible to exchange large amounts of crypto for fiat in this way, and such services are generally designed to cater to large institutions, high-net-worth individuals, and “crypto whales”. Advantages include a high level of discretion, the ability to buy and sell large amounts of crypto without having an impact on prices and trade volumes, and customizable traders. However, such services come with higher fees and less transparency compared to trading on an exchange. In addition, OTC services are generally not available to those looking to withdraw smaller amounts of crypto. Crypto Brokers These are platforms that make it possible to buy and sell digital money using fiat currencies such as dollars, euros, and pounds. They provide simpler interfaces compared to many crypto exchanges and support rapid transaction processing when trading one crypto for another. They also offer high security for users. However, the limitations of brokers include a narrow range of supported assets, less control, fewer trading tools, and more expensive fees. In addition, crypto brokers can be susceptible to fraud and hacks, and the transfer times of crypto withdrawals can be very slow, sometimes taking several days to process. Crypto Debit Cards These offer a way to spend crypto in the real world, rather than cashing out directly, but they can be useful for those who need to use their digital money to make certain kinds of purchases. For instance, if you need to buy some groceries, you’ll be able to do so and pay with crypto at any store that supports your crypto credit card. Some of the most popular crypto debit cards include Venmo , Gemini , Crypto.com , and Coinbase , and they allow users to spend the crypto they hold in their exchange accounts at hundreds of different stores that accept Mastercard or VISA payments. The way they work is that the card is linked to your crypto exchange account, so you’ll need to make sure you have enough funds to cover you transaction, or else it will be rejected. Whenever the user pays with their card, the crypto in their account is automatically converted to fiat at the current rate, and the funds are exchanged instantly. It’s one of the fastest ways to cash out crypto, but such cards often charge expensive fees, they may have transaction limits, and they don’t allow users to actually withdraw the cash into their hands. The Bottom Line These days the crypto industry has matured, and there are dozens of ways for people to convert their digital assets into fiat, and many of them will allow you to do so in a hurry. Crypto off-ramps are fast becoming one of the popular choices due to their all-around strengths and convenience, as they eliminate the complexity of going through an exchange of peer-to-peer service. That said, users should always consider the benefits and limitations of any crypto cash-out method to decide which one is appropriate for their needs.

The meeting focused on appointing pro-crypto figures to key government roles and exploring ways to overhaul the current regulatory landscape for the cryptocurrency sector. In a significant move, Crypto.com withdrew its lawsuit against the SEC , signaling a potential shift in the exchange’s approach to U.S. regulations. The lawsuit, filed in October after the SEC issued a Wells notice indicating enforcement action, was dropped on December 16. This decision has sparked speculation that Crypto.com is optimistic about upcoming policy changes under the new administration. Donald Trump, who recently won the presidential election, has been appointing pro-crypto advocates to prominent positions. Among these are Howard Lutnick of Cantor Fitzgerald as commerce secretary and Paul Atkins to lead the SEC . Additionally, David Sacks, a venture capitalist, has been named the first White House AI and crypto czar. Sacks is expected to shape policies around cryptocurrency and emerging technologies. The meeting follows a similar engagement last month between Trump and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. These discussions highlight increasing collaboration between crypto leaders and policymakers. Commentators have speculated that plans for a national Bitcoin reserve and broader regulatory reforms could be on the horizon. Crypto.com, headquartered in Singapore, has faced challenges in the U.S. but continues to expand globally. In August, it became the first crypto sponsor of the UEFA Champions League , a groundbreaking achievement in sports branding. The deal includes in-stadium promotions, broadcast visibility, and worldwide branding efforts. Despite the regulatory hurdles in the U.S., Crypto.com has made significant progress elsewhere. Last year, the company secured approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) , earning Electronic Money Institution (EMI) status. This approval has allowed the exchange to strengthen its presence in one of Europe’s most regulated financial markets. The growing interaction between crypto leaders and government officials signals the increasing influence of cryptocurrency in shaping financial and political policies .

Crypto strategist Justin Bennett tells his 115,400 followers on the social media platform X that it’s only a matter of time before Ethereum fully reclaims resistance at $4,000 as support. According to Bennett, Bitcoin has been on a grind-up this month and traders will eventually rotate some of their BTC profits to ETH to capture more upside potential. “ETH has struggled at $4,000 for obvious technical reasons, and BTC has stolen the show so far in December. But I’m betting we will see some of those Bitcoin profits flow into Ethereum soon. If ETH can clear $4,000-$4,100, there isn’t much stopping a sprint to $4,800 and potentially mid $5,000 to complete this channel. Time for a new Ethereum ATH (all-time high).” Source: Justin Bennett/X At time of writing, Ethereum is trading for $3,873. For the rest of December, Bennett thinks that the two largest crypto assets by market cap will outperform the rest of the digital asset market. “Focusing on BTC and ETH for the next two weeks makes the most sense, IMO (in my opinion). Alts will have their time again, but probably not before we see some crazy bullish moves from Bitcoin and Ethereum through the end of the year.” Looking at Bitcoin itself, the trader says that BTC is in the midst of a Christmas rally, and he expects the crypto king to shatter its diagonal resistance en route to new all-time highs. “Bitcoin going full Santa Claus mode. Pullbacks might be hard to come by through the end of the year, especially with the speculation of BTC becoming a US reserve asset under Trump. Wouldn’t be surprised to see $116,000 or even $125,000 through the end of December.” Source: Justin Bennett/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $106,339.

Explore Qubetics as the Best Crypto to Invest in Right Now Amid Polkadot’s $24 Target and Polygon’s Bullish Breakout,"What if you could secure your financial future by getting in on the ground floor of the next big cryptocurrency project? While some cryptos are stabilising and others are gearing up for potential rallies, one project is already making waves with its impressive presale momentum. Recent developments surrounding Polkadot and Polygon highlight the growing excitement in the market, but Qubetics ($TICS) is stealing the spotlight with its presale performance and innovative ecosystem. This article will explore the latest updates on Qubetics, Polkadot, and Polygon—three of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Qubetics: A Game-Changer in Crypto Wallet Solutions Crypto wallets are vital for bridging the gap between users and blockchain technology. They offer the infrastructure to manage, store, and transact with digital assets. As cryptocurrency adoption accelerates globally, the demand for secure, user-friendly wallet solutions has skyrocketed. The Qubetics Wallet , a cornerstone of the Qubetics Network, promises to transform users’ interactions with their digital assets. Designed for accessibility and simplicity, it will soon launch across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. This multi-platform approach ensures users can effortlessly manage their $TICS tokens and other digital currencies, regardless of their preferred device.

By prioritising usability and financial empowerment, Qubetics is helping users unlock new investment opportunities. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session to strengthen community engagement, answering questions and building stronger trust with its growing audience. With such innovation at its core, Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. Polkadot: Positive Outlook Despite Short-Term Challenges Polkadot has been navigating a promising yet cautious phase. After reaching $11.65 in early December, analysts note that technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI), point towards an imminent consolidation. The critical $10.5 price mark is being closely watched, as a slip below this level could test the $8.4 support zone. However, market sentiment remains optimistic. Strong purchasing activity and Polkadot’s growing adoption as a multi-chain platform continue to inspire confidence. Analysts forecast a significant price rebound, with projections targeting $24 by early 2025. Polkadot’s cross-chain capabilities ensure its relevance as a top investment option, positioning it as a standout choice for forward-thinking investors. Polygon: Signs of a Bullish Breakout Build Momentum Polygon is attracting investor attention with compelling signals hinting at a bullish rally. Three critical factors are driving this optimism. Firstly, the price has bounced off the triangle’s axis, reflecting solid buyer activity. Secondly, the Stochastic indicator has turned bullish, while the MACD crossover on a two-week timeframe suggests upward momentum is approaching. Adding to the bullish case, a decline in exchange supply ratios and increased token movement to private wallets by Polygon whales indicate accumulation. This trend points to growing investor confidence and a strong foundation for potential growth. As a leading scaling solution, Polygon remains a noteworthy player in the crypto market, with analysts eyeing its next rally. Qubetics Presale: Phase 13 Ignites Investor Excitement The Qubetics presale is creating tremendous excitement, and for good reason. Currently, in Phase 13, Qubetics offers weekly price hikes of 10%, culminating in a final stage increase of 20%. At present, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.034, presenting a limited-time opportunity for investors to lock in this value before prices surge. The numbers speak for themselves—Qubetics has already raised $6.9 million, with over 10,300 holders and an impressive 350 million tokens sold. These milestones reflect growing investor confidence and strong community support. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in right now , Qubetics ($TICS) is leading the charge with its robust presale strategy. Early investors are securing their tokens at discounted prices and positioning themselves to benefit as Qubetics scales its ecosystem. Conclusion As cryptocurrencies continue to make headlines, Qubetics, Polkadot, and Polygon developments showcase the opportunities available for investors. While Polkadot and Polygon are positioning themselves for significant gains, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out with its exceptional presale performance and groundbreaking wallet solutions. For those seeking the best cryptos to invest in right now, Qubetics offers an exciting chance to get in early and reap the benefits of its rapidly expanding ecosystem. With Phase 13 of the presale underway and prices set to rise, there has never been a better time to join the Qubetics revolution and secure your stake in its promising future.

The altcoins have followed suit, with notable price drops evident from the likes of ETH, DOGE, ADA, TRX, AVAX, and more. BTC Falls by $4K The primary cryptocurrency bounced off its low of $94,400 last weekend and began a massive run-up that culminated yesterday. During that rally, it breached $100,000 on Thursday and has remained within six-digit territory for almost the entire time since then. Following a slightly sluggish weekend spent at around $101,500, the asset went on the offensive once again on Monday morning and especially Tuesday. At the start of the business week, it skyrocketed to $106,500 and kept climbing on the second day to just over $108,000, which became its latest all-time high . However, after gaining roughly $14,000 within a week, it felt inevitable that there will be a correction. That transpired in the past 12 hours or so as BTC dumped by over four grand and now trades just inches above $104,000. Its market capitalization has calmed at $2.060 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is up to 54%. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 18.12.2024. Source: TradingView Alts in Retrace Mode As it typically happens when BTC heads in either direction, the altcoins follow suit. Ethereum is down by 4% and sits just over $3,850, XRP has slipped by 2.5% to $2.52, and so has SOL, which struggles at $216. More losses come from the likes of ADA, TRX, AVAX, SHIB, TON, SUI, XLM, DOT, and APT, with price drops of up to 9%. PEPE has also dropped hard, currently struggling to remain above $0.0000215. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets came close to $4 trillion yesterday but has dumped by about $150 billion since then to just under $3.850 trillion now.

37794352,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629545,1734516904,Bank stocks and not Bitcoin are the top play for 2025 – Wall Street,"Wall Street strategists are rallying around bank stocks as the top investment choice heading into 2025. The optimism is fueled by several key factors: a robust US economy, expectations of deregulation under President-elect Donald Trump, competitive valuations, and lower interest rates Investment teams from major firms like Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Barclays, Société Générale, and JPMorgan Chase have all advised prioritizing stocks and equities for the coming year. High-profile analysts such as Savita Subramanian of Bank of America, Brian Belski of BMO, and Chris Harvey of Wells Fargo are among those emphasizing the appeal of financial stocks. In a recent client note, Harvey highlighted the sector’s undervaluation, urging money managers to shift their focus to financial stocks. Similarly, Belski’s 2025 outlook reiterates that financials remain “drastically unloved” despite strong earnings growth forecasts and attractive pricing. US stocks lead global markets Wall Street analysts broadly agree on maintaining a preference for large US companies. The S&P 500 index is on track to deliver an exceptional total return exceeding 25% for a second consecutive year, a feat economists say is rarely seen. Wall Street's 2025 outlook for stocks 🔭 https://t.co/C1UoOm274S pic.twitter.com/uH6Of7zMux — TKer (@TKerLLC) December 8, 2024 Some analysts have acknowledged opportunities abroad, but most see the US market as the cornerstone for growth, especially as leadership shifts away from Big Tech toward sectors such as financials and utilities. US stocks now account for more than half of the global equity market’s value, their highest share since late 2001. According to FactSet data, the heightened market activity is driven by superior earnings growth among the largest American firms. Barclays’ chief US equity strategist, Venu Krishna, noted that the earnings outlook remains robust, with Big Tech still leading growth while other sectors slowly gain traction. The Trump administration’s proposed tax cuts and deregulation measures could further boost corporate earnings and economic expansion through increased deficit spending. Economists: US stocks are garnering huge capital influx JPMorgan’s global strategy group, led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, predicts that these sectors will benefit from an influx of capital. His sentiments were echoed by Alex Blostein, a senior analyst at Goldman Sachs, who noted that approximately $7 trillion parked in money market funds is beginning to flow into the market, starting with fixed income and potentially moving into stocks. The confidence in financials isn’t confined to analysts. Top bank executives have expressed similar sentiments, projecting a strong 2025 for the sector. At last month’s Invest conference , Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan conveyed confidence in the US economy under the Trump administration, predicting swift policy actions. Executives at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs echoed this optimism during Goldman Sachs’ Financial Services conference. Denis Coleman, Goldman Sachs’ CFO, cited “elevated levels of optimism” going into 2025, while JPMorgan’s Consumer & Community Banking CEO Marianne Lake forecasted a rise in investment banking fees fueled by increased strategic transactions. “We’re seeing an acceleration in client dialogues,” Coleman stated. Analysts aware of Bitcoin’s progress Meanwhile, Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, believes Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $250,000 by the end of 2025. Lee has cemented his reputation for accurate market forecasts, successfully predicting the S&P 500’s 24% rally in 2023 and its rise to 6,000 points in 2024. Lee has been bullish on Bitcoin, forecasting its price would surpass $100,000 this year, a prediction that came true. His investment thesis revolves around the growing demand for Bitcoin due to spot ETFs, reduced supply following block subsidy halvings, and favorable interest rate trends. Despite his optimism, Lee warned of potential volatility in early 2025, with Bitcoin prices possibly falling to $60,000 before rebounding to $250,000 by year-end. He advised investors to approach Bitcoin with conviction, noting that its annual gains often occur within a brief 10-day period. On the other hand, Wall Street veteran investor Dennis Gartman has dismissed BTC’s current rally as a strong investment case, saying he prefers Gold to the digital currency. During an interview with Bloomberg, Dennis Gartman expressed surprise at Bitcoin’s recent surge beyond $100,000, likening the cryptocurrency’s rise to historical speculative bubbles. The Chairman of the Akron University Investment Committee drew parallels to the tulip mania of 16th-century Holland and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “ This reminds me too much of the tulip bulb craze and the high-tech craze of the late 20th century, ” Gartman remarked. “ I will leave it to others to buy; I will avoid it .” Gartman also pushed back against Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold,” arguing that the cryptocurrency’s limited track record falls short when compared to gold’s longstanding value as an asset. “ Bitcoin has been valued for months at some price. Gold has centuries of being valued as an asset, ” he said. “ I will take the centuries bet over the monthly bet almost anytime .” Despite his skepticism, Gartman clarified that he has no intention of shorting Bitcoin. “ I will leave it to people wiser or more daring than I am ,” he added.

37794133,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitwise-launches-solana-staking-etp-in-europe,1734516641,Bitwise Launches Solana Staking ETP in Europe,"Bitwise has announced the launch of a Solana staking ETP, called BSOL, in the European Union. This move comes as the firm faces significant regulatory challenges in the United States, where efforts to introduce a Solana ETF have been stalled. The BSOL ETP aims to attract investors with staking rewards of up to 8% annually, offering an appealing alternative to US-based ETFs, which are prohibited from providing such returns due to securities laws. This decision follows Bitwise’s acquisition of a European ETP issuer in August, which has enabled a smoother entry into the European market. By focusing on Europe, Bitwise is tapping into a region with more favorable regulatory conditions for staking products. Recently, similar Solana staking ETPs have been introduced in the EU, such as VanEck’s offering. These products remain unavailable in the US, where regulatory restrictions have created significant hurdles. The BSOL ETP highlights Bitwise's strategy to differentiate itself. The ability to offer staking rewards sets it apart from US ETFs , which are constrained by current securities laws. In the US, all ETF applications for Solana must exclude staking rewards. However, some experts speculate this could change under a different regulatory leadership at the SEC, potentially allowing US ETFs to integrate staking features in the future. Solana’s price has recently faced some market corrections but has maintained relative strength compared to other cryptocurrencies. While the launch of BSOL has not yet had a noticeable impact on Solana’s price, the token continues to exhibit bullish trends, keeping investor interest alive . Bitwise’s decision to prioritize Europe raises questions about its long-term strategy. If US regulations remain restrictive, the firm may deepen its focus on the European market. Alternatively, a more crypto-friendly SEC in the US could open the door for staking rewards and renew Bitwise's interest in launching a Solana ETF domestically. For now, BSOL offers a compelling option for European investors , providing both access to Solana and the opportunity to earn staking rewards. This move not only reflects Bitwise’s adaptability but also underscores the growing appeal of staking products in jurisdictions with more accommodating regulations.",POSITIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitwise-launches-solana-staking-etp-in-europe,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37794133.jpeg

Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold ETFs! Here's the Data!,"Demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs has surged further following Donald Trump’s victory, with US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold funds in assets under management for the first time. As Bitcoin overtakes its arch-rival gold, K33 Research Head of Research Vetle Lunde recently shared that as of December 16, Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed US gold ETFs in total assets under management. The combined AUM of Bitcoin ETFs, including spot, futures, and leveraged funds, has reached $129 billion, analysts at K33 Research noted. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas also drew attention to Bitcoin's peace and said that it is a great success for Bitcoin ETFs to compete with gold in this way, especially despite being launched only 11 months ago. “If you include all Bitcoin ETFs (spot, futures, leveraged), they have $130 billion in assets compared to $128 billion in gold ETFs. However, if you look at just spot ETFs, BTC has $120 billion in assets compared to $125 billion in gold,” Balchunas said. ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci did not remain indifferent to the success of Bitcoin ETFs and stated that he expects Bitcoin ETFs to exceed gold ETFs in AUM by three times. Nate Geraci, in his post from the X account, predicted that from a long-term perspective, Bitcoin ETFs could triple the total assets under management of gold ETFs. Stating that Bitcoin ETFs currently have an AUM of $120 billion, while the AUM of gold ETFs is around $125 billion, Geraci stated that Bitcoin ETFs could reach three times that of gold ETFs. Geraci acknowledged that the three-fold estimate may seem ambitious, but added that the three-fold gap could widen further in the future. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1869192425073443109 *This is not investment advice.

This milestone reflects the growing popularity of Bitcoin as a modern alternative to traditional assets like gold. Despite gold ETFs having a 20-year advantage, Bitcoin ETFs have surged ahead within just a year of their launch in January 2024. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US has bridged the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional finance, offering investors a regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning it. This accessibility has driven significant demand from both institutional and retail investors , contributing to Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold in AUM. Notable financial players, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest, have entered the Bitcoin ETF market, adding credibility and fueling competition. Gold ETFs have long been seen as a safe haven against inflation and economic instability. However, Bitcoin, often referred to as ""digital gold,"" has emerged as a modern, decentralized alternative with similar store-of-value qualities. Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, especially for younger investors seeking innovation and higher returns. Bitcoin's remarkable price performance in 2024 has further solidified its appeal. Analysts suggest that this shift represents a generational change , with younger investors embracing Bitcoin’s technological and financial potential. Meanwhile, traditional investors seeking diversification are increasingly incorporating Bitcoin ETFs into their portfolios. The rapid growth of Bitcoin ETFs highlights a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the financial system. After years of regulatory hurdles, US approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in 2024 has set a global precedent, paving the way for similar products in other regions. This regulatory clarity has boosted confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset . Despite concerns over Bitcoin’s volatility, its institutional adoption signals a maturing market. Experts predict that continued inflows from traditional investors could further expand Bitcoin’s lead over gold in the ETF market. As Bitcoin solidifies its position in mainstream finance, its rise underscores a fundamental transformation in investor preferences. This historic moment demonstrates that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset—it is now challenging gold’s status as the ultimate store of value. The shift reflects how innovation and decentralization are reshaping financial markets and redefining where investors place their trust.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-etfs-overtake-gold-in-major-market-shift,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37794003.jpeg
37793894,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111398,1734516162,Bitcoin’s Bull Run: The Role of ETF Approvals in 2024,"It’s undeniable that Bitcoin has been through a remarkable journey. One of the major factors has been the approval of ETFs. This caused the price to go higher and encouraged institutional adoption. Read on as we’ll explain how Bitcoin ETFs have influenced the crypto bull market and the wider implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. What are Bitcoin ETFs? A Bitcoin ETF allows you to invest without the actual ownership of Bitcoin. It is traded on traditional stock exchanges. You will be able to buy shares in an ETF as you would with any stock, instead of in crypto wallets or exchanges. Most ETFs track the underlying price performance of Bitcoin either by holding the cryptocurrency outright or by utilizing futures contracts. The setup therefore provides a way for investors to benefit in the rises in the price of Bitcoin without ownership challenges. Why Bitcoin ETFs Matter Approval of Bitcoin ETF certainly shifted the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. This is revolutionary for many reasons: Accessibility: More individuals can now invest in Bitcoin thanks to Bitcoin ETFs, which make it quite simple. Credibility: In the view of more conventional investors, Bitcoin has a lot of validity because ETFs have received regulatory approval. Institutional Adoption: Big institutions can invest in Bitcoin through regulated ETFs. Liquidity: ETFs provide liquidity as more players join the market, which improves the efficiency of Bitcoin trading. Price Stability: The infamously erratic price of Bitcoin will be stabilized with greater involvement through ETFs. The 2024 Bitcoin Bull Run The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 has been accompanied by a strong crypto bull market. Bitcoin’s price broke above $50,000 earlier in the year, driven by optimism around ETF-driven growth. Institutional investors, who were earlier skeptical, have begun pouring money into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Factors Driving the Bull Run Several factors have contributed to the Bitcoin price surge in 2024: ETF Approvals : The green light from regulators has opened floodgates for new investments. Increased Institutional Adoption : Hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers are now participating in the market. Global Economic Uncertainty : Investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven during times of inflation and geopolitical tensions. Retail Investor Interest : Buzz around ETFs has reignited interest among retail investors, creating additional demand. A Look at Institutional Adoption Institutional adoption is the key to Bitcoin’s success in 2024. While ETFs made Bitcoin more accessible to institutions, the latter started accepting it as a strategic asset. Unlike retail investors, institutions invest on a large scale and have a greater effect on the price of Bitcoin. Institutional Benefits of Bitcoin ETFs Impact Simplified Access Encourages larger investments. Regulatory Oversight Reduces risks of fraud. Liquidity Easier to enter and exit positions. Portfolio Diversification Bitcoin acts as a non-correlated asset. In that respect, these benefits have triggered an increase in institutional participation, a factor which has helped push Bitcoin’s price higher, and consequently widen its acceptance into the mainstream class of investments. ETF-Driven Growth and Market Dynamics The functions of ETFs go way beyond mere gains in prices. Their approval itself has gone through a chain in the cryptocurrency market at large. Consider the following instance:. Improved Sentiment : The regulatory nod for ETFs has increased confidence in Bitcoin and the entire crypto sector. More Innovation: The success of Bitcoin ETFs is encouraging conversations around Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies about their possible appearance as ETFs. Market Maturation: ETFs work towards a more organized and regularized market, which brings in conservative investors. Challenges and Risks While Bitcoin ETFs have brought optimism, there are also challenges to consider: Regulatory Risks : Future regulatory changes could impact ETF operations. Market Manipulation : Critics argue that ETFs could expose Bitcoin to new forms of manipulation. Over-reliance on Institutions : Heavy reliance on institutional investments might reduce Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Investors should remain aware of these risks and consider them while navigating the crypto bull market. The Road Ahead For the unparalleled price rise of Bitcoin, the role of ETFs is indispensable. These ETFs legitimize Bitcoin in the marketplace, therefore offering further access, credibility, and scope of expansion. From there on, much focus might happen in developing ETFs around other cryptocurrencies or some new financial instruments using such digital currencies. As this market matures, Bitcoin can finally assume a leading position in being a strong virtual asset in the global finance system. Bitcoin ETFs have been a cornerstone of the 2024 crypto bull run, leading price increases and institutional adoption. Their approval has lent credibility to Bitcoin, welcomed a wide array of investors, and shifted the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While there are still issues, this year’s progress underlines the increasing presence of cryptocurrencies within the traditional financial system.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoins-bull-run-the-role-of-etf-approvals-in-2024/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png
37795398,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52469,1734516055,Crypto Pundit Says This Viral Coin known as the “Next Dogecoin” Will Deliver Bigger Gains than DOGE in 2025,"Dogecoin(DOGE) made history as the meme coin that developed into a cultural phenomenon. From a joke among crypto enthusiasts to a token guaranteeing well-known endorsements, DOGE shot to prominence few could have imagined. But as we head toward 2025, a rising chorus of analysts and traders are pointing to another currency ready to surpass Dogecoin’s returns: Rexas Finance (RXS). Called the “next Dogecoin” for its explosive appeal and viral community support, Rexas Finance is much more than a meme. With a strong use case focusing on tokenizing real-world assets and an ecosystem appealing to developers and general users, RXS is rapidly becoming the token to watch in the next bull market. Legacy of Dogecoin and Future Vision for 2025 Dogecoin gained popularity partly thanks to its meme culture appeal and community-driven approach. Stars like Elon Musk expanded DOGE’s influence, driving its price to all-time highs in 2021. Over the past six months, DOGE has gained over 198%. Still, notwithstanding its achievements, DOGE has challenges that can limit its expansion in the next years. Dogecoin’s lack of great utility has left it primarily dependent on social media buzz and guesswork. Although its ongoing appeal guarantees a certain degree of interest, analysts think its development potential could be restricted compared to more modern, utility-oriented coins. Rexas Finance’s Rising Profile: More Than Just Hype Rising in momentum recently, Rexas Finance (RXS) is a viral token with significant upside potential. Unlike Dogecoin, Rexas is based on actual value and lets users tokenize luxury goods, intellectual property, and real estate, among other things. Presale Success and Explosion Potential Priced at $0.15 and already raised $27.4 million with 342.3 million tokens sold, RXS is on its 10th presale stage. This early success emphasizes the great degree of investor confidence in Rexas Finance’s long-term future. Based on its listing, analysts estimate notable price swings; some even predict a spike to $5 or more within months of release. Tokenization Revolution of Rexas Finance Rexas is unique among other coins in creatively approaching real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Rexas lets people and companies tokenize illiquid assets using blockchain technology, increasing availability worldwide. This unique use helps RXS be more than just another coin. It exploits a vast, unexplored market and exposes investors to tangible assets using blockchain efficiency and openness. Developing Trust with Major Listings and a CertiK Audit Credibility and security take the front stage in a field rife with fraud and uncertainty. Following a thorough CertiK assessment, Rexas Finance guarantees its infrastructure and code are reliable and safe. Moreover, its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have confirmed its standing and raised awareness of a larger audience through visibility and access. Rexas Launchpad and Ecosystem Expansion Rexas Finance is a whole ecosystem that fosters and expands blockchain innovation, not just a coin. Its Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder tools make asset tokenization and blockchain-based project creation possible. As the blockchain industry develops, this emphasis on ecosystem growth guarantees that RXS will be pertinent and valuable. By enabling artists and companies, Rexas Finance creates a distinctive niche that differentiates it from meme tokens like Dogecoin. A Real Reward Community-Driven Movement Rexas Finance has also embraced the community, as seen by a $1 million giveaway to honor early supporters. This project has drawn a devoted and active group of investors, augmenting the coin’s viral appeal. Emphasizing the project’s dedication to its community, 20 lucky investors will win a $50000 RXS token each. Although this engagement-driven approach reflects Dogecoin’s early success, it is supported by a more sustainable paradigm anchored in utility and scalability. Why Might RXS Eclipse DOGE by 2025? Unquestionably appealing and culturally relevant, Dogecoin’s reliance on speculation and limited use could impede its expansion as the crypto market develops. Rexas Finance presents a more interesting investment thesis for long-term gains by combining viral appeal with a strong use case. RXS’s presale success, creative tokenizing technique, and strong ecosystem help it stand out among altcoins. Rexas Finance is the wiser option for forward-looking investors since analysts predict it can provide higher returns than Dogecoin. In Essence, The Time to Act is Right Now. The struggle for crypto supremacy is intensifying as we approach 2025. Though its true potential resides in other currencies like Rexas Finance, Dogecoin will still be top news. RXS’s low entry fee of $0.15, established track record of presale success, and innovative approach to asset tokenization help RXS lead the next wave of crypto innovation. Rexas Finance provides the ideal mix of viral attractiveness and practical value for anyone looking for life-changing profits. Don’t let this chance pass away; RXS can be the “next Dogecoin” that vanishes Dogecoin.

Aiming to carve a niche in the European market, Bitwise has set a highly competitive management fee of 0.85%, substantially lower than 21Shares’ 2.5%. With these features, BSOL appears poised to disrupt the existing landscape of Solana-based ETPs in Europe. Strategic Moves Toward U.S. ETF Approval While Bitwise strengthens its position in Europe, the firm has its sights set on the U.S. market. In November, Bitwise registered a statutory trust in Delaware as part of its groundwork for a proposed spot Solana ETF. However, approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still pending . Despite the regulatory hurdles in the U.S., optimism remains high. Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, recently predicted that the chances of a spot Solana ETF gaining approval in the U.S. are “overwhelmingly high” by the end of 2025. Bitwise’s latest product, BSOL, fills a gap left by its earlier European Solana ETP, ESOL, which does not support staking rewards. The inclusion of staking functionality demonstrates Bitwise’s intent to offer products that provide both growth potential and passive income opportunities for investors. Looking Ahead Bitwise’s ambitions extend beyond the ETP market. The company’s leadership has expressed bullish forecasts for the broader crypto industry. Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s investment chief, and Ryan Rasmussen, head of research, anticipate that Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025, with its market cap overtaking gold’s $18 trillion by 2029. Additionally, the duo predicts major activity in the crypto IPO space, expecting at least five major players, including Circle and Kraken, to go public in 2025.

These fake emails, crafted to appear legitimate, urge users to verify their recovery phrases on a fraudulent website, granting attackers full access to victims’ cryptocurrency wallets. The surge in holiday transactions adds urgency to the ongoing threat of crypto scams. The phishing campaign, detailed by tech news outlet Bleeping Computer, begins with deceptive emails titled “Security Alert: Data Breach May Expose Your Recovery Phrase.” These emails claim that a recent Ledger data breach may have put users’ recovery phrases at risk and direct recipients to a fake Ledger-branded website. Hosted on Amazon Web Services, the site appears professional and mimics Ledger’s legitimate platform. Users are prompted to conduct a ""security check"" by entering their recovery phrases, which are then validated against a recognized word list. Regardless of input, the site falsely claims phrases are invalid, encouraging users to try again, ensuring scammers obtain accurate information. Once attackers have the recovery phrases, they can take full control of wallets, draining funds and seizing other digital assets. This scam highlights the dangers of phishing during the holiday season, a time when online activity spikes, and vigilance is often lowered. Ledger has not confirmed a new data breach but reminded users of its long-standing policy: “Ledger will never ask for your 24-word recovery phrase. If someone does, it’s a scam.” The company has faced phishing issues before, especially after a 2020 breach that exposed customer information, leading to targeted phishing campaigns. Another incident in December 2023 saw Ledger’s connector library exploited, resulting in nearly $500,000 in losses. These recurring events have eroded trust among some users, with one remarking, “For a company we trust to safeguard our assets, this is not reassuring.” Crypto fraud has fluctuated recently, with phishing-related losses dropping by 53% in November 2024 to $9.3 million. However, this latest attack suggests scammers are refining their tactics. Security experts warn that crypto investors must remain cautious and take proactive measures to protect their wallets, especially during high-risk periods like the holidays. Ultimately, safeguarding digital assets is the individual’s responsibility.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | WALLET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ledger-users-targeted-in-new-phishing-scam,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37793804.jpeg

After a sudden 2.75% drop over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has lost its footing above the $104,000 mark. The current BTC price is $103,674, with the market capitalization remaining at $2.052 trillion.As the surge in supply suggests a potential extended correction, attention is now focused on a crucial support trendline. Will the declining trend lead to a breakdown that tests the $100,000 level?Bitcoin Price AnalysisIn the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin’s price action shows a failed attempt to maintain a strong close above the 50% Fibonacci level. The key Fibonacci resistance is at $106,912.Despite reaching a new all-time high of $108,364, overwhelming supply in this region caused a swift bearish reversal. This has led to a 4.42% pullback from the new all-time high. Bitcoin Price Chart The bearish retracement has caused the price to fall below the 20-EMA line on the 4-hour chart. After forming two large bearish engulfing candles, Bitcoin is now testing a critical local support trendline.This support trendline sits slightly above the 38.20% Fibonacci level at $103,093. Additional support is found near the 50-EMA line, around $102,676.Given these support levels, BTC may experience a bullish recovery. However, the quick decline has caused the 4-hour RSI to drop below the halfway mark, signaling increased selling pressure and the potential for further downside.Bitcoin ETFs Buy The DipAmid the overnight correction, BlackRock accumulated $741.41 million worth of Bitcoin yesterday. With this substantial inflow, the total daily net inflow for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $493.95 million.This contrasts with an outflow of $128.17 million from Fidelity and three other ETFs. Furthermore, over the past 14 days, Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen positive inflows totaling $6.45 billion.BTC Price TargetsAccording to Fibonacci levels, a breakdown below the 38.20% Fibonacci level could lead to a retest of the $100,000 psychological mark, with the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $98,369 serving as a target in the event of an extended decline.Conversely, a bullish reversal for Bitcoin would face resistance at the 50% Fibonacci level, with a bullish target set at $110,730.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/bitcoin-drops-below-104k-is-a-100k-retest-imminent/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-drops-below-104k-is-a-100k-retest-imminent,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Donald Trump's election victory in November 2024 sparked a wave of excitement that sent the broad crypto market soaring as the president-elect had shown extreme support for the industry during his campaign. However, as the rally now stalls for some assets, investor sentiment may now be changing. This appears particularly true for meme coin market leader Dogecoin (DOGE) .Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors Grow Impatient Following Trump's election victory and the announcement of plans to launch a department of government efficiency playfully nicknamed D.O.G.E. by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Dogecoin (DOGE) soared about 220% from $0.15139 to highs of $0.48434.But as the rally has stalled over the past few weeks, with DOGE shedding some of its gains to trade at the $0.38429 price point at the time of writing, traders may now be losing patience and faith that the asset's price still has more room for growth in the short term.According to Santiment Feed data shared by prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez on Tuesday, December 17, weighted DOGE sentiment has turned negative, dropping from highs of nearly five on Santiment' s scale in mid-November to a negative 0.6. Along with this decline in sentiment has also come a massive dip in mentions on social media from over 3,200 to below 300. Santiment Feed chart showing Dogecoin social volume and weighted sentiment.

Source: Ali Martinez Still, negative sentiment may not be a reason for investors to panic, as it can often be a contrarian indicator when it is overwhelming. Indeed, analysts continue to sound bullish on the asset despite the recent correction.More Room for Growth Still?Most recently, market analyst Javon Marks has asserted that DOGE has nearly perfectly replicated its historical performance, indicating higher prices. ""History says Dogecoin is about to record a near +75% gain and more, to and above its current ATH's ($0.73905) before much, much higher,"" the analyst wrote.Specifically, the analyst set a conservative final target of $3 and over $15 in the best-case scenario. On a more ambitious note, crypto analyst ""Cantonese Cat"" has set a target of $24 , citing historical price action.",NEGATIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/dogecoin-sentiment-turns-sour-as-traders-grow-impatient/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dogecoin-sentiment-turns-sour-as-traders-grow-impatient,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37793754,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629523,1734515732,US DOJ to call Perplexity executive to testify against Google in the antitrust case,"Following Google’s appeal regarding the antitrust case, the Department of Justice (DOJ) seeks to summon particular witnesses. Dmitry Shevelenko, the chief business officer of Perplexity, has been called upon to testify against Google, a direct competitor in the tech arena. According to reports , Dmitry Shevelenko is to be interviewed by the DOJ regarding the relationship between generative AI and Search Access Points, distribution, barriers to entry and expansion, and data sharing. DOJ believes the information might strengthen its argument that Google monopolizes the search business and excludes potential competitors and, as a result, deserves more severe penalties. The link between Perplexity and Google Perplexity and other generative AI tools, such as OpenAI’ s ChatGPT Search, have emerged as a potential alternative to internet searches. These tools can provide direct responses to complex inquiries, even when faced with inaccurate or made-up information. Google, however, saw it as a challenge and responded by developing its own AI search tools, including AI Overviews, which display AI-generated responses above search results. Recently, Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity AI expressed his desire to form a partnership with news publishers who have accused the Google challenger of stealing their workstream. He attacked Google’s business model of directing consumers to websites while making money from advertisements or sponsored results. Aravind Srinivas stated, “We certainly were very surprised about the lawsuit because we actually wanted a conversation.” This shows that Perplexity has shown interest in going against Google. This must be the reason why DOJ knows they will cooperate. What is the weight of Perplexity’s testimony? In October, Google served a summons on Perplexity to obtain company documents to substantiate its case that it has a viable competitor in the search industry. However, Google lamented in a court filing that it had not received “a single document” from Perplexity as of December 11. The company contends that after two months of waiting, there is “no conceivable justification for further delay.” According to the filling, Perplexity has already consented to fulfill 12 of Google’s 14 document requests. Still, it claims that it is continuing to assess the burden associated with the collection of such a potentially extensive universe of documents. Perplexity further states that it has agreed to submit copies of licensing agreements related to AI training. But Google wants all of Perplexity’s licensing agreements and has urged Google to “meet and confer” on this matter. The antitrust case The antitrust case was started by the DOJ in 2020 and was joined by more than 30 state attorneys general. The case stated that Google has unfair control over the internet search market. It claimed that Google was breaking the law to stop competing search engines like Bing and DuckDuckGo from doing business. Source: Cloudflare Cloudflare report analysis also showed the extent of Google’s monopoly to be 88.5%. In particular, Google made deals with big companies like internet browsers and smartphone makers like Apple and Android to be the default search engine on their products. This pushed rivals out of the market and stopped them from growing. Ted Sfikas, field chief technology officer at Amplitude explained, “Google’s Search market is so dominant and it is inextricably tied to Google Chrome, Google Ad Network, Google Ads Hub, Google Analytics, and Google Tag Manager, they are demonstrating monopoly power when they cause harm to the market.” Source: Cloudflare According to Cloudflare, Chrome led by 65.8%, which is also part of Google. Judge Amit Mehta agreed with the DOJ that Google acted as a monopolist in the internet search space by barring competitors. This created a feedback loop between monopolization and increased ad revenue, which allowed the company to raise digital ad prices and further dominate the market. According to the verdict, Google has an 89.2% share of the general search market, which rises to 94.9% on mobile devices. However, Google announced its intention to appeal the ruling, alleging that it would restrict consumers’ access to their preferred search engine .

37793701,https://coinpaprika.com/news/deutsche-bank-s-new-tech-bridges-crypto-and-finance,1734515671,Deutsche Bank's New Tech Bridges Crypto and Finance,"Deutsche Bank has unveiled a groundbreaking Layer-2 (L2) blockchain solution to address the compliance challenges of using public blockchains in traditional finance (TradFi). Named Project Dama 2, this initiative is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian and involves major financial institutions exploring blockchain technology for asset tokenization. This innovative L2 protocol enhances public blockchains like Ethereum, focusing on cost efficiency, security, and regulatory compliance. By leveraging curated validators that meet strict compliance standards, Deutsche Bank’s solution ensures safer interactions, reducing risks such as inadvertently engaging with sanctioned entities or unverified validators. The protocol also incorporates advanced features like ZKsync technology, which boosts transaction speed and security. One standout feature is the introduction of ""super admin rights"" for regulators , granting oversight authorities the ability to monitor transactions transparently when necessary. This approach balances blockchain’s benefits, such as scalability and interoperability, with stringent regulatory requirements, offering a more secure and efficient framework for financial institutions. Public blockchains like Ethereum have the potential to revolutionize finance, particularly through asset tokenization. However, traditional financial institutions have hesitated to adopt them due to compliance concerns. Risks include vulnerabilities to unexpected events, like hard forks, which can disrupt digital ledgers. Deutsche Bank's Layer-2 framework addresses these challenges while maintaining a detailed transaction record separate from the underlying Layer-1 blockchain. Project Dama 2, developed with crypto firms Memento Blockchain Pte. and Interop Labs, aims to bridge TradFi and decentralized systems. It offers a tailored approach to compliance while taking advantage of blockchain's scalability and cost-saving potential. According to Boon-Hiong Chan, Deutsche Bank’s Asia-Pacific innovation lead, public blockchains can offer unmatched benefits if compliance risks are effectively managed. By connecting to Ethereum, the solution highlights the possibilities of integrating decentralized technology with traditional financial systems. This development underscores the importance of collaboration in advancing blockchain innovation . The project reflects a strategic move toward combining TradFi's regulatory rigor with the efficiency of decentralized systems. If approved by regulators , Deutsche Bank plans to launch a minimum viable product (MVP) for Dama 2 next year. This pilot could serve as a model for other financial institutions navigating similar challenges, potentially setting new standards for compliance and innovation in the financial sector.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/deutsche-bank-s-new-tech-bridges-crypto-and-finance,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37793701.jpeg
37793595,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111266,1734515559,MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet: Poised to Surpass Starbucks and Nike in Market Value,"MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet: Poised to Surpass Starbucks and Nike in Market Value The meteoric rise of Bitcoin (BTC) has propelled MicroStrategy into the spotlight as one of the most significant corporate players in the cryptocurrency space. Holding an impressive 439,000 BTC , MicroStrategy has leveraged the cryptocurrency’s upward momentum to boost its market cap to $99.4 billion , positioning itself to outpace global brands like Starbucks and Nike if Bitcoin continues its bullish trend. In this article, we explore how MicroStrategy’s strategic investment in Bitcoin is reshaping the financial landscape, examine its potential to surpass industry giants, and assess the risks and rewards associated with its bold approach. MicroStrategy and Bitcoin: An Unbreakable Bond MicroStrategy, a business intelligence and software solutions company, took a transformative turn in 2020 when CEO Michael Saylor announced the company’s pivot toward Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This decision was rooted in Saylor’s belief in Bitcoin as “digital gold” and a hedge against inflation. Since then, MicroStrategy has accumulated 439,000 BTC , making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. The company’s strategy has not only reshaped its financial outlook but also sparked a wave of Bitcoin adoption among institutional investors. The Numbers Behind MicroStrategy’s Success MicroStrategy’s market cap growth is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. The company gains approximately $440 million for every $1,000 increase in Bitcoin’s price , a testament to the outsized impact of its cryptocurrency holdings. Milestone Projections According to Cointelegraph , MicroStrategy could soon surpass major global brands if Bitcoin reaches the following price points: Bitcoin Price Market Cap Brand Comparison $118,810 $105.5 billion Surpasses Starbucks ($105.5B) $140,000 $115 billion Surpasses Nike ($115B) This ambitious projection highlights the potential of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy, as it capitalizes on the cryptocurrency’s increasing adoption and value. Why MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Matters MicroStrategy’s decision to double down on Bitcoin has significant implications for both the cryptocurrency market and the corporate world. Pioneering Institutional Adoption By incorporating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy, MicroStrategy has set a precedent for other companies. It has demonstrated that Bitcoin can serve as a legitimate reserve asset and a tool for value preservation in uncertain economic times. Market Leadership in Cryptocurrency Holdings With its massive Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a leader in the crypto space. Its success has encouraged other corporations, such as Tesla and Square, to explore Bitcoin investments. Strengthened Brand Identity MicroStrategy’s alignment with Bitcoin has boosted its visibility and appeal, especially among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors. This association has further solidified its image as an innovative and forward-thinking company. The Debt-Fueled Strategy: A Double-Edged Sword While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has delivered substantial gains, it has also attracted scrutiny due to its reliance on debt to fund cryptocurrency purchases. The company currently holds $7 billion in debt , compared to its $47 billion in Bitcoin holdings . Supporters’ Perspective Proponents argue that MicroStrategy’s long-term Bitcoin investment outweighs its debt obligations. As Bitcoin’s value appreciates, the company’s holdings could generate exponential returns, offsetting any financial liabilities. Critics’ Concerns Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and a significant downturn could expose MicroStrategy to substantial financial risks. Debt Repayment : Critics warn that a prolonged bear market could make it challenging for the company to service its debt, especially if its stock price declines. Stock Premium Debate : Some analysts, such as Clifford Asness of AQR Capital, have questioned the sustainability of MicroStrategy’s trading premium, suggesting that new share buyers may be enriching existing shareholders at their own expense. Bitcoin’s Role in MicroStrategy’s Growth Bitcoin has been the driving force behind MicroStrategy’s growth, providing a significant boost to its market cap and stock price. However, the cryptocurrency’s performance also introduces an element of uncertainty. Bullish Momentum Bitcoin’s recent rally has been fueled by growing institutional interest, increased adoption, and macroeconomic factors such as inflation concerns. This upward trajectory has been a boon for MicroStrategy, solidifying its position as a market leader. Potential Downside If Bitcoin experiences a significant price correction, MicroStrategy’s stock could face downward pressure. The company’s financial health is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s market performance, making it vulnerable to crypto market fluctuations. MicroStrategy’s Vision for the Future Despite the inherent risks, MicroStrategy remains committed to its Bitcoin strategy. CEO Michael Saylor has consistently expressed confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential, positioning it as a cornerstone of the company’s financial strategy. Expanding Bitcoin Adoption MicroStrategy’s success has inspired other corporations to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset, contributing to the cryptocurrency’s growing adoption. This trend underscores Bitcoin’s potential to become a mainstream financial instrument. Pioneering Innovation By integrating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy, MicroStrategy has positioned itself as a pioneer in the intersection of technology and finance. This forward-thinking approach aligns with the company’s mission to drive innovation and create value for its stakeholders. Key Takeaways for Investors MicroStrategy’s bold approach to Bitcoin investment offers valuable insights for investors: Diversification : The company’s strategy highlights the importance of diversification and innovation in portfolio management. Risk Management : Investors should be mindful of the risks associated with market volatility and debt obligations. Long-Term Vision : MicroStrategy’s commitment to Bitcoin underscores the importance of adopting a long-term perspective in investment strategies. Conclusion: A Bold Gamble with Promising Prospects MicroStrategy’s journey with Bitcoin is a testament to the transformative potential of cryptocurrency in the corporate world. While the company’s debt-fueled strategy has drawn criticism, its massive Bitcoin holdings position it for unprecedented growth if the cryptocurrency’s value continues to rise. As MicroStrategy inches closer to surpassing global brands like Starbucks and Nike, its success serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale for other corporations. The company’s bold bet on Bitcoin highlights the opportunities and challenges of embracing cryptocurrency in an ever-evolving financial landscape. Whether MicroStrategy’s strategy will yield long-term success or expose it to significant financial risks remains to be seen. For now, the company’s commitment to Bitcoin has solidified its place as a trailblazer in the intersection of technology, finance, and innovation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Bitcoin World,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microstrategys-bitcoin-bet/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png

37793594,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111284,1734515496,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Drops to 81: Market Still in ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone,"Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular tool for gauging investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, fell to 81 on December 18, 2024, dropping six points from the previous day. Despite the decline, the market remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone, indicating continued bullish sentiment among traders and investors. This index, provided by Alternative, serves as a thermometer for the emotional state of the crypto market. A score of 0 reflects “Extreme Fear,” while 100 represents “Extreme Greed.” Understanding how this index works and what it signals can help traders and investors make more informed decisions. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index aggregates data from multiple sources to measure market sentiment, assigning a single score between 0 and 100. It provides insights into whether the market is leaning toward fear , signaling potential undervaluation, or greed , indicating overvaluation. Factors Influencing the Index The index considers six key metrics: Volatility (25%) : Examines market fluctuations over time. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Assesses trading activity and price movement. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes sentiment from platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%) : Collects opinions from the crypto community. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Tracks Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Monitors search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. The Significance of a Score of 81 With the index at 81 , the market is clearly in the “Extreme Greed” zone. Here’s what this means: 1. High Bullish Sentiment Investors and traders are optimistic, driving prices higher across the cryptocurrency market. Such sentiment often corresponds with new entrants into the market and increased trading activity. 2. Risk of Overvaluation “Extreme Greed” can signal a potential market bubble. Overvaluation may lead to sharp corrections, especially if sentiment shifts due to negative news or profit-taking. 3. Momentum for Altcoins During periods of extreme greed, altcoins often see increased attention and price gains as traders seek higher returns beyond Bitcoin. Implications of the Recent Drop The six-point drop in the index could suggest: 1. Cooling Market Sentiment The slight decline may indicate a pause in market euphoria, potentially leading to short-term consolidation or a minor pullback in prices. 2. Healthy Correction A reduction in extreme greed can be seen as a healthy correction, offering a more sustainable path for the market to grow without overheating. 3. External Factors Macro events, regulatory news, or changes in global markets may have contributed to the slight decline in sentiment. How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index for Trading 1. Identifying Market Trends Extreme Fear (0-24): Indicates undervalued conditions, potentially signaling buying opportunities. Fear (25-49): Suggests caution but may still present opportunities for long-term investors. Neutral (50): Balanced market conditions. Greed (51-74): Bullish sentiment with potential for short-term gains. Extreme Greed (75-100): Overvalued market, where caution is advised. 2. Timing Entries and Exits During extreme greed, traders might consider taking profits or setting stop-loss orders to manage risks. During extreme fear, dollar-cost averaging or opening new positions could yield long-term gains. 3. Complementary Indicators Use the index alongside other tools like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and support/resistance levels for a comprehensive strategy. Key Trends in Crypto Sentiment Bitcoin’s Dominance Bitcoin’s performance often sets the tone for the entire market. Currently, its dominance is contributing to the overall “Extreme Greed” sentiment. Altcoin Activity With Bitcoin leading the charge, altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon often follow suit, experiencing heightened trading activity. Market Volatility Periods of extreme greed often correlate with increased volatility, creating both opportunities and risks for traders. The Role of Social Media and Google Trends Social Media Influence Crypto discussions on platforms like Twitter and Reddit significantly impact market sentiment. Positive news or celebrity endorsements can drive the index higher, while FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) can push it lower. Google Trends Search interest in terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto bull run” offers a glimpse into retail investor behavior. An uptick in search trends often coincides with higher index scores. What’s Next for the Market? 1. Continued Monitoring of the Index Investors should keep an eye on the index to anticipate potential market reversals. A drop below 75 could signal the start of a more cautious phase. 2. Focus on Key Market Drivers Institutional Activity: Moves by large investors can significantly influence sentiment. Regulatory News: Developments in crypto regulations can sway the index in either direction. Macro Trends: Global economic conditions, such as inflation rates and currency stability, also play a role. 3. Opportunities in Altcoins As the market remains in Altcoin Season, traders may find opportunities in undervalued projects or emerging technologies. Conclusion: Navigating Extreme Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 81 highlights the market’s strong bullish sentiment, but the slight decline suggests a possible moderation in euphoria. For traders and investors, this is a time to exercise caution while capitalizing on market opportunities. By staying informed and using tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index alongside other technical and fundamental indicators, you can navigate the ever-changing crypto market with confidence.

37793543,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111292,1734515435,Ohio Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill Amid Growing Crypto Adoption,"Ohio Embraces Bitcoin for Strategic Reserves Cryptocurrency continues to gain traction in the United States, and now Ohio is making headlines by introducing a bill to establish a state-owned strategic Bitcoin reserve . Republican Representative Derek Merrin spearheaded this initiative, adding Ohio to the growing list of states considering Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy. This move follows a similar bill introduced in Texas by Representative Giovanni Capriglione, highlighting a broader trend of state governments exploring Bitcoin adoption. What Is a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? A strategic Bitcoin reserve involves a state or entity holding a portion of its financial assets in Bitcoin. The rationale is to leverage Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, diversify reserves, and embrace the technological advancements driving the digital economy. For states like Ohio, creating a Bitcoin reserve signals a commitment to innovation and positions them as leaders in cryptocurrency adoption. Details of Ohio’s Bitcoin Reserve Bill Key Provisions Proposed by: Ohio Republican Representative Derek Merrin. Goal: Establish a state-owned Bitcoin reserve to diversify Ohio’s financial assets. Potential Uses: Hedge against inflation. Support technological innovation within the state. Attract blockchain and crypto-related businesses to Ohio. Timeline and Implementation While specific timelines for the bill’s passage and implementation remain unclear, its introduction marks a significant step toward integrating cryptocurrency into state-level financial strategies. Texas Leads the Way in Bitcoin Reserves The Texas Bill Just days before Ohio’s announcement, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced a similar bill. Texas has long been a hub for cryptocurrency mining and innovation, and a Bitcoin reserve could further solidify its status as a crypto-friendly state. Lessons for Ohio Ohio can look to Texas for guidance in implementing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, including: Legal frameworks for procurement and storage. Collaboration with blockchain experts. Educating the public on the benefits and risks of cryptocurrency reserves. Why Are States Considering Bitcoin Reserves? 1. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a potential hedge against inflation, unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited amounts. 2. Economic Diversification State-owned Bitcoin reserves diversify financial portfolios, reducing reliance on traditional assets like bonds and equities. 3. Encouraging Innovation Adopting Bitcoin can position states as leaders in technological innovation, attracting blockchain startups and investment. 4. Preparing for a Digital Future As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance, states with Bitcoin reserves will be better equipped to navigate the evolving financial landscape. Challenges in Establishing a Bitcoin Reserve While the concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is promising, there are significant challenges: 1. Regulatory Hurdles Cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. remains complex, with varying rules at the state and federal levels. States like Ohio must navigate these regulations to ensure compliance. 2. Volatility Risks Bitcoin’s price volatility poses a risk to state finances. Effective risk management strategies will be crucial for maintaining financial stability. 3. Public Perception Educating residents about the benefits and risks of a Bitcoin reserve will be essential to gain public support. 4. Security Concerns Ensuring the safety of state-owned Bitcoin reserves will require robust cybersecurity measures to prevent theft and hacking. Economic Implications for Ohio Boosting Blockchain Adoption Creating a Bitcoin reserve could attract blockchain startups and investors, fostering economic growth and job creation in Ohio. Increasing Revenue Streams If Bitcoin’s value continues to rise, Ohio’s Bitcoin reserve could generate significant returns, benefiting the state budget. Enhancing State Reputation By embracing cryptocurrency, Ohio positions itself as a forward-thinking state, encouraging innovation and technological advancement. Global Trends in Bitcoin Reserves Nation-State Adoption Countries like El Salvador have already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and maintain national Bitcoin reserves. Ohio’s move aligns with this global trend, albeit at the state level. Institutional Adoption Major corporations like MicroStrategy and Tesla have invested heavily in Bitcoin, showcasing its potential as a strategic asset. What’s Next for Ohio? 1. Legislative Process Ohio lawmakers will debate and refine the bill before it can be passed into law. Public hearings and expert consultations are expected. 2. Collaboration with Industry Experts Partnering with blockchain and cryptocurrency experts will be crucial for implementing the reserve effectively. 3. Addressing Public Concerns Ohio must address questions around Bitcoin’s volatility, environmental impact, and long-term viability to gain public trust. Conclusion: A Bold Step Toward the Future Ohio’s introduction of a Bitcoin strategic reserve bill marks a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency adoption at the state level. While challenges remain, the potential benefits—including economic diversification, technological innovation, and financial stability—make this a compelling initiative. As more states follow suit, Bitcoin’s role in public finance could reshape the future of government asset management. For Ohio, this bold step positions the state as a leader in embracing the digital economy.

Meanwhile, these levels favour both the bulls and the bears at frequent intervals, suggesting a particular pattern being formed within the markets. The bull remains vigilant over the price trends of the cryptos and, after a brief consolidation, triggers a strong rise towards the higher resistance. Meanwhile, the emergence of the primitive tokens that have experienced multiple bull & bear markets has raised the speculation of traders shifting their focus back to the fundamentals more than the trend. Hedera (HBAR) Price Eyes At a New ATH at $1 Hedera price triggered a massive upswing after rebounding from the November lows; HBAR price surged and achieved levels not seen since December 2021. With this recovery, the market participants became confident of the upcoming price action as the platform witnessed a huge influx of buying volume that it had never witnessed ever in history. This seems to have triggered a strong bullish case for the HBAR price, which is believed to mark new highs before the end of the year and eventually reach $1 or levels just above, marking the peak for the ongoing bull run. The latest integration of Hedera & Chainlink seems to have fueled the rally, which is about to enter a fresh bullish range. The price is stuck between 0.786 & 1 FIB levels between $0.44 and $0.571. As the RSI has displayed a bearish divergence from the overbought zone, a small pullback in the price is expected, which has begun and reached levels below $0.25. However, if the RSI hovers within the upper zone, the bullish momentum could be held, which may revamp a strong rise towards the ATH at $0.571 before the end of the year. Uniswap (UNI) Price Aims for a 100% Rise Soon The top DeFi token, Uniswap, has been largely volatile since the start of the year and experienced over 220% rise followed by 13% retracement. The price failed to clear one of the pivotal resistance zones between $18.9 and $19.6, the neckline of the parabolic recovery. However, the UNI price is expected to face an extended pullback and eventually trigger a strong rebound in no time. The UNI price is currently facing extreme bearish pressure for the second consecutive week, which suggests it may maintain a strong descending trend until the end. The OBV has displayed a bearish divergence but may certainly not validate a momental shift from the ongoing bullish trend. The token is experiencing a rise in volumes after a long time and with the first weekly Golden Cross, the price is expected to get a larger boost and trigger a 100% rise, reaching levels above $24.",POSITIVE,UNI | HBAR,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | HBAR,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/prices-of-hbar-and-uni-display-enormous-strength-will-these-cryptos-boom-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

As Bitcoin sells at $103,967, analysts are revising their long-term valuation for BTC, proposing new heights. They cite factors such as adoption by institutional players, potential integration by sovereign entities , and its comparison to gold as a store of value.Experts have drawn parallels between Bitcoin's market capitalization and gold, citing the possibility of the crypto matching gold’s market cap. Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter highlighted this potential, projecting a long-term Bitcoin price of $900,000. Institutional Strategies For BitcoinCarter points out that institutional participation has significantly boosted Bitcoin’s prominence. Strategies like MicroStrategy’s use of fixed-income markets to fund Bitcoin purchases have shown the profitability of such investments, with substantial premiums on their holdings.As Carter notes, these trends demonstrate the growing interest in Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, especially among entities unable to buy the cryptocurrency directly.Additionally, regulatory changes in Washington could unlock new opportunities for broader adoption. Carter suggests that policies like the cessation of de-banking and Bitcoin custody by major banks could trigger a new wave of institutional and sovereign adoption.Proposals for Bitcoin as a Strategic ReserveFurthermore, Bitcoin's role in addressing fiscal challenges has also garnered attention. Earlier, VanEck proposed a model where the U.S. Treasury could strategically acquire Bitcoin to mitigate national debt. This proposal assumes the purchase of one million BTC tokens over five years at an average price of $250,000 per Bitcoin. Such strategic reserves could theoretically align with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ vision while addressing inflation and fiscal sustainability.These developments coincide with broader market trends, as noted by VanEck's CEO, Jan van Eck. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $150,000–$170,000 by 2025 reflects growing confidence in the asset’s resilience.The asset's year-to-date return of 124.4% further underscores its market dominance in 2024, far outpacing gold’s 28.1% performance.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/18/castle-island-founder-issues-bold-900k-bitcoin-forecast-says-btc-will-match-gold-market-cap/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=castle-island-founder-issues-bold-900k-bitcoin-forecast-says-btc-will-match-gold-market-cap,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37793294,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394556,1734514913,$1 Million Bitcoin? Trump’s Reserve Plan Sparks Global Crypto Frenzy,"The post $1 Million Bitcoin? Trump’s Reserve Plan Sparks Global Crypto Frenzy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin market has recently hit a major milestone, surpassing $100,000. This achievement has sparked a renewed wave of discussions about Bitcoin’s potential future. But here’s the twist—crypto enthusiast Atlas, known on X, believes that with the upcoming launch of a US Bitcoin Reserve under President Donald Trump in 2025, Bitcoin’s price could soar to an eye-popping $1 million per coin. Yes, you read that right—$1 million per Bitcoin! Could this bold prediction become reality? Let’s dive deeper into Atlas’ reasoning and explore what could make this massive price surge possible. Cryptocurrency in the US Political Campaign Cryptocurrency has become a key topic in the US political campaign, with both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris offering bold proposals for the industry. Trump’s plan to create a US Bitcoin Reserve has gained significant attention, positioning it as a way to protect the US economy from inflation. Atlas believes that under Trump, the US government could acquire at least 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply. ➠ 2 ◈ Trump’s election campaign popularized the notion of a $BTC reserve, pitching it as a future-focused economic solution ◈ Critics were quick to condemn the plan, citing Bitcoin’s volatility as a major issue ◈ Many argued it would create more problems than benefits for… — Atlas (@crptAtlas) December 17, 2024 Bitcoin Reserve: Benefits and Criticism Despite the excitement, the Bitcoin reserve proposal has faced sharp criticism. Opponents argue that Bitcoin’s volatility makes it too risky to be used as a national reserve, and warn it could harm the US economy. However, supporters of the plan argue that Bitcoin can act as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Over the past year, Bitcoin has risen by 152.7%, strengthening its role as a safe asset in times of financial instability. A Global Shift Toward Bitcoin On the global stage, countries like Russia are looking at Bitcoin as a way to navigate economic sanctions. Atlas points out that over $300 billion of Russian assets were frozen by Western powers due to sanctions. Other nations, like China, frustrated by the US’s global economic dominance through the dollar, are also likely to adopt Bitcoin as an alternative. Atlas suggests these countries are eager to reduce their reliance on the US dollar and would welcome strategies like Bitcoin to help achieve this. The US Must Act Quickly to Stay Ahead For the US, now is the time to act. Atlas argues that acquiring a significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply would help secure the country’s position as a leader in the global Bitcoin market. By purchasing 20% of the total Bitcoin supply, the US could strengthen its financial system and dominate the cryptocurrency space. $1 Million Bitcoin: The Economics Behind the Prediction Atlas’ forecast of Bitcoin reaching $1 million per coin is based on basic economic principles: lower supply and higher demand lead to price increases. If the US adopts Bitcoin on a large scale, the demand would rise significantly, pushing the price higher. The US Bitcoin Reserve could change the global financial system. With increased demand, limited supply, and growing competition from other countries, Bitcoin’s future looks promising. While the $1 million Bitcoin target may seem bold, Atlas’ reasoning makes it seem more possible than ever.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/how-might-trumps-us-bitcoin-reserve-influence-btc-price-to-hit-1m/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37794907,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320617,1734514749,Metaplanet Anticipates First Operating Profit in Seven Years Following Bitcoin Addition to Balance Sheet,"Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is poised to achieve its first consolidated operating profit in seven years, just months after incorporating Bitcoin into its balance sheet . The Tokyo-based firm announced on December 18 that it expects to generate 890 million Japanese yen ($5.8 million) in revenue for the fiscal year ending December 31, a significant increase from the 261 million yen recorded in the previous fiscal year. The company’s operating profit is projected to reach 270 million yen, a sharp turnaround from the 468 million yen loss it suffered last year. Large Portion of Metaplanet’s Revenue Comes From Bitcoin Products A substantial portion of Metaplanet’s revenue comes from its Bitcoin-related activities, particularly its strategy of selling Bitcoin put options. This approach generated 520 million yen in income, making it a key driver of the company’s improved financial outlook. Put options allow investors to sell an asset at a pre-agreed strike price, and Metaplanet earns a premium for each contract sold, regardless of whether the option is exercised. If exercised, the company can acquire Bitcoin at the agreed price, aligning with its broader strategy of accumulating the cryptocurrency. The firm’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset began in April, part of a shift aimed at hedging against currency depreciation. Beyond its Bitcoin-related activities, Metaplanet’s hotel business has also played a role in its improved financial performance. Through its subsidiary, Wen Tokyo Co., the company operates the Royal Oak Hotel in Tokyo’s Gotanda district. The combined success of its hotel operations and Bitcoin strategy has put the company on track to achieve profitability for the first time since 2017. *Metaplanet Projects First Fiscal Year Operating Profit Since 2017* pic.twitter.com/oYNKOtNatR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) December 18, 2024 Looking ahead, Metaplanet plans to formalize its Bitcoin accumulation efforts as a standalone business line. According to its December 18 disclosure, the firm will pursue “Bitcoin accumulation and management” as a distinct unit. The strategy includes leveraging loans, equity, convertible bonds, and other financial instruments to acquire and hold Bitcoin. The company also intends to maintain its reliance on Bitcoin put option sales as a significant revenue source. Metaplanet to Create More Revenue Streams from Bitcoin Activities Metaplanet’s ambitions extend beyond treasury management. It aims to create revenue streams from Bitcoin-related marketing activities. To support this initiative, the company recently secured a license to operate a Japanese version of the crypto-focused news outlet, Bitcoin Magazine. The firm’s growing commitment to Bitcoin has made it Asia’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Boyaa Interactive. As of its latest update, Metaplanet holds 1,142 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $119.4 million. To support its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, Metaplanet issued its fourth bond offering on December 16, raising nearly 4.5 billion yen ($30 million). The company also announced plans for a 5 billion yen private placement of ordinary bonds. Aside from Metaplanet, other major corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy have been continuously expanding their Bitcoin holdings. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoin , valued at approximately $1.6 billion, bringing the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 Bitcoin (currently over $46 billion).

Why $PHNIX Could Be the Next $PEPE, $WIF, or $SHIB","In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, meme coins have carved out a unique niche, capturing the imagination of investors and enthusiasts alike. Tokens like PEPE, WIF, and SHIB have demonstrated the power of community-driven projects to achieve exponential growth. Now, a new contender has emerged on the XRP Ledger (XRPL): $PHNIX . Launched on December 3, 2024, $PHNIX has quickly gained traction, positioning itself as a symbol of resilience and rebirth within the XRP community. The Symbolism Behind $PHNIX The phoenix, a mythical bird that rises from its ashes, has long been associated with themes of renewal and indestructibility. Within the XRP community, this symbolism resonates deeply, especially in light of challenges such as the SEC lawsuit that once cast doubt on XRP’s future. However, XRP’s resurgence has mirrored the phoenix’s legendary rebirth, inspiring the creation of $PHNIX as a tribute to this enduring spirit. As stated on their official website, “$PHNIX is here to be the ultimate symbol of the resilience of XRP in the face of adversity.” Why $PHNIX Could Be the Next PEPE, WIF, or SHIB 1. Strong Community Engagement : Meme coins thrive on active and passionate communities. $PHNIX has rapidly cultivated a dedicated following, with enthusiasts rallying around its symbolic representation of XRP’s resilience. The project’s emphasis on community involvement is evident through initiatives like encouraging supporters to add $PHNIX-themed sunglasses to their profile pictures, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose. 2. Strategic Marketing and Partnerships : The $PHNIX team has outlined plans for extensive marketing campaigns, including collaborations with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and traditional marketing avenues, to amplify the token’s reach. Additionally, efforts are underway to secure listings on centralized exchanges (CEX) and form strategic partnerships, further enhancing $PHNIX’s visibility and accessibility. 3. Alignment with XRP’s Narrative : By embodying the phoenix, $PHNIX taps into a narrative that is already deeply ingrained within the XRP community. This alignment not only attracts existing XRP supporters but also appeals to new investors drawn to the compelling story of resilience and rebirth. As noted in a recent press release, “$PHNIX builds on this symbolism, serving as a memecoin that embodies the widely recognized mascot of XRP.” 4. Utilizing the XRPL Ecosystem : Operating on the XRP Ledger offers $PHNIX several advantages, including fast transaction speeds and low fees. These features make it more appealing for traders and investors, facilitating seamless transactions and fostering increased adoption. The token is available on FirstLedger, a decentralized exchange on the XRPL network, with no transaction taxes, ensuring a user-friendly trading experience. Recent Performance and Growth Since its launch, $PHNIX has demonstrated impressive growth. Within days, its market capitalization soared, capturing the attention of the crypto community. This rapid ascent mirrors the early trajectories of other successful meme coins, suggesting that $PHNIX could follow a similar path to prominence. As reported by CryptoPotato, $PHNIX has experienced significant price appreciation, indicating strong market interest. Conclusion While the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and investing in meme coins carries significant risk, $PHNIX presents a compelling case for potential growth. Its deep-rooted symbolism, strategic marketing efforts, and alignment with the resilient spirit of XRP position it as a strong contender to become the next major meme coin on the XRP Ledger. As always, potential investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before making investment decisions.

37793266,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629500,1734514279,Should president Trump ban US Congress members from crypto trading just like with stocks?,"Self-proclaimed ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump faces a new ethical crossroads: Should he block U.S. Congress members from trading cryptos, mirroring the proposed ban on stocks, which he supports? With the crypto market becoming a multi-trillion-dollar industry, allowing lawmakers to trade in it could look like handing the keys to the vault to the people writing the rules. Banning Congress from trading stocks has been a hot topic for a while now. Sitting president Joe Biden threw his support behind it ages ago, saying lawmakers shouldn’t profit from markets they have the power to influence. Polls show 75% of Americans agree. But crypto, which is decentralized, global, and volatile, presents an entirely different beast. It’s never been done before. There are no existing patterns to follow, and Mr. Trump is not the most responsible person on the planet. Trump’s crypto love affair Trump is Bitcoin’s loudest advocate in Washington right now. He’s backed policies like halting government bitcoin sales and appointing crypto allies to powerful regulatory posts. His approach to crypto has made him wildly popular among us blockchain enthusiasts, but it has also raised questions about his own investments. Trump’s personal crypto holdings and ties to industry players could muddy the waters when it comes to enforcing ethical standards. Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, has shared that he’s worried Trump’s financial interests could influence the decisions he makes—or doesn’t make—on regulating cryptocurrencies. “The conflicts have substantially increased alongside the expansion of his business empire,” he said. And let’s be honest, a crypto-friendly SEC chief under Trump could be great for the market but questionable for governance. Columbia Law School professor John Coffee took it a step further, pointing out how Trump’s administration would mean lighter enforcement on crypto companies . While that might sound like music to the ears of Bitcoin bulls, it’s a problem when lawmakers stand to profit personally from the rules they create. The legislative battle over Congress’s trades The idea of banning Congress from trading anything isn’t new. The ETHICS Act, introduced years ago, sought to stop lawmakers and their families from profiting in markets they influence. As of press time, Congress members can still trade stock freely, despite the growing public demand for change. The ETHICS Act could extend to cryptocurrencies, but it’s still a proposal, not a law. Even if it passes, enforcing it would be another uphill battle. Crypto moves fast, much faster than Washington. And unlike stocks , it’s not tied to a central exchange. Banning it could be a massive disaster, but allowing it could be worse. Polls show the public is tired of lawmakers profiting while supposedly serving the people. Ethical governance is the buzzword, but applying it to a decentralized market like crypto is a whole different game. One misstep, and the public’s fragile trust in Congress could crumble further. Wonder what that’ll do to Trump’s legacy. What other countries are doing The U.S. isn’t the only one grappling with these questions. In the UK, lawmakers have to show all their financial interests, including stocks and cryptos. Canada’s Conflict of Interest Act does the same, making sure there is tight transparency in public office. Australia too. Lawmakers must disclose their crypto holdings to avoid potential scandals. Germany offers lawmakers more leeway but is facing calls to tighten its rules. And in the European Union, transparency and ethical investment policies are top priorities. Compared to these places, the U.S. looks like the Wild West, with rules that are vague and barely enforced. Crypto is still new, and lawmakers who own it might better understand its complexities. That could help them draft smarter, fairer regulations. But crypto is supposed to represent financial freedom. Restricting it could send the wrong message about the industry. There’s also the argument about attracting talent to public service. If financial restrictions are too harsh, qualified individuals might avoid politics altogether. Though let’s just face it: Trump’s probably not gonna ban Congress from either stock or crypto trading. He loves making money far too much for that.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-trump-ban-us-congress-members-crypto/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37793266.jpeg
37792936,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=664240,1734514224,"MicroStrategy’s Bankruptcy Risk: CEO Warns Bitcoin Must Drop To $16,500 To Trigger Collapse","MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm co-founded by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, has significantly ramped up its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, surpassing 400,000 BTC in holdings. However, concerns about the company’s financial stability tied to the Bitcoin price have emerged, particularly from Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant. Ju cautioned that while the prospect of MicroStrategy facing bankruptcy is not impossible, it would require an event as unlikely as “an asteroid hitting Earth.” MicroStrategy’s Financial Risks As Bitcoin Price Floor Holds At $30,000 In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Ju elaborated on the matter by stating that BTC has maintained a consistent price floor, never dropping below the long-term cost basis of major holders, which currently stands at $30,000. He noted: MicroStrategy’s debt is $7 billion, while its Bitcoin holdings are valued at $46 billion. Based solely on Bitcoin, the liquidation price would be around $16,500. The last cycle’s bottom was at $16,000. Talking about a drop to that level now feels as improbable as predicting $3,000 when Bitcoin was at $60,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches $4,100 For The First Time In Over Three Years, Aiming For $5,000 Next In the context of current price movements, CryptoQuant noted that the price surge toward BTC’s new all-time high above $108,000 on Tuesday was fueled by short liquidations totaling approximately $151 million over the past 12 hours, The firm disclosed that the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio also reached an all-time high during this surge, reinforcing Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold” and affirming its role as a preferred store of value compared to traditional gold assets. Additionally, MicroStrategy’s recent inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 has bolstered market sentiment. Saylor hinted at further Bitcoin purchases, even with spot prices exceeding $100,000. CryptoQuant asserts that this inclusion could lead to passive fund inflows into MicroStrategy shares, providing the company with greater access to capital for its Bitcoin acquisitions. BTC Purchases For Sixth Consecutive Weeks Saylor stated on Monday that Microstrategy has purchased the market’s leading crypto for the sixth week in a row. This transaction adds to the firm’s considerable Bitcoin portfolio, which currently stands at 439,000 BTC, acquired for around $27.1 billion at an average price of $61,725 per coin. Additionally, Saylor revealed that the firm’s Bitcoin assets have produced significant gains, with a 46.4% increase quarter-to-date (QTD) and a 72.4% gain year-to-date (YTD). Related Reading: Solana Monthly Chart ‘Looks Ready For A Monster Run’ – Details CryptoQuant also noted that this week’s central bank meetings appear to be secondary to market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin. While it remains highly unlikely, an “extremely dovish stance” from the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell could provide the necessary momentum for BTC to rise even further. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $104,140, down 2.6% on the 24-hour time frame but still up 6.5% on the week.

37793110,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111295,1734514221,Cynthia Lummis Predicts 2025 as the Breakout Year for Bitcoin and Digital Assets,"Cynthia Lummis Champions Bitcoin and Digital Assets Pro-crypto U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has made headlines by declaring that 2025 will be the pivotal year for Bitcoin and digital assets . Known for her unwavering support for cryptocurrencies, Lummis envisions a transformative shift in the global financial system led by digital assets. In a report shared by Watcher Guru, Lummis’ remarks underscore the growing momentum around cryptocurrency adoption in the U.S. and beyond. This prediction aligns with broader trends of regulatory frameworks, institutional adoption, and advancements in blockchain technology that are setting the stage for a digital revolution. Why Cynthia Lummis’ Prediction Matters 1. A Recognized Voice in U.S. Crypto Policy Cynthia Lummis has been one of the most vocal advocates for cryptocurrencies in Congress. Representing Wyoming, a state pioneering crypto-friendly legislation, Lummis has been instrumental in shaping regulatory discussions around Bitcoin and other digital assets. 2. Timing the Market Evolution Predicting 2025 as the “year of digital assets” suggests a timeline for significant milestones, including: Widespread adoption of digital currencies. Clarity in U.S. regulatory policies. Integration of blockchain technology into mainstream industries. 3. Bridging Innovation and Regulation Lummis’ advocacy highlights the balance between fostering innovation and implementing regulations to protect consumers while encouraging growth in the digital asset ecosystem. The Current State of Digital Assets Rising Institutional Interest Major corporations, hedge funds, and investment platforms are increasingly adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to their portfolios. Regulatory Developments The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are actively working to clarify their roles in regulating digital assets. Technological Advancements Blockchain technology continues to evolve, offering scalable solutions that address challenges like security, speed, and interoperability. What Could Make 2025 a Game-Changer? 1. Regulatory Clarity The implementation of comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations could provide the legal certainty needed for mass adoption. Key areas include: Stablecoin regulations. Licensing requirements for crypto exchanges. Consumer protection policies. 2. Institutional Adoption With Bitcoin ETFs already surpassing gold ETFs in assets under management, 2025 could see even greater institutional involvement. 3. Retail Adoption User-friendly apps, wallets, and educational initiatives could drive retail participation, making cryptocurrencies more accessible to the average consumer. 4. Technological Breakthroughs Advancements in blockchain scalability, security, and interoperability could position digital assets as practical solutions for industries ranging from finance to supply chain management. Wyoming’s Role in the Crypto Revolution Wyoming, under Lummis’ influence, has become a hub for crypto innovation: Crypto-Friendly Laws: The state has enacted 24 pro-crypto laws, offering clarity and support for blockchain companies. First Crypto Banks: Wyoming is home to the first crypto banks, like Kraken and Avanti, which operate under a special-purpose depository institution (SPDI) charter. Incentives for Blockchain Companies: Low taxes and business-friendly policies attract blockchain startups to the state. Global Trends Supporting Lummis’ Prediction 1. Nation-State Adoption Countries like El Salvador and others have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, setting a precedent for broader government-level adoption. 2. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Numerous central banks are exploring or launching CBDCs, highlighting the global shift toward digital finance. 3. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) DeFi platforms are democratizing access to financial services, offering alternatives to traditional banking systems. 4. Tokenization of Assets From real estate to art, tokenization is creating new opportunities for fractional ownership and liquidity in previously illiquid markets. Challenges on the Road to 2025 While the future looks promising, several obstacles need to be addressed: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Ongoing debates in the U.S. about which agencies should oversee digital assets continue to create confusion. 2. Market Volatility Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are notorious for their price volatility, which could deter conservative investors. 3. Security Concerns Hacks and fraud remain significant issues in the crypto space, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures. 4. Public Perception Misinformation and skepticism about cryptocurrencies could slow adoption rates. The Role of Legislation and Advocacy Key Legislative Developments Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bills: States like Ohio and Texas are considering strategic Bitcoin reserves, showcasing growing state-level support for digital assets. Federal Initiatives: The Biden administration and incoming President-elect Trump have both discussed frameworks for cryptocurrency regulation. Advocacy Efforts Lummis and other pro-crypto lawmakers are working to educate their peers about the benefits and risks of digital assets, aiming to create a balanced regulatory environment. What 2025 Could Look Like for Digital Assets Mainstream Integration Digital assets could become an integral part of everyday transactions, from retail purchases to international remittances. Enhanced Financial Inclusion Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide. Booming Ecosystems DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets could see exponential growth, creating new opportunities for investment and innovation. Global Leadership Countries and states embracing digital assets early could position themselves as leaders in the emerging digital economy. Conclusion: A Vision for the Future Cynthia Lummis’ prediction that 2025 will be the year of Bitcoin and digital assets underscores the rapid progress and growing importance of cryptocurrencies in today’s financial landscape. With advancements in technology, increasing institutional adoption, and ongoing legislative efforts, the stage is set for a transformative shift in how the world views and uses digital assets.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/musk-loves-bitcoin-muskbtc-solana-memecoin-to-explode-13000-before-exchange-listing-while-shib-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37793644,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52464,1734513970,Layer-2 Solutions vs. Razewin: Which Technology Is Leading the Next Crypto Revolution?,"Introduction As blockchain networks grow, scalability and energy consumption are becoming increasingly important concerns. Layer-2 scaling solutions, such as Mantle Network and Manta Network, are gaining traction by improving transaction throughput and reducing congestion. However, Razewin offers an entirely different approach with its mobile-based mining system. This article will compare Layer-2 solutions to Razewin’s technology, examining which is better suited for the next phase of blockchain development. Layer-2 Solutions and Blockchain Scalability Layer-2 solutions are designed to improve the scalability of existing blockchain networks, particularly those based on Ethereum. By offloading transactions from Layer-1 blockchains, Layer-2 solutions help reduce congestion and lower gas fees. Popular Layer-2 technologies include rollups, sidechains, and state channels, all of which aim to make blockchain networks more efficient. Mantle Network, for example, uses a rollup-based system that allows for faster, cheaper transactions. By processing transactions off-chain and bundling them into a single batch, Mantle reduces the load on Ethereum’s mainnet, enhancing scalability without sacrificing security. Similarly, Manta Network focuses on privacy and scalability, using zero-knowledge proofs to create a secure and efficient Layer-2 solution. Razewin’s Energy-Efficient Alternative While Layer-2 solutions focus on improving transaction speeds and lowering fees, they still rely on the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining system for network security. Razewin, on the other hand, takes a completely different approach by using mobile-based mining that requires far less energy than traditional PoW methods. Razewin’s system allows users to mine cryptocurrency via their smartphones, turning physical movement into mining rewards. This not only reduces the environmental impact of mining but also makes it more accessible to a broader audience. By using a mobile-first approach, Razewin sidesteps the scalability challenges faced by traditional blockchains while also offering a more sustainable solution. Which Technology Is Leading the Next Revolution? Both Layer-2 solutions and Razewin’s mobile mining model represent important innovations in the blockchain space. Layer-2 technologies are essential for improving the scalability of existing blockchains, particularly for decentralized applications (dApps) that require fast and cheap transactions. However, they do not address the environmental concerns associated with PoW mining. Razewin, on the other hand, tackles both scalability and energy efficiency by offering a low-energy alternative to traditional mining. Its mobile-based system is more sustainable and accessible, making it a strong contender for the future of blockchain technology. Conclusion Layer-2 solutions and Razewin’s mobile-based mining model each offer unique advantages for the future of blockchain. Layer-2 scaling improves transaction throughput and reduces fees, but it does not address the environmental impact of mining. Razewin’s sustainable, low-energy approach provides an alternative that could lead the next wave of blockchain innovation, especially as the demand for eco-friendly solutions grows.

This month, we’re seeing a wild mix of bullish momentum, steady progress, and sharp pullbacks. BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is charging full steam ahead with a presale that’s already turning heads and breaking records. Meanwhile, Dogs (DOGS) is holding steady with a rising trading volume, showing signs of resilience. On the other hand, Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) seems to be cooling off, taking a breather after a recent all-time high. Meme coins have proven they’re more than a passing trend. From Dogecoin to the newest players on the market, they’ve carved out a massive space for themselves by blending community power, humour, and utility. BTFD Coin, in particular, is quickly positioning itself as one of the best meme coins to invest in this month thanks to its innovative staking rewards, engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a presale that has already attracted thousands of bullish investors. Let’s break down what makes these three meme coins so interesting and why they’re making waves this month. BTFD Coin: Ride the Bull Run to New Heights What happens when you combine a clever name, a booming presale, and a dedicated community? You get BTFD Coin. With its slogan “Own the Dip,” BTFD has tapped into the spirit of investors looking to capitalise on market downturns. Currently in Stage 12 of its presale, BTFD is priced at $0.00013 and has already raised an impressive $4.1 million, selling 56 billion tokens to date. For early investors, this presale isn’t just exciting—it’s a golden opportunity. Let’s say you put down $10,000 right now at the presale price of $0.00013. That nets you 76.92 million BTFD tokens. When BTFD hits its listing price of $0.0006, your investment could balloon to $46,152. That’s a life-changing return for anyone who wants to “buy the dip” and ride the bull run to new heights. But BTFD isn’t just another meme coin with empty promises. It’s also creating an engaging Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, currently live in beta. In a market where gaming is booming—especially among Gen Z and millennials—BTFD’s move into this space is timely and strategic. Imagine earning rewards for playing your favourite games while holding tokens that increase in value. That’s the dream, right? With a solid P2E foundation, BTFD has something more than hype—it’s got utility. For those who prefer to let their investments work for them, BTFD offers 90% APY staking rewards. This means you can hold your BTFD tokens, stake them, and earn significant passive income without lifting a finger. Think about it—while you’re sipping your coffee, binge-watching Netflix, or even playing BTFD’s P2E game, your tokens are busy generating returns. It’s the kind of low-effort, high-reward setup that crypto investors dream of. If you’re ready to join the bull run, here’s how you can grab your share of BTFD tokens . Start by setting up a crypto wallet—MetaMask or Trust Wallet works perfectly. Fund your wallet with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head over to BTFD’s presale page. Connect your wallet, select the amount you want to invest, and confirm the transaction. It’s that easy. Once the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your BTFD tokens and watch your investment charge ahead. With limited presale stages remaining and an upcoming listing price that’s more than 4x the current presale price, now’s the time to act. Dogs (DOGS): Holding Steady with Rising Volume Unlike some meme coins that live and die by hype, Dogs (DOGS) is proving it has a little more staying power. Trading at $0.0006787, the token is down 3.9% in the last 24 hours, but its daily trading volume has surged by 15.84%, showing that interest in the project isn’t fading. Built on the TON Blockchain, Dogs is a community-driven initiative that cleverly leverages Telegram’s massive user base. Its dog mascot—famously created by Telegram’s founder—adds charm and relatability to the project, making it easy for newcomers to latch onto the token’s mission. What makes Dogs special is its focus on tokenised stickers and community ownership. Think of it like the meme coin world’s way of introducing millions of Telegram users to blockchain technology. As more users engage with Telegram, Dogs stands a chance to grow alongside the platform’s expanding ecosystem. For now, Dogs isn’t soaring to new heights, but it’s not collapsing either. The steady volume increase signals that investors see potential here. If you’re looking for stability in a wild market, Dogs could be one of the best meme coins to invest in this month. Just a Chill Guy: Cools Off After an All-Time High Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY) has captured the hearts of TikTokers and meme lovers everywhere. The laid-back, grey-sweater-wearing character has become the poster child for relaxed vibes and “whatever” attitudes. But while Chill Guy’s cultural stock is rising, his token has taken a hit. Currently trading at $0.3171, CHILLGUY is down 13.30% in the last 24 hours and 19.33% over the past month. The market cap has slipped by 13.40%, and trading volume has fallen by 14.27%—clear signs that investors are pulling back after CHILLGUY hit its all-time high of $0.6651 on November 27th. What caused the dip? Analysts point to a mix of profit-taking and market cooldowns. But despite the recent slump, CHILLGUY’s relaxed branding continues to attract attention. The meme character has built a strong fanbase on platforms like TikTok, where his chill vibes resonate with younger investors. For those with patience, CHILLGUY’s recent pullback could offer an entry point before the next viral wave. While it’s cooling off now, the project’s cultural momentum suggests it still has room to grow, keeping it among the best meme coins to invest in this month. Concluding Remarks Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the clear leader among the best meme coins to invest in this month. With a presale that’s raised $4.1 million, delivering massive ROI potential, combined with a Play-to-Earn game and a generous 90% APY staking programme, BTFD is offering something for every kind of investor. Meanwhile, Dogs holds steady with its community-driven growth, and Just a Chill Guy is taking a breather after its recent highs. Whether you’re looking for explosive potential, steady gains, or meme-worthy branding, this month’s lineup of meme coins has something for everyone. If you’re ready to “own the dip,” BTFD Coin is the move. With limited presale stages left, now’s your chance to join the bull run and watch your investment soar.

37792536,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111277,1734513249,"Bitwise CIO Predicts Bitcoin Price Could Hit $500,000 as Strategic Reserve Adoption Looms","Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has been making headlines for its potential as a global reserve asset. In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of Bitwise Asset Management, predicted that Bitcoin’s price could skyrocket to $500,000 if the United States adopts it as a strategic reserve asset. This speculation gains momentum with initiatives like the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s (BPI) executive order proposal for President-elect Donald Trump and state-level legislative efforts to position Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Could this be the dawn of a new era for Bitcoin and global financial systems? Why Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Makes Sense 1. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins positions it as a hedge against inflation, much like gold. As the U.S. and other countries grapple with rising inflation and devalued fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers a decentralized and deflationary alternative. 2. Decentralized Nature Unlike traditional reserve assets like gold or foreign currency, Bitcoin is decentralized, reducing the geopolitical risks associated with centralized financial systems. 3. Increased Institutional Trust The increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors, including major corporations and financial institutions, has bolstered its credibility. Strategic reserve adoption would further validate its role as a reliable store of value. 4. Strategic Advantage Countries that integrate Bitcoin into their reserves could gain an edge in the digital economy. As Bitcoin adoption grows globally, early adopters could reap significant economic and strategic benefits. Matt Hougan’s Prediction: The Road to $500,000 Hougan’s bold prediction of Bitcoin reaching $500,000 hinges on two primary factors: 1. U.S. Adoption as a Reserve Asset If the U.S. government adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, it would create unprecedented demand. Given Bitcoin’s fixed supply, such demand could drive its price to historic highs. 2. Global Ripple Effect Should the U.S. take the lead, other nations may follow suit, further boosting Bitcoin’s price. This could transform Bitcoin into a global reserve currency, challenging the dominance of the U.S. dollar. Legislative and Policy Developments Supporting Bitcoin The Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Executive Order The BPI has drafted an executive order urging the incoming administration to recognize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. This move aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to integrate Bitcoin into the nation’s financial strategy. State-Level Initiatives Several U.S. states, including Texas and Ohio, have introduced bills to adopt Bitcoin reserve strategies. These efforts demonstrate growing support for Bitcoin’s integration into public financial systems. Global Trends Countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic have already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. If major economies like the U.S. join the fray, Bitcoin’s global acceptance could accelerate. The Implications of $500,000 Bitcoin 1. Market Capitalization At $500,000 per Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization would exceed $10 trillion, placing it on par with gold as a store of value. 2. Financial System Transformation Bitcoin’s rise could reshape global financial systems, reducing reliance on traditional reserve assets and introducing a more decentralized and transparent economic model. 3. Investment Surge A $500,000 Bitcoin would attract more institutional and retail investors, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of modern portfolios. Challenges to Bitcoin’s Strategic Reserve Adoption While the potential benefits are significant, several challenges remain: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Bitcoin’s classification as an asset varies globally, creating regulatory hurdles that could delay or complicate strategic reserve adoption. 2. Volatility Concerns Bitcoin’s price volatility poses a challenge for governments and institutions considering it as a reserve asset. 3. Technological Barriers Ensuring secure storage and management of Bitcoin at a national scale requires robust technological infrastructure. 4. Political Opposition Not all policymakers are on board with Bitcoin adoption. Skeptics argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and lack of physical backing make it a risky reserve asset. Expert Opinions on Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset Supporters Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy): Advocates for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value compared to gold. Anthony Pompliano: Highlights Bitcoin’s potential to revolutionize global reserve systems and reduce reliance on fiat currencies. Critics Warren Buffett: Dismisses Bitcoin as speculative, lacking intrinsic value. Nouriel Roubini: Argues that Bitcoin’s volatility undermines its suitability as a reserve asset. The Role of Bitcoin ETFs in Strategic Reserve Adoption The rise of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) plays a pivotal role in promoting Bitcoin’s adoption. With ETFs offering seamless exposure to Bitcoin, governments and institutions can easily incorporate the cryptocurrency into their reserves. Looking Ahead: The Path to $500,000 1. Continued Adoption As more states and countries explore Bitcoin reserve strategies, its price trajectory toward $500,000 becomes increasingly plausible. 2. Infrastructure Development Improvements in Bitcoin’s scalability and security will enhance its appeal as a reserve asset. 3. Public-Private Partnerships Collaboration between governments and private entities could accelerate Bitcoin’s integration into financial systems. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Strategic Reserve Potential Matt Hougan’s prediction of a $500,000 Bitcoin underscores the cryptocurrency’s transformative potential. While challenges remain, the growing interest from governments, institutions, and investors signals a bright future for Bitcoin. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction as a strategic reserve asset, it could redefine global finance, offering a decentralized and inflation-resistant alternative to traditional assets. Whether or not Bitcoin reaches $500,000, its journey toward widespread adoption is reshaping the financial landscape.

This leaves competitors like Meta, Amazon, and Google gasping for air in the AI arms race. Meta came closest but still trailed far behind, with 224,000 chips. Amazon and Google? Not even close, with orders of 196,000 and 169,000 Hopper chips respectively. Nvidia’s GPUs have become Silicon Valley’s gold standard, driving a frenzy of data center investments to support cutting-edge AI models like ChatGPT. Microsoft, with its Azure cloud infrastructure, is going all in, betting big on AI as the future of tech. Microsoft’s giant leap Nvidia’s Hopper chips, hailed as the crown jewels of AI processing, have been the hottest tech commodity for two years. They’ve become critical tools for training and running next-gen AI models. Analysts at Omdia estimate that the company’s purchases more than tripled compared to last year, a direct response to skyrocketing demand following ChatGPT’s breakout success. “Good data center infrastructure… takes multi-years of planning,” said Alistair Speirs, senior director of Azure Global Infrastructure at Microsoft. The company is also positioning itself to dominate the cloud market, renting out its hardware to customers through Azure. Omdia’s analysis shows that Microsoft’s Hopper haul dwarfs the 230,000 chips bought by ByteDance and Tencent combined. However, the chips shipped to China were modified H20 models—downgraded to comply with US export restrictions. Nvidia tweaked these chips to limit their capabilities, but even with reduced power, Chinese companies are snapping them up. The AI spending spree This year alone, tech companies have shelled out a jaw-dropping $229 billion on servers, with Microsoft leading the charge. The company’s $31 billion capital expenditure makes it the biggest spender in the global AI infrastructure boom, overshadowing Amazon’s $26 billion. According to Omdia, Nvidia GPUs accounted for 43% of server spending in 2024, cementing the company’s dominance in AI hardware. Nvidia’s Hopper chips may be the star, but Microsoft isn’t putting all its eggs in one basket. It has begun rolling out its own Maia chips, installing 200,000 units this year. Meanwhile, Amazon has been ramping up production of its Trainium and Inferentia chips, deploying 1.3 million units to fuel its AI ambitions. It’s even building a new AI cluster featuring hundreds of thousands of Trainium chips for Anthropic , an OpenAI competitor it has backed with an $8 billion investment. Meta and Google are also doubling down on their in-house chips, each deploying around 1.5 million units of their custom designs.

37794905,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320595,1734512778,ASIC Takes Binance to Court for Denying Important Consumer Protections,"The Australian corporate watchdog sued Binance’s Australian arm for failing to protect consumers misclassified as ‘wholesale clients.’ The investors were apparently exposed to highly speculative and risky crypto products, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) claimed . Oztures Trading Pty Ltd, trading as Binance Australia Derivatives, offered crypto derivative products to 505 retail investors from July 2022 to April 2023. However, the investors representing about 83% of its local clientele were misclassified as wholesale clients. As a result, the unit failed to provide important rights and consumer protections under Australian financial services laws, ASIC noted . This means Binance failed to provide product disclosure statement and access to a compliant dispute resolution scheme. “Our case alleges Binance’s compliance systems were woefully inadequate and exposed more than 500 clients to high-risk, speculative products without the right consumer protections in place,” said ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court. She added that many retail clients trading financial products suffered significant loss during the period. “In 2023, we oversaw compensation payments by Binance of approximately $13 million to affected clients.” Binance Failed to Make Target Market Determination ASIC has further sued the exchange for not making a target Target Market Determination, nor having a compliant internal dispute resolution standards. The lack of dispute resolution denies clients a structured mechanism to address grievances. Additionally, Binance failed to ensure that its financial services were delivered efficiently, honestly, and fairly, the regulator stressed. The exchange has also been accused of not adhering to license conditions and inadequate employee training. In April 2023, the ASIC cancelled the Australian financial services license held by Binance . “Our targeted review of these matters is ongoing, including focus on the extent of consumer harms,” the regulator said at the time.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Cardano and Polkadot investors eye 1Fuel OFT’s Q2 2025 debut, with its presale gaining momentum as the next big altcoin opportunity. Table of Contents DOT and ADA forecasts for 2025 Investors excited for 1Fuel’s debut in Q2 2025 1Fuel set to transform DEX wallets Endless possibilities in one wallet Cardano and Polkadot saw steady growth in 2024, especially with their all-time highs revealing strong performance. But as the market evolves, investors from the ecosystems are paying more attention to a new token debuting in Q2 2025, and that’s 1Fuel OFT. There’s a lot of buzz around the 1Fuel live presale, making it among the most exciting opportunities in the crypto market. With sky-high growth projections expected once it is listed, the excitement around 1Fuel continues to build as investors countdown to the launch. DOT and ADA forecasts for 2025 As analysts have predicted, DOT and ADA are preparing for significant price action next year, making them suitable for anyone who wants a crypto to invest in. Polkadot is currently valued at $8.63, and it reached an all-time high of $11.32 in 2024. Analysts are expecting strong performance for DOT in 2025, with the price movement between $13.01 and $45.32. The average projected price increase for 2025 is $27.50. The most optimistic outlook for DOT sets October 2025 as the peak month, as analysts expect it to surge up to 388.64% above today’s levels. This bullish sentiment is due to the increasing adoption of Polkadot’s ecosystem and growing investor confidence. On the other hand, Cardano is worth $1.06, which is shy of its 2024 all-time high of $1.231. Analysts expect that by January 2025, the price of ADA will rise by 23.41% to $1.326159.

With its promising roadmap and features, 1Fuel is a standout among altcoins in presale and is attracting attention from ADA and DOT investors. Currently in stage 2 of its presale, 1Fuel has already achieved remarkable progress with a growing number of investors comparing it to traditional options like MetaMask and Core Wallet. The presale offers early adopters the lowest possible price for OFT at $0.012, making it attractive to investors. 1Fuel set to transform DEX wallets 1Fuel is not just another crypto to invest in but is focused on revolutionizing how decentralized exchange (DEX) wallets operate. Its features aim to address some of the most pressing challenges faced by existing wallets like Core Wallet and MetaMask, for a seamless user experience. One standout feature is 1Fuel’s cross-chain transaction capabilities, which allow users to interact with multiple blockchains from a single wallet. It’s gaining traction as one of the top altcoins in presale because of its DEX wallet which bridges different ecosystems and facilitates transactions with a single click.

What Time Will It Be Announced? How Will BTC Be Affected? Here Are the Expectations and Things to Know!,"While volatility is effective in the Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency markets, all eyes are on the FED's December interest rate decision today. As is known, the FED made its first interest rate cut in September and made an aggressive start to the discount cycle with a 50 basis point cut decision. The FED also made a 25 basis point rate cut in November. After September and November, dollar, gold, stock market and cryptocurrency investors closely follow the December decision, which is the last interest rate decision of 2024, while the questions of whether the FED will continue to cut interest rates and by how much continue to be important for investors. When Will the December FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its December interest rate decision on December 18, 2024 at 22:00. In Which Direction Are Expectations Focused? The FED interest rate decision, which global markets are eagerly awaiting, will be announced today. The FED last reduced the interest rate to 4.75 percent in November. While the general expectation in the market is that the FED will reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points in December and the interest rate will fall to 4.5 percent, analysts expect the FED's interest rate decision text and FED Chairman Jerome Powell's statements to have an impact on BTC and cryptocurrency prices. At this point, after the interest rate decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make a statement at 22:30 Turkish time. The latest employment and inflation data released in the US have strengthened expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates for the third time at its last meeting of the year and lower the policy rate by 25 basis points, while Oxford Economics US Chief Economist Ryan Sweet said, “Our forecast that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points in December and then pause the rate cut in January still stands.” Sweet added that they expect three interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each for 2025. How Is Bitcoin Expected to Move? While the critical FED interest rate decision and Powell's statements are awaited, Bitcoin took a pause after exceeding $ 108,000. While this pause includes the FED's decision and the expectation that Powell will make more hawkish statements against increasing inflation, K33 Research analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman stated that the FOMC meeting will increase BTC and market volatility. Analysts stated that they expect volatility to increase after the FOMC meeting, and that the macroeconomic environment will remain relatively stable after the FOMC meeting, which will pave the way for Bitcoin to gain upward momentum. Analysts recently said that Bitcoin is poised for a holiday rally with the expected volatility following the FOMC meeting. *This is not investment advice.

37792014,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111299,1734512144,Galaxy Digital CEO Predicts Bitcoin’s Market Cap Could Surpass Gold Within 5-8 Years,"The Bitcoin-Gold Debate The CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, has reignited discussions about Bitcoin’s long-term potential by predicting that the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization could surpass gold’s within the next 5-8 years. Novogratz shared his insights on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting Bitcoin’s rising market presence and increasing adoption as catalysts for this transformation. As of now, Bitcoin’s market cap stands at $2.13 trillion—approximately 14% of gold’s $17.8 trillion market cap. The bold forecast underscores Bitcoin’s growing role as a store of value and its potential to challenge gold’s dominance as a global reserve asset. Why Novogratz’s Prediction Matters 1. Bitcoin’s Growing Share of Global Wealth Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth in recent years, transitioning from a niche digital asset to a global financial powerhouse. The cryptocurrency’s rise to 14% of gold’s market cap is a testament to its increasing adoption as a digital store of value. 2. Institutional Adoption Accelerates Growth Novogratz’s prediction comes at a time when institutions are driving Bitcoin adoption. Companies like MicroStrategy and countries such as El Salvador have incorporated Bitcoin into their reserves, bolstering its credibility. 3. The Case for Bitcoin Over Gold Unlike gold, Bitcoin offers unique advantages such as portability, divisibility, and resistance to physical confiscation. These characteristics position Bitcoin as a modern alternative to gold in an increasingly digital world. Bitcoin vs. Gold: Key Comparisons Aspect Bitcoin Gold Market Cap $2.13 trillion $17.8 trillion Portability Highly portable, can be transferred digitally Limited to physical transportation Divisibility Infinitely divisible Divisible but less practical Supply Capped at 21 million BTC Practically infinite with mining Storage Digital wallets Physical vaults or storage facilities Factors Fueling Bitcoin’s Rise 1. Institutional Adoption Institutional investments have poured billions into Bitcoin, validating its role as a legitimate financial asset. Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity are just a few examples of major players embracing Bitcoin ETFs and funds. 2. Digital Transformation The world is rapidly shifting toward digital ecosystems. Bitcoin, as a native digital asset, benefits from this trend, offering seamless integration with online financial systems. 3. Decentralization and Trust Unlike gold, which requires centralized storage and verification, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized blockchain, providing transparent and trustless value storage. 4. Scarcity and Halving Events Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins ensures its scarcity, a trait that mirrors gold. Halving events, which reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin, further limit supply and have historically driven price increases. Challenges Ahead for Bitcoin While the potential for Bitcoin to surpass gold is compelling, several hurdles remain: 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide continue to debate the role of Bitcoin in the financial system. Unfavorable regulations could impact its growth trajectory. 2. Market Volatility Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can be extreme, deterring risk-averse investors who prefer the stability of gold. 3. Public Perception Although Bitcoin’s reputation has improved, lingering skepticism and misinformation about cryptocurrencies could hinder widespread adoption. Gold’s Enduring Legacy Gold has been a trusted store of value for centuries, serving as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Its physical nature and established history make it a cornerstone of traditional investment portfolios. However, Novogratz’s prediction suggests that Bitcoin could capture a new generation of investors who value digital assets’ unique advantages. What Needs to Happen for Bitcoin to Surpass Gold? 1. Increased Adoption Bitcoin adoption needs to extend beyond institutions and retail investors. Broader use cases, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and global remittances, could drive significant growth. 2. Technological Advancements Scalability solutions like the Lightning Network are critical for Bitcoin to handle higher transaction volumes efficiently, fostering mainstream adoption. 3. Education and Awareness Educating the public about Bitcoin’s benefits and addressing misconceptions are vital for fostering trust and increasing adoption. 4. Regulatory Clarity Clear and supportive regulations would provide the stability needed for Bitcoin to attract more investors and institutions. Timeline to $17.8 Trillion Novogratz’s 5-8 year timeline is ambitious but plausible. Bitcoin’s growth has historically been exponential, driven by network effects and technological advancements. Year Projected Market Cap Percentage of Gold’s Cap 2025 $5 trillion ~28% 2027 $10 trillion ~56% 2030 $18 trillion ~101% Investor Takeaways 1. Diversification is Key Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to include both gold and Bitcoin. Each asset offers unique advantages and serves different purposes. 2. Long-Term Perspective Bitcoin’s journey to surpass gold will likely be marked by volatility. A long-term investment approach can help navigate short-term fluctuations. 3. Stay Informed Understanding the macroeconomic factors driving Bitcoin’s growth, such as inflation and institutional interest, can provide valuable insights for making informed decisions. Conclusion: The Future of Bitcoin and Gold Mike Novogratz’s prediction of Bitcoin surpassing gold’s market cap within 5-8 years reflects the transformative potential of digital assets. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, it poses a legitimate challenge to gold’s long-standing dominance as the ultimate store of value. While challenges remain, Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, combined with growing adoption and technological advancements, position it as a formidable contender in the financial landscape. For investors, the race between Bitcoin and gold presents an opportunity to diversify and capitalize on the shifting dynamics of global wealth.

37792264,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-usage-gains-ground-among-u-s-voters-survey/,1734512069,Crypto Usage Gains Ground Among U.S. Voters: Survey,"A recent Emerson College survey highlights the growing influence of crypto users in U.S. politics. Conducted between December 11 and 13, the survey of 1,000 registered voters revealed that 19% had either invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrency. Notably, nearly 40% of these respondents reported using digital assets for purchases, reflecting its increasing utility. Survey Findings Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College polling, noted the demographic diversity of digital asset users. “Crypto users are younger and represent a more diverse constituency, making them a growing political force,” Kimball noted. The poll found that 57% of these users hold a favorable view of President-elect Donald Trump, who has shown staunch support for the industry. The survey also underscored a generational divide: 28% of voters in their 40s reported using digital assets, compared to just 9% of those in their 60s and only 4% over the age of 70. Men were twice as likely as women to engage with digital assets, with 26% of male respondents versus 13% of female respondents acknowledging their use. Ethnically, a third of crypto users identified as Asian, Hispanic, or Black, while only 14% were white. Pro-Crypto Candidates Gain Momentum The pro-crypto sentiment isn’t confined to the voter base. Trump’s administration has already signaled its support for the sector, with key nominations of pro-crypto figures for financial regulatory roles, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. This aligns with findings from a survey conducted by the Digital Chamber, which identified a “crypto voting bloc” of 26 million U.S. voters who prioritize digital asset-friendly policies. The study revealed that 16% of respondents considered crypto policy “extremely” or “very” important when choosing a political candidate. Further data from Grayscale and a market research firm suggested that over half of U.S. voters would favor digital asset-friendly candidates. This sentiment was reflected in the 2024 election results, where hundreds of pro-crypto candidates secured congressional seats. Industry leaders now anticipate a regulatory environment more favorable than ever before, potentially cementing the U.S. as a global leader in digital assets .

37791960,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111271,1734512055,Messari Report: Rootstock Achieves Record Growth in Q3 2024,"Rootstock’s Unprecedented Growth in Q3 2024 Rootstock (RSK), a Bitcoin sidechain known for enabling smart contracts, experienced remarkable growth in the third quarter of 2024. According to a recent report by Messari, Rootstock achieved an all-time high in daily active accounts , alongside record-breaking transaction volumes and a significant increase in total value locked (TVL). This article will explore the insights from Messari’s report, highlighting Rootstock’s Q3 achievements, key milestones, and the implications of its continued development within the blockchain ecosystem. Key Metrics: Breaking Records Across the Board 61% Increase in Daily Active Accounts Rootstock recorded a 61% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth in daily active accounts , reaching a record high of 1,732 accounts by the end of Q3. This rise indicates increased adoption and user engagement, driven by Rootstock’s innovative offerings and ecosystem expansions. Record-Breaking Transactions On August 5, 2024 , Rootstock set a new benchmark with 13,820 daily transactions , an 18.5% increase compared to Q2. The surge in transactions reflects heightened activity across the network, likely fueled by new integrations and upgrades. Growth in Total Value Locked (TVL) Rootstock’s TVL saw a 27.53% increase , climbing from $135.2 million to $172.4 million by the end of Q3. The growth underscores Rootstock’s expanding utility and its role in fostering decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on the Bitcoin network. Factors Driving Rootstock’s Q3 Growth 1. Technological Milestones First ZK SNARK Verified on Bitcoin : Rootstock became the first network to integrate a zero-knowledge proof (ZK SNARK) verified on the Bitcoin blockchain. This achievement enhances privacy and scalability for Rootstock users, setting a precedent for future development.

Focus on Decentralization With the RootstockCollective DAO in place, the network is poised to achieve greater decentralization, empowering its community to shape the platform’s future. Enhanced Interoperability The Flyover protocol and other interoperability initiatives will likely attract more developers and users, solidifying Rootstock’s position as a leading smart contract platform. Scaling Adoption Rootstock’s continuous innovation and user-centric upgrades are expected to drive further adoption, especially as it explores new use cases and partnerships. Tips for Investors and Developers Monitor Ecosystem Growth : Keep an eye on Rootstock’s expanding ecosystem and the adoption of its protocols, as these metrics indicate long-term sustainability. Leverage DAO Participation : If you’re part of the Rootstock community, participate in the DAO to influence the network’s direction and governance. Explore Use Cases : Developers should explore Rootstock’s platform for creating innovative DeFi and dApp solutions that leverage Bitcoin’s security. Conclusion: A Promising Future for Rootstock Rootstock’s Q3 achievements mark a pivotal moment in its journey, showcasing its potential to revolutionize Bitcoin-based smart contracts and DeFi applications. With record-breaking growth in daily active accounts, transactions, and TVL, Rootstock is well-positioned to lead the next wave of blockchain innovation. As the network continues to achieve technological milestones and expand its ecosystem, it presents exciting opportunities for investors, developers, and users alike. The future of Bitcoin-backed smart contracts looks brighter than ever, and Rootstock is at the forefront of this transformation.

37791911,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111268,1734511964,Meme Coin Trading Volume Plummets Over 50% in One Month: What It Means for Crypto Investors,"A Sudden Decline in Meme Coin Popularity The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and meme coins have been at the forefront of both excitement and risk. However, the latest data from CoinMarketCap reveals a significant shift in the trend. Meme coin trading volume has dropped more than 50% in a single month , raising concerns among investors and traders alike. In this article, we’ll delve into what’s driving this decline, analyze key market trends, and discuss whether meme coins are entering a bear market or if this is merely a temporary dip. Meme Coin Trading Volume: A Rapid Decline What the Data Tells Us According to CoinMarketCap, meme coins, which include popular names like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE) , have seen their trading volume shrink dramatically by over half in just 30 days. This trend is noteworthy, considering the massive hype that meme coins have garnered in recent years. Major Meme Coins’ Performance While meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe have managed to maintain a relatively stable performance, the broader meme coin market is struggling. This inconsistency suggests a decline in speculative interest and a shift in investor behavior. Historical Context Meme coins rose to prominence largely due to their appeal as speculative assets, fueled by social media hype and celebrity endorsements. However, with the recent drop in trading volumes, their long-term sustainability is being called into question. What’s Behind the Decline in Meme Coin Trading Volume? Several factors could be contributing to the sharp decline in meme coin trading volume: Market Saturation The meme coin market has become oversaturated, with thousands of new tokens launching each month. This oversupply dilutes investor interest and spreads trading volume across too many options, leaving established coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to compete for market share. Reduced Retail Participation Meme coins primarily attract retail investors. However, rising macroeconomic concerns, including inflation and stagnant wage growth, may have limited disposable income for speculative investments like meme coins. Regulatory Uncertainty The cryptocurrency market continues to face global regulatory scrutiny, with meme coins often seen as the riskiest category. This has discouraged institutional and retail investors from engaging with these assets. Bearish Sentiment in Crypto Markets While the overall cryptocurrency market has shown signs of resilience, many altcoins, including meme coins, have underperformed. This has led to a broader shift toward safer, more stable assets. Are We Entering a Meme Coin Bear Market? While it’s too early to definitively call this a bear market for meme coins, several indicators suggest a weakening trend: Lower Market Activity : The sharp drop in trading volume indicates reduced investor enthusiasm and participation. Declining Social Media Mentions : Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, which have historically driven meme coin rallies, are seeing fewer mentions and discussions about meme coins. Increased Losses for Traders : Many meme coin traders have reported losses due to high volatility and sharp price corrections. These factors, combined with the 50% drop in trading volume, paint a picture of caution for meme coin enthusiasts. Key Players: Dogecoin and Pepe Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin remains the leader in the meme coin space, with a loyal community and a relatively stable price compared to newer meme coins. However, its trading volume has also declined, reflecting broader market trends. Pepe: A Rising Star or a Fading Trend? Pepe saw massive hype upon its launch but has struggled to sustain momentum. Despite its initial success, the coin’s performance has leveled off, mirroring the overall decline in meme coin trading activity. What This Means for Meme Coin Investors 1. High Volatility Remains a Challenge Meme coins are inherently volatile, and the recent trading volume drop highlights the risks associated with these assets. Investors should be prepared for rapid price swings and the possibility of significant losses. 2. Diversification Is Key To mitigate risk, investors should consider diversifying their portfolios with more stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), which have stronger fundamentals. 3. Stay Informed Keeping up with market trends, regulatory developments, and social media sentiment can help investors make informed decisions. 4. Focus on Utility Meme coins with real-world use cases or innovative features are more likely to succeed in the long term. Investors should prioritize projects that offer tangible value beyond mere speculation. Expert Opinions on the Decline Crypto Analysts Weigh In Many crypto analysts have pointed to market maturity as a key reason for the decline in meme coin trading volume. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, speculative assets like meme coins may lose appeal in favor of more established and utility-driven projects. What the Data Says Market data also supports the view that meme coins are losing steam. For instance, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have seen a notable decrease in meme coin trades, reflecting lower retail participation. The Future of Meme Coins Despite the current challenges, meme coins are unlikely to disappear entirely. Their unique blend of humor, community, and speculative appeal ensures they will always have a niche audience. However, for meme coins to thrive in the long term, they must evolve beyond their current limitations. This could include developing real-world use cases, improving security measures, and fostering greater transparency. Tips for Navigating the Meme Coin Market Do Your Research : Always investigate a coin’s team, roadmap, and community before investing. Avoid FOMO : Resist the urge to invest based on hype alone. Set Realistic Goals : Understand your risk tolerance and set clear profit and loss targets. Use Stop-Loss Orders : Protect your investments from significant downturns with stop-loss orders. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for Meme Coin Enthusiasts The 50% drop in meme coin trading volume serves as a reminder of the volatile and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. While major players like Dogecoin and Pepe continue to hold their ground, the broader market shows signs of weakness. For investors, this is a time for caution and strategic planning. By staying informed and diversifying portfolios, traders can navigate the challenges of the meme coin market while positioning themselves for future opportunities. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, only time will tell whether meme coins can regain their former glory or fade into obscurity.

37791924,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629473,1734511675,JPMorgan Head warns Trump tariffs could reawaken 1970 stagflation; Here’s why,"In May, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned of a potential return to stagflation this year, an economic condition marked by stagnant growth coupled with rising inflation. Now, with Donald Trump’s proposed Tariffs, economists are debating whether Jamie Dimon’s predictions will come true. Speaking to panelists at a conference, Dimon pointed to years of extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus as contributing factors, including the Federal Reserve’s hiking of interest rates at the time. “ How can you tell me it won’t lead to stagflation? ” he questioned. While Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell dismissed these concerns earlier this year, describing stagflation as an unlikely scenario, recent developments have reignited the debate. President-elect Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff proposals are being scrutinized as a possible catalyst for economic disruptions reminiscent of the 1970s. Trump’s tariff threats raise economic tensions Trump has pledged to impose sweeping tariffs once in office, including a 25% levy on imports from Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on goods from China. On the campaign trail, he further suggested a 10% to 20% tax on all imports and hinted at raising tariffs on Chinese products by as much as 60%. While some experts speculate these proposals might be negotiation tactics, the implementation of such broad-based tariffs could severely impact the economy. The risk, according to analysts, lies in higher consumer prices, disrupted supply chains, and retaliatory measures from trading partners. The U.S. economy hasn’t faced stagflation since the 1970s, a period defined by high unemployment, soaring inflation, and slow economic growth. During that time, the Federal Reserve’s initial response of lowering interest rates to address unemployment led to runaway inflation. In a dramatic shift, the Fed later prioritized combating inflation by aggressively raising rates, plunging the economy into a recession. Powell, recalling the challenges of that era, noted, “ It was 10% unemployment, high single-digit inflation, and very slow growth .” The 1970s stagflation, triggered in part by the Arab oil embargo, upended conventional economic theories about the relationship between inflation and unemployment. Current economic conditions differ from the 1970s Despite Dimon’s warnings, the U.S. economy today is far from the dire conditions of the 1970s. Unemployment stands at 4.2%, significantly below historical averages, and inflation has cooled to just above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target after peaking at a 40-year high two years ago. Economic growth remains steady, with the annualized rate at 2.8% last quarter, even as the Fed maintains elevated interest rates to keep inflation in check. The central bank’s recent rate cuts are expected to continue, though their full impact could take years to materialize. Economists are divided on the potential fallout from Trump’s proposed tariffs. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, argued that while tariffs could drive up prices for many goods, the inflationary impact might be limited to an initial surge similar to a sales tax increase. However, he cautioned that prolonged inflationary expectations could lead to higher wage demands and sustained price hikes. The risk of stagflation grows if other countries retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, which could force employers to cut jobs. Additionally, businesses facing heightened uncertainty might delay investments, further dampening growth. Feroli emphasized that stagflation remains a worst-case scenario rather than the baseline forecast. He noted that sufficient time for businesses to adapt to higher tariffs could mitigate the economic shock. Expert: Trump policies could slow down economic growth Another economist and expert financial analyst, Nouriel Roubini, cautioned that the U.S. economy could face the risk of stagflation if President-elect Donald Trump’s economic policies are implemented without restraint. Roubini, renowned for his accurate prediction of the 2008 global financial crisis, pointed to the potential consequences of unchecked political control under Trump’s administration. With the Republican Party holding sway over the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary, Roubini argued that institutional checks on Trump’s policies would be minimal. “ There is no political discipline because they control the executive, the Supreme Court, the judges, the Congress, ” Roubini told ABC News. Instead, he suggested that the primary constraints on Trump’s economic decisions might come from financial markets, specifically bond traders. Roubini also outlined a dual-edged impact of Trump’s proposed economic agenda. Pro-business measures such as corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and increased fossil fuel production could stimulate growth and help curb inflation . However, other initiatives might have the opposite effect, reducing growth while driving up inflation, he noted. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo economists echoed JPMorgan’s Feroli’s sentiments in a recent note, warning of a “modest stagflationary shock” if tariffs are enacted shortly after Trump’s inauguration. They projected higher near-term inflation and slower growth but highlighted significant uncertainty around future policies. “ Should this occur, the probability of a stagflation scenario in our growth model would likely increase, ” the note stated. Still, both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan economists agree that inflation is unlikely to rise sharply beyond current levels.

37793207,https://invezz.com/?p=2392876,1734511656,Crypto craze grips Indian small towns as youngsters look to diversify portfolios,"India’s cryptocurrency market is rapidly evolving, with smaller cities and towns stepping up as active players in the digital assets space. A recent report by CoinSwitch says tier-2 and tier-3 cities like Botad, Jalandhar, Patna, Kanchipuram, and Dehradun are becoming increasingly active in the country’s crypto ecosystem. This marks a significant shift from the earlier dominance of major metropolitan areas like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. This wave of growth is primarily driven by younger investors, many of whom are under 35, looking to diversify their portfolios with cryptocurrencies. The country now boasts over 2 crore crypto users, with a majority exploring a range of digital assets, from mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to niche meme coins and decentralised finance (DeFi) tokens. Younger investors dominate the crypto landscape CoinSwitch’s report reveals that young Indians are leading the charge in crypto adoption, with 75% of investors aged 35 or younger. The 26-35 age group accounts for the largest segment at 42%, followed by the 18-25 demographic at 30%. Even older age groups are beginning to participate more actively, with individuals aged 36 and above now contributing 28% to the market. Balaji Srihari, Vice President at CoinSwitch, said, 2024 has been a huge year for the global crypto ecosystem, driven by big political and regulatory changes that have sped up mainstream growth. At CoinSwitch, we’ve witnessed a spike in crypto investment across India. “What was once concentrated in major metros is now quickly expanding to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, reflecting the growing appeal. Indian investors are diversifying their portfolios, exploring everything from meme coins to Layer-1 and DeFi tokens,” he added. In an interview with Invezz earlier this year, Sumit Gupta, co-founder of CoinDCX, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in India, said maturation of Indian crypto investors on the platform was one of the most striking trends that the company witnessed. “The average age rose from 25 in 2022 to 30 in 2023, attracting seasoned investors beyond the traditionally young demographic,” he said. Smaller cities shaping India’s crypto future Regional diversification is reshaping India’s crypto market. While Delhi-NCR continues to lead in overall investment volumes, smaller cities are catching up fast. Bengaluru emerged as the leader in Layer-1 token activity, while Barbaka, a town in Assam, dominated the DeFi segment with 24% of participation. Jalandhar showed its strength in meme coin investments, contributing 18% to the sector. Gupta had also revealed insights that concur with CoinSwitch’s findings. “Tier-2 cities like Lucknow and Patna emerged as surprising leaders in crypto adoption. Jaipur, Indore, Bhubaneswar, and Ludhiana, breaking into the top 15, challenged the notion of major urban centres monopolizing the crypto investment space,” he said. Meme coins and DeFi tokens rise in popularity Meme coins have emerged as a significant category, accounting for 13% of India’s total crypto investments in 2024. Dogecoin remains the top choice, capturing 55% of all meme coin investments, followed by PEPE at 12% and BONK at 6%. PEPE has been a standout performer, recording an incredible 1300% growth this year. Layer-1 tokens continue to dominate the crypto landscape with 37% of total investments, while DeFi tokens have secured the second spot with a 17% share. Meme coins, gaming tokens, and Layer-2 assets have also made notable contributions, collectively accounting for over 81% of the market in 2024.

37791630,https://crypto.news/?p=14320355,1734511319,AI forecasts new viral altcoin could create more millionaires than SHIB and PEPE,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. AI identifies Rollblock as the next 100x altcoin, rivaling Shiba Inu and Pepe’s explosive gains. Table of Contents Rollblock gets AI vote with blockchain-backed sports bets Shiba Inu burns tokens with abandon as it rises 10% Pepe rides high on Musk memes Rollblock remains the best crypto bet for crushing it in 2025 Many crypto investors are turning to the power of AI to identify the next hot altcoin to add to their portfolios. Recently, AI has come to realize the huge disruptive potential of the Rollblock (RBLK) web3 casino presale, which is on track to deliver comparable 100x returns to meme giants such as Shiba Inu and Pepe. Rollblock gets AI vote with blockchain-backed sports bets Rollblock ( RBLK ) has recently been AI’s crypto pick of choice, as hyper-intelligent AI platforms have identified many bullish catalysts on the horizon for this upstart GambleFi protocol. Rollblock combines a truly comprehensive gaming platform with over 7,000 casino classics and a brand-new sports betting feature that will see sports fans lining up to place bets on thousands of live international sporting tournaments. The RBLK token powers the entire ecosystem, leveraging the Ethereum blockchain to provide Rollblock gamers with unparalleled peace of mind that their bets won’t be manipulated. RBLK features a hard cap of a billion tokens, meaning it is worlds away from typical crypto gaming cash grabs that regularly inflate their supply. RBLK will, in fact, become scarcer over time as Rollblock scales, thanks to the unique Rollblock revenue-sharing scheme that will see a significant portion of Rollblock profits rolled back into buying up RBLK on the open market each week. 60% of these buybacks will be immediately burned to reduce the supply, and the rest is regularly allocated to stakers in the community. Stage 9 tokens are selling rapidly for just $0.0415 exclusively at the Rollblock presale page. You might also like: DeFi ecosystem for BTC, says Hoskinson; Rollblock early backers to take advantage Shiba Inu burns tokens with abandon as it rises 10% Shiba Inu remains the second-largest meme coin in the crypto market as it has risen by 10% this month to reach $0.000027. This brings the Shiba Inu market cap to an astonishing $16 billion and secures its position at number 13 in the crypto rankings. Recently, the Shiba Inu burn rate jumped by 515%, as 72.8 million SHIB tokens were locked in unspendable wallets. This is always bullish for Shiba Inu price action, as fewer coins in circulation mean a reduction in the selling pressure on Shiba Inu trading pairs. Pepe rides high on Musk memes Pepe recently broke back into the crypto top 20, as this popular frog-based meme has jumped by 9.9% in the last 30 days of trading to reach $0.0000234. Unexpectedly, Elon Musk tweeted a series of Pepe memes to his millions of followers on the X social media platform. While Musk usually favors Dogecoin memes, his move into Pepe viral posts could signal an opening of his meme portfolio into Pepe. Pepe has been one of the best performers of this bull market so far, growing by 7,600% since its inception in the bear market. Rollblock remains the best crypto bet for crushing it in 2025 While Pepe’s best days are probably behind it, Rollblock offers the greatest chance to recreate such blistering 100x moves according to AI. Head to the Rollblock presale to secure an allocation before the price goes parabolic in 2025. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials .

This move, approved by the firm’s board of directors, is part of its broader strategy to integrate Bitcoin into its financial framework. Details of the New Venture The announcement , shared in a post on X, follows a series of shareholder approvals and strategic moves aimed at positioning the company as a leader in Bitcoin adoption and management. In it, Metaplanet stated that its new business line will focus on purchasing, holding, and managing the crypto asset through various financial instruments, including loans, equity issuances, and convertible bonds. The document also reveals Bitcoin purchases and accumulation will be conducted with BTC Yield as the primary performance metric. Metaplanet will also continue generating premium income from Bitcoin put option sales, which capitalize on the asset’s volatility to drive revenue. Furthermore, its exclusive license for Bitcoin Magazine Japan will be used to create new revenue streams through BTC-related marketing activities and educational initiatives. By combining these efforts, the investment firm is seeking to solidify its role as Japan’s leading Bitcoin treasury company and a pioneer in the country’s crypto ecosystem. It emphasized that the new business model will complement its existing hotel operations, with both areas serving as core pillars of the firm’s growth strategy. Financial Achievements The Tokyo-based company is on track to achieve its first consolidated operating profit in seven years, just months after adding BTC to its balance sheet. In a separate disclosure on December 18, it projected revenue of 890 million yen ($5.8 million) for the fiscal year ending December 31, a significant jump from the 261 million yen reported the previous year. A major portion of this revenue, 520 million yen ($3.4 million), came from selling Bitcoin put options. Additionally, the investment firm reported unrealized gains of approximately 7.446 billion yen ($48.6 million) on its BTC holdings. Since pivoting to the number one cryptocurrency as a treasury asset in April 2024 to hedge against the weakening yen, Metaplanet has actively pursued several capital-raising efforts to support its acquisition strategy. These include securing $66 million through its 11th stock acquisition rights exercise in October, raising $11.3 million via bond issuance in early November, and obtaining $62 million through its 12th stock acquisition rights later that month. Most recently, on December 16, it issued a fourth bond worth nearly 4.5 billion yen ($30 million) and announced plans for an additional 5 billion yen in private placement bonds. As of today, Metaplanet holds 1,018 BTC , valued at approximately $118 million, according to BitcoinTreasuries.

While the earlier rally brought excitement to the market, several factors are now contributing to the downward trend. If Bitcoin fails to break through its resistance level, it could drop further to around $95,000. The Impact of the Fed’s Interest Rate Decision One major reason for Bitcoin’s price decline is the upcoming interest rate decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Coinpedia News reports that there is a 96% chance the Fed will lower rates by 25 basis points. However, there are concerns about how the Fed will handle inflation moving forward. Inflation reached 2.8% in November, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments on the 2025 rate outlook are drawing attention. If the Fed cuts rates more than expected in 2025, it could put significant pressure on the market. Traders Cash In Their Profits Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price drop is a wave of selling by short-term holders. Many traders who bought Bitcoin recently are now selling to lock in their profits after the rally. This type of selling is common when prices hit new highs, as traders seek to secure gains. Long-term holders, who bought Bitcoin when it was trading between $90,000 and $100,000, are largely staying inactive. They may be waiting for more stable market conditions before deciding to act. Bitcoin Is Correcting – But Don’t Panic! Bitcoin’s past price cycles show that corrections are a natural part of its growth. In previous all-time highs, Bitcoin has experienced pullbacks of up to 34%. These short-term drops can erase weeks of gains, but they are considered a normal part of how the market behaves. Analysts believe this correction might temporarily push Bitcoin below $100,000 before it stabilizes. What’s Next for Bitcoin’s Price? Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $104,000, marking a 2.93% decline in the past 24 hours. To maintain its upward momentum, Bitcoin needs to turn this new price peak into solid support. If it does, the price could rise past the highly anticipated $110,000 mark. However, if Bitcoin struggles to break above this resistance and hold its position, it could face further declines, potentially retreating toward its next key support level at $95,651. With so many factors at play, the next move for Bitcoin could reshape its path for the rest of the year – and 2025!",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/key-reasons-why-bitcoin-price-is-down/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

However, as it hit the peak at $263, it initially took a sideways path followed by a downturn. SOL is one of the cryptos that could rally literally; however, the sudden shift in momentum caused the community to talk. Is it the start of a downturn for the fifth biggest crypto or is there something we are missing? Solana On a Roller Coaster Solana hit $263 on November 22 but then dipped to $203 last week. Since October 10, it had been in an upward parallel channel with some up spikes. It tried crossing the ATH a few times but failed which pushed it down to the parallel channel again. Initially it looked like the channel was going to hold the price but soon it fell out from the bottom, hitting $203. Source : Tradingview This movement drove it under all the moving averages and now they are the active resistance. We even witnessed the death cross over on December 11 on a 4 hour chart. Even the RSI at 43 gives a signal about lack of momentum. However the trading volume is up by almost 39% as compared to the last 24 hours. What’s the Next Target for Solana? Solana’s next big target is $300. But first, it needs to break through resistance levels at $222 and will have to fight its way to $263. Easier said than done. Right now, the price sits at $215.32, and interest is growing, with open interest rising by 2.25% to $5.34 billion. Investors are closely watching these key price points to see where Solana heads next. New Staking Opportunities for Solana Investors On the investment side, Bitwise launched a Solana Staking ETP (BSOL) in Europe. This new product is designed to address the previous lack of staking rewards from Bitwise’s Solana ETP, ESOL. BSOL offers a staking reward rate of 6.48%, which is higher than the 5.49% from 21Shares. While things are moving slower in the US, Bitwise has filed for a spot Solana ETF, though approval is still up in the air. What’s Next for Solana? Right now, Solana’s price is in a bit of a struggle. Some analysts believe it could retest the $203 support level before bouncing back. It’s a tough spot, but there’s still potential for growth. There are fewer moments in crypto when some solid crypto starts moving down during a rally.

Both projects have made significant strides in Web3 adoption, highlighting their potential for growth in 2024. Litecoin’s ETF interest is particularly noteworthy, marking a pivotal step for mainstream crypto integration. On the other hand, Filecoin is shaking up the data economy with its storage solutions. But another project deserves your attention: Qubetics . This underdog isn’t just innovating; it’s revolutionising the VPN market with its decentralised dVPN solution. Tackling real-world issues like privacy, security, and data restrictions, Qubetics is carving its niche while attracting over 10,300 investors in its presale. Let’s explore why these three coins stand out this month. Qubetics: Redefining Online Privacy with Decentralised VPN The internet is riddled with vulnerabilities, from data breaches to invasive privacy practices. Traditional VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) claim to offer privacy, but they’re centralised and often fall short in protecting user data. Enter Qubetics’ decentralised VPN (dVPN)—a solution designed to fix these gaps. The digital landscape has seen a significant uptick in cyberattacks and privacy violations. According to a recent report by Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime is expected to reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. Centralised VPNs, while popular, are often susceptible to data breaches and can sometimes restrict user freedom by logging and sharing data. Qubetics’ dVPN changes the game by decentralising data routes, making it nearly impossible for hackers or third parties to intercept user traffic. This not only enhances security but also ensures users have complete control over their data. Currently in its 13th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 350 million $TICS tokens, raising more than $6.9 million. The token’s price, set at $0.0342, offers an excellent entry point for early investors. Analysts predict that $TICS could see significant value growth, thanks to its unique use case and robust community backing. Invest $1,000 in Qubetics today, and you’d secure approximately 29,239 $TICS tokens. If the token value rises to $1—an achievable target given its current trajectory—you’re looking at an ROI exceeding 28x. To learn more about Qubetics, you can watch this video . Litecoin: A Veteran With New Momentum Litecoin has long been a staple in the cryptocurrency market, often referred to as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” While its reputation as a reliable payment method is well established, Litecoin has recently captured investor attention with its growing ETF interest. As reported by TechPoint Africa, Litecoin ETFs are gaining traction among institutional investors. This marks a major step toward making cryptocurrency more accessible to traditional investors. An ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) allows people to invest in Litecoin without needing to directly purchase or store the cryptocurrency. This newfound interest is driving liquidity and boosting confidence in Litecoin’s future. The asset’s capped supply of 84 million coins ensures scarcity, which could lead to a price surge as demand increases. Filecoin: Revolutionising Data Storage Filecoin is disrupting the data economy by offering decentralised storage solutions. Unlike traditional cloud providers like AWS or Google, Filecoin leverages blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin’s ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with new integrations and partnerships aimed at enhancing its usability. The network allows users to rent out unused storage space in exchange for FIL tokens, creating a decentralised alternative to centralised data storage providers. Filecoin’s decentralised approach not only lowers costs but also ensures greater data security. This is particularly relevant in today’s world, where data breaches are becoming increasingly common. Filecoin’s current price offers an attractive entry point, especially for long-term investors. With $1,000, you could acquire a substantial amount of FIL tokens. As the demand for decentralised storage grows, Filecoin’s market cap and token value are expected to rise significantly. Conclusion Litecoin and Filecoin are undoubtedly strong contenders for your portfolio this month, but Qubetics offers a unique opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a revolutionary project. Its decentralised VPN is solving real-world problems in a way no other blockchain project is currently addressing. The 13th presale stage won’t last forever, and neither will the chance to invest in $TICS at $0.0342. Don’t let FOMO get the better of you—make Qubetics your top choice this month and secure your share of the future of online privacy. Visit the Qubetics presale today to join the movement and position yourself for massive returns. The time to act is now!

37791238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663986,1734510606,Ethereum Sees Net Outflows On Spot Exchanges—Is a Major Price Rally Coming?,"As Ethereum attempts to rally alongside Bitcoin, the asset appears to have been spotlighted as analysts assess its fundamentals to grasp what is ongoing behind the scenes. A key factor influencing ETH’s price so far, according to the latest analysis, is the relationship between net flows on spot exchanges and investor behaviour. Net flows measure the balance between Ethereum entering and exiting exchanges, providing a critical indicator of potential price trends. Related Reading: Ethereum May Retest $3,700 Before a Major Rally, Analyst Predicts Net Outflows And Conditions For Ethereum Price Growth Notably, net outflows typically signal bullish sentiment as investors transfer their ETH to cold wallets, reducing selling pressure on the market. In contrast, an increase in net inflows often reflects readiness to sell, which can create downward pressure. According to CryptoQuant analyst cryptoavails, these patterns in Ethereum’s net flow data have played a notable role in past price cycles. For example, in early 2022, when Ethereum’s price dropped from $4,000 to $1,000, net inflows were dominant, indicating heightened selling activity. However, the trend reversed in July 2022, with net outflows supporting Ethereum’s gradual price recovery. For Ethereum to maintain an upward trend, the analyst highlights that sustained net outflows are essential. When ETH is withdrawn from exchanges, the circulation tightens, reducing selling pressure. This supply-demand imbalance can favor higher prices as investor confidence grows. Particularly, a steady pattern of net outflows signals that investors are holding Ethereum long-term, suggesting an environment for price appreciation. However, cryptoavails mentioned that Ethereum’s growth momentum remains sensitive to sudden market shifts. A significant influx of ETH back onto exchanges could increase selling pressure, leading to short-term corrections. The analyst wrote: This dynamic supports upward pressure on the price. However, sustainability is crucial—sudden net inflows can lead to short-term selling pressure, weakening the trend. What This Means For The Altcoin Market Ethereum’s performance holds broader implications for the altcoin market. As a leading altcoin in cryptocurrency, its movements often set the tone for altcoin trends. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, a strong Ethereum rally supported by consistent net outflows can ignite an “altcoin season,” where altcoins experience significant price gains following Ethereum’s upward trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Reaches $4,100 For The First Time In Over Three Years, Aiming For $5,000 Next During such periods, investor sentiment shifts positively across the broader crypto market, driving demand for smaller-cap assets. cryptoavails concluded: Ethereum’s strong performance is essential for the anticipated altcoin season. ETH’s movements will significantly influence the future performance of altcoins. Thus, Ethereum’s net flow data on spot exchanges is a critical indicator that investors should closely monitor.

37791268,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111274,1734510603,"Bitcoin ETFs Set to Surpass Gold ETFs in Asset Scale, Says ETF Store CEO","Bitcoin ETFs Gaining Ground Against Gold ETFs The competition between Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and gold ETFs is heating up as digital assets continue to capture the imagination of investors worldwide. Nate Geraci, CEO of The ETF Store, a U.S.-based investment advisory firm, recently stated that Bitcoin ETFs could reach three times the asset scale of gold ETFs in the long run . With Bitcoin ETFs nearing $120 billion in assets under management (AUM) compared to gold ETFs’ $125 billion, the gap is already narrowing. According to K33 Research, the combined AUM of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, including spot, futures, and leveraged funds, has already surpassed that of gold ETFs for the first time. Let’s dive deeper into why Bitcoin ETFs are poised to outpace their gold counterparts and what this could mean for the investment landscape. Bitcoin ETFs: A Rapidly Growing Asset Class Strong Market Demand for Bitcoin ETFs The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by major regulatory bodies has opened the floodgates for institutional and retail investors alike. Bitcoin ETFs offer a seamless way to gain exposure to the leading cryptocurrency without the complexities of wallet management and private key security. Advantages Over Gold ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are tapping into a growing narrative that positions Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Unlike gold, Bitcoin offers additional features such as scarcity, divisibility, and portability. With a capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against inflation and a store of value is gaining traction, especially among younger, tech-savvy investors. Global Momentum Bitcoin ETF adoption is not limited to the U.S.; international markets are also embracing these investment vehicles. Canada, Europe, and Australia have seen significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to their rapid growth on a global scale. Gold ETFs: A Mature but Slowing Market Current State of Gold ETFs Gold ETFs have been a go-to asset for decades, with a reputation as a reliable hedge during economic uncertainty. However, their growth has stagnated as younger generations gravitate towards digital assets. Challenges in Competing with Bitcoin ETFs Limited Appeal to Younger Investors: Millennials and Gen Z investors are more inclined towards Bitcoin, which they perceive as more innovative and aligned with modern technology. Lack of Innovation: Gold ETFs have largely remained unchanged in their offering, while Bitcoin ETFs continue to evolve with new types, including leveraged and futures-based ETFs. Why Bitcoin ETFs Are Poised to Surpass Gold ETFs 1. Rising Institutional Interest Institutions are increasingly allocating funds to Bitcoin ETFs as a way to diversify portfolios and hedge against macroeconomic risks. The involvement of financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity in launching Bitcoin ETFs has further legitimized this asset class. 2. Digital-Native Investors Driving Growth The digital economy is shaping investment trends, and Bitcoin sits at the intersection of technology and finance. Younger generations, who are more accustomed to digital currencies, are likely to favor Bitcoin ETFs over traditional assets like gold. 3. Higher Return Potential While gold has historically been a stable investment, Bitcoin’s volatility offers higher upside potential. This attracts risk-tolerant investors looking for substantial gains, especially during bull markets. 4. Regulatory Approvals Boosting Confidence The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a game-changer, providing investors with a transparent and regulated way to invest in Bitcoin. This has alleviated concerns about market manipulation and custody issues, making Bitcoin ETFs more appealing. 5. Expanding Use Cases for Bitcoin Beyond its role as an investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being used for cross-border payments, remittances, and as a medium of exchange in various ecosystems. This adds intrinsic value to Bitcoin, which is reflected in its growing adoption and price. Expert Opinions: Bitcoin ETFs vs. Gold ETFs Nate Geraci’s bold prediction that Bitcoin ETFs could grow to three times the size of gold ETFs underscores the confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. In his analysis, Geraci acknowledged that this projection might appear ambitious but pointed out that Bitcoin’s unique attributes and growing adoption could widen the gap over time. K33 Research added weight to this narrative by highlighting that U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in combined AUM. This milestone signals a shift in investor preferences, as more funds flow into the digital asset space. Key Milestones for Bitcoin ETFs First Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval: Regulatory bodies approving spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a major catalyst for inflows. Increased Participation from Financial Giants: Companies like BlackRock and ARK Invest launching Bitcoin ETFs have brought credibility to the market. Growing Global Adoption: Countries beyond the U.S. are embracing Bitcoin ETFs, further expanding their market reach. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs? Continued Growth in AUM If Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, Bitcoin ETFs are likely to see exponential growth in AUM. For every $1,000 increase in Bitcoin’s price, ETF Store CEO Geraci estimates an additional $440 million added to Bitcoin ETFs. Market Dynamics The competition between Bitcoin ETFs and gold ETFs will intensify, but Bitcoin’s superior growth rate suggests it will emerge as the dominant asset class in the ETF space. Potential Risks While the outlook is optimistic, risks such as regulatory changes, market volatility, and macroeconomic factors could impact Bitcoin ETFs’ growth trajectory. Investors should remain vigilant and diversify portfolios to mitigate risks. Final Thoughts: The Future of Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly gaining ground, challenging the long-standing dominance of gold ETFs. With record-breaking growth in AUM, increasing institutional adoption, and a younger demographic driving demand, Bitcoin ETFs are on track to redefine the investment landscape. As Nate Geraci predicts, Bitcoin ETFs could surpass gold ETFs by threefold in the long run, marking a paradigm shift in how investors approach asset allocation. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the market, Bitcoin ETFs offer a compelling opportunity to participate in the digital asset revolution.

Hayes predicts dollar devaluation via gold revaluation impacting global markets. Crypto market may dip short-term, but long-term growth remains optimistic for Bitcoin. As Donald Trump prepares to return to office in January 2025, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes shared his views on how this political shift may influence the cryptocurrency market. Hayes predicts that Trump’s economic policies could trigger significant price movements for digital assets, including a potential early-year dip. According to Hayes, Trump has a limited window to enact policy changes before the 2026 midterm elections dominate legislative focus. This period will likely shape how global markets, including crypto, respond to Trump’s financial strategies. This limited window will influence how Trump can address financial issues such as the nation’s growing debt and economic policies. Hayes warns that markets may acknowledge this barrier, leading to a correction, especially in sectors like crypto, which tend to react sharply to macroeconomic shifts.

The S&P 500 has now set a record for failure, dropping for 12 straight days—the longest losing streak in its entire history. The Dow Jones isn’t doing much better, limping into a nine-day losing streak after shedding another 0.61% on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite followed suit, slipping 0.32%. This chaos isn’t confined to Wall Street. Over in Europe, the Stoxx 600 index dropped 0.42%, dragged down by a 1.4% nosedive in banking stocks. Somehow, tech stocks managed to claw out a 0.61% gain, defying gravity in a market that seems allergic to good news. Wall Street bleeds as the Fed looms large All eyes are on the Federal Reserve as its two-day meeting comes to an end. Traders expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points, but it’s not a done deal. Inflation refuses to back off, and the labor market is still holding strong. A CNBC survey of 27 experts shows just how split opinions are—63% think a rate cut is the right move, while the rest aren’t so sure. Stocks tied to the tech world are taking hits that would make a heavyweight boxer jealous. Nvidia fell another 1.2% on Tuesday, solidifying its position in correction territory, with its stock down more than 10% from recent highs. Broadcom was right there with it, dropping 3.9% as its recent rally lost steam. Meanwhile, the Dow is drowning, and UnitedHealth is holding the anchor. Over the last eight sessions, this one stock has accounted for more than half of the Dow’s total losses. That’s because the company’s CEO, Brian Thompson, was allegedly shot to death, sending the company into a tailspin. Outside of the Dow, the broader market is still showing some signs of life. The S&P and Nasdaq are hovering near record closes, even though they also ended Tuesday in the red. Bitcoin smashes through $108k While Wall Street scrambles, Bitcoin is stealing the show. The largest crypto hit $108,315 on Tuesday before settling back to $106,400 so the bulls can cool down a bit. President Donald Trump has emerged as crypto’s newest hype man, backing Bitcoin-friendly policies and even floating the idea of a strategic national Bitcoin reserve. If that wasn’t enough, MicroStrategy —famous for pouring billions into Bitcoin—is about to join the Nasdaq 100 Index. Investors are piling in, betting that Bitcoin’s star is only beginning to rise. Since Trump’s election victory on November 5, Bitcoin has surged more than 55%. Its ETFs are seeing huge inflows as both institutional and retail investors jump in, shrugging off the usual concerns about volatility and the lack of traditional valuation metrics. On the Deribit options exchange , traders are stacking bullish bets at the $120,000 strike price. Open interest there—the number of outstanding contracts—shows strong confidence that Bitcoin’s momentum isn’t slowing down anytime soon. K33 Research analysts predict that after the Fed wraps up its meeting, quieter macroeconomic conditions could create a perfect storm for Bitcoin to keep climbing through the holiday season. Back in the traditional market, some are hoping for a Santa Rally—the usual uptick in stock prices during the last week of December. But with the Fed meeting’s outcome still uncertain, it’s unclear whether Santa’s bringing gifts or coal this year. For now, Bitcoin seems to be running the show.

This operation funneled millions of dollars to finance the country’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. Crypto Laundering Scheme The two individuals, Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, used Green Alpine Trading, LLC, a company based in the UAE, as a front for their activities. They worked with Sim Hyon Sop, a board member of North Korea’s Korea Kwangson Banking Corp (KKBC), based in China. Sim managed complex money laundering tactics, using funds from North Korean IT workers and cybercriminals to support the regime. Between February 2022 and September 2023, Lu Huaying cashed out cryptocurrency received from illegal operations. Zhang Jian helped expand the operation and acted as a messenger, transferring funds for Sim. These funds were used to purchase military-related resources for North Korea. North Korea’s Growing Use of Crypto This operation shows that North Korea is increasingly using cryptocurrency to bypass international sanctions and finance activities that destabilize the region. Despite global warnings, the North Korean regime has found ways to exploit digital financial systems, posing a serious threat to global security. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hack Alert: $5.63M Lost as LastPass Breach Hits 40 Wallets , Sanctions and Global Cooperation The sanctions freeze all U.S. assets belonging to the individuals and companies involved, and prohibit U.S. businesses from engaging in any transactions with them.

37790829,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=111280,1734509716,Altcoin Season Index Drops to 59: What It Means for the Crypto Market,"The Current State of the Altcoin Season Index On December 18, 2024, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 59 , down three points from the previous day. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index measures the market’s shift between Bitcoin and altcoins based on their relative performance over 90 days. With a score above 50, the market remains in Altcoin Season , a period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin in price gains. This shift indicates a growing preference among investors for altcoins, which can offer higher volatility and potentially greater returns. But what does this drop in the index mean for traders and the broader crypto market? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index 1. How the Index Works The Altcoin Season Index evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies , excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, compared to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The scoring system is simple: Above 75: Strong Altcoin Season, with most coins outperforming Bitcoin. Below 25: Bitcoin Season, with Bitcoin dominating altcoin performance. The index serves as a barometer for market sentiment, guiding traders on whether to focus on Bitcoin or diversify into altcoins. 2. Altcoin vs. Bitcoin Performance For the market to be in Altcoin Season, 75% or more of altcoins need to outperform Bitcoin. At 59, the index indicates a balanced but altcoin-leaning market, reflecting a competitive environment where altcoins are holding their ground. What a Drop to 59 Signals The three-point drop in the index suggests subtle shifts in market dynamics. While the score remains in Altcoin Season territory, the reduced margin hints at Bitcoin regaining some relative strength. Here’s what this means: 1. Increased Bitcoin Activity The drop may signify rising interest in Bitcoin, possibly due to macroeconomic factors or significant news, such as regulatory developments or institutional adoption. 2. Consolidation Among Altcoins Altcoin performance may be consolidating as traders take profits from recent rallies. This can lead to decreased momentum and reduced index scores. 3. Investor Sentiment A slight decline in the index could reflect shifting sentiment, with investors cautiously returning to Bitcoin or waiting for clear market trends before making significant moves. Why Altcoin Season Remains Strong Despite the minor drop, the crypto market remains firmly in Altcoin Season. Here’s why altcoins continue to shine: 1. Diversification and Innovation Altcoins often provide exposure to emerging blockchain technologies, from DeFi platforms to NFT ecosystems. This diversification attracts investors looking for the next big opportunity. 2. Higher Volatility Altcoins tend to exhibit greater price swings, which can lead to substantial short-term gains. Traders capitalizing on these movements contribute to altcoin dominance. 3. Bitcoin Saturation As Bitcoin matures, its price gains become less dramatic compared to smaller-cap altcoins. This dynamic encourages investors to explore altcoin projects with higher growth potential. Top Performing Altcoins Driving the Index While Bitcoin remains the market leader, several altcoins have outperformed it recently, contributing to the Altcoin Season Index score: Ethereum (ETH): With its strong presence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and upcoming updates, ETH continues to attract significant investment. Solana (SOL): Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Solana has seen substantial adoption. Polygon (MATIC): Benefiting from Layer 2 scaling solutions, Polygon has gained traction among developers and users alike. Pepe (PEPE): A meme coin gaining popularity due to community-driven hype and speculation. Risks and Opportunities During Altcoin Season Opportunities High Returns: Altcoins often deliver exponential returns during this phase. Emerging Projects: It’s a great time to identify and invest in innovative blockchain projects. Risks Volatility: While altcoins can generate massive gains, they are also prone to steep corrections. Market Sentiment Swings: A sudden shift toward Bitcoin or external factors like regulatory crackdowns can impact altcoin performance. What to Watch for Moving Forward 1. Bitcoin’s Influence A significant rally or increased dominance by Bitcoin could push the Altcoin Season Index lower. Watch for Bitcoin breaking key resistance levels or news of institutional inflows. 2. Regulatory Developments Government policies toward cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, could shape the market’s direction. Favorable regulations might strengthen Altcoin Season, while crackdowns could boost Bitcoin’s relative appeal. 3. Altcoin-Specific Innovations Keep an eye on advancements within the altcoin ecosystem, such as new protocol upgrades, partnerships, or use cases that could drive further outperformance. Conclusion: The Implications of a 59 Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index’s drop to 59 reflects a nuanced market where altcoins still outperform Bitcoin but with reduced dominance. This balance provides opportunities for traders who diversify their portfolios, leveraging both Bitcoin’s stability and altcoins’ growth potential. As the crypto market evolves, staying informed about trends like the Altcoin Season Index can help investors make smarter decisions.

Bitcoin dominance skyrocketed after BTC broke $108K for the first time. In order for an altcoin rally to come into effect, BTC dominance needs to drop. Mainstream altcoins like Lido DAO (LDO), EigenLayer (EIGEN), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Chainlink (LINK) dropped sharply in the last 24 hours as Bitcoin dominance surged to 56.5%. Bitcoin (BTC) itself fell 2.5% to $103,900, following a record high of $108,268 earlier this week. This altcoin price decline reflects the growing dominance of Bitcoin, which often leads to altcoin losses in the short term. Analysts predict this trend may reverse soon, potentially sparking an altseason.

37790527,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313212,1734509083,VanEck Predicts Establishment of US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Next Year Without Aid of Congress – Here’s How,"An analyst at one of the biggest asset managers in crypto thinks the US will establish some form of a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve next year. Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says in a new interview with Natalie Brunell that the reserve might not be generated from Congressional legislation, however. “I think more likely it’ll be an executive action that tries to reclassify the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin that the US government already owns, having seized in crimes or other events, and just call that a Bitcoin reserve and pledge not to sell it. Our prediction for next year is that there will either be a national Bitcoin reserve like what I’ve just described, or that one or a handful of states will pass their own, and I think the most likely candidates for that are Pennsylvania, Florida or Texas.” In July, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming said she would announce a bill to establish a BTC reserve as a means of securing the value of the US dollar amid a record-breaking national debt. The legislation would drive the US government to accumulate one million BTC, or 5% of BTC’s total supply in five years. On the campaign trail this year, President-elect Donald Trump promised that the US would stop selling its trove of seized Bitcoin on the open market and instead strategically hold the asset as an investment. Earlier this month, a member of the Texas House of Representatives proposed new legislation that would enable the Lone Star State to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve within its treasury. The decentralized betting platform Polymarket currently prices the odds that Trump will create a Bitcoin reserve in his first 100 days in office at 41%.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

In a high-profile and eye-opening case, Kim Nam-guk, a former lawmaker from South Korea’s Democratic Party, is accused of hiding his cryptocurrency assets . Prosecutors have requested a six-month prison sentence for Kim, claiming he intentionally failed to report a large sum of crypto in his asset declarations to the National Assembly, which is a legal requirement. The case is heating a crypto tax debate and how to tackle such cases in the current scenario where crypto assets are seen as a safety net by many small-scale traders and investors. How Kim Hid His Cryptocurrency ? Prosecutors say Kim tried to hide his crypto holdings from the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee, which reviews lawmakers’ financial details. To conceal his assets, he transferred a large portion of his crypto into a regular bank account, making it look like he wasn’t holding any digital coins. He also misreported his total assets, declaring much lower amounts than he actually owned. By converting some of his crypto into bank deposits, he falsely included them in his asset reports while keeping the actual value of his cryptocurrency hidden. Catching the Discrepancies Kim’s asset declarations in 2021 and 2022 were much lower than what he truly owned. In 2021, he reported assets worth about 1.2 billion won, but prosecutors believe he actually had 9.9 billion won in cryptocurrency at the time. Kim Speaks Out Despite the serious tax charges against him, Kim publicly criticized his party’s push for virtual asset taxation last month. He called the move an ineffective attempt to gain public support. The Democratic Party is currently working on changes to the tax law that would raise the tax deduction limit for virtual assets to 50 million won, a promise made during the last election. As South Korea faces growing concerns over digital asset management, it’s clear that the country needs stronger rules to prevent tax evasion and better control over the expanding crypto market.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-south-korea-punish-crypto-tax-evaders-kim-nam-guks-trial-sets-a-precedent/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

PDX Beam is set to become the first ever end-to-end payment transaction process and crypto-to-cash payments platform for merchants and consumers. PDX Global, the developer company, recently finished a round of testing for the app and claimed it is ready for a live public beta test on Dec. 19. According to the press release received by crypto.news, PDX Beam offers users instant crypto-to-cash settlements directly on the blockchain-based platform, without having to go through traditional intermediaries such as credit cards and banks. Once the app is publicly accessible, users will be able to avoid banking charges and payment delays by using PDX Beam to convert crypto into cash within seconds. Users simply have to sign up to PDX Beam and link their secure wallet. To make crypto payments in-store or online, the app will convert the user’s crypto funds into local currency after paying the mandatory gas fees for network use on the relevant blockchain . The free app claims the user does not need to have a “special exchange account” to make the purchase. On the other hand, merchants will be able to accept crypto funds from consumers without needing to own a crypto account or even touching the crypto side of the transaction. This is because PDX Beam is integrated with point-of-sale systems and business software. The app is also gearing up to facilitate physical and online purchases for marketplace platforms like Clover and Shopify. By bridging the gap between crypto and traditional currencies, the platform further expands on the potential of crypto as a form of payment for every day use.

The team expects the platform to be able to complete transactions in 15 seconds or less by the time the software is launched. CEO of PDX Global, Shane Rodgers, stated that most merchants still believe that they must allocate a significant amount of funds into crypto payment systems in order to start accepting crypto from customers. With PDX Beam, merchants can simply integrate the app into their systems using any POS Terminal equipped with an API or custom code for QR scanning without additional costs to accept crypto payments. “Transactions can be settled either in same day ACH [Automated Clearing House] or real-time instant settlement at the merchant’s option, reducing fees to a fraction of the transaction cost of a debit or credit card,” said Rodgers. According to a recent survey by Deloitte, around 85% of merchants in the U.S. expect crypto will be used for daily payments in the few years ahead. By 2022, approximately 2,352 US businesses have already accepted Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a payment option.

37790117,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52457,1734507771,Ripple CTO Explains How RLUSD and XRP Complement Each Other,"Ripple’s launch of its stablecoin , RLUSD, marks a pivotal advancement for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) ecosystem. The stablecoin aims to drive innovation, expand use cases, and increase engagement within the XRPL ecosystem. The XRPL, renowned for its speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency, was built to support assets, including cryptocurrencies and fiat-backed tokens. According to Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, the introduction of RLUSD brings significant advantages to the decentralized exchange (DEX) on the XRPL. In a recent video shared to X by Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie), Schwartz highlighted how credible assets like RLUSD could enhance trading volumes, benefiting developers, users, and applications. The Role of XRP and RLUSD in the Ecosystem A standout feature of the XRPL DEX is its auto-bridging mechanism. This feature automatically identifies XRP as an intermediary to facilitate trades between different assets, ensuring transaction efficiency. Schwartz noted that the integration of RLUSD will further optimize this process, as it fosters more trading activity on the platform. RLUSD also has the distinction of having NYDFS approval , which places it above its peers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Schwartz, XRP and RLUSD complement each other due to their differing characteristics. While XRP is optimized for use as a bridge currency, RLUSD’s stability enables applications in sectors such as real-world asset tokenization, foreign exchange markets, and trade financing. One of the primary benefits of RLUSD lies in its potential to unlock new opportunities for developers and builders in the blockchain space. The demand for stablecoins has been increasing, driven by their utility in facilitating global transactions and reducing volatility. Ripple’s stablecoin aims to capitalize on this trend by encouraging innovative on-chain applications. For Ripple’s proprietary payment solutions, Schwartz revealed that XRP will continue to serve its purpose as a bridge currency. However, RLUSD’s introduction allows Ripple to expand its ecosystem into new areas. Schwartz emphasized that this move positions Ripple to address the growing demand for stablecoin-based applications, particularly in markets that require price stability. The XRPL recently experienced a boom because of meme coins , and the attention from RLUSD could take the ecosystem to new heights. Schwartz closed the video stating, “We’re entering a growing market expected to see significant expansion, especially with stablecoins. Builders will certainly take advantage of the new opportunities presented by this ecosystem.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

It is expected that the US Fed will make some important announcements after the meeting. There is a high chance of the announcement of a 25 basis points interest rate cut. Let’s examine the scenario. US Fed Expected to Cut Rates Again According to Kalshi, there is at least a 96% probability that the Federal Reserve will announce a 25 basis points rate cut today. There is currently a 96% chance the Fed will cut 25bps tomorrow This would be the Fed's third rate cut of 2024 for a total of 100bps pic.twitter.com/AReQQXK8bQ — Kalshi (@Kalshi) December 17, 2024 This year, the US Fed has already executed at least two rate cuts. Once the new rate cut is implemented, the total rate cuts of 2024 will reach as high as 100 basis points. US Inflation Metrics Back on the Rise Inflation pressure has risen sharply in the last couple of months. This adds complexity to the Federal Reserve’s attempt to stabilise the economy. At the start of this year, the US CPI Index was as low as 308.417 Points. In April, it rose to 313.55 points. In October, it touched the yearly peak of 315.66 Points. However, in November, it slightly dropped to 315.49 Points. In January, 2024, the US Producer Prices index was at 142.683 Points. In June, it reached 144.834 Points. Since June, it has grown consistently. In November, it touched a yearly peak of 146.493 Points. At the beginning of the year, the US Personal Consumption Expenditure Price index was around 122.115 Points. In April, it touched a peak of 123.234 Points. Since June, it has surged steadily. In September, it was at 123.931 Points. In October, it climbed to a monthly peak of 124.266 Points. US Labour Market Challenges It was the deteriorating situation in the US job market that primarily prompted the policymakers to consider the rate cut option. Though initially the job market witnessed certain improvements, recently it began weakening. The US Initial Jobless Claims index was 224K on November 30. In the first week of December, it rebounded to 242K – the level it was at least 8 weeks earlier. On November 23, the US Continuing Jobless Claims index was at 1.87K Thousand. On November 30, it surged to 1.89K Thousand. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will South Korea Punish Crypto Tax Evaders?

However, for ETH to reach this milestone, it must surpass the critical resistance level of $4,000. Ethereum Spot ETFs Attracting Consistent Inflows According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum spot ETF inflows have remained consistently positive since November 22. The cumulative net inflows total $2.32 billion, with a significant $1.5 billion added between November 22 and December 16 alone. Related Reading: Ethereum Finally Set For A New All-Time High? Here’s What Analysts Say Breaking it down by weekly inflows, the week ending December 13 saw net inflows of $854.85 million, closely followed by $836.69 million during the week ending December 6. Moreover, the total net assets held by Ethereum ETFs have climbed to $14.28 billion, which represents approximately 2.93% of ETH’s total circulating supply. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) ranks as the largest holder with $5.87 billion in net assets, followed by Blackrock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) with $4.02 billion. These strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs have bolstered bullish sentiment, with Ethereum bulls anticipating a possible rally to a new ATH for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Crypto analyst Momin Saqib took X to share his thoughts on ETH price action. The analyst noted that ETH looks poised to break through the local highs of the $4,000 range and is eyeing the $4,500 price level. He added: Ethereum inflows have been coming in non-stop for the last few weeks! After seeing $BTC at $107K…. I think institutions don’t have much options left to bet on higher upside of crypto industry! Higher! Looking at Ethereum’s weekly chart, the digital asset has made four significant attempts to break through the $4,000 resistance level. While it briefly surpassed this level during its second attempt, creating its current ATH of $4,878, it ultimately proved to be a false breakout, followed by a prolonged bear market over the next two years. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that ETH’s post-breakout retest of the $3,100 price level was successful, propelling the cryptocurrency back into the $4,000 zone. They highlighted that ETH has held above the $4,000 zone as support for the second consecutive week, a key development that could pave the way for further upward momentum. Despite The Potential Upside, ETH Traders Remain Cautious While strengthening fundamentals, bullish technical indicators, and persistent ETF inflows paint a positive picture for Ethereum, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic about ETH’s short-term price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Crosses $3,800: Is The ‘God Candle’ Nearing? Analysts Weigh In For instance, analyst CryptoBullet emphasized that ETH may see a quick wick to $3,700 before rebounding. The analyst added that ETH’s ability to hold above key resistance levels indicates its strong bullish momentum. Another factor potentially dampening short-term optimism is Justin Sun, founder of Tron (TRX), who recently unstaked $208 million worth of ETH from Lido Finance. This move has raised concerns about potential selling pressure. ETH trades at $3,947 at press time, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

Here Are the Details,"The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on two individuals and an organization accused of laundering cryptocurrency for North Korea, as part of the country’s efforts to counter illicit financial activities. US Sanctions North Korea's Crypto Laundering Network The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified Lu Huaying and Zhang Jian, both Chinese citizens, as key figures in the money laundering network. These individuals are alleged to have facilitated money laundering on behalf of Sim Hyon Sop, the sanctioned banking representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The duo reportedly operated through a front company in the United Arab Emirates called Green Alpine Trading, which has also been designated a sanctioned entity. The company is accused of serving as a central hub in the network. The U.S. Treasury has highlighted North Korea’s role in using its agents and proxies to conduct illicit financial activities, including cryptocurrency theft, fraudulent IT work, and money laundering. According to the Treasury, these funds support North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. North Korean hacker groups, including the infamous Lazarus Group, have been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency heists in history, including the $600 million hack of the Ronin Ethereum sidechain in 2022. North Korean Hackers' Deceptive Tactics North Korean hackers reportedly use tactics such as impersonating recruiters or executives of legitimate cryptocurrency firms to trick their targets. For example, blockchain security firm SlowMist revealed that a Lazarus Group hacker once pretended to be an executive from Chinese blockchain firm Fenbushi Capital and convinced victims on LinkedIn to click on malicious links. *This is not investment advice.

37789303,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374376,1734506622,6 Signs Ripple (XRP) Is About to Make Another Colossal Splash,"So, will Ripple token prices fizzle out and consolidate with long-term support at a lower level? Or will XRP continue to skyrocket over the next 60 days? Here are 6 of the most current signals regarding XRP’s price . But real quick first: As for more focused long-term accumulation holders and altcoin investors who make cyclical adjustments with the occasional swing trade to optimize their strategy: Is XRP the right place to park it for a while? Is it too Late to Buy XRP in 2024-2025? That’s an important question for many cryptocurrency investors looking at the top coins by market cap for opportunities to achieve their financial goals over their relevant timeframes. Using Bitcoin as a point of comparison, RippleNet does not appear to have reached as much of its TAM (total addressable market) along its product adoption curve. For example, Bitcoin is already on Wall Street as a number of ETF products, and XRP is not. But, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse says his company considers an XRP ETF inevitable. Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has actively explored IPO options for some time , but outside the United States, because of the costly battle against the SEC. In addition to that gauge of XRP’s market adoption curve, the Belgium-based SWIFT cooperative is a directly relevant point of comparison. While SWIFT processes international payment volume on the order of USD $5 trillion daily, RippleNet appears to be just getting started. XRP tokens on the decentralized financial platform XRP Ledger facilitate something like USD $1.5 billion worth of similar transactions each day, according to data from XRP Scan. 1. XRP Stablecoin Gets Nod From NY Regulator Last week the New York state financial regulator, the Department of Financial Services, approved a new Ripple stablecoin—RLUSD. The issuer of XRP tokens for RippleNet launched the new product on Dec. 17. XRP token prices on crypto exchanges soared by 11% in market valuation following the regulator’s approval. They jumped from $2.38 to over $2.47 within minutes after the company’s announcement of a launch date. Once the product was released, XRP’s price went even further by tapping a multi-week peak of over $2.7. 2. Ripple Token Technicals Technical signals for Ripple were strong in mid-December. From Dec. 3 – 10, XRP retraced from a high above $2.70 and consolidated above the $1.90 level. XRP’s price then fired back up to above $2.70 on Tuesday, Dec. 17. So the tokens for RippleNet appeared to have found their long-term support level for another leg up in December. That’s impressive price performance and shows great buoyancy after what Jeff Park, chief strategist at crypto asset manager Bitwise, called , in an interview with Fortune, “one of the most violent liquidations we’ve had in the altcoin universe.” The way Park sees it, this retracement looks like a market just stopping briefly to catch its breath: “It looks severe. But the gains were even more astronomical preceding it, and this is a little bit of an exhaustion.” On Tuesday, Ripple’s simple and exponential moving averages across the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day periods indicated a Strong Buy recommendation, according to data from TradingView. One potential hazard for the XRP army is a large amount of whale-sized transfers to exchanges. That makes the potentially available supply more liquid and could signal selling intent by big players. A November surge of whale transfers doubled Binance’s XRP whale inflows since late October. The last time this metric was this high in Mar. 2024, it preceded a 3-month slide for the asset. 3. Strong Business Model, America’s ‘Secret’ Weapon? This fundamental evaluation of Ripple’s long-term future prospects as a payments business cannot be understated. Ripple maintains a SaaS product that is so good with a business and team around it that are so capable that RippleNet could be the US’s secret weapon to maintain global financial hegemony in the face of a fading dollar . That’s why popular digital asset researcher X Anderson, in a recent post, called XRP “a strategic weapon for the US.” Main reasons why Ripple along with XRP is a strategic weapon for the US: Ripple has built a next-generation B2B cross-border payments system controlled by a US company. RLUSD will be able to expand the usage of USD around the world, especially for financial institutions… — Anders (@X__Anderson) December 2, 2024 “Ripple has built a next-generation B2B cross-border payments system controlled by a US company,” Anderson wrote. “Ripple holds roughly 45% of all XRP, meaning a US-based company is the largest holder of XRP.” 4. XRP Ledger Daily TXs Trending Up For another fundamental analysis, the daily transaction volume on the XRP Ledger for decentralized finance may be cause for trader/investor bullishness into January. Total payments from one account to another increased from 0.73 million daily on Sept. 17 to 1.4 million daily on Dec. 16, nearly doubling in three months’ time. Accordingly, payment volume in XRP tokens using the XRP Ledger increased over the same period, from 762 million to 1.99 billion. Daily active accounts on XRP Ledger have also kept pace with the appreciating crypto spot exchange price for the Ripple token. Daily unique senders rose to over 105K on Dec. 2. The previous record was just a touch over 50K each of the three times this metric ever came anything close to this month’s all-time high. Daily new account activation figures are also bullish. 5. Trump Effect, Ripple SEC Lawsuit Dust Settles The outgoing Biden administration’s war on cryptocurrency via a very aggressive SEC is at an end with the incoming second one for New York City and cable television’s Donald Trump. The president-elect’s appointment of Peter Thiel’s PayPal apprentice, David Sacks, to be his crypto and AI czar is more proof the new White House will be friendly and supportive of cryptocurrencies like XRP. In a November tweet, Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty stated that Ripple’s defense against the SEC in US court “provided the blueprint to defeat Gary Gensler’s inexplicable war on crypto.” During a recent 60 Minutes interview, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said his company recently launched a new crypto-focused US super PAC named Fairshake because of the SEC’s “war on crypto.” Its influence on policymakers will come with the gravitas of its legal victories, its international business partnerships with foreign governments and financial institutions, and its vast honeypot of financial resources and clearly no shortage of cash—not even through a prolonged and expensive SEC battle happening at the same time as a severe cyclical bear market for the crypto industry. 6. Dollar and Bitcoin Macro Cycles The dollar is in an inflationary, low-interest rate cycle for the time being. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is in its historical 12 – 18-month bullish price adjustment phase following a 50% supply cut every four years. This quadrennial’s “halving” occurred on April 20, 2024. As a result, XRP’s price is caught up in a very broad, macro-cycle, multi-month financial updraft that, in many previous cycles, has dramatically increased the daily market exchange rate for altcoins like XRP. #XRP is not dumping, it’s a whole market thing. Triggered by #BTC dump. Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you’re a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise. Not Financial Advice. I am not qualified to give any advice. pic.twitter.com/33dtboWwRl — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 5, 2024 An AI startup founder and Ripple investor who goes by Vincent Van Code on X recently pointed to a $5 target level for XRP’s price by February. Just as Ripple’s price began to retrace in early December, Van Code wrote, “Fundamentals are very strong for XRP, if you’re a holder, my gut is telling me it will hit $5 by Feb 2025. All this is noise.” The post 6 Signs Ripple (XRP) Is About to Make Another Colossal Splash appeared first on CryptoPotato .",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Potato,https://cryptopotato.com/6-signs-ripple-xrp-is-about-to-make-another-colossal-splash/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/37789303.jpeg
37789175,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394452,1734506420,"This Token Looks A Lot Like Dogecoin (DOGE) Just Before It Exploded 18,400% Last Bull Cycle","The post This Token Looks A Lot Like Dogecoin (DOGE) Just Before It Exploded 18,400% Last Bull Cycle appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Rexas Finance (RXS) is shaping up to be the next big breakout in crypto, drawing comparisons to Dogecoin (DOGE) just before its massive 18,400% surge in the last bull cycle. With a strong focus on tokenizing real-world assets, a Certik-validated security audit, and upcoming listings on top-tier exchanges, RXS is positioned as a low-cost altcoin with explosive growth potential. Already in its 10th presale stage at $0.15, the project has raised over $27.4M and is building momentum as it aims to outpace Shiba Inu (SHIB) by 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has shown resilience with a 10.2% rebound following the recent market dip, bolstered by bullish momentum after the U.S. CPI report. The daily chart illustrates key technical indicators aligning for a potential extended recovery, yet resistance and support levels demand close attention. Dogecoin price forecast The primary resistance to monitor is the $0.46 level, marked by the upper Bollinger Band, which represents a critical psychological threshold. A breakout above this zone could pave the way toward the next target of $0.50, a level last tested during earlier bullish sentiment waves. Volume Delta data supports a scenario where consistent buying pressure might push DOGE into new short-term highs, but traders should watch for profit-taking near $0.50. On the downside, immediate support is found at $0.38, aligned with the lower Bollinger Band. Breaching this level could invalidate the bullish outlook, exposing DOGE to further corrections. A drop below $0.38 would open the floor to retest $0.36, where stronger support lies. Rexas Finance (RXS) could be the next Dogecoin (DOGE), poised for explosive growth like DOGE’s 18,400% surge last bull cycle. Rexas Finance (RXS) It is on the verge of a massive breakout.

Cryptoinsightuk began with a poll asking the community what the asset’s price would be by Christmas Day. Over 2,000 community members responded. 36% of the participants predicted XRP would trade between $2 and $3.30. An additional 30% expected the price to range from $3.30 to $5, while 26% anticipated a value exceeding $5. Notably, only 8% of participants believed the cryptocurrency might fall below $2, indicating strong market confidence. Currently trading at $2.59, XRP has demonstrated notable upward momentum over the past 24 hours, increasing by 5.14%.

With a fully diluted valuation of around $16.5 billion and a daily trading volume of about $657 million, this mid-cap altcoin is drawing significant attention from institutional investors. After all, what’s better than a diversified portfolio? As market momentum builds, UNI’s recent price action and whale activity suggest that something big might be brewing. Digging Into Uniswap’s November Breakout Uniswap, a DeFi-focused and utility-driven token, has surged over 160% since the beginning of November. This rally pushed UNI past its previous resistance at $16.5, reinforcing optimism in the market. The UNI/BTC pair is also showing early signs of a trend reversal, coinciding with the altseason’s anticipated parabolic phase. Whale Activity and Exchange Deposits Recent on-chain data from Santiment shows that more than 800,000 UNI tokens, worth over $13 million, have been deposited into various crypto exchanges in just two days. Today, a major whale holding $89 million in crypto transferred 1.49 million UNI, valued at $24 million, to Binance. Earlier this week, Uniswap’s team made headlines by transferring nearly 5 million dormant UNI tokens to Coinbase Prime. These tokens, untouched for over 4 years, have raised speculation about the team’s potential strategic moves. Institutions have been depositing $UNI into exchanges over the past 2 days! 1/ Whale “0x59a” with a $89.4M portfolio deposited 1.495M $UNI ($24.3M) to #Binance an hour ago, securing an estimated $13.7M profit (+129%) after 5 months. 2/ @Uniswap team-related wallet “0xa37” sent… pic.twitter.com/DOa7ynLXKn — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) December 18, 2024 Key Targets and Levels UNI is currently retesting a critical resistance level above $16, which could act as a springboard for its next bullish phase. On the weekly chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently climbed above 70% for the first time this year, signaling renewed strength in UNI’s upward trend. If a short-term correction occurs, analysts expect UNI to find strong support above $14 before continuing its bullish momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Live: Markets Consolidating as BTC, ETH & Others Plunge Hard While PENGU & BGB Prices Surge , On higher time frames, UNI appears well-positioned for a potential 100% gain in the near term, provided market conditions remain favorable.

Similarly, Web3Bay is carving a niche in decentralized e-commerce, establishing a user-driven marketplace powered by its 3BAY token. Early investment in Web3Bay’s presale could yield unique benefits and strong community ties in a project with significant growth prospects. Stacks: Leveraging Bitcoin for Enhanced Web3 Functionality Stacks is transforming Bitcoin’s utility by integrating smart contracts and decentralized apps into its robust network. The Nakamoto upgrade marks a significant advancement by separating Stacks’ transactions from Bitcoin’s, enhancing efficiency. It introduces sBTC, a Bitcoin-backed asset that facilitates smart contract interactions with Bitcoin, potentially attracting new applications and DeFi projects to tap into Bitcoin’s vast market cap. As Stacks becomes increasingly adaptable, its market value has responded positively. Currently trading around $2.40 as of December 2024, Stacks is drawing developer interest and witnessing a surge in smart contract activity, setting it up as a leading Web3 crypto that could mainstream Web3 functionalities on Bitcoin’s platform. Web3Bay: A New Era of E-Commerce on the Blockchain While Stacks enhances Bitcoin usability, Web3Bay aims to revolutionize e-commerce through decentralization.

Web3Bay’s 3BAY token facilitates transactions and offers perks like discounts on purchases and a role in governance, embodying a community-centric approach. Web3Bay also supports traditional payment methods like PayPal, marrying Web2 convenience with Web3’s innovative features, positioning it as an attractive Web3 crypto for those interested in decentralized marketplaces. The Benefits of Early Investment in Web3Bay’s Presale Participating in Web3Bay’s presale provides early investors with several advantages. The presale, spanning 28 stages with a 15% price increase per stage, rewards early engagement with lower prices and potential high returns. Early participants gain influence within the platform’s governance, directly impacting its evolution. Investing early helps stabilize Web3Bay’s foundation for a smoother launch, with plans for cross-chain compatibility to facilitate transactions across major blockchain networks. This strategic vision, combined with early investment benefits, makes Web3Bay a promising venture for potential growth. In Conclusion Both Stacks and Web3Bay are paving distinct paths in the Web3 sector, each offering unique innovations—Stacks with its Bitcoin-focused enhancements and Web3Bay with its user-centric e-commerce platform. For early backers, these projects not only offer a chance at lucrative returns but also an opportunity to be part of progressive Web3 developments.

37789701,https://invezz.com/?p=2392866,1734504992,How Bitcoin’s surge is transforming the luxury retail industry,"The rise of Bitcoin, which recently surged past $107,000, is reshaping the luxury retail landscape. High-end brands, eager to attract affluent crypto investors, are adopting cryptocurrencies as a payment option. French luxury department store Printemps has partnered with Binance and Lyzi to offer cryptocurrency payments in France, setting a precedent for European retailers. Meanwhile, Virgin Voyages has launched a $120,000 annual pass that can be purchased using Bitcoin, highlighting the luxury sector’s push toward innovation in payment methods. As brands explore new avenues to connect with tech-savvy consumers, cryptocurrency adoption is becoming a symbol of forward-thinking branding. Printemps leads Europe’s luxury crypto adoption In a landmark move, Printemps has become the first European department store to accept cryptocurrency payments, thanks to its collaboration with Binance and Lyzi. Customers can now use Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase luxury goods across its French stores. This initiative comes as other high-end brands like Gucci, Balenciaga, and S.T. Dupont explore similar options to attract crypto wealth. S.T. Dupont plans to implement cryptocurrency payments in its Paris stores before the holiday season, aiming to capture the growing market of crypto-affluent consumers. Virgin Voyages tests Bitcoin payments Luxury cruise line Virgin Voyages has stepped into the cryptocurrency realm by introducing a $120,000 annual sailing pass payable with Bitcoin. This initiative, launched earlier this month, is among the first experiential offerings in the luxury sector to embrace digital currencies. By tapping into the wealth generated by crypto investments, Virgin Voyages aims to align its brand with the tech-savvy elite. Analysts note that such moves could serve as a model for other industries looking to integrate cryptocurrency as a payment method. While luxury brands are increasingly adopting cryptocurrency payments, regulators continue to warn about the risks associated with digital assets. High volatility and limited real-world utility have historically deterred widespread adoption. Industry insiders argue that blockchain innovation and the integration of cryptocurrencies into financial markets could mitigate these challenges. In the United States, luxury conglomerate Kering has already embraced crypto payments across its brands, including Gucci, which allows transactions in ten cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin wealth fuels luxury purchases Bitcoin’s meteoric rise is attracting luxury consumers eager to diversify their portfolios. Analysts suggest that high-value items like designer handbags and luxury watches have become popular choices for crypto investors. Balenciaga has responded by launching a €350 leather card holder designed for crypto wallet hardware, highlighting the brand’s focus on merging technology with fashion. This accessory is part of a broader trend where high-end brands cater to younger, tech-driven demographics seeking innovative products. Despite growing interest, cryptocurrency payments in luxury retail remain largely symbolic. Retailers often reconvert digital assets to fiat currencies to offset risks of volatility. Luxury brands view crypto payments as a strategic move to attract younger and international clientele, particularly in Asia. Printemps plans to expand its crypto payment services to New York City, further solidifying its role as a pioneer in the sector. With Bitcoin’s value continuing to rise, more brands are likely to follow suit.

The executive order is designed to take effect immediately upon being signed by Donald Trump on his first day in office. The order lays out the potential implications of such a designation and emphasizes Bitcoin’s strategic importance in the national reserve framework. The draft suggests that recognizing BTC as a strategic asset could enhance the country’s financial stability and security. The order designates Bitcoin as a strategic asset All it needs is a signature and America’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is real. Drafted by @btcpolicyorg pic.twitter.com/kNWVDlnDEo — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) December 17, 2024 The presidential order affirmed that it’s important for the United States to adapt its financial strategies to maintain stability and leadership in the global economy. The order also acknowledged BTC as a decentralized and finite store-of-value asset, akin to digital gold. The institute believes that BTC’s unique attributes can bolster the resilience of the U.S. dollar and support American economic interests. The order maintained that BTC is a suitable asset for strategic acquisition within the Treasury Department’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). It also confirmed that Bitcoin establishes itself as a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and could be a permanent national asset for the benefit of all Americans. The executive order suggested that it’s important to establish a Strategic BTC Reserve in order to grow the U.S. economy and to cement American financial dominance in the future. It also suggested that it’s important to expand the diversity of assets being held within the ESF to safeguard national economic activity and competitive advantage in the 21st Century. The presidential directive also highlighted the goal of the U.S. is to become the global leader of the digital assets industry. The order maintained that the U.S. can attain this by attracting capital, talent, and sound businesses to set up and expand in the U.S. The order seeks to diversify U.S reserve assets “This is meant to be a good thing for the United States and is not a giveaway to the Bitcoin or crypto industry. ” ~ Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at Bitcoin Policy Institute. The executive order revealed it has established the Strategic BTC Reserve (SBR) with the goal of enhancing the diversity of U.S. reserve assets. It also argued that the SBR will be subject to regular audits, stringent security standards, and comprehensive reporting measures to ensure accountability and security over the long term. The order also wants to consolidate government bitcoin holdings within 7 days of the date of the order. It suggested that any Bitcoin under the control of any Federal agency, including the United State Marshal Service, shall not be sold, swapped, auctioned, or encumbered. The order recommended that upon the acquisition of a legal title, BTC should be transferred by the head of such Federal agency to the SBR. The executive order also proposed that Bitcoin be designated as a strategic reserve asset suitable for purchase and holding within the ESF. It also directed the Secretary of the Treasury to implement an acquisition program for Bitcoin to acquire and manage BTC within the ESF within 60 days of the date of the order. Zack Shapiro, Head of Policy at Bitcoin Policy Institute, denied claims by Stephanie Ruhle, host at MSNBC, that the order might be the biggest bailout to crypto ever. Shapiro highlighted that the people responsible for the bill, including Cynthia Lummis, are not planning to sell their bitcoin to the government as part of the bill.

37789700,https://invezz.com/?p=2392750,1734504621,SEC Commissioner Crenshaw’s departure sparks optimism for crypto reforms,"The crypto industry has scored a significant victory with SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s departure. According to Eleanor Terett in Fox Business, the Senate Banking Committee canceled the vote on her renomination, effectively ending her tenure. Eleanor Terrett @EleanorTerrett · Follow 🚨BREAKING: A Senate aide has just informed me that tomorrow’s Senate Banking Committee scheduled markup vote on @SECGov Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has been canceled. She will not be renominated to her position. 3:28 am · 18 Dec 2024 2.3K Reply Copy link Read 207 replies Known for her staunch anti-crypto stance, Crenshaw opposed the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF and other pivotal policies. Her departure is expected to pave the way for a more pro-crypto regulatory environment under new leadership. Crenshaw, who joined the SEC in 2020, was initially appointed under the Trump administration and later renominated by President Biden. During her tenure, she was a close ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and was often considered even more aggressive in her approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Her exit marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape, potentially altering the SEC’s focus on enforcement actions within the crypto sector. Industry pressures shaped the outcome The crypto community played a vital role in this outcome. Advocacy groups and individuals flooded the Senate with over 107,000 emails opposing Crenshaw’s renomination, a show of force highlighting the industry’s growing influence. This unprecedented mobilization demonstrates the sector’s readiness to fight against restrictive policies and push for fairer regulations. This sentiment is echoed by pro-crypto lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has predicted a transformative year for Bitcoin and digital assets in 2025. With Crenshaw no longer at the helm, there is anticipation of changes in the SEC’s approach, particularly around Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets. Crenshaw’s departure raises questions about the SEC’s ongoing legal battles, notably with Ripple Labs. Her strict enforcement stance against Ripple and other crypto projects was seen as a hallmark of her tenure. Without her influence, there is growing optimism that the SEC may reconsider its legal strategy, especially as pressure mounts for clearer regulatory guidelines. Interestingly, the crypto markets showed little immediate reaction to the news. Legal experts suggest this is due to the nuanced nature of the development, which may take time to resonate with broader market participants. However, the long-term implications could be profound, particularly for projects like Ripple that have faced significant challenges under the current regulatory framework. SEC’s future direction hinges on who replaces Crenshaw Speculation suggests that a Trump-appointed successor could adopt a more balanced approach toward crypto. This aligns with broader industry hopes for regulatory clarity and support for innovation. Meanwhile, the crypto industry is closely watching developments around the Bitcoin spot ETF. Crenshaw’s opposition was a key factor in delaying its approval, but her absence could accelerate the decision-making process. As the SEC’s leadership undergoes a shake-up, the potential for a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment is on the rise. The departure of a staunch opponent like Crenshaw opens the door for dialogue and progress, aligning with the crypto industry’s aspirations for growth and legitimacy.

It’s building the first meme coin staking platform, which will allow users to generate passive rewards on all the top meme coin assets. The presale will end in three days, and then $STARS will list on exchanges. As the end date nears, traders are making more significant investments in the presale. Currently, the total raise sits at $19.4 million. Favorable market conditions spurred by Bitcoin crossing $100K, alongside investors witnessing the success of Pepe Unchained after its ICO, are helping drive Crypto All-Stars’ presale momentum. $STARS Creates A New Meme Coin Economy The meme coin market is worth $117 billion today, and all the top projects have experienced significant price increases in recent months. However, compared to other asset classes, such as DeFi and AI, investors can do very little with their meme coins beyond buy and sell. Crypto All-Stars is changing this by creating a staking platform that allows users to generate passive income from their tokens. Holders across the meme coin industry will be highly interested in this. The Crypto All-Stars staking platform supports 11 of the top meme coins. These are: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, Bonk, Brett, Mog Coin, Floki, Milady, Turbo, Toshi, and Coq Inu. With the launch approaching so soon the All-Stars are getting their dance on! Does anyone else want a $STARS chandelier? pic.twitter.com/1JMT3tVLt6 — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) December 10, 2024 The team also noted that they’ll add more meme coins later. To access the platform, users must hold $STARS, and the amount they hold determines how much they can earn. This creates a flywheel effect: All users must buy $STARS, and they’re incentivized to hold as much as possible. Therefore, it’s likely that we’ll see users hoard staking rewards rather than sell them. As the team adds new projects to the staking platform, this could significantly impact the Crypto All-Stars price. There won’t be enough supply for new users to buy, causing the price to rocket. Indeed, this means that those who buy during the presale could be at a significant advantage, as they are among the only investors to buy before the staking platform and accompanying utility-driven demand begins. Traders seek Pepe Unchained Alternative After 500% gain – is it $STARS? Utility-focused meme coin Pepe Unchained soared 500% within three days after its presale ended last week, underlining the explosive potential of popular presale tokens once they hit the open market. Pepe Unchained’s success has driven significant demand for Crypto All-Stars, with investors hoping for a rerun of its gains once $STARS lists on exchanges. As to how far it could go, analyst ClayBro is looking beyond the 500% gain that Pepe Unchained provided and suggests it could 10x in price. ClayBro underscores that the market appeal for meme coins is picking up, and Crypto All-Stars is well-positioned as an innovative application inside the sector. Other analysts are looking even further ahead. For instance, Crypto June says it can 100x. Something to note is that Pepe Unchained launched with a much higher market cap than Crypto All-Stars. This leaves more room for growth for $STARS, which is partly why analysts believe gains between 10x and 100x are possible. Secure Crypto All-stars For $0.0016782 Before It’s Too Late The Crypto All-Stars presale is available to buy at a fixed price of $0.0016782. But with three days until it ends, now is the time to act for those who haven’t done so already. Investors can buy $STARS via the project’s website or using the Best Wallet app. Crypto All-Stars has been audited by Coinsult and Solid Proof , with both firms finding the project to be safe and secure.

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trump-patriot-trumppat-solana-memecoin-will-explode-19000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37787797,https://coinpaper.com/6593/crypto-com-drops-sec-lawsuit-after-meeting-with-trump,1734503435,Crypto.com Drops SEC Lawsuit After Meeting with Trump,"The meeting with Trump coincided with Crypto.com’s decision to drop its lawsuit against the SEC in an attempt to align with the incoming administration. Meanwhile, Ohio also proposed a Bitcoin reserve bill after similar initiatives in Texas and Pennsylvania. President Biden backed a congressional stock trading ban after scrutiny over lawmakers’ crypto holdings, while SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw’s renomination faces uncertainty due to crypto-related controversies and political shifts. Crypto.com CEO Meets Donald Trump United States President-elect Donald Trump recently met with Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek at his residence in Mar-a-Lago to discuss policies that could impact the cryptocurrency industry. According to a Dec. 16 social media post , Marszalek traveled to Florida for the meeting, during which they reportedly explored Trump’s proposal to establish a national Bitcoin reserve and discussed potential appointments to his administration that could shape the future of the crypto sector. The meeting coincided with Crypto.com’s decision to drop its lawsuit against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On the same day, the exchange voluntarily dismissed its case against the SEC and its commissioners with prejudice, according to a filing that was submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Marszalek previously announced in October that the exchange planned to file the lawsuit to counter a Wells notice received from the SEC. However, a Crypto.com spokesperson revealed that the case was withdrawn to align with the firm’s intent to collaborate with the incoming administration on regulatory frameworks for the industry. Since his election victory on Nov. 5, Trump very clearly indicated support for the crypto industry through his proposed appointments. The president-elect named several people with pro-crypto perspectives to key roles, including former PayPal COO David Sacks as the “AI and crypto czar” and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins as his pick for SEC chair. In addition to Marszalek, Trump also met with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in November to discuss potential personnel appointments. These meetings happened after Trump launched his own digital asset initiative, World Liberty Financial, during his campaign. Ohio Proposes Bitcoin Reserve Fund Donald Trump is not the only person eyeing a Bitcoin stockpile. An Ohio lawmaker recently introduced legislation to establish a Bitcoin fund in the state treasury, making it the third U.S. state to pursue a Bitcoin reserve in just over a month. Ohio House Republicans leader Derek Merrin proposed HB 703, the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, on Dec. 17. The bill will grant the state treasurer the authority to buy Bitcoin as part of a broader asset allocation strategy, though it does not mandate these purchases. Merrin described the initiative as a response to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar, and believes there is a need for Ohio to embrace emerging technology and safeguard tax dollars from losing value. He added that the legislation sets the stage for Ohio to take advantage of Bitcoin to strengthen its finances. He even compared the cryptocurrency to ”digital property rights” and called it revolutionary for global economies. The current legislative session is set to adjourn on Dec. 31, which means that the bill is unlikely to advance before then. Merrin stated that he expects the proposal to serve as a foundation for Ohio’s next legislative session, which begins Jan. 6 of 2025, when it will need to be reintroduced. Merrin is a vocal supporter of crypto, and holds a top-tier “A” rating from Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto lobbying arm. He also consistently advocated for policies protecting individuals' rights to own and transact with digital assets. Ohio’s efforts are similar to initiatives in Texas and Pennsylvania after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory in November. His win brought renewed attention to Bitcoin's potential role as a state or federal reserve asset. Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act on Dec. 12, proposing a five-year holding period for Bitcoin as a state reserve. In Pennsylvania, Representative Mike Cabell proposed legislation in November to permit the state treasury to allocate up to 10% of its holdings to Bitcoin. Biden Backs Congressional Stock Trading Ban President Joe Biden recently expressed his support for banning members of Congress from trading stocks while in office by stating that “nobody in the Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they’re in the Congress.” In an interview to be released by the labor advocacy group More Perfect Union, Biden shared his thoughts amid calls to prevent potential conflicts of interest among lawmakers. Although President Biden previously avoided commenting on legislation restricting stock trading for government officials, past proposals gained some renewed traction in Congress. In July, lawmakers from both the House and Senate supported measures to prevent the president, vice president, and members of Congress from trading or selling various financial assets, including stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. This extends to assets disclosed under the STOCK Act, which was introduced in 2012 to enhance transparency. Biden mentioned his own practice of relying solely on his Senate salary during his decades-long tenure representing Delaware from 1973 to 2009. While the president largely stayed silent on cryptocurrencies, he did sign an executive order in 2022 to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. Concerns over potential conflicts of interest have intensified following the election of President-elect Donald Trump, who holds large amounts of crypto, including tens of millions of dollars in personal wallets and through his decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial. As a result of this, critics questioned whether Trump’s financial interests and those of his supporters in the crypto industry could influence his policy decisions. Several members of Congress, including Georgia Representative Mike Collins , Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, have disclosed their own cryptocurrency holdings, which only added to the scrutiny. Lummis is a strong Bitcoin advocate, and also proposed creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, a move experts say could drive up the cryptocurrency’s price. It is still unclear whether President Biden would support extending a stock trading ban to include Supreme Court justices. While the justices are allowed to trade stocks, they risk potential conflicts of interest if they do not withdraw themselves from cases involving their financial holdings. Crenshaw’s SEC Nomination in Doubt Meanwhile, United States lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee canceled a planned session to consider the renomination of Caroline Crenshaw for a second term as a commissioner at the SEC. According to a Dec. 17 announcement, the committee will no longer meet on Dec. 18 to vote on Crenshaw’s nomination or that of Gordon Ito to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. This reduces the likelihood of Crenshaw’s confirmation before Republicans gain majority control of the Senate in January. Cancelation of session to consider nominations (Source: US Senate Banking Committee ) Crenshaw has served as an SEC commissioner under both incoming President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden, and her term ended in June this year. She is allowed to continue in her role for up to 18 months beyond her term’s expiration. So far, her nomination faced some pushback from crypto interest groups, which labeled her “more anti-crypto” than SEC Chair Gary Gensler. On the other hand, more than 40 organizations urged senators to support her, arguing that a Trump-led administration is unlikely to appoint any Democratic SEC commissioners. The SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency regulation and its political composition have been key issues for Trump, who campaigned on promises to overhaul the agency. Trump even vowed to fire Gensler immediately after taking office and suggested that his administration will adopt a more crypto-friendly stance. Crenshaw’s nomination, if reconsidered by the Republican-led Senate, is still uncertain. If confirmed, she could serve at the SEC until 2029.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6593/crypto-com-drops-sec-lawsuit-after-meeting-with-trump,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

However, the excitement around the token turned into chaos as the price plunged over 57% from the highs of around $0.068, mainly driven by a sell-off of 20% of its supply.

The bill doesn’t require Bitcoin investments but gives the treasurer flexibility to diversify the state’s asset portfolio. Merrin sees this as a crucial step to protect taxpayer funds from losing value due to the declining strength of the U.S. dollar. He describes Bitcoin as “digital property rights for everyone” and envisions it as a modern solution to economic challenges while strengthening Ohio’s financial position. Can Bitcoin Save Us From Inflation? Merrin argues that adopting Bitcoin could help Ohio guard against inflation and economic instability. The proposed plan aims to preserve taxpayer money and offers a new approach to managing the state’s finances. By including Bitcoin in its reserves, the state could potentially benefit from lower interest rates and greater financial security. Though the bill was introduced just weeks before the current legislative session ends on December 31, Merrin plans to reintroduce it in January 2025 during the next session. He hopes this proposal will provide Ohio lawmakers with a clear strategy for integrating Bitcoin into the state’s financial planning. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Hits $106K as Trump’s Reserve Plan Sparks Crypto Frenzy , Joining a Growing Trend Among States Ohio isn’t the only state looking into Bitcoin for its savings.

This seems to be a classic case of traders de-risking in anticipation of an expected hawkish Fed rate cut later Wednesday.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded around $103,750, marking a 2% drop for the day, according to TradingView and CoinDesk data. Prices had surged to a record high of over $108,000 on Tuesday but failed to maintain those gains, ending the UTC day flat. That formed a 'doji,' a candlestick pattern that signifies indecision and potential bullish exhaustion when seen at record highs.  As expected, bitcoin's decline has resulted in even larger losses for alternative cryptocurrencies, but some majors, such as XRP, SOL, and ETH, are experiencing losses comparable to BTC.  The Fed will announce the rate decision, the interest rate dot plot, projections, and economic forecasts at 14:00 ET. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference will be held a half hour later.  The consensus is that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points to the 4.25% to 4.5% range, marking a total easing of 100 basis points since September. But, the dot plot is expected to show fewer rate cuts for next year.  ""The risk of slightly stronger near-term growth with the threat of higher inflation – tariffs putting up prices of goods and immigration controls potentially lifting wages and costs in the likes of agriculture, construction and hospitality sectors – means that we expect them to signal only three rate cuts in 2025. Previously, they had suggested four,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients.  ""We look for 25bp of cuts per quarter in 2025 with a terminal rate of around 3.75% in the third quarter,"" analysts added, noting the possibility of the Fed revising their projections for economic growth and inflation.  These so-called hawkish expectations are likely fueling the de-risking in the crypto market that is looking for reasons to correct, having seen prices for BTC soar from $70,000 to over $100,000 in less than two months.  It's important to note that fewer rate cuts do not necessarily mean tightening; easing is still on the table. This suggests that the path of least resistance for risk assets remains tilted toward the upside.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SOL,BTC | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/18/bitcoin-takes-a-breather-after-doji-candle-in-a-cautious-pre-fed-de-risking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/625dcd4e50bd279bffd1fc013d5f5fe4f5c8f01f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The coordinated raid on December 10, 2024, targeted the Big Leaf Building in Victoria Island, Lagos, which had been used as a hub for training Nigerian accomplices in fraudulent activities. Among those detained were 148 Chinese nationals, 40 Filipinos, and individuals from other countries. The operation highlights the global reach of these schemes, which preyed on victims in North America, Europe, and beyond. Over 500 SIM cards recovered During the raid, investigators discovered extensive evidence of the suspects’ activities, including over 500 SIM cards, high-end computers, and mobile phones used to deceive victims. The seven-story facility housed sophisticated operations aimed at orchestrating scams on platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Telegram. The EFCC also seized vehicles used in the operation, emphasizing the scale and organization of the fraudulent activities. According to EFCC Chairman Ola Olukoyede, speaking through Director of Public Affairs Wilson Uwujaren, the building served as a training ground where foreign nationals instructed Nigerian recruits on how to execute scams, including the creation of fake profiles and the manipulation of victims into investing in a bogus platform, www.yooto.com. Fake profiles and fraudulent investments The fraud relied heavily on the use of fake identities to gain victims’ trust . Recruits underwent a two-week induction program, during which they were trained to impersonate foreign individuals convincingly. Initial activation fees on the fraudulent platform started at $35, with victims lured into investing larger sums over time. Once the victims were engaged, the Nigerian accomplices were sidelined, and foreign operators took over the scam, severing the connections to conceal transactions. This layered strategy made it challenging for victims to trace the source of their losses, underscoring the operation’s calculated approach. Payments bypass corporate systems To maintain secrecy, payments to Nigerian recruits were made either in cash or via personal bank accounts, bypassing corporate systems entirely. This approach ensured that the operations remained under the radar, further complicating efforts to track and dismantle the network. The EFCC has confirmed that investigations are ongoing, with plans to charge the suspects once the process is complete. The raid is one of the largest coordinated actions taken against crypto-related fraud in Nigeria, a country often cited as a hotspot for such activities. The arrest of hundreds of individuals from various nationalities highlights the transnational nature of these schemes, as well as the need for greater international collaboration to combat cybercrime.

37787380,https://coinpedia.org/?p=394418,1734502644,Solaxy’s Layer 2 Solution Could End Solana’s Network Congestion for Good,"The post Solaxy’s Layer 2 Solution Could End Solana’s Network Congestion for Good appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Network congestion has plagued Solana since its early days, with transaction failures and slowdowns becoming a familiar headache for users. Now, a new Layer 2 solution called Solaxy promises to fix these issues through an innovative approach to transaction processing. When the Solana network gets busy, transactions stack up like cars in rush hour traffic. Solaxy’s rollup technology creates new paths for these transactions by processing them outside the main network. This breakthrough comes at a crucial time for Solana, as the network faces growing pressure from meme coin trading volumes and expanding decentralized applications. With over $400,000 raised in its ongoing presale within days, Solaxy’s approach has caught the attention of developers looking for reliable scaling solutions. How Solaxy’s Rollup Technology Makes Solana Faster When users make transactions on Solaxy’s Layer 2, the system immediately validates and groups them into ordered bundles. These bundles then get processed outside the main Solana network, which prevents congestion. Think of it as creating express lanes above the main highway – traffic keeps flowing smoothly because it’s spread across multiple levels. The security of these transactions comes from a process called settlement. After Solaxy processes a bundle of transactions, it creates a cryptographic proof – like a secure digital receipt. This proof gets recorded on Solana’s main network, confirming that every transaction in the bundle happened correctly. It’s similar to how a notary stamps documents to verify their authenticity, but this happens automatically for every batch of transactions. Speed improvements come from how Solaxy handles data. Traditional Solana transactions each carry their own verification data. But with rollups, hundreds or thousands of transactions share one set of verification data. This reduction in data size lets the network process more transactions without getting overwhelmed. For developers and users, this means consistently fast performance. Applications running on Solaxy maintain their speed even when the main Solana network faces heavy traffic. The Meme Coin Connection: Why High-Volume Trading Needs Layer 2 Meme coin trading creates challenges for blockchain networks. When a new meme coin launches or a social media post goes viral, thousands of traders rush to buy or sell at the same time. This sudden surge in activity has historically caused Solana to slow down or even stop processing transactions, leaving traders unable to execute their trades. Solaxy prevents these issues through its layered approach to transaction processing. The Layer 2 system can handle sudden spikes in trading volume because it processes transactions in parallel streams. While the main Solana network tries to process each transaction individually, Solaxy groups similar transactions together, making the whole system more efficient. This batching system particularly helps with the rapid-fire trading typical of meme coins. Traders can execute multiple transactions quickly without waiting for each one to clear the main network. For arbitrage traders working across multiple meme coins, this speed advantage becomes crucial for capturing price differences before they disappear. Building the Future: Developer Tools and Customization Developers building applications on Solana face a constant challenge: balancing fast transaction speeds with user experience. Solaxy’s development toolkit addresses this by letting developers fine-tune how their applications process transactions. The platform includes a set of smart contract templates that developers can adapt for different types of applications. A decentralized exchange, for instance, can optimize for high-speed trading by setting custom parameters for transaction bundling. Gaming applications can group similar in-game actions together, making the gameplay smoother even during busy periods. This customization extends to how applications handle transaction fees. Developers can choose between different bundling strategies based on their users’ needs. Some might prioritize speed by processing transactions immediately in smaller bundles, while others might optimize for lower costs by waiting to collect more transactions before processing them together. For decentralized finance applications, Solaxy offers specialized features for handling complex transactions. Smart contracts can be configured to automatically batch similar trades together, reducing costs for users while maintaining quick execution times. This becomes particularly valuable for automated trading strategies that need to execute multiple transactions in rapid succession. The development environment also includes testing tools that simulate high-traffic scenarios. Developers can stress-test their applications under various network conditions before deployment, helping identify and fix potential bottlenecks early in the development process. Investment Structure: Staking, Rewards, and Growth The economic model behind Solaxy creates strong incentives for long-term network support. When investors stake their SOLX tokens, they’re not just earning rewards – they’re helping secure the network and improve its performance. As more tokens get staked, the network can process larger transaction bundles more efficiently. Current staking rewards distribute 4,377.4 SOLX tokens per ETH block, with rewards releasing over three years. This extended timeline encourages participants to think beyond short-term gains. The staking pool already holds over 280 million SOLX tokens, showing strong early commitment from the community. Joining the presale gives investors early access to these staking benefits. The process starts by connecting a Web3 wallet to Solaxy’s platform. Investors can purchase SOLX using ETH, USDT, or BNB directly from their wallets. For those new to cryptocurrency, the platform accepts bank card payments, making it accessible to first-time buyers. The investment process works like this: After connecting your wallet, you choose your preferred payment method and the amount you want to invest. The system automatically stakes your tokens after purchase, so you start earning rewards immediately. The minimum investment stays low to allow broad participation in the network’s growth. What makes this structure different is how it ties economic incentives to network performance. When staked tokens help process more transactions, the network generates more fees, which flow back to stakers as additional rewards. This creates a positive feedback loop – as more people stake tokens, the network becomes more efficient, potentially increasing rewards for all participants.

Trump’s promise to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one seems to be coming true, as Gensler announced his resignation on January 20, the same day Trump is inaugurated. This big news helped push XRP to new yearly highs. Plus, Ripple’s RLUSD launched on December 17, taking a big step toward global growth. Meanwhile, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw became a target of the crypto community due to her strong anti-crypto stance and was denied renomination. All of these events could lead to something big on January 15, especially with Paul Atkins soon taking over as SEC Chair. Many are hopeful that this will bring a more relaxed approach to crypto regulation. What Will Happen on January 15? The SEC has requested an extension to file its principal brief in the ongoing XRP lawsuit with Ripple Labs. The new deadline for filing is set for January 15, 2025. According to attorney Fred Rispoli, this part of the case is strictly about paperwork — no new evidence or jury trial. There are two appeals in process: one from the SEC and another from Ripple, called a “cross-appeal.” Each side will submit an opening brief, followed by an opposition brief, and then a reply brief. Afterward, there will be a 15-minute oral argument in front of three judges . Fred said that while the argument is brief, it will be crucial, as the judges’ questions can provide insight into their initial thoughts on the case. However, he also said that the entire process could take up to a year and a half, despite the short duration of the oral argument. Even if the legal case continues, supporters remain optimistic that the new government will implement the right measures to support the crypto industry. Another bullish development is that Empower Oversight is urging Congress to release an SEC Inspector General report on former chairman Jay Clayton’s actions.

Citing Bitcoin’s potential to strengthen the US dollar and enhance national economic security, the document outlines a framework for establishing it as a strategic reserve asset within the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The draft, titled “Executive Order Designating Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset within the Exchange Stabilization Fund,” states that it is important for the United States to adapt to global financial innovations in order to maintain its economic leadership. It describes Bitcoin as a “decentralized and limited store of value asset” comparable to digital gold. The proposal addresses three key objectives: Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR): The SBR will promote economic flexibility by increasing the diversity of U.S. reserve assets. Bitcoin Designation as a Strategic Asset: The bill positions Bitcoin as a key component of U.S. financial dominance, allowing for its inclusion in the ESF. Leadership in the Digital Assets Industry: The plan aims to attract capital, talent, and businesses in the digital assets industry to the United States.

Consolidation of Government Bitcoin Assets: Within seven days of the Executive Order going into effect, all Bitcoin held by federal agencies, including those seized in legal proceedings, will be transferred to the SBR.

It piggybacks on this to amass a community of hungry traders and equips them with market-beating tools. These include trading signals, meme coin picks, a trading insiders group, staking, and trading rewards. The project raised a staggering $27 million in its first week of presale, which took Pepe Unchained five months to achieve. As such, the Wall Street Pepe ICO looks set to sell out in days or weeks.

It’s the first Solana layer 2 blockchain, making Solana even more scalable than it already is. https://twitter.com/SOLAXYTOKEN/status/1867318005660889427 Due to Solana’s sheer popularity, it suffers from congestion issues despite being capable of 6,500 transactions per second (TPS). This leads to longer wait times, higher fees, and sometimes transaction failures. Solaxy fixes this by batching transactions and computing them off the main network before reporting them back to Solana for finality. This enhances Solana’s transactional capabilities, making transactions cheaper, faster, and smoother. Solaxy launched its ICO four days ago and has raised $630K so far.

Bitfinex’s latest reports suggest when BTC’s peak could come and how much climbing might be left for the flagship crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel Bitcoin’s ‘Unique’ Cycle In its latest Alpha Report, Bitfinex highlighted the crypto industry’s big strides in adoption and mainstream recognition this year, which have differentiated this cycle from previous ones. Notably, the launch and increasing institutional demand of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed expectations and attracted a “new class of investors” to the crypto space. Per the report, this cycle has been “unique” as these new investors brought by ETFs and increasing confidence in the sector sent BTC’s price to a new ATH ahead of the Halving event, historically leading the flagship crypto to a new high after 5-7 months. The industry also saw a growing interest in diversifying national reserves with cryptocurrencies, with several jurisdictions worldwide considering implementing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve after the flagship crypto’s recent performance. According to Bitfinex analysts, these factors have kept BTC’s corrections smaller than other cycles and will likely continue this trend for the rest of the bull run: In the current bull cycle, which began in mid to late 2023, Bitcoinʼs corrections have been smaller, particularly since the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. With institutional and ETF demand providing consistent buying pressure, we expect this trend to continue, keeping future corrections limited and potentially shorter in duration. Moreover, the upcoming crypto-friendly US administration added to the growing bullish sentiment surrounding the industry, leading to the massive post-election rally. As a result, the crypto market has grown 130% year-to-date (YTD) to a market capitalization of $3.69 trillion, increasing nearly 70% this quarter. What’s Next For Bitcoin This Cycle? The report noted Bitcoin’s performance, highlighting its 573% surge from its 2022 low of $15,487. The flagship crypto has also seen an increase of 130% year-to-date (YTD), fueled by this year’s industry achievements. Earlier this month, Bitcoin broke past the $100,000 barrier for the first time, setting a new ATH closer to the $110,000 level on Monday. According to Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency still has several levels to climb in 2025, as historical data indicates that the market is mid-cycle. This data suggests BTC’s price will likely peak around Q3 and Q4 2025, as it tends to do approximately 450 days post-halving. Meanwhile, metrics like Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL), and the Bull-Bear market indicator signal that “we remain in the bull phase but far from euphoric peaks.” Bitfinex also explained that the Pi Cycle Top Indicator has historically been effective in timing cycle highs, forecasting the peaks with a three-day window. The previous cycle’s predictions indicate that Bitcoin could peak between mid-2025 and early-2026. Related Reading: PNUT Memecoin Drops 10% Following Peanut’s Owner Legal Warning To Binance If it follows the 2021 cycle pattern, BTC could see its price experience a 40% increase to $339,000 and peak around June or July 2025. Nonetheless, the report notes that the flagship crypto has been on a trend of diminishing returns over the cycles. Based on this, Bitcoin’s price might see a 15% to 20% increase to the $160,000-$200,000 range instead. However, if the cryptocurrency mirrors 2017’s cycle pattern, BTC’s rally could extend until January of 2026, peaking at $229,000 with similar diminishing returns.

37788346,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52452,1734501384,Ripple CTO Speaks On Recent Move That Could Unlock More XRP For All Accounts,"The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has undergone a critical transformation in its approach to account reserves. On December 2, the account reserve requirement for wallets on the XRPL was lowered from 10 XRP to 1 XRP , while the ownership reserve decreased from 2 XRP to 0.2 XRP and Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has weighed in on the implications of this strategic move. Traditionally, the XRPL has maintained account reserves as a defense mechanism against network spam and abuse. These reserves require users to lock up a specific amount of XRP to activate an account and maintain additional network objects like NFTs. This adjustment aims to lower the entry barrier for new users and provide more flexibility for existing account holders. To some, lowering the minimum reserve requirement could open the floodgates for spammers to enter the network. Ripple CTO Weighs In In his post on X, Schwartz highlighted the complex considerations behind reserve modifications. He emphasizes that the primary purpose of the reserve mechanism goes beyond simple governance, serving as a critical tool for maintaining network stability and preventing potential abuse. The voting mechanism for reserve changes involves validators setting preferred parameters, with the network ultimately adopting the median of these settings. However, Schwartz has identified potential challenges in this approach. When validators are inactive or votes are closely divided, the network can experience instability, oscillating between different reserve levels. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 To address these concerns, Schwartz proposed two key improvements to the voting configuration. First, he suggested implementing a default “off” setting for reserve changes, requiring explicit configuration for any modifications. Second, he recommended establishing a neutral default that prevents unintentional reserve adjustments without deliberate validator intervention. Schwartz also highlighted a unique aspect of the reserve modification, stating, “It’s worth pointing out that when reserves are lowered, every account on the XRPL immediately has more unlocked XRP.” Raising reserves would effectively lock up XRP that users previously had available, which could create perceptions of undue network influence. Schwartz characterizes the recent reserve reduction as overdue, though he noted that he would have preferred a more conservative approach. This recent move is part of a series of amendments to improve the ecosystem, and the growing adoption of XRP and its rising price show that the community is moving in the right direction.

However, every once in a while, a project comes along that catches the attention of industry veterans and sparks conversations about its potential to redefine the entire space. As we approach 2024, crypto experts are fixated on a new blockchain challenger that promises to address long-standing issues like scalability, sustainability, and integration with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Could this be the blockchain project that sets the new standard for the industry? Here’s why experts are so intrigued. The Challenges of Current Industry Leaders Blockchain giants like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain have made remarkable strides, but each comes with its own set of challenges: Ethereum: Its high gas fees and reliance on Layer 2 solutions to scale often frustrate users and developers. Solana: Known for its speed, Solana has faced network outages and questions about centralization. Binance Smart Chain: While efficient, it has been criticized for prioritizing performance over true decentralization. These pain points highlight the need for a blockchain that can combine high performance, decentralization, and innovative integration—all while being accessible and sustainable. The Features Turning Heads The blockchain gaining traction among experts is rumored to introduce groundbreaking features that directly address these gaps. Although details are still limited, here’s what we know so far: Lightchain Protocol AI Presale 1. A Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism The platform is said to use an entirely new consensus mechanism—possibly called Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—that leverages AI-driven computations to validate transactions. This could significantly improve energy efficiency and scalability while rewarding meaningful contributions to the network. 2. AI Integration at Its Core With an integrated Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), this blockchain goes beyond mere decentralization. It enables developers to create dApps that utilize real-time AI for predictive analytics, automation, and advanced decision-making. 3. Seamless Scalability Unlike many existing blockchains, this project reportedly achieves scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. By eliminating the need for complex Layer 2 solutions, it promises a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. 4. Environmentally Friendly Operations Sustainability has become a critical factor for blockchain adoption, and this challenger claims to have addressed this through its innovative consensus mechanism, which dramatically reduces energy consumption. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Why Experts Are Taking Notice Crypto experts are excited about this project because it tackles the most pressing issues holding back widespread blockchain adoption. Its potential to deliver a solution that is not only scalable but also intelligent and sustainable could set it apart in a crowded market. What Experts Are Watching: Technical Feasibility: Can the platform truly deliver on its promises of efficiency and scalability? Developer Support: Will it attract the developer community needed to build a robust ecosystem of applications? Institutional Interest: Early partnerships with enterprises or governments could provide the momentum required for mass adoption. Implications For The Crypto Industry If this blockchain lives up to expectations, it could redefine industry standards and challenge the dominance of established players like Ethereum and Solana. Beyond the crypto market, its AI integration could open the door to new applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and gaming. Key Use Cases: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Smarter, faster, and more secure financial services. Supply Chain Optimization: Transparent and intelligent tracking of goods and resources. AI-Powered Governance: Decentralized decision-making enhanced by real-time data analysis. Is This the Future of Blockchain? While it’s too early to say for certain, the buzz surrounding this blockchain challenger is hard to ignore. Its ability to address long-standing issues while introducing innovative features could make it the platform to watch in 2024. For investors and developers, the opportunity to get involved in a project with this level of potential is rare—and could prove transformative. Challenger Worth Watching The crypto world thrives on disruption, and this new blockchain challenger is poised to deliver just that. By combining cutting-edge technology with practical solutions to the industry’s biggest problems, it has the potential to meet and exceed the expectations of both the crypto community and the broader tech world. As details continue to emerge, this project is shaping up to be one of the most exciting developments of 2024.

Speaking at the Policy Summit by Blockchain Association, Scott stresses that crypto has the “potential to democratize the financial world.” “In my opinion, it is the next wonder of the world,” he said. “I’m going to be the chairman that creates a digital assets subcommittee for the first time.” Sen. Scott will be replacing Democrat predecessor, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who failed to secure a fourth term . Sen. Brown has long been a vocal critic of cryptos , citing concerns over their use in illicit finance. On Tuesday, along with Republican lawmaker French Hill, Sen. Scott devised plans to advance two crypto market-structure bills. These include the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) establishing crypto guardrails and a stablecoin bill. “I look forward to working with President Trump, David Sacks, and my colleagues in Congress to develop a regulatory framework for digital assets that encourages innovation here in the United States, not overseas,” he wrote on X. #Crypto has the potential to democratize the financial world.

Hill emphasised the importance of bipartisan support for successful crypto legislation. He also said that the future is bright in the US for digital assets and cryptocurrencies. Fantastic to join my friend @PatrickMcHenry at the @BlockchainAssn ’s 2024 #BAPolicySummit .

Hill noted. “You need to build consensus.” Sen. Tim Scott on Crypto ‘Scapegoat’ Concerns In April, Sen. Scott called cryptocurrencies a “scapegoat” for the federal government’s concerns about illicit finance. He also announced his run for US president last year in a motive to develop a digital assets regulatory framework that protects consumers while promoting innovation. During the July Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Sen. Scott explored using Bitcoin to establish “opportunity zones” that offers tax-free investments for developers. The Tuesday Policy meeting also saw the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s two Republican commissioners — Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce — speaking about the changes they expect to bring in the agency next year. Uyeda criticised the SEC’s current crypto accounting standard, while Peirce noted that the regulator will work closely with the CFTC.

Factors adding to this rally are major expectations of lower interest rate cuts in December, as it typically helped Bitcoin. Another factor that boosted this rally was the inclusion of MicroStrategy in the Nasdaq 100 index . In an X post, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, tagging James Seyffart on X, revealed that Bitcoin-Ethereum combo ETFs are likely to launch first, followed by Hedera (HBAR).

It is also evident that Atkins’ lighter regulatory approach could streamline the way for a broader range of crypto ETFs. Spotlight on Solana and XRP ETFs While proposals for Solana and XRP ETFs have been submitted, approval is unlikely until the new SEC leadership takes over in January. Bloomberg analysts suggest these funds could see the green light by late 2025. Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, has also joined the conversation stating, “It’s highly likely Solana ETFs will be approved by the end of next year at the latest.” Bitcoin adoption and the rise of crypto ETFs are driving prices to new heights—Read Bitcoin price prediction to see where it’s headed next! Altcoins in Focus Other altcoin ETFs, including those for Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR), could gain approval sooner due to their regulatory clarity. Seyffart highlighted that neither Litecoin nor HBAR has been classified as a security by the SEC, which simplifies their path to market. However, he questioned whether there’s sufficient investor demand for these products. Looking ahead, the number of altcoins ETF applications is expected to triple in the coming months, reflecting growing interest in diversifying crypto investment options. Issuers appear confident in the regulatory shift, with Two Prime Digital Assets CEO Alexander Blume remarking, “They wouldn’t waste the time and expense if they didn’t believe approval was likely.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP is the Largest Token After BTC & ETH Despite Trading Below $3-Here’s What to Expect if the Price Marks an ATH , The market is opening doors for alternative investment options since Bitcoin is getting high the market needs fresh inflow.

37786594,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52429,1734499836,Price Dip Or Buying Opportunity? Savvy Traders Hoarding Meme Coins Shiba Inu And Pepe. Rollblock Presale Tops $7 Million,"Price dip or buying opportunity? That’s the question many investors are asking following the crypto market’s post- bull run cooloff. Savvy traders are seizing the opportunity to take new positions. In fact, the SHIB meme coin had 15% in weekly gains while PEPE toppled Uniswap’s valuation. Meanwhile, the Rollblock presale has surged past $7 million , capturing attention with its unique “GambleFi” model and staking rewards. $7.3M and counting: Rollblock crypto casino set presale record ahead of the bull run The meme hype is gaining ground, and so is the innovation that Rollblock brings to the iGaming scene. Since its launch, Rollblock’s crypto presale has been gaining traction as one of the most talked-about opportunities in the altcoin market. Currently in stage nine presale , Rollblock has raised over $7.3M as a vote of confidence for its iGaming ingenuity. The reasons are crystal clear! The project stands out for its unique “GambleFi” model, which combines crypto gaming and staking features. Unlike traditional casinos and their pitfalls, Rollblock focuses on security and transparency by leveraging Ethereum’s smart contract. Its novel AI-powered betting tools designed to enhance user experience have also struck a chord with many punters. That’s why its ongoing presale is being compared to PEPE and SHIB ‘s meme success. The market is buzzing, and Rollblock is still selling at a discounted $0.0415. Shiba Inu shows signs of bullishness. A new bull run or a fakeout? Another altcoin that savvy traders have been hoarding ahead of the bull run is the beloved dog-themed Shiba Inu meme coin . Over the past week, Shiba Inu has shown bullish signs after breaking new levels with a 15% MoM gain to $0.00003. The meme coin ‘s outstanding performance and community-driven ecosystem development fueled the HODLing. Shiba Inu ‘s robust burn mechanism got a reface from the 1 CENT DREAM project to incinerate supply and aid price rise. Adding to the positive sentiment, Shiba Inu ‘s Shibarium L2 has reached a new milestone—$6M in TVL, 2M addresses, and over 60M transactions processed. Investors’ confidence is also on the rise, and some analysts are forecasting its rise to $80M in valuation. PEPE meme coin overtakes UNI as whales pour in billions PEPE faithful are also reaping the fruit of their foresight even before the bull run began. The frog-inspired meme coin broke the record—$11B market cap after overtaking UNI. This achievement represents an astounding 18x growth from its humble beginnings at $591 million earlier this year. This month’s performance is no different. PEPE has surged 150% on the heels of whales pouring in $1.14B. The token’s rally was further bolstered by its Dec. 5 listing on Binance.US and expanded accessibility through platforms like Robinhood and MoonPay. The milestones have exposed PEPE to newer investors, and analysts predict more upside during the bull run . Conclusion The crypto market’s full steam saw a cooldown, and savvy traders are already capitalizing on opportunities that signal massive future gains. Shiba Inu ‘s bullish breakout and PEPE ‘s record-smashing milestones show the enduring power of meme coins . Yet, Rollblock’s impressive $7.3M presale and innovative “GambleFi” model are turning heads as the next big contender. For investors, this dip isn’t just a cooldown—it’s the perfect time to position for explosive returns. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

From MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy driving its market cap near $100 billion to US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold ETFs in assets under management for the first time, the cryptocurrency is solidifying its position as a formidable contender in institutional investment portfolios. MicroStrategy’s Stellar Year: A 546% Stock Surge Fueled by Bitcoin Holdings MicroStrategy (MSTR) has had a phenomenal year, with its stock price skyrocketing by 546% in 2024, propelling its market capitalization to $99.4 billion. The company’s strategic accumulation of Bitcoin has been a key driver of this unprecedented growth. This year alone, the enterprise software giant added 249,850 BTC to its holdings, bringing its total reserves to an astounding 439,000 BTC — solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world. MicroStrategy’s current market cap is on the verge of surpassing the $100 billion milestone. With this achievement, it would outpace several prominent American companies if Bitcoin reaches higher price benchmarks. For instance, at a Bitcoin price of $138,000, MicroStrategy’s market cap could eclipse Starbucks , valued at $105.5 billion, and even Nike , which boasts a $115 billion valuation. Given its massive Bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy’s fortunes are closely tied to the price trajectory of BTC. According to its net asset value (NAV) worksheet, the company’s fully diluted market cap stands at $114 billion, with the derived MSTR NAV hovering around $40 billion. MicroStrategy’s BTC-centric strategy means that every $1,000 move in Bitcoin’s price equates to an approximate $440 million change in the company’s market cap. The implications are profound: A modest 11% rally in Bitcoin’s price to $118,810 would push MicroStrategy’s market cap beyond Starbucks. A 32% increase in Bitcoin’s value to $140,000 would allow MicroStrategy to overtake Nike. These calculations assume MicroStrategy refrains from further adding to its Bitcoin reserves, which currently outpace its nearest corporate competitor, Marathon Digital, by an astounding 985%. The High-Stakes Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy has drawn both praise and criticism. The company frequently issues debt to finance its Bitcoin purchases, a move that amplifies its exposure to BTC’s price movements. While this has proven immensely profitable during bullish market conditions, skeptics like Chainlink advocate Zach Rynes have expressed concern over the risks of the debt-based model. However, Ki-Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, remains optimistic about MicroStrategy’s approach. In a recent post on X, he highlighted that Bitcoin has never traded below the cost basis of long-term holders, which currently stands at $30,000. Ju quipped that MicroStrategy would face financial ruin “only if an asteroid hits Earth.” MicroStrategy’s performance in 2024 demonstrates the transformative potential of a Bitcoin-centric investment strategy. Its unprecedented accumulation of BTC not only solidifies its dominance in the cryptocurrency space but also positions it to compete with traditional corporate giants in terms of market capitalization. As Bitcoin continues to rise, MicroStrategy’s future appears intertwined with the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Whether the company reaches new milestones or grapples with market volatility, one thing remains clear: MicroStrategy has become a bellwether for corporate Bitcoin adoption and the broader integration of crypto into traditional financial markets. Bitcoin ETFs Surpass Gold Funds in AUM, Marking a Milestone for Crypto Adoption Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have outpaced gold ETFs in net assets for the first time. According to data from K33 Research, the collective assets under management (AUM) of US Bitcoin ETFs crossed $129 billion on Dec. 16, surpassing the total held in gold ETFs, which was just shy of that figure. This milestone highlights a shift in institutional investor sentiment, with asset managers increasingly favoring Bitcoin over the traditional safe-haven asset. The data includes both spot Bitcoin ETFs and those tracking Bitcoin's performance through financial derivatives like futures. The rapid rise of Bitcoin ETFs reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. According to Vetle Lund, K33 Research’s head of research, this achievement sheds light on Bitcoin’s emerging role in the broader financial market. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added that when factoring in all Bitcoin ETFs — including spot, futures, and leveraged funds — their collective AUM reaches $130 billion, compared to $128 billion for gold ETFs. However, he noted that spot Bitcoin ETFs alone account for $120 billion, trailing gold’s $125 billion. Balchunas described Bitcoin’s ability to compete with gold ETFs in such a short timeframe as ”unreal,” particularly given that spot Bitcoin ETFs only launched in January 2024 after a protracted approval process with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has been a key driver behind Bitcoin’s dominance in the ETF landscape. These funds, which directly hold Bitcoin rather than derivatives, have attracted significant inflows since their debut, breaking the $100 billion AUM threshold in November. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the frontrunner among Bitcoin ETFs, with nearly $60 billion in AUM. In November, IBIT overtook BlackRock’s own gold ETF, the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), marking a symbolic victory for the cryptocurrency over the precious metal. The surge in Bitcoin ETF assets also mirrors broader optimism about Bitcoin’s future. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, noted that the 2024 US presidential election results, which saw Donald Trump secure a victory, played a pivotal role in boosting Bitcoin ETF performance. The post-election period brought over $5 billion in inflows, reflecting renewed confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. The growing interest in Bitcoin ETFs aligns with what analysts call the “debasement trade.” This trend refers to investors seeking refuge in assets like gold and Bitcoin amid economic uncertainties and rising geopolitical tensions. A report from JPMorgan in October highlighted several factors driving this shift, including structurally higher geopolitical uncertainty since 2022, persistent inflation concerns, and worries about high government deficits across major economies. These factors have made both gold and Bitcoin attractive options for investors preparing for potential ”catastrophic scenarios.” On Dec. 16, Bitcoin’s purchasing power relative to gold reached a new all-time high as well, as BTC prices surged to record levels. A Paradigm Shift in Asset Allocation Bitcoin ETFs surpassing gold funds in AUM represents a significant turning point in the investment landscape. While gold has long been the go-to asset for preserving wealth during times of uncertainty, Bitcoin is rapidly emerging as a modern alternative. Its appeal lies in its potential for high returns, ease of transferability, and growing mainstream acceptance. The milestone also highlights the success of institutional players like BlackRock in legitimizing Bitcoin through regulated financial products. By offering investors a secure and accessible way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, these ETFs have played a crucial role in driving adoption. Despite its remarkable ascent, Bitcoin still faces challenges, including regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and skepticism from traditional financial institutions. However, its performance in 2024 has demonstrated resilience and a growing ability to compete with established assets like gold. As Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract inflows, they could reshape the broader financial market by encouraging more institutional and retail investors to allocate capital to digital assets. This shift not only elevates Bitcoin’s status but also paves the way for broader cryptocurrency adoption in traditional finance.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6594/micro-strategy-nears-100-b-market-cap-as-bitcoin-strategy-pays-off,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37787947,https://invezz.com/?p=2392565,1734499637,Australia’s corporate watchdog sues Binance’s unit over consumer protection failure,"Australia’s corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), announced on Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit against Binance’s local derivatives business, alleging misclassification of retail customers as wholesale clients, thereby denying them consumer protections. Binance Australia Derivatives is part of the global Binance group, one of the world’s largest digital cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume with registered users across the globe. Allegations on Binance’s unit The watchdog has accused Binance Australia Derivatives of multiple regulatory failures during the period between July 2022 and April 2023. According to the ASIC, the cryptocurrency exchange failed to meet key obligations required under Australian financial laws. The allegations include: Failure to Provide a Product Disclosure Statement: Binance did not issue a Product Disclosure Statement to retail clients, a fundamental requirement to ensure that investors understand the products they are being offered. Lack of Target Market Determination: The company failed to make a Target Market Determination, which helps ensure financial products are marketed only to suitable clients. Non-compliance with Internal Dispute Resolution Standards: Binance’s internal dispute resolution system was not compliant with Australian regulations, denying clients a structured mechanism to address grievances. Inefficient and Unfair Financial Services: The exchange allegedly did not take necessary steps to ensure that its financial services were delivered efficiently, honestly, and fairly. License Condition Violations: Binance is accused of not adhering to the conditions attached to its financial services license. Inadequate Employee Training and Competence: The company did not adequately train its employees or ensure their competence in providing financial services. The ASIC claims that Binance Australia Derivatives incorrectly classified 505 retail investors, representing approximately 83% of its local clientele, as wholesale clients between July 2022 and April 2023. This misclassification allowed the company to offer crypto derivative products without adhering to the stricter consumer protection standards required for retail clients. Binance’s troubles in Australia In April 2023, the ASIC cancelled Binance Australia Derivatives’ financial services license after conducting a targeted review of the exchange. Later, in November 2023, the regulator facilitated compensation of around A$13.1 million ($8.29 million) to 435 retail clients who were incorrectly categorised as wholesale clients. “Crypto derivative products are inherently risky and complex, so it is critical that retail clients are classified correctly,” ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said in a statement. She added that such classifications ensure they receive the required consumer protections and the information needed to make an informed investment decision ASIC stated that it will pursue penalties, declarations, and adverse publicity orders against Binance in the ongoing proceedings. The exchange has yet to comment on the lawsuit. This legal action comes shortly after Australia’s federal court fined the local operator of another cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, A$8 million following ASIC’s civil proceedings.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

Over the years, their popularity has skyrocketed, driven by community engagement, viral marketing, and a sprinkle of good old-fashioned internet humour. Today, we’re diving into three standout contenders in this space: BTFD Coin , Book of Meme, and Snek. These projects are not just riding the meme coin wave; they’re innovating gameplay, turning pages, and sneaking up in value. Each of these coins showcases exceptional potential for returns, making them some of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BTFD Coin is particularly noteworthy due to its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) gaming mechanics and staking rewards. This coin isn’t merely about memes; it’s about building a robust community and giving back to its holders. With a presale that launched on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin is setting the stage for something big. Analysts are buzzing with excitement, predicting a significant increase in value as the presale progresses. With each stage, the anticipation grows, and potential investors are keen to jump on board before it’s too late. As for the presale itself, BTFD Coin has already raised over $4.1 million, hitting the $1 million mark in under ten days and $2.5 million in just fourteen days. This kind of traction is hard to ignore, especially when you consider the low entry price of $0.000004 per coin. With a projected listing price of $0.0006 post-presale, the potential for profit is substantial. It’s a prime example of why this coin is among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. BTFD Coin: Innovating the Meme Coin Space BTFD Coin is making waves in the meme coin arena, primarily through its unique approach to gameplay and community engagement. The integration of a play-to-earn model not only attracts gamers but also incentivises participation within its ecosystem. Imagine earning rewards while playing games that resonate with the meme culture—it’s a win-win situation. This innovative approach aligns perfectly with the current trends in the crypto space, where gamification is becoming increasingly popular. The presale dynamics of BTFD Coin add another layer of excitement. Since its launch, the coin has surged through multiple presale stages, showcasing a healthy demand. Currently, it’s in its 12th stage, priced at $0.00013. With over 56 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 5,700 holders, the community backing this coin is robust. Investors are flocking to BTFD Coin, eager to secure their stake in a project that’s not just about memes but about real utility and engagement. Now, let’s talk numbers. An investment of $150,000 during Stage 5, priced at $0.00005 per coin, would yield 3 billion $BTFD coins. When the price hits the projected $0.0006 at the end of the presale, that investment would translate to a whopping $1.8 million. That’s the kind of growth that gets investors buzzing, making BTFD Coin a frontrunner among the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Book of Meme: Turning a New Page Next up is the Book of Meme, a project that’s creatively leveraging the meme culture to build a community and increase value. It’s a fresh take on the traditional meme coin concept, focusing on storytelling and user-generated content. The idea is simple yet powerful: users create and share memes, and the best ones are rewarded with tokens. This not only enhances community interaction but also incentivises creativity. The Book of Meme aims to turn the conventional narrative of meme coins on its head. Instead of merely relying on hype, it fosters a culture where users feel invested in the platform’s success. This model is particularly appealing to younger audiences who thrive on social media engagement and creativity. By gamifying the meme creation process, Book of Meme is carving out a unique place in the crypto landscape. Investors are taking notice of the potential for substantial returns. With its innovative approach, the Book of Meme is positioned as one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. Its community-driven model is not just about making a quick buck; it’s about building a sustainable ecosystem where everyone can thrive. As the project continues to grow, so too does the excitement around its future potential. Snek: Sneaking Upwards Finally, we have Snek, a meme coin that’s been quietly gaining traction. While it may not have the same level of mainstream attention as BTFD Coin or Book of Meme, Snek is steadily sneaking its way into the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. This coin is all about community, often leveraging humour and internet culture to create a loyal following. Snek’s appeal lies in its simplicity and relatability. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate things with grandiose promises; instead, it focuses on building a strong community. This grassroots approach can lead to organic growth, which is often more sustainable than hype-driven models. As more people discover Snek and its engaging community, the potential for upward movement in value becomes increasingly likely. The current market sentiment is highly favourable, and many analysts are predicting that Snek could be one of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. As it continues to build its following and enhance its community engagement, investors are starting to take it seriously. Snek’s value might not skyrocket overnight, but its steady ascent could yield impressive returns for those who get in early. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the landscape of meme coins is evolving, and BTFD Coin, Book of Meme, and Snek are leading the charge. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, whether it’s innovative gameplay, community-driven content, or a grassroots approach. For anyone looking to dive into the crypto world, these coins represent some of the best meme coins to invest in December 2024. With solid presale performances, robust community backing, and exciting potential for growth, the time to act is now.

37790003,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320537,1734498664,Ohio Representative Pushes Bill to Authorize Bitcoin Investments for State Treasury,"Ohio Representative Derek Merrin has introduced a bill that aims to authorize the state’s treasury to invest public funds in Bitcoin. The proposal, known as House Bill 703 or the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act, seeks to establish a Bitcoin fund within the state’s treasury and grant the State Treasurer the authority to allocate funds to Bitcoin investments at their discretion. “The U.S. Dollar is being rapidly devalued, and our State Treasurer should have the authority and flexibility to invest in Bitcoin when determining proper asset allocation,” Merrin said in a post on X . Bill Does Not Mandate Treasurer to Invest in Bitcoin The bill proposes amendments to section 2981.12 and the addition of section 135.146 to Ohio’s Revised Code. While it empowers the treasurer to make Bitcoin investments, it does not mandate specific purchase amounts or asset allocation targets. Merrin said that Bitcoin can act as a safeguard for Ohio’s financial reserves, offering a tool to preserve public funds from devaluation. He claimed this legislative step would allow Ohio’s government to “harness the power of Bitcoin” and reinforce the state’s financial standing. The timing of the bill’s introduction is significant, as the legislative session is nearing its conclusion. Merrin hopes the proposal will serve as a framework for debate in the next session, which begins in 2025. The initiative aligns with broader efforts at the state and national levels to integrate Bitcoin into public financial systems. Today, I filed HB 703 to create the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve within the state treasury!

In November 2024, Pennsylvania Representative Mike Cabell introduced the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act, which calls for up to 10% of the state’s treasury reserves to be allocated to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. Meanwhile, on December 12, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione filed House Bill 1598, seeking to create a state-controlled Bitcoin reserve and permit state agencies to accept Bitcoin payments for taxes and fees. Ohio’s Bitcoin push builds on a separate initiative led by Ohio State Senator Niraj Antani, who proposed legislation in October to allow state residents to pay taxes and fees using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. These developments point to a growing trend among U.S. states to explore the use of Bitcoin as a financial hedge and payment option for public funds. Corporate Bitcoin Holders Expand BTC Reserve The announcement comes as corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings. Earlier this week, MicroStrategy acquired 15,350 Bitcoin , valued at approximately $1.6 billion, bringing the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 Bitcoin (currently over $46 billion). Likewise, MARA Holdings (MARA) bought 11,774 BTC in the latest acquisition, the company announced on X on Dec. 10. The mining firm purchased Bitcoin using proceeds from its zero-coupon convertible notes offerings, paying approximately $1.1 billion at an average price of $96,000 per Bitcoin. Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining company, also announced plans to raise $500 million through a private bond offering to bolster its Bitcoin reserves further.

37785007,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629407,1734497432,Deutsche Bank develops solution to address blockchain regulatory challenges,"Deutsche Bank AG is addressing regulatory challenges that banks face when using public blockchains, such as the risk of unknowingly transacting with criminals or sanctioned groups. According to a Bloomberg report , the bank launched its test version of Project Dama 2, an asset servicing pilot, in November. This platform’s layer two system relies on public blockchains to provide more affordable and efficient transactions. Boon-Hiong Chan, a Deutsche Bank Asia-Pacific innovation lead, said that the bank’s Layer 2 connects to Ethereum, one of the busiest smart contracting blockchain networks. Deutsche Bank sees blockchain as a means to deal with margin pressures in financial services Chan explained in an interview that public blockchains such as Ethereum pose risks to regulated banks. The risks include uncertainty regarding who is performing the validation of transactions, the possibility of paying fees to sanctioned entities, and the possibility of unexpected changes to the blockchain. Chan added, “Using two chains, a number of these regulatory concerns should be satisfied.” Project Dama 2 is one of several initiatives in Singapore’s Project Guardian, where 24 major financial institutions are looking to tokenize assets via blockchain technology. Deutsche Bank, among other advocates, sees blockchain as a means to deal with margin pressures in financial services. However, there are still questions as to how far banking institutions should go in the crypto world. The Dama 2 platform is built through a product supported by ZKsync’s technology and is based off of an alliance between crypto firms Interop Labs and Memento Blockchain Pte. The bank is waiting for the green light from financial watchdogs and plans to unveil the product’s minimum viable features sometimes next year. Chan emphasized that the layer 2 component could free banking institutions to examine and explore public distributed ledger technologies as well as allow them to exhibit a more pronounced list of network validators that facilitate transaction approvals for crypto assets in exchange for rewards. Deutsche Bank partners with crypto.com to offer banking solutions for the exchange Deutsche Bank is one of the most active banking institutions in the blockchain ecosystem. On December 10th, Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced it had formed a strategic partnership with the German bank to expand banking and crypto services in Singapore, Australia and Hong Kong. The agreement stipulates that the bank will provide additional banking support and increased coverage to the crypto exchange as their relationship escalates. Banking institutions are crucial for business operations in the crypto industry by helping crypto companies manage cash flow, facilitate enormous financial transactions and process payments. Crypto companies have had prolonged challenges with the private banking sector for a long time. U.S. regulators under the Biden-Harris administration launched operation 2.0 which involved financial censorship for crypto organizations. The litigation was first introduced by former president Barack Obama’s administration in 2013 as an operation Choke Point meant to tackle fraud and illegal activities by denying malicious individuals and entities access to banking services. Notable crypto figures have also been denied access to the banking system. In October, Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer, Brad Gralinghouse publicly announced he was de-banked by Citibank. Gralinghouse explained in an interview that the bank terminated their years-long relationship, citing his prominence and involvement in the crypto arena. The executive said the bank gave him five days to transfer his funds to other banking institutions. Deutsche Bank joins industry players in Web3 to investigate interoperability of public blockchains In June, the Frankfurt based bank joined a coalition of major financial organizations and Web3 industry contributors to produce a detailed research on how tokenized assets can achieve interoperability across private and public blockchain networks as well as legacy systems. The report titled Institutional Interoperability: “How Financial Institutions Navigate a Multichain World” highlighted a definitive role that accessibility and liquidity availability would play in facilitating financial institutions with flexibility, scalability, transparency and privacy. The contributors of the research stressed that there exists a need for network interconnecting models that connect different blockchains. Deutsche Bank’s firsthand insights emphasized that blockchain and tokenization technologies can significantly reduce costs and provide efficient value to users in non-traditional business models. The bank cited its insights from experimentation with the technologies from an asset servicing perspective. The bank also discussed that interoperability across blockchains, and with traditional systems, is necessary while describing its challenges.

37784757,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=375018,1734497227,Here’s When FTX’s Court-Approved Chapter 11 Plan Will Take Effect,"FTX and its affiliated debtors have announced that their Chapter 11 reorganization plan will officially take effect on January 3, 2025. This day has also been designated as the initial distribution record date for those holding allowed claims in the plan’s convenience classes. Distribution Details According to a press release , payments for these claims are expected to begin within 60 days of the plan’s effective date. In line with this, recipients must complete know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and fulfill other distribution requirements, including submitting tax forms. This first round of payments will only apply to the convenience classes, with FTX noting that separate records and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. The court-approved reorganization plan, finalized in October 2024, received overwhelming support from creditors, who stand to recover an average of 119% of the value of their claims. Furthermore, under the terms of the initiative, some will receive up to 140% in cash. FTX estimates that total recoveries will range between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion. These repayments have been made possible through efforts to reclaim assets from various parties, including the U.S. Department of Justice and international regulators. The company’s CEO, John J. Ray III, highlighted that the latest development demonstrated the significant success of the recovery efforts. “For the past two years, our team of professionals have meticulously and efficiently worked to recover billions of dollars to reach this point.” He added that FTX is now in a strong position to begin reimbursing funds to customers and creditors. He also encouraged claim holders to ensure they complete all the necessary steps to avoid delays in receiving their payments. Distribution Agents and FTX Convictions To support the distribution process, the defunct exchange has partnered with two crypto custodians, BitGo and Kraken. The duo will help disburse the funds to both retail and institutional customers as well as other claimants in supported jurisdictions. FTX’s bankruptcy filing in late 2022 was one of the most significant collapses in the crypto industry. It was marked by several high-profile sentences, including the November 2023 conviction of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy, resulting in a 25-year imprisonment. In May 2024, FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame was sentenced to 7.5 years in prison, while Caroline Ellison, the former head of Alameda Research, received a two-year prison term. Two other executives, Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, avoided prison altogether.

37790000,https://cryptonews.com/?p=320552,1734496891,"About 20% of US Voters Have Used Crypto in Some Form, Emerson College Poll Reveals","A recent Emerson College poll reveals that nearly 20% of U.S. voters have engaged with cryptocurrency in some capacity, be it through investment, trading, or usage. The survey , conducted between December 11 and 13, polled 1,000 registered voters, providing a glimpse into the evolving relationship between American voters and the crypto industry. The poll revealed that 40% of crypto users have used digital assets to make purchases, showcasing the growing real-world application of crypto. Crypto Users Are Younger Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted that crypto users tend to be younger and come from more diverse backgrounds. “Crypto users are younger and have a larger minority base, highlighting crypto as a growing, diverse constituency for political support.” Notably, 57% of these users have a favorable view of Donald Trump. The support aligns with Trump’s recent pro-crypto stance. Since his campaign, the president-elect has shown a strong backing for the crypto sector, nominating several pro-crypto figures to lead key financial regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The poll further revealed that younger demographics are more engaged with crypto. Among respondents under 40, nearly one-third reported having used cryptocurrency. The rate of crypto use declined with age, as 28% of respondents in their 40s, 17% in their 50s, 9% in their 60s, and only 4% of those over 70 reported crypto use. NATIONAL POLL What do you think is the most important issue facing the United States? 40% economy 17% immigration 16% threats to democracy 7% abortion access 5% healthcare 4% crime 3% housing affordability 3% education https://t.co/W0zTX4kJ7b — Emerson College Polling (@EmersonPolling) November 3, 2024 Gender and racial disparities were also evident in the data. Men were twice as likely to use crypto as women, with 26% of male respondents reporting usage compared to 13% of female respondents. Furthermore, about one-third of crypto users identified as Asian, Hispanic, or Black, while only 14% identified as white. The Emerson poll’s findings come amid growing political interest in crypto. Another survey, conducted by the Digital Chamber, found that 26 million U.S. voters belong to a “crypto voting bloc,” with one in seven respondents prioritizing pro-crypto policies when selecting candidates. A separate poll by Grayscale and a market researcher revealed that over half of U.S. voters were more inclined to support pro-crypto candidates. Fairshake Spent Tens of Millions on Pro-Crypto Candidates As reported, cryptocurrency-related Political Action Committees (PACs) and affiliated groups poured over $245 million into the 2024 election cycle. For one, Fairshake’s financial muscle was instrumental in shaping election outcomes. The PAC spent tens of millions supporting candidates across the political spectrum, including Democratic Senate hopefuls in Arizona and Michigan, as well as Republican Jim Justice in West Virginia. In California, Fairshake’s ad blitz contributed to Democratic Rep. Katie Porter’s defeat in the Senate primary. By the end of the election cycle, Fairshake had already raised $78 million for the 2026 midterms. Crypto industry leaders and venture capitalists played a significant role in financing these efforts. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen contributed $12 million, while Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss donated a combined $10.1 million. Other major donors included Kraken’s Jesse Powell and Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko.

37784551,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=313155,1734496830,A Web 3.0 VC’s Guide to Surviving and Thriving in 2025,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post 2024 will be recognized as the year when crypto and blockchain finally mainstreamed their legitimacy. While the crypto industry is no stranger to adversity, this year has seen a surge of optimism regarding its potential. With the re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States, the global cryptocurrency market has surpassed a valuation of $3 trillion for the first time in over three years. This resurgence is driven by a demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets, coinciding with the new administration’s policies and market sentiment. With the clouds starting to part, regulatory clarity and infrastructural progress have emerged as two key factors driving the industry’s successes and hard-earned legitimacy. This shift has fueled a steady influx of VC (venture capital) investments over the course of 2024, signaling the market is both maturing and preparing for a major breakout. So, how can startups take advantage of 2025’s fresh possibilities to garner VC attention? The answer lies in reflecting on the past year. Gains of 2024 This year welcomed a new level of maturity for the crypto sector, with some of the most successful projects prioritizing security, compliance and building trust with investors and the broader Web 3.0 community. Just two weeks into the year, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs supercharged market confidence, attracting institutional and retail investors. But why? The move legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of skeptics, fueling interest in crypto to the general public and driving gradual price gains. By making Bitcoin more accessible through traditional financial markets, the approval opened the gates for larger institutional investments , which had previously been cautious about direct exposure to the crypto market. And now, Trump’s re-election has produced a market surge, with Bitcoin prices reaching a historic high, surging over 129% in 2024. While the specifics of Trump’s crypto policy remain uncertain, he is widely anticipated to be a strong ally to the industry, fueling optimism for what lies ahead. One of the most welcomed developments over the last 12 months has been the convergence between crypto and AI . While it was always clear that these two transformative technologies would eventually intersect, few could have predicted the speed and scale at which they merged – a nd the surface of what’s possible is only just being scratched. While there is no crystal ball to predict exactly what’s coming next year, startups can use 2024 as a compass, pinpointing which trends will be on VCs radar. Solving scalability through infrastructure For startups looking to scale successfully, one of the most critical areas to address is the infrastructure sector, particularly in the ongoing development and scaling of Ethereum’s ecosystem. As Ethereum continues to grow rapidly, scalability remains a major barrier, making it a key focus for VCs looking to invest in solutions that can handle high-volume transactions efficiently. Layer-two solutions are becoming increasingly essential in addressing the challenges facing Ethereum , and VCs are keen to support startups in developing the infrastructure needed to enhance the network’s efficiency, security and accessibility. Pioneering privacy solutions with AI and blockchain In 2025, AI and blockchain are set to significantly advance data privacy, addressing concerns highlighted by copyright lawsuits involving several high-profile companies . Innovations such as FHE (fully homomorphic encryption) and federated learning are set to pave the way for privacy-preserving AI training. Startups combining AI and blockchain to safeguard privacy while creating value for users are positioned to attract investor attention. In particular, solutions that allow individuals to maintain control over their data and be compensated for its use could disrupt traditional data-sharing models, creating new business opportunities. Beyond privacy, there are clear challenges in AI that Web 3.0 could help address, including improving accessibility and democratization, creating pathways for monetization and ownership and fostering incentives for open contributions. While the future remains uncertain, the growth of consumer adoption and institutional investment is likely to strengthen the foundations of the crypto industry and drive sustainable progress. In the coming year, we expect VCs to deepen their commitments, focusing on building long-term value while supporting talented founders whose solutions will drive the next wave of innovation. The rise of PayFi While DeFi has made steady progress, its full integration into traditional financial systems is still unfolding. Interest in DeFi is on the rise, and in 2025, the focus will shift towards PayFi (payment finance). First introduced last July, PayFi leverages blockchain as a settlement layer, using Web 3.0 payments and DeFi protocols to create more transparent, cost-effective and efficient financial transactions. For VCs, investing in PayFi startups presents an opportunity to be involved in the next wave of financial innovation, which is set to reshape the relationship between crypto and TradFi (traditional finance). Increasing focus on real-world assets for investment opportunities Tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) are quickly becoming a popular investment. By 2030, the market for tokenized RWAs is projected to reach $16 trillion , as companies are looking to bring more traditional asset classes onto blockchain platforms. ANZ, one of Australia’s top four banks, recently partnered with Singapore’s Project Guardian to explore tokenizing RWAs, which is an example of an institution looking to expand access to a wider range of asset classes. VCs should look out for projects innovating in this space, as tokenized RWAs allow even those with limited capital to participate in substantial ventures, opening opportunities for financial growth and stability, Bringing stablecoins and TradFi together As blockchain continues to align with TradFi, the stablecoin market will be a pivotal sector to watch. VCs should be keenly interested in the growing stablecoin market, particularly as major players recently announced new initiatives that will allow banks to issue stablecoins and other fiat-backed tokens internationally. Stablecoins, alongside payments and yield protocols, are expected to play a central role in the continued Web 3.0 expansion by providing stable, scalable and interoperable solutions for DeFi applications. They help to ensure seamless value transfer, which has the potential to help foster greater adoption across markets globally. As new projects enter the DeFi playing field, VCs will continue to intensify their investments, prioritizing the creation of long-term value and continue backing founders whose solutions are set to fuel and lead the next wave of progress in the blockchain and Web 3.0 ecosystem.

According to Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, a Senate aide confirmed that the Senate Banking Committee’s scheduled vote on her nomination has been canceled. Crenshaw, who was known for her anti-crypto stance, even opposed the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF, issuing a dissent. This victory is seen as a step forward for the crypto community, with many expecting a pro-crypto shift in the SEC under new leadership. Crypto advocates flooded the Senate with 107,000 emails opposing Crenshaw’s renomination, showing the strength of the industry’s voice. Additionally, Senator Cynthia Lummis predicts that 2025 will be a major year for Bitcoin and digital assets, with David Sacks serving as the crypto czar. Crenshaw, appointed to the SEC in 2020 under the Trump administration and later renominated by President Biden, has been a strong ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. She is considered even more anti-crypto than Gensler, especially due to her opposition to key crypto policies. With Crenshaw not being renominated as SEC Chair, it significantly boosts the likelihood that the SEC will not continue its pursuit of Ripple Labs. This also opens the door for President Trump to appoint someone new, potentially more favorable to the crypto space. Why Didn’t The Crypto Market React?

37784255,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663971,1734496249,Bitcoin’s Price Momentum Shifts As Spot Market Outpaces Futures – Here’s What It Means,"Bitcoin has continued its upward trajectory as recent market trends highlight a shift in investor behaviour. According to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Avocado Onchain, spot market demand has emerged as a significant driving force behind Bitcoin’s ongoing price increases. This trend indicates growing buying pressure from long-term investors, as speculative activity in the futures market appears to be cooling. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Big Move? Key Metric Reveals When to Cash In Profits Bitcoin Spot Market Demand Gains Strength The analyst’s observations provide insights into Bitcoin’s ongoing bull cycle, which began in the first half of 2023. According to Avocado, initially, the futures market led the charge in pushing Bitcoin’s price upward, signalling a speculative phase fuelled by short-term traders. However, this momentum was interrupted earlier this year when both the futures and spot markets experienced reduced trading activity starting in March. Since October, market activity has returned, with trading volumes rising across both futures and spot markets, providing fresh support for Bitcoin’s rally. In his analysis, Avocado Onchain noted a key trend: while futures market activity has recently declined, demand in the spot market has been steadily increasing. Spot market activity refers to the actual purchase of Bitcoin on exchanges for immediate delivery, typically driven by investors with a long-term perspective. This stands in contrast to futures markets, where traders speculate on price movements using contracts that do not require immediate ownership of the asset. Spot Market Demand Takes the Lead as Bitcoin Continues Its Upward Momentum “While futures market activity has declined, spot market demand continues to increase.

Historically, overheated futures markets have led to volatility, often triggering liquidations. However, the cooling of futures market activity, coupled with rising spot market demand, reflects a more sustainable form of buying pressure that can underpin Bitcoin’s long-term growth. The CryptoQuant analyst noted: Looking ahead, the futures market is likely to undergo cycles of overheating and liquidations, which will contribute to Bitcoin’s price growth. This price movement will, in turn, encourage further capital inflows into the spot market. Additionally, Avocado Onchain pointed to the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of Bitcoin’s funding rate, which shows “no signs of late-cycle overheating.” Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit $180,000 If These Cycle Top Indicators Are Absent, Says VanEck’s Sigel The funding rate measures the cost of holding futures contracts and is often used as an indicator of market sentiment. Avocado mentioned that as BTC funding rate remains balanced, it suggests that BTC’s price movements are not being driven solely by leveraged positions, reducing the risk of sudden price reversals.

With Bitcoin hitting record highs, important figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Dennis Porter are pushing hard to make it happen. The plan is to make Bitcoin a part of U.S. fiscal policy. This could help strengthen the U.S. dollar and even improve national security. It’s a bold idea that could completely reshape how America handles money. Cynthia Lummis and Her Vision for Bitcoin Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Senator, has been a Bitcoin supporter for a long time. She sees Bitcoin not just as a cryptocurrency, but as something that could help secure America’s financial future. She’s backing a proposal to turn part of the U.S. gold reserves into Bitcoin. Lummis argues this would save the government billions and give the dollar a much-needed boost. Source : X.com But she’s not in this alone. David Sacks, a venture capitalist who’s been named the “ Crypto Czar ,” is working alongside her to push for a new law that would make Bitcoin a key part of the U.S. reserves. This partnership is all about making sure the economy stays strong, even as we head into a more digital age. Dennis Porter and the Executive Order Dennis Porter, the CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, shared the first page of an Executive order via an X post. This EO could pave the way for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This will allow the U.S Treasury to manage BTC as a reserve asset along with the dollar and gold. MASSIVE BREAKING: I can confirm that my team has finalized a model EXECUTIVE ORDER for the president of the United States to establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ pic.twitter.com/rz3issLf2H — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) December 17, 2024 The executive order also proposes taking around 200,000 Bitcoin—seized in criminal cases and worth about $20 billion—and using them as part of this reserve. Instead of selling these assets at auction, they would be put to work for national financial stability. To ensure transparency, the Treasury would oversee Bitcoin with robust security and conduct regular audits. What’s Next for Bitcoin in U.S. Reserves? If the plan goes ahead, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could have a major impact on the U.S. economy. It might help cut down the national debt, protect the country from inflation. It can even make the dollar more competitive on the global stage. Beyond that, it could give the U.S. a stronger negotiating position against economic powers like China and Russia. While the proposal sounds promising, it’s clear that challenges remain.

Bitcoin remains the face of stability in crypto, while ZIGnaly continues to attract users with its powerful trading tools. But the hottest name buzzing through the crypto streets is Qubetics ($TICS) , where analysts are predicting monumental returns after its mainnet launch. Qubetics is offering a fresh approach by addressing real-life blockchain problems that its competitors simply couldn’t solve. With its presale stages closing quickly every week, the project has investors scrambling to secure tokens before the next price hike. Let’s dive into why Qubetics, Bitcoin, and ZIGnaly are the best coins to invest in this month . Qubetics Promises Life-Changing Returns with Revolutionary Solutions Qubetics is the rising star that everyone’s talking about. Its presale has already raised over $6.9 million across 13 stages, selling over 350 million $TICS tokens . The token price currently sits at $0.0342, but analysts are projecting massive returns for early investors, with the price expected to reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 630.19% ROI. Post-launch predictions are even more impressive, with $1 translating to a 2820.78% ROI and $5 promising an astonishing 14,503.91% ROI. To put it into perspective: An investment of $550,000 in $TICS at its current presale price could grow into $240,414,515 if the token reaches $15 post-launch. These numbers aren’t just ambitious—they’re realistic, given the project’s massive potential. One of Qubetics’ standout offerings is the QubeQode IDE . This intuitive development platform makes building blockchain applications simple for businesses and individuals alike. Small Businesses: Take a local retail shop wanting to accept digital payments. With QubeQode’s drag-and-drop tools, the shop owner can create a smart contract in minutes for tokenized loyalty rewards—no coding required. Developers: For tech enthusiasts, QubeQode’s form-based configuration speeds up dApp development, allowing creators to launch secure, scalable applications faster. Enterprises: Large companies can leverage pre-built components for token management and user authentication to streamline their internal processes while ensuring data security. With every presale stage ending at midnight each Sunday, Qubetics increases the token price by 10%, creating urgency for investors.

Over the past week, Bitcoin’s trading volume and market cap have shown consistent growth, signalling rising interest among institutional investors. According to CoinDesk’s latest report, Bitcoin’s trading volumes soared by 18% as the crypto broke through its previous resistance levels. Analysts point out that the renewed focus on Bitcoin ETFs and institutional adoption is fuelling this momentum. For example, BlackRock recently hinted at accelerating its plans for Bitcoin ETF approval, which could bring billions of fresh investments into the asset. Additionally, El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy has seen a new surge in returns, highlighting the coin’s long-term value. On-chain data also shows that whales are accumulating Bitcoin again, suggesting bullish sentiment heading into the next halving cycle. For those keeping their eyes on stable investments, Bitcoin remains an anchor in the volatile market. Its growing adoption as digital gold and institutional backing makes it an essential part of a strong crypto portfolio. ZIGnaly Boosts Traders’ Earnings with Strategic Updates ZIGnaly is making strides in helping retail and pro traders level up their crypto earnings. This copy trading platform recently reported a 25% increase in user base after rolling out its latest AI-powered trading bots. The platform allows investors to mirror the trades of top-performing traders, which has gained massive traction among beginners looking to automate their crypto strategies. Earlier this week, ZIGnaly announced an upgrade to its profit-sharing model, reducing platform fees and increasing trader payouts by 12%. This move aims to attract more expert traders to the platform, creating win-win opportunities for both sides. Moreover, ZIGnaly’s native token saw a notable uptick after its integration with leading blockchains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum. This opens doors for smoother liquidity and faster transaction speeds—critical features that ZIGnaly needed to stay competitive. For investors seeking reliable utility-driven platforms, ZIGnaly remains one of the best coins to invest in this month. Conclusion: Why These Are the Best Coins to Invest in This Month Qubetics, Bitcoin, and ZIGnaly each bring something valuable to the table for crypto investors. Bitcoin continues to deliver unmatched stability, solidifying its role as the cornerstone of every portfolio. ZIGnaly’s innovative platform upgrades make it a strong contender for traders seeking automated, profitable solutions. Qubetics, however, stands out with its groundbreaking QubeQode IDE and unmatched ROI potential. With analysts predicting an incredible rise to $15 post-mainnet launch and its presale price increasing weekly, Qubetics is setting new standards in the crypto space. Each of these projects offers opportunities tailored to different investor goals, whether it’s stability, trading growth, or explosive returns.

Santa Rides Shiba (SANTSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANTSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Rides Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Rides Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Rides Shiba launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Rides Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Rides Shiba by entering its contract address – CxpeR8vdgeVWZFwBytS7PRrXHBwVgPJWZBJUcpK3k7vT – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANTSHIB. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/santa-rides-shiba-santshib-memecoin-will-explode-over-19000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

A nonprofit focused on government accountability, they questioned Hinman, who served as the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance director from 2017 to 2020. The group found documents suggesting Hinman may have violated ethics rules about conflicts of interest and sent evidence to the SEC’s Office of Inspector General in May 2022. In February 2024, the SEC’s inspector general said the investigation was almost finished. The report could support their investigation before Clayton is confirmed as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. What Did Hinman Say in His Controversial 2018 Speech? In 2018, Hinman gave a high-profile speech stating that Ethereum’s digital token, Ether, was not a security, which led to an immediate rise in Ether’s price. This raised questions about whether Hinman violated the law by promoting Ether while having financial conflicts of interest. “Based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,” he had said. Outside groups, including Consumer Action for a Strong Economy (CASE), have continued to push the SEC to release the report. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton wrote, “TIME TO RELEASE THE REPORT @GaryGensler If we are going to move forward – we do so with complete TRANSPARENCY. If Gensler doesn’t release this report, Paul Atkins needs to do so immediately. @HesterPeirceand others should be calling for its release.” XRP vs SEC: The issue also revolves around a lawsuit filed on December 22, 2020, during the final days of the Trump administration. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and William Hinman, Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, sued Ripple Labs, its co-founder Chris Larsen, former CEO and executive chairman, and current CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The lawsuit accused them of selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP cryptocurrency as unregistered securities. Tristan Leavitt, in his 22-page letter, wrote how SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest felt SEC’s actions against XRP were problematic. Grundfest wrote to the SEC and said, “The staff has articulated no material distinction between the operation of Ether and of XRP that is relevant to the application of the federal securities laws. Imposing securities law obligations on XRP while leaving Ether untouched raises fundamental fairness questions about the exercise of Commission discretion Ether and XRP should be treated similarly.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ETH | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pressure-mounts-on-gensler-to-release-ig-report-as-new-letter-exposes-xrps-unfair-treatment-and-ethereums-free-pass/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

This notable surge in interest was shared on X by JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), a well-known figure in the XRP community. BREAKING: Google Searches for #XRP Explode! pic.twitter.com/3FOHSgPKzm — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 15, 2024 After years of struggling, XRP finally experienced a massive breakout, rising to its highest level since 2018. This drew significant interest from the crypto world and other mainstream spaces. However, this rise in popularity also coincided with the increasing anticipation surrounding RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. Ripple’s RLUSD Gains Traction RLUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, is a notable addition to the XRP ecosystem and has brought significant attention. RLUSD leverages the efficiency and scalability of Ripple’s technology to provide a reliable, decentralized stablecoin option. Interestingly, the surge in Google searches for XRP appears to correlate with increased interest in RLUSD. As the stablecoin gains visibility, it seems to positively impact XRP’s market presence, reinforcing Ripple’s ecosystem as a whole. This trend is expected to continue as RLUSD adoption rises, presenting new use cases for XRP and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Community Reaction JackTheRippler’s post garnered many positive responses. One community member predicted that XRP’s chart would soon mirror the Google search spike. Another stated that he would perform more searches to boost the digital asset. The spike has excited the community, and with the recent launch of RLUSD, it could rise even more. At press time, Google trends showed that XRP searches had dropped a bit, but there are still many reasons to be excited about the digital asset. What’s Next for XRP? The increased search activity reflects more than just curiosity. It signals rising interest in the XRP ecosystem as the company expands its influence in the financial sector. Ripple’s ongoing efforts to build partnerships and promote blockchain adoption are resonating with a wider audience, driving interest in its flagship assets, XRP and RLUSD. Moreover, the timing of this surge is noteworthy. XRP has been in the headlines recently because of various high-profile developments like the resignation of Gary Gensler , the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and multiple applications for XRP ETFs. At press time, XRP traded at $2.53, down 2.16% over the last 24 hours. There is much to be excited about in its immediate future, and the attention will only increase as the asset smashes through milestones.

37783318,https://crypto.news/?p=14320307,1734494375,Ohio lawmaker Derek Merrin introduces Bill to create state Bitcoin Reserve,"A proposed legislation in Ohio seeks to incorporate Bitcoin into its financial plan. Derek Merrin, the Leader of the Ohio House Republicans, introduced the bill. Derek Merrin, who was the former Mayor of Waterville, took to X to announce that House Bill 703, filed this week, would enable the state treasurer to invest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) in order to create an “Ohio Bitcoin Reserve” in the state treasury. His thought behind introducing the bill was that incorporating BTC into the state’s investment portfolio could help hedge against the slow erosion of the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar, thereby helping to retain the value of public funds across generations. You might also like: Bitget secures Bitcoin service provider license in El Salvador https://twitter.com/DerekMerrin/status/1869134602390122545 If passed, the proposed law will put Ohio on the map for government crypto adoption by giving the treasurer the authority and flexibility to invest in BTC. Advocates like Cynthia Lummis argue that with BTC gaining acceptance as a form of payment by large businesses and even government agencies in some instances, including it in state reserves would enhance a state’s financial strength. Further, this could push forward more corporate adoption for digital assets, legitimizing its position in global finance, according to Matthew Sigel, who heads the Digital Assets Research wing of VanEck .

Most of Ohio’s debt consists of general obligation bonds and special obligation bonds issued to fund infrastructure projects, education, and other public projects. As a result, if Ohio can now add BTC to its treasury reserves, the state would likely improve its long-term financial solvency. In time, such a strategy could brighten Ohio’s fiscal picture, easing the pressure to raise taxes or cut services and putting the state in a much better position to fulfill such obligations.

Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal confirmed this in an X post : We’ve filed our response to BiT Global’s effort to stop our delisting of wBTC before any discovery or even formal response to their bogus claims. We explain why this lawsuit lacks merit and why their request for a TRO should be denied. ~ Paul Grewal The legal debacle occurred during transition maintenance for wBTC from BitGo to BiT Global and its Singaporean satellite. In August, BitGo stated that, in a bid to enhance the resilience of its protocol, it was sharing two of the three wBTC keys with those two firms. Coinbase acted on the concerns of crypto players BiT Global argued in its submission that Coinbase is simply promoting a rival tokenized Bitcoin product, cbBTC. They claimed Coinbase has resorted to defamatory remarks to instil fear and doubt about wBTC’s regulatory position and stability. However, Coinbase has maintained that their reaction comes from the concerns of the users. Mr. Sun has had regulatory issues and has been accused of market manipulation. This has contributed to Coinbase taking relevant measures. Under the arrangement between BitGo and BiT Global’s two entities, BitGo will be in charge of operations, as the two BiT Global firms hold collaterals for wBTC. BiT Global accuses Coinbase of violating federal laws over wBTC delisting Coinbase has stated that BiT Global wants to force it into business with an entity that is non-compliant with its standards due to Mr Sun’s material involvement.

37782651,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627028,1734492600,Solana (SOL) Races Ahead While Lightchain AI Redefines Blockchain Speed,"In the fast-evolving blockchain world, where speed and scalability define success, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is making waves with a unique approach. Combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, Lightchain AI aims to revolutionize how speed, scalability, and real-world utility coexist. And now, with the Lightchain AI Presale underway, it’s the perfect time to explore why this platform is a game-changer. While Solana (SOL) has gained recognition for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees, Lightchain AI is taking a different path. Instead of simply chasing throughput, it integrates AI-driven features to enhance scalability, security, and usability. Solana may dominate the race for speed, but Lightchain AI is redefining what it means to cross the finish line in the blockchain space. The Allure of Solana: A Blockchain Built for Speed Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network Solana’s architecture, built around Proof of History (PoH), allows it to process up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), significantly surpassing many other blockchain platforms. With transaction fees typically under $0.01, Solana has become an appealing choice for both developers and users. Its core advantages include efficient scalability, enabling support for a wide range of applications from DeFi to gaming, a developer-friendly ecosystem that attracts innovative projects with its growing set of tools and resources, and cost-effectiveness, making it ideal for microtransactions and dApps. Challenges Under the Hood Despite its impressive performance, Solana faces several challenges. Its network downtime has been a recurring issue, raising concerns about reliability. Additionally, critics point to centralization concerns, arguing that its validator structure leans more centralized, potentially conflicting with the decentralized principles of blockchain. Moreover, while Solana excels in speed, it lacks the advanced functionalities required for AI-driven or industry-specific applications, which limits its broader use case potential. Lightchain AI: Transforming Speed into Smart Efficiency A New Breed of Blockchain While Solana focuses on transaction volume, Lightchain AI’s AI-enhanced blockchain takes a more holistic approach. The platform introduces cutting-edge innovations like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) to not only deliver speed but also integrate real-world intelligence into its core operations. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out: Intelligent Consensus: PoI rewards nodes for meaningful computations, transforming validation processes into productive AI tasks. Adaptability: AIVM’s architecture dynamically scales resources based on workload demand, ensuring consistent performance. Broad Applicability: From healthcare to predictive analytics, Lightchain AI caters to a diverse range of industries. A Tale of Two Titans: Solana vs. Lightchain AI Transaction Throughput vs. AI Integration While Solana dominates transaction speeds, Lightchain AI introduces capabilities that Solana’s architecture cannot match: PoH vs. PoI: Solana’s Proof of History timestamps transactions for speed, while Lightchain AI’s Proof of Intelligence utilizes AI-driven computations for validation, merging utility with consensus. Static vs. Dynamic Processing: Solana excels in high-speed transactions but lacks the adaptability of Lightchain AI’s resource allocation. Scalability Without Compromise Solana’s scalability is often hampered during network congestion, a challenge Lightchain AI addresses through: Parallel Processing: Tasks are distributed across multiple nodes to maintain high throughput. Dynamic Resource Allocation: Lightchain AI optimizes computational power based on real-time demand, avoiding bottlenecks. Lightchain AI in Action: Real-World Applications 1. AI-Powered DeFi Innovation Lightchain AI enhances decentralized finance ( DeFi ) with predictive models that: Optimize Risk Assessment: Real-time analytics improve lending and trading protocols. Enable Smarter Investments: AI tools offer insights for yield farming and portfolio management. 2. Intelligent NFTs Lightchain AI is pushing the boundaries of non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) by: Creating Adaptive Assets: NFTs evolve based on user behavior or real-world events. Integrating AI Features: Supports interactive collectibles for gaming and art. 3. Healthcare and Logistics From diagnosing diseases to improving supply chains, Lightchain AI’s AIVM is a game-changer: Medical Insights: AI enhances imaging analysis and predictive healthcare models. Transparent Supply Chains: Improves efficiency and accountability through data-driven tracking. The Future of Blockchain: Lightchain AI’s Vision Lightchain AI goes beyond traditional metrics of blockchain success by introducing AI-enhanced capabilities that redefine what’s possible. Its ability to combine speed, precision, and adaptability makes it a trailblazer in the blockchain revolution. What Sets Lightchain AI Apart: Real-World Impact: Industry-specific applications that solve tangible problems. Sustainability: Energy-efficient mechanisms reduce the environmental footprint. AI-Powered Solutions: Tools and features that extend beyond financial applications. Join the Lightchain AI Revolution The Lightchain AI Presale: Now is the time to join Lightchain AI’s transformative ecosystem. By participating in the presale , you gain early access to an innovative platform with groundbreaking potential. How to Participate: Visit the Lightchain AI website for presale access. Connect your wallet (ETH or USDT supported) to secure LCAI tokens. Stay updated through the Telegram group and Twitter/X . Conclusion: Solana or Lightchain AI? While Solana races ahead with its unparalleled transaction speeds, Lightchain AI redefines blockchain capabilities by integrating AI and delivering adaptable, intelligent solutions. Both platforms play pivotal roles in advancing blockchain technology, but Lightchain AI’s broader applications and innovative architecture make it a standout in the industry. As blockchain continues to evolve, the race isn’t just about speed—it’s about meaningful innovation.

However, XRP has hit reverse after touching $2.71 and is now trading at $2.55 level. XRP has strong support near the $2.40 levels and currently, the market is moving in the right direction and may rise slightly higher. A micro support region has been established between $2.55 and $2.62, though there is no immediate expectation for this level to be tested. The third wave is still unfolding, with a 100% extension reached. The ideal target for this third wave is around $2.81, but support should ideally remain above the current levels. Anything below this would be considered a deeper pullback, but still within the range of micro structures. The third wave is expected to extend higher, followed by waves 4 and 5, which could push XRP to retest its all-time high. However, the structure is currently fragile, and while the price movement is not as impulsive as previous rallies, support levels are holding firm. Breakout to $3.80 on Cards? According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP has solid support around $2, where previous resistance is now acting as support. There haven’t been significant changes for XRP recently, but in the short term, the price is continuing its bullish breakout from a bull flag pattern. This breakout started a few days ago, and now we are seeing stronger bullish momentum. XRP has recently made new higher highs, confirming the breakout. This is a positive price structure, with higher highs and higher lows forming. The price target for this bullish flag breakout is around $3.80, which represents a potential 40% to 60% move up from the breakout point.

It’s not just about a token; it’s about risk, reputation, and trust in the crypto ecosystem. Sun affiliated BiT Global filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and they have submitted a response to it. BiT Global isn’t happy with the delisting. They’ve accused Coinbase of damaging their reputation and profits. Meanwhile, the exchange has made it clear: their priority is user safety, not BiT’s business interests. What’s About wBTC Delisting? Coinbase decided to drop wBTC from its listings after discovering BiT Global now controls the token. What is the problem with that? Well, BiT Global is tied to Justin Sun and he has faced allegations of fraud, market manipulation, and is even under investigation by the FBI. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, addressed the situation directly in a tweet. He called BiT’s claims “baseless” and reaffirmed the commitment of the exchange to protect its platform and users. Source : X.com For Coinbase, this connection was a red flag. They use strict reviews to make sure all listed assets meet their safety and integrity standards. To them, wBTC no longer made the cut. But BiT Global claims this move hurts them and wBTC users worldwide. They’ve gone to court to stop the delisting, asking for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). Coinbase’s Defense: Facts Over Fears Coinbase’s legal team isn’t holding back. In their response , they pointed out that BiT delayed filing the TRO until days before wBTC’s delisting. If it was so urgent, why wait? They also argued that the delisting wouldn’t make much of a dent. Less than 1% of global wBTC trading happens on Coinbase. So even if they delist it, the impact on the market is tiny. And the bigger issue? Reputation. According to Coinbase, any damage to wBTC’s trust didn’t start with their decision. It started with Justin Sun’s history. Legally, Coinbase stood firm. They said platforms have the right to decide what assets they list. No one can force them to list something they believe puts users at risk. What Comes Next? The case is heading to court on December 18, 2024. Coinbase seems confident in their stance, and they’re sticking to their decision. For BiT Global, this is a tough fight—they’ll need to prove their claims hold water. The outcome could change how crypto platforms handle delistings in the future. But for now, Coinbase has one focus: protecting their platform and the people who use it. This isn’t just another crypto dispute. It’s about setting standards for safety and trust in an unpredictable industry.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bit-global-vs-coinbase-whats-the-truth-behind-the-lawsuit/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Solana Realized Cap Growth Has Slowed Down Recently In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about how the recent performance of Solana has stacked up against the two largest coins in the sector. “Looking at price performance, SOL outpaced both ETH and BTC for most of Q4 2024,” notes the analytics firm. “However, since early December, ETH has taken the lead, outperforming the other two assets.” As it stands right now, Bitcoin is up around 18% over the past month, Ethereum 28%, and Solana 3%. Thus, SOL has clearly fallen off after being the market leader just earlier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Here? What Historical HODLer Selloff Pattern Says What could be behind this shift in the market? The answer to the question could lie in the capital flows that these cryptocurrencies have recently been observing. In order to estimate the capital flows for the assets, Glassnode has made use of the Realized Cap indicator. The “Realized Cap” refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of any digital asset by assuming that the ‘real’ value of any token in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Since the last transfer for any coin is likely to represent the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered its cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap is a sum of the cost basis of all coins in the circulating supply or, more simply, a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In this view, changes in the Realized Cap essentially reflect the amount of capital that’s exiting out of or entering into the asset. Below is the chart for the 7-day change in the indicator shared by the analytics firm, which showcases these outflows/inflows happening for Solana and others. From the chart, it’s visible that the 7-day change in the Realized Cap was at notable positive levels between September and early December. Bitcoin and Ethereum also observed capital inflows in this period, but SOL was simply growing at a significantly faster pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Now In Selling Mode For A Year: Should You Be Concerned? This month, though, the sector has seen a flip as both Bitcoin and Ethereum have pulled ahead of Solana. The earlier higher capital inflows were likely the drivers behind SOL’s outperformance, so with them gone, it makes sense that the top two assets would take over. SOL Price Whereas Bitcoin and Ethereum have enjoyed a surge over the last few days, Solana has been moving in a sideways trajectory as its price is still trading around $221.

37781309,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374999,1734490299,"Ethena Labs Launches USDtb, Backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund","Ethena Labs officially launched USDtb, a new stablecoin backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), on December 16th. Developed in partnership with Securitize, USDtb is designed to operate like existing fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, with reserves invested in cash or cash-equivalent assets to maintain a 1:1 value ratio. USDtb Debuts According to the official blog post , the stablecoin’s primary reserve asset, BUIDL, makes up 90% of USDtb’s overall backing, positioning it as the highest BUIDL-backed stablecoin to date. USDtb is independent of Ethena’s USDe, thereby providing users with an alternative stablecoin offering a distinct risk profile. Additionally, USDtb is expected to improve USDe’s resilience in volatile market conditions by potentially serving as a backup asset during periods of negative funding rates. The product has passed extensive audits from leading security firms such as Code4rena, Quantstamp, Cyfrin, and Pashov. It is being considered for inclusion in Spark’s $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. Ethena has tapped Copper, Zodia Custody, Komainu, and Coinbase Institutional to serve as custodians for its newly launched USDtb stablecoin. The token’s liquidity will be supported by major providers, including Jump, Cumberland, Amber Group, GSR Markets, and SCB Limited. USDtb’s Impact on Ethena’s Stablecoin Ecosystem José Maria Macedo, co-founder of blockchain research and development firm Delphi Labs, predicts that USDtb will become the largest on-chain tokenized treasury product within a month of its launch. Highlighting the significance for Ethena, Macedo noted that USDtb not only provides a “lower-risk” yield-bearing stablecoin option but also strengthens Ethena’s existing USDe stablecoin. The exec even went on to say that during periods when funding rates fall below treasury rates, Ethena can close out hedging positions and reallocate assets to USDtb. This approach reduces USDe’s exposure to negative funding rate concerns while ensuring that its floor yield matches the treasury rate. Meanwhile, Seraphim Czecker, Ethena’s head of growth, spoke about the impact of USDtb on Ethena’s operations, particularly in bearish market conditions. He explained that prolonged periods of negative funding rates no longer pose a threat to Ethena, as the platform can now allocate capital to its own real-world asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb. This effectively establishes a yield “floor” tied to the T-Bill rate, ensuring a stable APY even in unfavorable market environments. Czecker further highlighted USDtb’s scalability, noting its potential to exceed $100 billion in total value locked (TVL).

Trump Patriot (TRUMPPAT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPPAT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Patriot can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Patriot could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Patriot launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Patriot on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Patriot by entering its contract address – 9hmvtogFEjzZQMFfJ5Hiq7fQSq7E38mG3Qjb7X42qM6P – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPPAT.

With over 10,300 token holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold, Qubetics is quickly proving itself as one of the best coins to invest in today. At the same time, Litecoin’s growing network strength and Fantom’s upcoming major upgrade are catching the attention of savvy investors. Qubetics is not just about hype; it brings real-world solutions where older platforms fell short. Its 13th presale stage is making waves with solid numbers, a 10% price increase every week, and the potential for massive gains.

Its multi-chain Qubetics Wallet combines convenience and innovation, making it easier than ever to manage digital assets across devices like iOS, Android, and desktops.

For example, a freelancer working with international clients can receive payments in $TICS tokens, which are automatically converted to stablecoins like USDT or USDC during transactions. This ensures stability for both parties, even as markets shift. Small businesses can also streamline cross-border payments without relying on outdated banking systems. Another standout feature is Qubetics’ virtual and physical debit card integration with Visa and Mastercard. Whether it’s paying for groceries, buying digital subscriptions, or making big-ticket purchases, users can connect Qubetics Wallet to Apple Pay or Google Pay, bridging the gap between traditional payments and crypto.

If you want to know more about this project, take a look at this video here . Litecoin Strengthens Its Network and Hash Rate Litecoin (LTC) has been making strong moves lately. In the past month, its price surged by over 50%, bringing renewed investor confidence and pushing the number of wallets in profit to a two-year high. This upward momentum reflects growing trust in Litecoin as a reliable alternative to Bitcoin. Litecoin’s network security is also at its strongest point ever. The hash rate—a key measure of computational power protecting the network—recently hit an all-time high of 1.74 PH/s. This 50% increase shows rising participation from miners, solidifying Litecoin’s resilience and long-term sustainability. However, analysts caution traders to watch for technical patterns, like the “inverse cup and handle,” which could signal short-term pullbacks. Despite this, Litecoin’s fundamentals remain strong, with its growing adoption and robust network positioning it as a staple in the crypto market. Fantom Set to Rebrand with Sonic Upgrade and Faster Speeds Fantom (FTM) is gearing up for a game-changing upgrade with its transition to the Sonic mainnet. This upgrade aims to boost transaction speeds, reduce fees, and improve overall scalability, making Fantom a go-to platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. Ahead of this upgrade, Fantom saw a 16% price surge, indicating strong market excitement. Analysts note that technical indicators, like the MACD bullish crossover, suggest further gains may be on the horizon. The Sonic upgrade is particularly significant because it enhances Fantom’s ability to handle more transactions at lower costs—key factors for attracting developers and new projects. For users, this upgrade means faster, cheaper transactions, positioning Fantom as one of the most efficient platforms in the DeFi space. By addressing previous scalability concerns, Fantom is set to compete with leading Layer-1 solutions. Conclusion Qubetics, Litecoin, and Fantom are showing impressive developments that make them stand out as some of the best coins to invest in today. Qubetics’ presale success, with over 10,300 holders and 350 million $TICS tokens sold , offers investors a unique opportunity with real-world solutions and massive growth potential. Litecoin’s strengthened network security and rising hash rate highlight its reliability, while Fantom’s Sonic upgrade promises faster transactions and lower fees. Each of these projects is building momentum for the future, making them strong contenders for anyone seeking long-term gains.

One minute, they’re trending, and the next, they’re surging in price. The meme coin space is as fast-moving as a TikTok trend, and if you’re not careful, you could miss out on the next big thing. Lucky for you, we’re here to make sure that doesn’t happen. Whether you’re looking for the best meme coins to buy now or just trying to keep up with the latest movements in the meme coin world, we’ve got the lowdown on three big players: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme. Just this week, BTFD Coin hit a major PR milestone, racking up over $4.1 million in presale funds. At a presale price of $0.00013, it’s safe to say that investors are paying attention. And who can blame them? This meme coin isn’t just meme-driven; it has real utility with its upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a community-first mentality. Let’s take a deeper dive into these three coins and find out which one’s the best fit for your portfolio. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin With Serious Potential If you’re even remotely plugged into the meme coin scene, you’ve probably seen this one popping up everywhere. It’s got the hype, the community, and the momentum to make a serious play in 2025. The BTFD Coin presale is absolutely crushing it, and with over $4.1 million raised, it’s clear that investors are getting in on the ground floor. Now, let’s look at what $8,000 could do for you. At today’s presale price of $0.00013, $8,000 would buy you a whopping 61,538,462 coins. That’s a lot of tokens for a relatively low price. And if the coin even hits a modest target of $0.0006 (still super conservative), your $8,000 investment could shoot up to $36,923. That’s a return of over 460%, just from holding for a few months. Of course, with the P2E game and staking rewards , the upside is even greater. So yeah, if you’re wondering which of the best meme coins to buy now, BTFD Coin is certainly one to watch. Notcoin: Earn Rewards, No Staking Required Next up, we’ve got Notcoin, the meme coin that’s shaking things up in the TON ecosystem. If you’re into Telegram and its growing influence on Web3, then Notcoin might be your next big move. They’ve recently launched their Earn programme, a game-changing initiative that lets users earn rewards just by holding TON-based tokens in their Telegram wallet—no complex staking required. This new twist makes it super easy to earn passive rewards without all the hoops and hurdles usually associated with staking. The Earn program essentially works like a launchpool, rewarding holders of Notcoin and other TON-based tokens by giving them access to airdrops. Think of it like a rewards buffet, where all you have to do is be active and hold the right tokens. Users can earn rewards hourly and even participate in exclusive pools like the Gold, Platinum, and Early Notcoin Staker groups for extra bonuses. For meme coin enthusiasts looking for a way to earn while they sleep, Notcoin’s Earn programme is a no-brainer. Book of Meme: A Surge of Hope for 2025 Now let’s talk about Book of Meme, which has been turning heads lately. This coin has all the potential to skyrocket, with predictions pointing to a $0.04 surge in 2025. Yep, you read that right. If Book of Meme can hit that target, early investors are looking at some serious returns. For reference, it’s trading at $0.008 now, so, yes, that’s a major upside we’re talking about! But what makes Book of Meme stand out? It’s not just about the meme—it’s about the community and the culture behind it. With its solid growth and the influence of meme culture, Book of Meme is one of those coins that could go from zero to hero in a matter of months. Wrap It Up: Which Meme Coin Is Right for You? So, what’s the verdict? When it comes to the best meme coins to buy now, there’s a lot to consider, but the combination of community, utility, and growth potential is key. If you’re after serious growth, BTFD Coin is the frontrunner right now. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and bullish momentum, it’s an entire ecosystem in the making. But hey, if you’re looking for something a bit more passive with rewards, Notcoin’s Earn programme could be just the ticket.

37781231,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52438,1734487248,"Dogecoin Price Is Replicating 2021 Pattern That Led To 36,000%, Why You Should Buy This Rival For 70,000% Rally In 18 Days","Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has revealed a bullish 2021 pattern that has formed for the Dogecoin price, which could lead to a parabolic rally. This development provides a bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, which is currently consolidating. However, rival token ETFSwap (ETFS) provides a better opportunity for investors as it will enjoy a 70,000% rally in 18 days. Dogecoin Price Could Replicate 2021 Bull Pattern In an X post , Trader Tardigrade raised the possibility of the Dogecoin price replicating a bullish pattern from the 2021 market cycle. This bullish pattern led to a 30,000% surge in the Dogecoin price back then, suggesting that DOGE could again enjoy such price gains in this market cycle. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price could reach as high as $16 if it replicates the 2021 bull pattern. The chart also showed that the Dogecoin price surge to $16 could happen sometime next year. However, despite this bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, it looks almost impossible for DOGE to reach this target based on its circulating supply. A Dogecoin price surge to $16 will give DOGE a market cap of $2.3 trillion, which is almost impossible at the moment, considering that the crypto market is just valued at over $2 trillion. Why Investors Should Buy ETFSwap (ETFS) Which Will Rally 70,000% Investors are better off buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token, which will rally 70,000% in 18 days. This bullish outlook for the token stems from its incredible utility, which is already gaining much attention. ETFS is the native token of the ETFSwap platform, which tokenizes exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and enables them to be traded on-chain. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides an easier and more convenient way to trade these traditional assets since investors simply need to convert the token for their desired ETF. This explains why traditional finance (TradFi) investors have been looking to purchase as many coins as possible since ETFS got listed on the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX). The massive demand for the token so far will contribute to the projected 70,000% rally in 18 days. This is why investors who have yet to invest need to hurry and buy as many coins as possible to position for this price surge. ETFSwap’s (ETFS) other use cases prove that the token can indeed witness this parabolic rally. The ETFSwap (ETFS) token provides access to crypto assets and other commodities on the ETFSwap platform including gold, silver, rubber, cotton, and crude oil, among others. Users will simply swap the token for their desired asset. This makes portfolio diversification much easier as investors will now be able to gain access to several asset classes in one place. As such, it is best to get ahead of these investors and accumulate as many coins as possible. The ETFS token is deflationary , which is another reason it could easily rally by 70,000% and outperform the Dogecoin price. The ETFSwap (ETFS) team has committed to burning some of the fees earned on the DeFi platform to buy back and burn as many ETFS tokens as possible. This deflationary mechanism makes it easier for the ETFSwap (ETFS) price to surge, especially considering the massive demand that the token is already witnessing. Conclusion The ETFSwap (ETFS) token is set to be listed on major exchanges in the coming weeks. It is best to front-run these listings as the 70,000% rally could begin as soon as these exchanges ETFS. Moreover, these exchanges will begin to accumulate ETFS ahead of the listing, so it is best to hurry and accumulate the coin. Buying the ETFSwap (ETFS) token means that you get to enjoy as much as a 700x return on investment (ROI). This is definitely an opportunity to make life-changing gains and one you shouldn’t pass on in this bull run.

37779826,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663818,1734487224,Bitwise Exec Reveals His Personal Top 3 Crypto Predictions For 2025,"In a post on X dated December 17, 2024, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, shared his personal top three predictions for the crypto sector in 2025. His insights come at a time when the crypto market has experienced significant growth, and after Bitwise released its annual top 10 crypto predictions for the next year. #1 Bitcoin Structured Products Surge Park predicts that by 2025, Bitcoin structured products will see an asset influx of at least $5 billion. He states, “The cold, hard truth is that most private wealth managers and institutions remain hesitant about taking on directional Bitcoin exposure.” Related Reading: Crypto Watchlist: Top 5 Coins To Watch This Week He elaborates that products like buffered notes and principal-protection ETFs will be pivotal in bridging this gap, offering tailored exposure to Bitcoin’s volatility to meet institutional preferences. “I predict that buffered notes, principal-protection ETFs, and similar instruments will unlock a floodgate of new demand, giving institutions access to Bitcoin’s volatility at the price they deserve, customized to their own preferences,” Park remarks. #2 Maple Finance Outpaces BlackRock’s BUIDL With a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $535 million as of his writing, Park believes Maple Finance will surpass BlackRock’s BUIDL project. He argues, “I hold an unapologetic view that decentralized markets, which enable novel financial primitives, will see adoption faster than ‘security tokenization’ projects retrofitting to legacy infrastructure.” Park sees decentralized lending platforms like Maple Finance, which provide institutional-grade services, as the category winners in the near future, potentially aided by favorable regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration. “Institutional-grade, crypto-asset-backed decentralized lending like Maple Finance remains the most promising near-term category winner, bolstered by potential regulatory tailwinds,” Park forecasts. #3 Emergence Of A New Decentralized Crypto Stablecoin Despite past failures like LUNA, Park anticipates the rise of a new decentralized stablecoin backed by a decentralized strategic reserve. He asserts, “Bitcoin’s role as a reserve asset is now undeniable, spanning corporate balance sheets to nation-states,” but emphasizes the crypto community’s desire for a reserve that is “decentralized free from sovereign whims at all costs.” Related Reading: Crypto Market Hit Hard With $1.7 Billion Liquidated, Largest Event Since 2021 The new stablecoin, he predicts, will leverage heightened transparency and cryptographic proofs, aiming to restore trust and utility in decentralized finance. “Despite the scars left by LUNA, I predict a more robust effort will rise, built with heightened transparency and leveraging the long-awaited arrival of cryptographic proofs. I have some exemplary candidates in mind that can and will lead the way,” he states. These predictions by Park come after the predictions from Bitwise for 2025. The firm has projected Bitcoin to exceed $200,000, driven by institutional investment and ETF inflows. Ethereum and Solana are also expected to reach new all-time highs, further solidifying the growth narrative in the crypto space. Additionally, Bitwise sees 2025 as potentially becoming the “Year of the Crypto IPO,” with several crypto unicorns expected to go public in the US. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $106,794.

37779916,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=629383,1734487002,Gutting Satoshi — How Bitcoin can be taxed at 110% in Japan,"Bitcoin in Japan can sometimes be taxed at more than its own value, leaving heirs and sellers of crypto worse off than they started. A new report from Nikkei details how BTC can sometimes be taxed at as much as 110%, as industry leaders and crypto advocates on the archipelago scramble desperately to get the government’s greasy fingers out of Satoshi’s wallet. According to Microstrategy’s Michael Saylor, it’s only “ paranoid crypto-anarchists ” who are worried about keeping bitcoin and government separate, or being able to use crypto non-custodially and permissionlessly. But for the Japanese, holding bitcoin and other crypto assets has now become a huge liability — thanks solely to the state. If we consult the creator of bitcoin themselves, Satoshi Nakamoto, we see that the whole project was always meant to be electronic cash that doesn’t require a financial institution or third party; this is something now coming to bitter remembrance for those Japanese who had wished for the state to get more involved. How Bitcoin can be taxed at over 100% in Japan Of course there is debate about taxation in pretty much every country. And when it comes down to brass tacks, there is no getting around that it is money taken (usually without one’s express consent) under threat of force, and then spent on whatever the strangers in political office far away want to spend it on. Like it or not, it’s theft. Still, to avoid being caged, most people understandably pay the extortion fees out of self-preservation. But in Japan, things are getting out of control for even the most happily obedient normie. While the leader of the Democratic Party for the People (DPP), Yuichiro Tamaki, has been fighting alongside industry groups to get a separate 20% tax for crypto in place, the country’s new prime minister seems uninterested. PM Shigeru Ishiba recently went so far as to publicly doubt the legitimacy of bitcoin as an asset and to imply that tax reform would be promoting a scam to the public. So the possibility of being taxed at up to 55% on gains in Japan remains in place. But the nightmare doesn’t end there. Enter: the inheritance tax. A new report from Japanese financial media outlet Nikkei details how in some cases, people might be taxed for even more bitcoin value than they got in the first place. The December 18 piece describes how the inheritance tax, combined with other taxes, could result in someone being taxed at 110%. Here’s the hypothetical breakdown: Someone buys 100 BTC in December 2014 (worth 4.6 million JPY). They die in December 2024, leaving the BTC (now valued at 1.437 billion JPY) to their child. The child must pay an inheritance tax maxed out at 55%. The heir then sells the BTC upon inheriting it, and must pay taxes on gains, with the acquisition price still being the original 4.6 million yen. Combine the two 55% taxes and others (inheritance tax, income tax, and local resident tax) and the child is now taxed at a rate higher than the value of the asset itself, or 110%. The article goes on to note that even in cases where less value is involved, rates can still reach 100%, and details that even small gains in crypto can end up being taxed at rates higher than those of stocks. “Even if the profit from selling virtual currency is small, there are many cases where the tax rate is higher than stocks,” the article by Tomoko Ōga states. “If the income amount subject to comprehensive taxation is 3.3 million yen or more but less than 6.95 million yen, the maximum income tax rate is 20% and the local resident tax is 10%, which is higher than the total of 20% for separate declaration taxation.” Perhaps there was something to that permissionless exchange thing after all, but each day the state gets more involved, the very real stakes and threats of punishment are jacked up higher and higher. Thankfully, this results in even more innovation and development of efficient P2P (peer-to-peer) protocols so peaceful people can use their money freely and efficiently, without having to be extorted of their inheritance or pay for war. But then again, maybe they are just being paranoid.

Musk Loves Bitcoin (MUSKBTC), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKBTC is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Loves Bitcoin can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves Bitcoin could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves Bitcoin launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves Bitcoin on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves Bitcoin by entering its contract address – 35GthqqwTd9HokNVfUzGpjsALCJbeUXXeKeJcrPCZsJB – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKBTC.

From Trump’s speech to ETFs and MicroStrategy’s massive buys, could a major institutional supply squeeze be underway? Table of Contents Bitcoin soars to new highs Institutional powerplay Macroeconomic crosswinds What do experts think? Bitcoin soars to new highs Bitcoin ( BTC ) has once again stolen the spotlight. On Dec. 17, BTC climbed to an all-time high of $108,260, pushing its post-U.S. election gains to over 50%. As of this writing. 17, it is trading around $106,663 levels. BTC 5-month price chart | Source: crypto.news BTC’s rally follows President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal to establish a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve, a concept that has sparked widespread excitement across markets. Trump’s announcement, made during his speech at the New York Stock Exchange on December 12, aims to position the U.S. ahead of global competitors in the digital asset space. He pointed to the need for America to “do something great with crypto” and to build reserves similar to its existing strategic oil stockpile. The idea of a Bitcoin reserve isn’t entirely new. It was first introduced through the BITCOIN Act, championed by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, which envisions the U.S. acquiring 1 million BTC over the next five years to help address the growing $35 trillion national debt. Another major factor driving this surge has been institutional activity, particularly from MicroStrategy, a firm synonymous with aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. In the past week alone, MicroStrategy announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC at an average price of $100,386 per coin. This recent acquisition brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 439,000 BTC, valued at around $47 billion. The company’s Bitcoin strategy has paid off immensely, catapulting its market cap from $1.1 billion in 2020 to nearly $100 billion today. Moreover, MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, effective next week, is also expected to boost further demand for its stock as funds and ETFs rebalance their portfolios. Meanwhile, Ethereum ( ETH ) hasn’t been left behind in this crypto frenzy. After a period of stagnation, ETH showed strong signs of life, climbing to a seven-day high of $4,106 on December 16—a 6% weekly gain. While Ethereum has faced some minor retracement due to profit booking, it remains steady around the $3,950 mark as of this writing. ETH 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Let’s dive deeper into the key developments driving Bitcoin and Ethereum, analyze the macroeconomic indicators shaping this bull run, and see what experts believe could happen in the days to come. Institutional powerplay Bitcoin and Ethereum are both showing strong momentum, but the underlying story becomes clearer when we look at ETF inflows, liquidations, and futures open interest. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been on a tear this month. Since December began, they’ve seen consistent inflows every single day, adding over $5.16 billion as of Dec. 16. These inflows have pushed the total assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs to $123 billion — a strong signal of confidence, especially from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs, however, tell a different story. Between their launch on Jul. 23 and Dec. 3, inflows were modest, reaching just $733.6 million. Compared to Bitcoin’s performance, this figure looks miniscule. But momentum has clearly shifted. Since Dec. 4, Ethereum ETFs have seen consistent inflows, adding $1.58 billion in a matter of days, suggesting that investors are warming up to Ethereum, likely encouraged by its price performance and Bitcoin’s strong market lead. Liquidation data adds more context to what’s happening in the market. Over the last 24 hours, as of Dec. 17, $339 million worth of positions were liquidated across the crypto market, with $205 million in longs and $134 million in shorts wiped out. 24-hour liquidation heatmap | Source: CoinGlass For Bitcoin, total liquidations have been around $60 million, with short positions making up the majority at $30 million, compared to $29 million from longs, suggesting that many traders betting against Bitcoin’s rally were forced out of their positions as BTC climbed past $108,000. Ethereum saw even heavier liquidations, totaling $78.5 million, with shorts again taking a larger hit at $52 million, again reflecting how ETH’s recent price push to $4,100 surprised many bearish traders. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s futures open interest — the total value of outstanding futures contracts — has seen monumental growth . Back in early October, open interest sat at $32 billion. Following Trump’s election victory and the resulting bullish sentiment, that figure grew rapidly, reaching $55 billion by mid-November. Since then, open interest has continued to climb, hitting a massive $70 billion as of December 17. Rising open interest paired with increasing prices is a bullish signal, as it shows new money flowing into the market and traders placing bets on further upside. Put simply, Bitcoin’s rally isn’t running on fumes. ETF inflows are strong, futures activity is rising, and short sellers are being squeezed out of their positions. Ethereum, while slower to catch up, is now benefiting from the same momentum, with growing ETF inflows and shorts being liquidated. Both assets appear to have solid footing for their current uptrends, with institutional money and futures markets aligning to paint a bullish picture. Macroeconomic crosswinds The broader macroeconomic environment is currently a mixed bag, with a weakening U.S. Dollar, rate cut expectations, and political turbulence in Europe creating uncertainty across global markets. The USD, which had been gaining strength for a while, is now stalling. The November Retail Sales figure came in at 0.7%, beating expectations of 0.5%, but it wasn’t enough to inspire confidence . Excluding cars and transportation, growth was a weak 0.2%, below the forecasted 0.4%. Add to that the downward revisions for previous months, and it suggests consumer spending — the engine of the U.S. economy — is slowing. This ties directly to the Federal Reserve. The market expects a 25-basis-point rate cut on Dec. 18 with almost certainty. However, the Fed’s tone has been cautious about 2025. Expectations of aggressive rate cuts in the future are being dialed back, which has kept the Dollar from falling further. A stronger Dollar generally puts downward pressure on riskier assets, including Bitcoin, because investors often see USD as a safer bet. But now that the Dollar’s rally is pausing, it gives crypto some breathing room. At the same time, U.S. industrial production contracted by 0.1% in November when analysts expected growth of 0.3%, which signals that certain sectors of the economy are struggling. Combine that with sluggish equity markets — Asian and European stocks are down, and U.S. futures are sliding by around 1% — and we see a general lack of enthusiasm for traditional investments. Historically, when traditional assets underperform, and inflation remains under control, capital starts flowing into alternatives like Bitcoin. However, an overall bearish outlook can add choppiness and halt the bullish sentiments. Meanwhile, political instability in Germany — where Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a confidence vote — and lingering economic troubles in France are weakening the Euro. Since the Euro makes up 58% of the U.S. Dollar Index, this directly supports the Dollar. However, global uncertainty often drives investors to look for assets that are independent of governments and central banks, like Bitcoin. Amid this, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield has pulled back slightly to 4.38%, down from its recent high of 4.43%. If yields continue to fall and rate cuts accelerate, it becomes cheaper to borrow money, and investors will start looking for higher returns elsewhere. Bitcoin and Ethereum could likely benefit in these scenarios because they’re seen as high-return alternatives, especially when confidence in traditional markets is shaky. However, nothing is guaranteed. What do experts think? The ongoing Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies are creating the kind of setup that has historically led to explosive price movements. While the momentum is strong, there are signals investors should watch closely. One of the most key observations is Bitcoin’s tightening supply dynamics. As Quinten pointed out, “BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply,” — a clear indication that institutional investors are snapping up Bitcoin faster than it can be mined. BlackRock eating up 9x daily mining supply Supply shock incoming and normies still sleeping Institutional FOMO just starting — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 17, 2024 With spot Bitcoin ETFs now giving institutions easy access to BTC, the supply shock narrative is gaining traction. If institutions continue to accumulate at this rate, a supply squeeze could amplify BTC’s next leg up. Meanwhile, Ethereum is showing its own signs of structural strength. According to Ali Martinez, in previous bull cycles, Ethereum’s parabolic runs occurred when long-term holders shifted from the belief phase into “greed mode.” In the past two bull cycles, #Ethereum $ETH went parabolic when long-term holders shifted into greed mode. Right now, they’re only in the early stages of the belief phase. The big move could still be ahead! pic.twitter.com/warxPOlSFj — Ali (@ali_charts) December 17, 2024 Right now, Ethereum is still in the early stages of belief, suggesting that the big move for ETH may still be ahead, aligning with Ethereum’s recent price performance, as it quietly climbed toward $4,000 after months of stagnation. Adding to this picture is Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio — a widely followed valuation tool. The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market value (its current market cap) to its realized value (average acquisition price based on on-chain data). Historical patterns show that BTC’s MVRV ratio peaked at 4.7x in 2017 and 4x in 2021. As Presto Research outlines , applying a conservative 3.5x multiple to Bitcoin’s projected realized value of $1.2 trillion by Q3 2025 could put BTC’s network value at $4.2 trillion — or about $210,000 per Bitcoin. However, the path to these price levels won’t be smooth. As Michaël van de Poppe noted, the Federal Reserve’s upcoming meeting introduces a key wildcard. New all-time high for #Bitcoin and a liquidity sweep for $ETH . FED Meeting around the corner, which is likely going to bring a ton of volatility into the markets. I won't be surprised we'll see $110K and $95K in the same week. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 16, 2024 While a rate cut is expected, the Fed’s commentary could trigger volatility. Bitcoin has often responded sharply to central bank decisions, as monetary policy directly impacts liquidity in financial markets. In Poppe’s words, “I won’t be surprised we’ll see $110K and $95K in the same week.” If Bitcoin’s rally extends further and investor confidence spreads, Ethereum’s historical tendency to lag behind and then catch up could play out again. To put it all together, the current rally has strong foundations: institutional demand, shrinking supply, and improving market sentiment. However, volatility remains a given, especially with the Fed’s decisions looming and macro uncertainties still in play.

In a new video update, Guy Turner, the host of CoinBureau, tells his 2.57 million YouTube subscribers that the market cap for Pyth Network ( PYTH ) may eventually soar due to its potential to generate massive fee revenue. “In my opinion, Pyth Network is one of the most underrated cryptos there is. That’s because it’s an oracle that provides high-frequency data feeds that blockchains like Solana depend on. In other words, Pyth Network is like Chainlink, and some would argue that it’s better than Chainlink. That’s because Pyth Network technically has its own blockchain called Pyth Net, which could theoretically leverage the PYTH token for fees someday. This could make PYTH bigger than LINK, which is already pretty darn big. For the time being, though, PYTH continues to fly under the radar, which is good news for those looking to get in early, but bad news for those who have already been accumulating for a while.” PYTH is trading for $0.49 at time of writing, up 7% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.79 billion, PYTH is the 83rd largest crypto project. Meanwhile, LINK is trading for $29.08 at time of writing, up slightly on the day. With a market cap of $18.21 billion, LINK is the 13th largest crypto project.

Related Reading: The $589 XRP Dream: Believers Aren’t ‘Delusional’ Enough, Expert Says The study indicates that in the third quarter of 2024 Solana’s ecosystem funding reached $173 million, the highest level since mid-2022. This money flow shows a strong conviction in Solana’s ability to be the top blockchain platform. Solana: Key Drivers Of Growth One of the key reasons for this positive prognosis is the upcoming introduction of a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). As regulatory conditions improve, experts predict that institutional investors will flock to Solana, increasing its market position. We are so back! The Messari Theses for 2025 is live and available for free. Jump into the full report now ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/AzOZhiAib5 — Messari (@MessariCrypto) December 16, 2024 The introduction of a spot ETF might result in considerable financial inflows, placing Solana as a viable competitor to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Moreover, ongoing improvements to Solana’s infrastructure are anticipated to augment its performance. Jump Trading’s Firedancer client pledges to enhance transaction velocities and network scalability. The preliminary implementation has commenced, with complete deployment anticipated in 2025. This enhancement will broaden client alternatives while bolstering network security by reducing dependence on a singular codebase. Institutional Interest And Market Sentiment Reflecting the increasing institutional interest in Solana, companies like VanEck and Bitwise have lately registered for a spot SOL ETF. This action points to Solana’s unique value proposition as a high-performance blockchain starting to be acknowledged by conventional finance. If this tendency keeps up, many predict SOL’s price would soar to new heights; some even project it may hit $4,000. Solana’s market attitude remains positive, particularly after it just went past the $220 price level. If the movement continues, analysts anticipate SOL will reach its previous all-time high of $263. The combination of increased capital, technological breakthroughs and institutional support fosters Solana’s expansion.

Tether has invested strategically in StablR, a European startup focused on euro-denominated stablecoins. This partnership is to increase the use of stablecoins across Europe, especially with the European Union’s new regulations on digital assets set to take effect in 2024. Why Is This Investment Important? Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to real-world assets like the US dollar or euro. They offer stability and making them less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Tether’s investment in StablR is the sign of company’s commitment to promoting stablecoins in Europe, particularly as the region prepares for the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will regulate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the EU. StablR, which has already received a license in Malta to issue MiCA-compliant stablecoins and will use Tether’s tokenization platform, Hadron , to facilitate the conversion of traditional assets into digital tokens. By converting it will allow businesses to create digital versions of stocks, bonds, commodities, and more while complying with legal regulations on the whole. StablR’s Role and the Future of Stablecoins StablR offers two types of stablecoins: EURR , which is pegged to the euro, and USDR , which is pegged to the US dollar. Both stablecoins are available on popular blockchain networks like ERC-20 and Solana , and transactions on different platforms. With the help of Tether’s platform, StablR plans to expand its offerings and make stablecoins available on more blockchain networks, allowing even more people and businesses to use them. The stablecoin market is growing especially in countries with unstable economies, Europe is also showing increased interest, with many looking for alternatives to traditional banking systems. Tether’s investment in StablR comes as crypto exchanges adapt to new regulations in Europe (MiCA) that require stablecoin issuers to meet strict compliance and transparency standards. Tether’s investment in StablR helps bring stablecoins like EURR and USDR into Europe’s financial system. With Tether’s support, this partnership makes stablecoins easier to use and ensures they follow the rules in digital currencies.

Feels good, right? Well, the market’s buzzing with three coins that might just get you there. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is shaking up the scene with its massive presale momentum, Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and unbeatable community vibe. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) and COQ Inu (COQ) are making waves in the meme coin world with explosive gains and strong blockchain integration. If you’re scouting the best meme coins to buy for 2025, you’ve landed at the right spot. Let’s break down what makes these three coins worth watching, with a laser focus on BTFD Coin, the presale powerhouse currently turning heads across the crypto space. BTFD Coin (BTFD): A Presale Powerhouse You Don’t Want to Miss BTFD Coin is not just a meme; it’s a movement. Launched with the ethos of “Buy The F**ing Dip,”* BTFD has turned the legendary investment mantra into a full-blown ecosystem that rewards early movers. Since the presale kicked off at just $0.000004 per coin, it’s been nothing but up. Now in Stage 12, the price has hit $0.00013, with the coin set to list at $0.0006 at the end of the presale. Here’s the jaw-dropper: BTFD has raised over $4.1 million, with more than 56 billion coins sold and 5,700+ holders already on board. That’s what you call momentum. If you’re wondering, “How much could I earn?”, let’s do the maths. Say you invest $1,000 right now in Stage 12. At $0.00013 per coin, you’ll bag a staggering 7.69 million BTFD coins. When the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your $1,000 investment could balloon to $4,615. And that’s just the start. But BTFD isn’t just about hype. The project has actual substance with its Beta P2E game now live. You can join the Bulls Squad, tackle levels, and get a taste of what’s to come. Rewards aren’t live in the Beta yet, but this sneak peek is proof that BTFD is building something solid. Add to that staking rewards with an average 90% APY and it’s clear why investors are loading up their bags. Oh, and did I mention the BTFD Coin Referral Program? Share your referral code and earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens if you make the top 20 leaderboard. Your friends get an extra 10% BTFD when they spend $50 or more. Everybody wins. With Ethereum as its backbone and liquidity locked for three years, BTFD isn’t messing around. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a full-on ecosystem, primed for 2025’s bull run. If you’ve been hunting for the best meme coins to buy for 2025, don’t miss this dip. BTFD is your golden ticket. Brett (BRETT): The Rising Star on Base Chain Let’s talk about Brett (BRETT), a meme coin that’s captured hearts and wallets alike. Inspired by its Base Chain integration, Brett has proven that it’s more than just a flash in the pan. Trading at $0.1749 with a market cap of $1.8 billion, Brett’s price has doubled since November 2024, showing strong momentum in the competitive meme coin space. What’s driving this growth? A combination of strategic exchange listings and solid community support. Major exchanges have opened their doors to Brett, bringing more liquidity and visibility to the project. There’s also mounting speculation that Brett might score listings on Binance and Coinbase, which would catapult its popularity even further. Despite the high volatility (par for the course with meme coins), Brett’s trajectory is hard to ignore. Its recent performance and integration with Base Chain make it a strong contender among the best meme coins to buy for 2025. Whether it’s the next Pepe or something even bigger remains to be seen, but Brett has certainly earned its spot on this list. COQ Inu (COQ): Avalanche’s Meme Coin King Over on the Avalanche blockchain, COQ Inu (COQ) is quietly stealing the show. Priced at $0.000002373 with a market cap of $162 million, COQ Inu has firmly established itself as Avalanche’s top meme coin. Boasting a 24-hour trading volume of $20.44 million, it’s clear that COQ Inu isn’t just a niche project—it’s a growing phenomenon. COQ Inu’s secret sauce lies in its transparency and tokenomics. The team has burned liquidity and renounced contracts, ensuring the community’s trust in the project. Combine that with Avalanche’s low fees and lightning-fast transactions, and COQ Inu offers a compelling alternative to Ethereum-based meme coins. Market sentiment has been a major driver here. COQ Inu’s recent recognition among high-ROI meme coins has attracted investors seeking the next big win. With its unique position in the Avalanche ecosystem and its commitment to decentralisation, COQ Inu is certainly one of the best meme coins to buy for 2025 if you’re looking to diversify beyond Ethereum. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on BTFD Coin’s Presale With 2025 just around the corner, the race to snag the best meme coins to buy for 2025 is heating up. BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out as the clear front-runner, with its explosive presale success, P2E game, and community-driven vision. Raising over $4.1 million and counting, BTFD is shaping up to be the ultimate early-mover opportunity for investors ready to ride the bull run. At the same time, Brett (BRETT) is surging ahead on Base Chain, and COQ Inu (COQ) continues to dominate Avalanche with its transparent, low-fee model. Each of these projects offers something unique, but if you’re after a game-changing investment, BTFD Coin deserves your attention. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Join the BTFD presale now, stack your bags, and prepare to ride the bull into 2025. Timing is everything—and this is your moment to buy the f***ing dip.

37776413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=663540,1734480059,Analyst Who Correctly Predicted The Fantom Breakout Above $1 Reveals What’s Next In The Parabolic Trend,"A crypto analyst on TradingView, known as ‘Tradecitypro,’ has published a detailed Fantom (FTM) report, breaking down the cryptocurrency’s price action across the daily and 4-hour timeframe. After accurately predicting Fantom‘s surge above $1, the analyst highlights key price levels, market trends, potential price movements, and bullish technical indicators for FTM’s next parabolic trend. Fantom Daily Timeframe: Signs Of Trend Weakness After correctly forecasting FTM’s price breakout at $0.84, the TradingView analyst has revealed that the cryptocurrency is now following a parabolic uptrend, supported by a curved ascending trendline. According to the analyst, Fantom’s price has reacted multiple times to this distinctive trendline, ending price corrections and resuming its upward momentum. During the last bullish surge during Fantom’s uptrend, the cryptocurrency broke past the 0.7707 resistance and rose to the weekly resistance zone at 1.1116, where it stabilized above that level. Moreover, several indicators suggest that FTM may be slowing down and losing momentum. Its candle sizes have been gradually shrinking, indicating reduced bullish activity. Additionally, price corrections have intensified, signaling increased selling pressures and potential profit-taking. Fantom’s trading volume has also declined, suggesting that traders’ interests might shift. Another technical indicator that is currently bearish is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which is showing signs of divergence, signaling a potential reversal of the price of FTM drops below 55.74 on the RSI. Looking ahead, the TradingView analyst has revealed that a notable sign of sharp bullish trends and pre-pump movements is when a cryptocurrency exhibits weakness and a potential for a price reversal. If the current bearish trend for Fantom continues, the analyst has set the first minor resistance level at 1.6218. Additionally, if FTM can maintain a stable price above this zone, its next and strongest resistance could be at 3.2506. This resistance zone is near FTM’s all-time high of $3.46, representing a significant supply region. On the other hand, if FTM experiences a price correction, it would likely drop to the first support at the curved trendline. If the trendline is broken, the next price levels to watch are 1.1116 and 0.7707. A sustained price decline below 0.7707 would invalidate the previous bullish scenario for Fantom, potentially pushing the price further down to between 0.5349 and 0.2928. 4-Hour Timeframe: Ascending Channel And Potential Breakouts In the 4-hour timeframe, the TradingView analyst revealed that Fantom is currently moving within an Ascending Channel. The cryptocurrency’s price is interacting with the midline of the channel, providing temporary support. The analyst has revealed that no significant moves will be expected if Fantom remains within this Ascending channel. However, if the cryptocurrency can break out, it could lead to two potential scenarios: the start of a new parabolic trend or a trend exhaustion due to a loss in bullish momentum. The TradingView analyst has identified the price level at 1.636 as Fantom’s next static resistance. However, if FTM’s price has not yet reached this zone, the analyst suggests a safer strategy of taking long positions based on Dow Theory and channel breakouts.
