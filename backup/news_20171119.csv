42428116,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL613h,1511091619,Even Investors with Access Want ICO Presale Reform,"Stakeholders in the burgeoning market for initial coin offerings (ICOs) have reached consensus: the practice of presales needs to be reformed.  Originally conceived as a way to bootstrap new tokens by covering their legal and marketing expenses, some ICO issues are now offering crypto-insiders steep discounts on tokens and better distribution terms in presale rounds, where the public at large isn't invited to invest.  Yet, others say an overzealous market has made presales more of a main event.  For some of the less buzzy ICOs, most of the money appears to be coming through private rounds. Ripio raised $31 million of its $37 million token offering in its presale and Swarm raised nearly all of its $5.5 million funding from its presale.  Brayton Williams, a co-founder of blockchain incubator Boost VC, is no stranger to the market. Having been involved with bitcoin since 2013 (at one time pledging to back 100 bitcoin startups), he's yet to greet the ICO market with the same enthusiasm owing to these problems and others.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Everyone wants to invest in a presale. No one wants to invest in a public sale.""  And this mentality illustrates the dangers of presales to both projects and investors.  Take an example, let's call it ThisCoin. ThisCoin releases a white paper in January. In February, it offers a presale on its token with a 50 percent discount. The ICO runs in March and all the tokens sold get distributed on April 1.  It follows that presale investors would be almost guaranteed to roughly double their principle if they sold immediately in April.  To some, it would almost feel foolish not to.  Sid Kalla, a crypto-economics expert and co-founder of the Turing Advisory Group, told CoinDesk that he believes this effectively warps the incentive structure for ICOs.  In an industry that touts incentives as a backbone for product building, he perhaps sees this as more alarming than ironic.  ""The presale discount should reflect the risk being taken on by the early project backers,"" he said. ""Otherwise they have an incentive to invest in projects without proper due diligence because they can take a profit with minimal risk when the token is traded on exchanges.""  Question of fairness  Yet, the example above certainly isn't ""one size fits all.""  Many token projects take years to reach the market (ethereum, for example, didn't release an early version of its software for 12 months). Other much-hyped sales, including those for Filecoin and Tezos, that boast new blockchains, could take similar timelines.  But others believe it's not so much the potential for quick profit taking that's the trouble, but how it degrades the whole point of ICOs to begin with – that everyone from farmers in Idaho to Silicon Valley board members were to be given an equal seat at the table.  And some are pushing back. We covered a startup called Blockstack that recently snubbed presales when it sought to raise funding for its decentralized internet software.  ""We want to have a sense of fairness, that everyone gets the same terms and everyone has the same price,"" co-founder Muneeb Ali said at the time.  Which squares with a surprising take from someone on the investor side.  Fred Pye – the CEO of 3iQ is a Candadian innovation-oriented fund for institutional investors that's now working on crypto asset-based products – said that avoiding the presale is simply a matter of ethics and principle.  Even though his firm would be able to get a better deal by accessing those early rounds, he said it's not doing so.  ""The entire space gets more legitimate the fairer they treat everyone,"" he said.  Better options  But other investors see a place for presales, just not the way they are conducted now.  One of the co-founders of a new fund named Multicoin Capital argued that the ICO market needs to become more sophisticated, and presales are a key part of that process.  ""I think the fact that the first money in gets a significant discount compensates those investors for the risk that they are taking on by being the first,"" Tushar Jain, one of the fund's cofounders, told CoinDesk.  Still, he believes reform is needed. ""The current presale structure is collapsed too much,"" Jain said. ""I think we'll borrow the concept from the current VC world of actually having funding rounds.”  So, for example, a discounted presale would fund a product's development phase, with an ICO closer to its market debut. Rather than the way it works today, where the ICO follows almost immediately on the heels of its presale – all of which precedes even a beta test of the product.  Middle ground  But change may be coming from the market itself.  One real-world project we found operated a little bit closer to that model, at least insofar as it had a basic working version of its product before soliciting funds. Simple Token is building a platform that offers companies ""all the benefits of a token without the drama of an ICO,"" CEO Jason Goldberg, told CoinDesk on the day of its own presale.  Goldberg said Simple maxed out its presale discount at 30 percent for investments over $1.5 million and locked everyone in the offering into the same year-long distribution.  ""If you're going to do presales, you should keep presales to a minimum, say 25 to 35 percent of the offering, and make sure the people doing the presale are locked in, in exchange for a discount,"" he said.  Yet, there's still the matter of determining what actually changes should ICOs adopt more of the characteristics of traditional venture capital. Does that mean it will end up looking just like venture capital does now? Or will it only be taking what's best from VC while still generally democratizing technology investing?  Obviously, we can't know yet.  ""Everything is an experiment in crypto,"" Williams said. ""I hope we’re moving in the right path and learning from the past.""

42428126,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL61Dh,1511087413,The Gentrification of ICOs Is Underway,"Dr. Paul Ennis is an assistant professor at The Centre for Innovation, Technology & Organization at University College Dublin, specializing in bitcoin and blockchain studies.  In this opinion piece, Dr. Ennis takes readers on a tour of the cryptocurrency metropolis, comparing ICOs to a neighborhood, once hardened, that is in store for a cultural shift.      For years, I have described blockchain as the gentrification of bitcoin, meant positively.  Bitcoin is, without doubt, what it is because it has an edge, a Wild West dimension. Yet, residents of ""Bitcoin Country"" know this quasi-lawlessness comes with a price, specifically its appeal for scams and heists. When reversibility of transactions is outlawed, outlaws will appear, no doubt about it.  That's enabled because bitcoin is about channeling the old cypherpunk spirit and becoming as deregulated as possible through technical means. This is a form of total freedom where the risks and the rewards really begin to accelerate.  Our time, as well, is a time of acceleration, and in terms of technology, that means a time of deregulation through exit. This concept of exit, develop in the 1970s by Albert O. Hirschman, is the libertarian ideal condensed into one possibility, the option to opt out and live according to one's own conditions (""to live as if one were already free,"" as Graeber puts it).  Bitcoin has attempted to create pockets where one does precisely this, little islands of freedom, but always aware of where the true power lies. This leaves the potential of bitcoin as a ""regulative ideal,"" as described by Immanuel Kant, a target to aspire to.  This has played out in numerous forms, most notoriously the attempt by Ross Ulbricht to engage in ""profitable civil disobedience,"" leading him to create his shadow Amazon – narcotics direct to your door, bought using a slick interface with all the trappings of a clear-net e-commerce site.  Within these worlds, whether with cryptocurrency or cryptomarkets, there has always existed side-by-side the idealists and the exploiters.  Crypto is a rough neighborhood, but like our brick-and-mortar versions, we find true innovation there (""the hustle""). We also find a tendency to appropriate ideas and culture from there, drawn to the hard-nosed and scrappy desire to make something of nothing.  And yet there is the more clear-cut process of gentrification where, over time, an undesirable neighborhood is altered bit by bit, coffee shop by coffee shop, until the local population begins to look around and wonder, ""When do the suits arrive?""  People begin to speak differently, to speak of blockchain, rather than the blockchain. Rents go up, the locals feel marginalized. What happens, however, when digital rather than physical space is occupied? The costs of exit become much lower, the ability to ignore one another much easier.  Bitcoiners and blockchainers can co-exist, engaging and disengaging with what intrigues them.  Times a-changing  Gentrification is now apparent with the rapid expansion of initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In my own small country, one finds an ICO located in one of its most salubrious suburbs (Confideal) and run by the country's most successful hedge fund manager (Mingocoin). Alongside gentrification, one finds mainstream-ification, represented most abruptly by surreal, but surely exciting, celebrity endorsements, running the gamut of Floyd Mayweather to Paris Hilton.  What has changed? Well, for one, traditional businesses are no less drawn to the deregulationist tendency than cryptocurrency ones. They are, however, often more cautious, unused to the ""better-to-ask-permission"" philosophy underpinning numerous crypto innovations.  However, with the success of Uber, it seems that a cultural shift may be taking place that asks, what if, perhaps, one is able to self-fund? Or rather, to fund on one's own terms and in the democratized manner ICOs allow. Or put another way, why precisely would we not self-fund, especially in a community rooted in a libertarian politics of self-sufficient and a cypherpunk DIY ethos?  The retort, of course, is that regulations exist in order to constrain rampant exploitation of naive investors and no doubt the ICO space will have many of these. But does this mean ICOs should engage in the process of adopting regulatory frameworks that will appeal to this audience?  The answer is that, broadly speaking, they already are. The new breed of ICO is operating in a ""post-ban"" phase, meaning that the various warnings and crackdowns have occurred, are not simply theoretical, as they were for the original wave of ICOs (e.g. Gnosis).  This is why it is not uncommon to hear these days about ""passing the Howey test.""  In the case of ICOs, this test would determine whether a token is a security and therefore subject to SEC regulation. And what recent comments from the SEC suggest is a ""thoughtful"" approach is being taken, one that will take care to assess ICOs according to circumstances.  For now, the question is open, the ontological nature of tokens bracketed for the time being.  Finding ourselves  So, here is where we find ourselves, at the point where the cypherpunk insight – we can raise our own capital within this cryptocurrency community, using our own creative technologies – begins to attract outside interest, bringing in new neighbors, all sharp suits and business acumen.  Here is where I think the promise of cryptocurrencies begins to seep back in.  With contentious issues over transactions fees rendering older cryptocurrency ambitions, such as serving the unbanked, almost quaint in its idealism, we find the opening up of a new space of possibility, one hinging on creativity. For what ICOs allow for is the option of exit from endless rounds of venture capital funding, oriented to a select few of angel investors.  Instead, ICOs democratize the process to a massively-distributed network of people, allowing them to assess the situation, and giving them a chance to access investment opportunities in a way that is normally complicated by intermediaries and middlemen (remember, this is what all this is about).  Disintermediation of old business practices is always a little bit messy, a little bit of a culture shock.  But crypto is no ordinary shake-up, it goes right to the heart of what is assumed about the nature of what things are. Bitcoin disintermediates money; ethereum contracts and ICOs combine both to disintermediate the raising of capital.  The best part of all this?  Companies will finally be able to focus on their projects; in that spirit let a thousand ICOs bloom.
