42424998,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXOFh,1372432594,"Snowden, narcs and Swedish chips: Bitcoin loves them all","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 28th June 2013 — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  The name’s Hill. Benny Hill.  Secrets ain’t what they used to be. A spook of John Law’s acquaintance used to have the James Bond theme as their ringtone; after Edward Snowden’s traipse around the world, skipping merrily out of reach of the CIA, NSA and GCHQ, it’s probably been replaced by Benny Hill.  For those who like to peer into the future of bitcoin, though, the whole episode has been a lesson in quite why cryptocurrency solves a real need - the best, although not the only, way to tell whether an invention will succeed. In this case, the problem is simple logic. Snowden’s revelations show that the security services are very capable and happy to snoop on millions of people and especially those they categorise as aiding terrorism. In return, the authorities have branded Snowden an ally of terrorism. So, if you want to give Snowden practical support and the spooks find out, what does that do to the chances of ending up in the wrong sort of database?  Best not to find out. Bitcoin doesn’t go through any financial institution, so bitcoin transactions have a much lower profile to the various monitoring schemes based on the idea that effective naughtiness needs real money. So does effective goodness, of course, but it’s a bit difficult to send cash to someone capable of hiding from the global bloodhounds. WikiLeaks knows where Snowden is. But it’s very safe to assume that WikiLeaks is most definitely on spook radar - and hard to get money to in any case.  Enter bitcoin. It’s not spook-proof, but with a little work it is hard enough to connect back to you that it fulfils the number one rule of how not to be seen - be too hard work for too little reward for anyone to bother looking. And that solves the problem, Nothing else can.  Not everyone will benefit from this revelation, though. With most people seeing Snowden as the hero of the piece, it’ll be a long time before the NSA and GCHQ can rely on voluntary bitcoin donations to fund their own Russian hotel bills.  Silence is golden  Marketing is the tax you pay for not being interesting. If you don’t believe that, look at the next ten adverts you read or see on the telly, and ask yourself whether the products themselves are anything other than a dull thing competing against other dull things.  The reverse of the coin, though, is that if people are keeping quiet but clearly up to something, it may actually be worth looking into. Such looks like the case with KnCMiner, whose first interview broke the surface this week.  A Swedish start-up, it’s producing BTC mining rigs based on custom chips - and it’s not alone in that. The difference is that it's going for cutting-edge technologies that are a couple of generations ahead of the competition, even though this is much more expensive. The reasoning is - if you’re not going to be the best, why bother?  Laudable, exciting and risky. Even assuming that KnC achieves its goal and comes up with the most efficient, fastest mining boxes on the planet, that’s only going to be true for a short period. Moore’s Law, which will run for the next ten years at least, says that every eighteen months to two years, digital electronics get twice as powerful for a given price. The question is: can you make enough money during that short lifetime to see a profit on your expensive mining rig, before the next generation comes along and you lose your competitive advantage?  It’s the financial equivalent of fusion power: once you get more energy out of a fusion reactor than you put in, you get a self-sustaining reaction and as much power as you can eat. Before that point, you have an extremely expensive, albeit pretty impressive, flash gun. Nobody’s cracked sustainable fusion, but the rewards are so great that the governments of the world keep trying.  The dynamics of bitcoin mining are such that only the best engineering will show a profit, driving out less profitable efforts quite quickly. Those are the stakes KnC plays for - and if it pays off, they’ll no more need a marketing budget than a whale needs scuba gear.  Stash and carry  And going back to naughtiness, this week saw what looks like the first state seizure of bitcoin assets earned by contraband. The details are scarce, but as the roughly 11 BTC were nabbed by the US Drug Enforcement Agency it seems highly likely that this was all part of some action on the Silk Road anonymous entrepôt.  John Law has visited the Silk Road, a process which needs a mild amount of faffery with the Tor network and a general lack of paranoia; it is indeed filled with substances that make it harder to do complicated computer tasks while making you very paranoid indeed, so the whole thing is probably self-limiting. He didn’t feel the need to conduct any transactions, though, as he had nothing of interest to sell and tends to meddle with his neurochemistry in more traditional places.  As Let's Talk Bitcoin! pointed out, the blockchain records of the seized BTC strongly suggest that this was part of a ‘moneypot’ operation, where the DEA sets up shop on Silk Road and proceeds to collar hapless would-be purchasers - who, after all, have to provide a physical address for the products to be sent to. It would be interesting to know just how many Silk Road traders are in fact law enforcement officers: it’s hard to believe that any government agency from any government with an interest in narcotics wouldn’t have at least a couple of active accounts. And as there are an awful lot of such agencies - the War on Drugs being such a well-funded endeavour world-wide, nothing between one and ten thousand such accounts would be surprising.  All this is irresistibly reminiscent of the 1908 novel The Man Who Was Thursday, by G K Chesterston, in which an anarchist cabal turns out to be composed almost entirely of undercover agents unaware of each other’s true status. It’s also supposedly the book that led to Irish revolutionary republican Michael Collins adopting the maxim that “If you don’t seem to be hiding, nobody will hunt you out” - another very good lesson for those who prefer not to attract the attention of the surveillance state.  Everything old is new again.  Coining it in London  John Law would like to remind readers about next Tuesday's Bitcoin London conference. Of particular interest will be the networking cocktails (although John Law hopes for networking ale), and the post-event meetup at the Cat and Canary. Pembury Tavern: apologies, I have to take my business elsewhere for the day.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude. He has returned to write for CoinDesk on the foibles of digital currency.

42424991,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXO3h,1372414794,Man charged after demanding bitcoin for Mitt Romney tax returns,"A man from Tennessee has been indicted for attempting to extort $1 million in bitcoin by claiming that he had undeclared tax records of the former presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. Michael Mancil Brown (34) contacted the accounting firm used by Romney, PricewaterhouseCoopers, claiming that he had stolen computer documents containing up to twenty years' worth of tax returns that Romney had refused to put into the public domain for the sake of his election campaign.  Mr. Romney's tax returns had been a source of controversy throughout the campaign. Candidates are not required to divulge their tax returns, but it has become customary to do so. However, Mr. Romney refused to participate in the publication of his personal financial details.  The indictment of Brown is a result of an investigation that had been ongoing since last September, when it was first claimed that documents had been stolen from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Throughout the investigation, the company maintained that it could not find any evidence that it had been broken into. Furthermore, the documents that Brown claimed to possess have not yet been discovered.  Brown allegedly sent a letter to PricewaterhouseCoopers in August 2012, claiming to have the tax returns, and that he would release them to major news media outlets if he did not receive $1,000,000 worth of bitcoin. The indictment also claims that he invited other ""interested parties"" to send the same amount of digital currency to another bitcoin address if they wanted the documents.  According to Politico, Brown posted a cover letter to Pastebin that stated ""A scanned signature image for Mitt Romney from the 1040 forms were scanned and included with the packages, taken from earlier 1040 tax forms gathered and stored on the flash drives"". The original Pastebin link to the content has since been removed.  The packages in question had been sent to several recipients to accompany the online cover letter. However, it appears that no one opened them for fear that the flash drives contained viruses.  According to The Bitcoin Magazine, Brown said in his letter:  “At the same time, the other interested parties will be allowed to compete with you. For those that DO want the documents released will have a different address to send to. If $1,000,000 USD is sent to this account below first; then the encryption keys will be made available to the world right away. So this is an equal opportunity for the documents to remain locked away forever or to be exposed before the September 28 deadline. Who-ever is the winner does not matter to us.”  Brown has been indicted on six counts of wire fraud and six counts of extortion.  Clearly in this case, the transfer of bitcoin was desirable because of its relative anonymity and the ability to mix transactions making it difficult, if not impossible, to trace the complete path of funds throughout the block chain.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/28/man-charged-after-demanding-bitcoin-for-mitt-romney-tax-returns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9856fd3f89d653c448752a57fe03b6a91f493da9-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425007,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHXOVh,1372408009,Should corporations develop their own virtual currencies like bitcoin?,"Companies have an interest in virtual currencies for many reasons. It develops a store of value inside of an ecosystem; it ensures that goods will be purchased inside of their own worlds. Generally speaking, it keeps more value inside their own fiefdom once a virtual currency has been exchanged for cash money. In the end, it appears to be a major value proposition. This is especially true for technology companies that do most of their business in the digital realm.  With that being said, the recent history of corporate-backed virtual currencies is spotty at best. Let’s take a look at some recent efforts. Then, an analysis of the future of corporate digicurrencies.  Facebook Credits  Credits are used on Facebook’s platform to buy items within games and other applications. It sounds like a good idea in concept, but Facebook has decided to shutter their Credits platform.  Some have speculated that Credits would be a boost to Facebook as a payment system. Payments on Facebook may still come to fruition, but it won’t end up being denominated in the Credits virtual currency at this point. And for people who don’t quite understand how Facebook plans on making money from users long-term, it’s hard to fathom at all.  Facebook has experienced serious criticisms ever since the company went public amid concerns that it might not be able to match lofty revenue expectations. It’s also been in a back-and-forth battle with Zynga, which has been a developer of popular games on the social network. It would seem logical that something like Facebook Credits could work. But the reality is that adoption of Credits only reached as far as the people who played games on Facebook. This likely resulted in a fight with Zynga, which has to become less dependent on Facebook over the long-run and is now struggling to survive.  Amazon Coins  Lost in the hype during the month of April, when bitcoins hit an all-time high of $266, Amazon slipped in an announcement of their own virtual currency called Amazon Coins. This after they really first released it in February 2013.  There’s no debate about it: Amazon Coins has one goal. Its existence is to boost the amount of spending within Amazon itself. That’s the problem with Coins: it almost has no value outside of whatever Amazon is selling to customers. Sure, that can amount to a huge array of items, from books to on-demand movies to groceries. But what’s the end result for the consumer?  If you buy one of Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets, you’ll get 500 Amazon Coins. According to Amazon, that’s $5. And when you spend your money in Coins, you’ll get 10% off apps and games for the Kindle platform. It’s like a thank you for buying their hardware, a device built for delivering to its users more Amazon products and services. One emerging technology analyst, Jeffery Green, has said that he doesn’t understand the purpose from a user standpoint for Coins. “They’re too complex for the purpose they’re addressing,” he said.  Linden Dollars  Perhaps one of the most underrated yet successful virtual currencies, Linden Dollars are a unit of exchange within the virtual world Second Life. An element of legitimacy has been preset for Linden Dollars. This can be attributed to the fact that there is a very real economy of virtual goods sold within Second Life. Linden Lab used to even evaluate the macro perspective of its economy on its blog, but has not reported on it since 2011.  VirWox, a virtual currency exchange, is probably the best known for actually providing an outside market for the Linden Dollar. But the $L is not a speculative currency like bitcoin has been. Could that be attributed to the fact that it is derived from a corporate entity? That might be the case. The reality is that only people who would be engaged in exchanging fiat money into Linden Dollars would be Second Life users.  Microsoft Points  As CoinDesk’s Alice Truong recently reported, Microsoft will be moving away from its points system for the Xbox platform. In its place will be a system using a user’s local currency, or possibly Microsoft gift cards. Both options have been presented to the public  From the Microsoft Points website, it almost sounds as if this system was initially implemented as a way for people without a credit card to pay for things in the Xbox ecosystem. And using a point-based system as a replacement for credit cards does seem like a good idea in light of that fact. The demographics of people using video game systems skew heavily towards the younger set that cannot get a credit card. This might be because they have no credit, or might not even be old enough to obtain a card.  Numerous misshapen situations might have resulted if Microsoft had any plans on Points being used for their larger business - enterprise would be an example. That didn’t happen - an interesting note given their focus on profits in their business division. Yet the company is overly concerned about the consumer portion of their business - but the sunsetting of Points gives credence to their understanding that they do not want to overly confuse their relatively large customer base.  Bottom line  Corporations are going to continue to announce and then tout their own currencies. This will happen even though not all of them are going to survive. The consistently prevalent stream of news related to the term “digital currency” means that it gives companies, especially those that operate mainly in the technology sector, the ability to promote themselves with their own currency.  Is there a benefit to these systems? There might be. Loyalty programs akin to the points system with credit card companies are a prime example of how these digital currencies can translate to a new environment. People in this system can accrue value and then pay in something other than fiat money.  But a healthy dose of skepticism should be part of the adoption of this relatively new idea. Corporations are in the business of making money, especially public ones that are beholden to shareholders. Ultimately, what happens to these corporate-backed digital currencies will be dictated by revenue and profit metrics. It’s no wonder then, that Bitcoins have a good amount of market capitalization: not one person or corporation can control its fate. Perhaps that, in the end, is what fundamentally makes it valuable.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/28/should-corporations-develop-their-own-virtual-currencies-like-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/435a7fa40a3280c7e7b12afac207b4b7f9cb7e02-1024x520.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
