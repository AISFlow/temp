42433400,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOQXLh,1608501692,Crypto Long & Short: Bitcoin Is More Than a Hedge Against Inflation – It's a Hedge Against 'Crazy',"As the year that felt like a decade on speed starts to draw to a welcome close, some of us are starting to try to make sense of the timeline of narratives and events. Most of us (myself included) are failing. And that in itself is an intriguing narrative, that sheds light on bitcoin’s rally.      Bear with me while I try to explain.      On the one hand, we have a rapid rise in the bitcoin price, and coalescing institutional support from traditional investors and companies that see potential in crypto assets and markets.      On the other hand, we have conflicting economic and social trends. We have blind faith in the power of vaccines combined with rejection of the science of virus transmission; monetary policy designed to encourage lending combined with banks that are unwilling to do so; growing interest in the value of emerging markets combined with escalating risk of default; widening inequality combined with greater power of protest; I could go on.      These conflicting forces and the uncertainty swirling around them should encourage us to look closely at prevailing narratives. Yet, those of us watching the growing institutional interest in bitcoin markets have accepted without question the assumption that bitcoin’s inflation hedge qualities are behind it.      Let’s pick that apart.    The deflation debate    First, let’s look at another pair of conflicting economic trends.      Most economists seem to believe that a resurgence of inflation is unlikely. Depressed consumption and excess supply, the continuing impact of technology and demographic shifts, the low velocity of money and the weak labor market are just some of the factors they point to. These have already led to deflation in some key economic areas.      The bond market, on the other hand, tells us that inflation concerns are real. The five-year breakeven rate, a proxy for inflation expectations calculated by taking the difference between five-year U.S. Treasurys and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, is close to its five-year high.      What’s more, the yield curve continues to steepen, signaling expectations of higher interest rates in the future as central banks tackle a looming inflation problem. Taking into account the damage rising interest rates would do to debt-laden economies, this is the bond market telling us that they see trouble ahead.    An inflation hedge    But does that really matter for bitcoin?      Bitcoin is seen as an inflation hedge mainly because of its limited supply, which is not influenced by its price, and because of its relative attractiveness when real yields head to zero or lower.      Yet, when you buy bitcoin, you’re not just doing so to hedge inflation. You’re buying bitcoin to hedge all the other negative consequences that usually accompany it.      True, inflation is not always bad. “Good” inflation, a result of economic growth and low unemployment that helps to close the gap between supply and demand, encourages investment and even more economic growth.      Runaway inflation, however, exacerbates poverty, heightens uncertainty, demolishes trust in institutions and can lead to the breakdown of social order. This is not isolated to post-WWI Germany – we see it today in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Lebanon and Argentina, to name just a few.      Bitcoin is also a hedge for unstable governments that close bank accounts, police states that want to seize private wealth, broken payments rails due to corrupted systems or outside cyber attack threats, paranoid leaders that want to disenfranchise opponents, export-protecting devaluations that trigger more inflation.      These are less likely in developed economies. But let’s not forget that tipping points lurk around unexpected corners, and that Venezuela was once one of the wealthiest countries in the world and one of the more stable democracies in Latin America.      Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, but also against political instability and social disruption, which – if inflation comes roaring back – is not a ridiculous thing to prepare for.    A dollar debasement hedge    Bitcoin is also a hedge against a more gentle but just as pernicious debasement of currency through a loss of trust.      Traditionally, inflation moves in tandem with the strength of the local economy. But it can be triggered by currency weakness, which raises the prices of imported goods.      This is usually corrected when the central bank raises interest rates to combat rising inflation, which increases the attractiveness of the currency compared to others.      But in the current environment, an increase in interest rates may have the opposite effect, given the potentially catastrophic impact on debt-ridden economies. The U.S. bond market is telling us that it thinks interest rates will rise. The dollar continues to head lower, however, and could continue to do so even if those rate increases materialize, as faith in the capacity of the U.S. to employ traditional tools to good effect could be shaken.      And, most bitcoin trading is denominated in dollars. Therefore, if the dollar heads lower without a corresponding fall in the value of bitcoin (and since it’s unrelated to the economy, there’s no fundamental reason why it would), the BTC/USD ratio heads up.      Bitcoin is a hedge for not just the macroeconomic ills that we have been trained to watch out for. It can also provide ballast against the unforeseen problems waiting to be triggered.    The 'crazy' thesis    This highlights another hidden strength of bitcoin as an investment asset.      It is unlike any asset that we have seen before: programmatic supply, decentralized governance, fragmented market infrastructure that runs on technology developed by an unknown entity yet maintained by miners, developers and validators distributed across many geographies.      It doesn’t fit into standard economic thinking – and for that reason, it is perfect for our times.      In a world where you’ve gone from orthodox monetary policy to Keynesian economics to MMT in a few months, there is no longer any trust in the traditional recipes.      To paraphrase G. K. Chesterton, when you stop believing in traditional recipes, your mind is more open to new ones.      Bitcoin in portfolios represents more than a new recipe. It represents the need for a new recipe. It represents a safety play against a world in which old ideas are up in the air, and new ones have yet to take root.      It represents more than a hedge against inflation: it also represents an acceptance that politics and economics can get weird, and that untested ideas that are untethered to macroeconomic features and past assumptions are worth considering.      It represents a hedge against “crazy,” which is hopefully not what awaits us – but the risk of not preparing for that possibility is verging on irresponsible, and not even thinking about it is likely to end up being prohibitively expensive.    Anyone know what's going on yet?    The outperformance of bitcoin in 2020 has to set up the asset for even more professional investor attention next year, even though we all know that past performance is not an indicator of future performance. Or is it? The momentum trade seems to be the predominant strategy this year, and given the amount of money sloshing around markets looking for a good return, there is no indication that will end soon.      Then again, all bull markets have to end some time, although the underlying fundamentals and investment theses of bitcoin do not get worse with vaccine disappointments and worse-than-expected economic figures – unlike with stock and bond markets.    Chain links    Investors talking:      · Scott Minerd, CIO of fund manager Guggenheim Partners, which manages more than $230 billion worth of assets, told Bloomberg TV hosts this week that his firm’s fundamental analysis shows that bitcoin should be worth $400,000. This conclusion is based on the asset’s scarcity, and its relative value to gold as a percentage of gross domestic product. He also revealed that Guggenheim had started allocating to bitcoin when it was trading at around $10,000.      · U.K.-based fund manager Ruffer Investment Company has invested approximately $740 million in bitcoin, equivalent to around 2.7% of the firm’s assets under management. According to the company, the investment was ""primarily a protective move for portfolios"" to ""act as a hedge"" against ""some of the risks that we see in a fragile monetary system and distorted financial markets."" Ruffer is known in investment circles as a conservative manager focused on capital preservation. It had the top-performing active fund in Europe for January-June 2020: the LF Ruffer Gold Fund produced a six-month performance of over 55%. And now it’s investing in bitcoin. Ruffer has spoken often in the past about its inflation concerns. This investment makes me want to check in on other active managers worried about inflation – their ranks are growing.      · One River Asset Management, a $1 billion hedge fund (as of April 2020) specializing in volatility plays, has invested $600 million in bitcoin and ether or institutional clients (including Ruffer, which owns a stake in the company) via its subsidiary One River Digital Asset Management. CEO Eric Peters told Bloomberg that One River Digital’s crypto holdings will cross $1 billion in early 2021. Brevan Howard Asset Management co-founder Alan Howard is taking an ownership stake in One River Digital and helping to provide the company with back-end trading services.      · Christopher Wood, global head of equity strategy at investment firm Jefferies, has trimmed the recommended exposure in his model global portfolio from 50% gold in favor of bitcoin. This is even more notable given that this particular portfolio is designed with U.S. pension funds in mind. What’s more, he has said that he plans to increase exposure to bitcoin should there be a correction.      · Jeff Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, told Bloomberg that bitcoin was a “retail inflation hedge,” and a risk-on growth proxy.      · Not an endorsement, but an interesting and potentially useful thread prompted by tech investor Andrew Wilkinson, co-founder of Tiny Capital.      In market developments:      U.S.-based crypto asset exchange Coinbase has filed preliminary documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public. The Form S-1 is expected to become effective after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions. TAKEAWAY: Here we go … This will create by far the largest listed company in the crypto industry, and has been rumored for some time. As well as attracting even more attention to crypto markets, it is likely to kick off a slate of crypto-related listings, especially given the recent price movements and the swelling of institutional interest. What I’m most excited about, apart from seeing how the market values a systemic crypto market infrastructure business, is getting a look at their balance sheet and P&L.      Cboe Global Markets will launch a suite of crypto market tools in 2021 in a licensing partnership with execution provider CoinRoutes, including cryptocurrency indexes, historical data and real-time ticks. TAKEAWAY: Cboe operates the largest options exchange in the U.S. Coming from a traditional market infrastructure player, this deal signals support for the nascent asset group, and points to the introduction of new crypto services and products over the coming years. S&P also recently revealed crypto index plans, and other market data providers are likely to join the race to capture crypto data market share.      The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) will launch a futures contract on ether (ETH) in February 2021. TAKEAWAY: This goes a long way towards validating ETH as a potentially institutional-grade investment. The lack of liquid ETH derivatives for institutional investors has dampened hedging opportunities, and the removal of these barriers could encourage more professional investors to at least consider its merits.      Advisory company Evercore has named PayPal as its top payments stock, in part because it believes that the firm’s cryptocurrency services could be good for customer engagement and transaction margin. TAKEAWAY: This not only encourages investors to consider companies that are launching crypto asset services; it also encourages more companies to offer crypto asset services, because who doesn’t want investors looking at them?      Sovryn, a self-billed “decentralized platform for trading and lending Bitcoin,” has launched on the Bitcoin sidechain RSK, with $2.1 million in funding. TAKEAWAY: There’s a lot of debate about whether Bitcoin could ever be used for smart contracts. This is a reminder that the jury is still out, and technological progress is pretty good at showing that what many think is impossible is not that impossible after all. If the range of applications that can be built on Bitcoin broadens, that could boost its potential value.      SBI Financial Services, the subsidiary of Japanese tech conglomerate SBI Holdings, has acquired U.K.-based cryptocurrency OTC desk B2C2. TAKEAWAY: This is another example of legacy finance leveraging crypto asset services to broaden its client base, and to sell more to existing clients.      Banca Generali, an Italian private bank that focuses on wealth management for high net worth individuals, is leading a $14 million investment round in crypto wallet provider Conio, with an agreement to offer Conio’s services to the bank’s clients. TAKEAWAY: Yet another legacy bank gears up to offer crypto asset services to its clients. We will see a lot more of this in 2021.      You have banks building or buying crypto asset services, and you also have crypto firms trying to become banks. Crypto payments firm BitPay has filed to become a national bank in the U.S., headquartered in Georgia. TAKEAWAY: By becoming a national bank, BitPay will be able to operate in all U.S. states, while its non-bank competitors will need to get money transmitter licenses in each state they wish to operate in. This confers an operational advantage, and also a strategic advantage in that clients could prefer the additional scrutiny borne by national trust banks, compared to firms that don’t have a national bank license.      Speaking of crypto firms hoping to become banks, crypto asset platform Paxos (which last week filed to become a federally regulated bank) has raised $142 million in a Series C round. TAKEAWAY: Paxos is emerging as a key player in the developing crypto market infrastructure: as well as a crypto exchange itBit, it is building a full-stack infrastructure service that includes custody, tokenized securities, stablecoins and more. It powers PayPal’s new bitcoin offering, and also counts Credit Suisse, Société Générale and Revolut among its clients. (Paxos’ founder, Charles Cascarilla, was named one of CoinDesk’s Most Influential for 2020.) With this amount of funding, it will be interesting to see which of their many services they choose to build out more, or whether they will be adding new market tools to the mix.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/20/crypto-long-short-bitcoin-is-more-than-a-hedge-against-inflation-its-a-hedge-against-crazy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9657f4b29598bee805d99269f86fc42875e19643-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A vote could come as soon as Sunday evening.  While the text of the bill wasn't released, the pact is expected to provide $300 a week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits, a $600 check to many Americans, plus help for schools, vaccine distribution and small businesses, the WSJ said earlier Sunday.  In good news for those who welcome the Federal Reserve's free-printing ways, a move by some Republican senators to use the bill to put a check on the central bank was only partly successful, the WSJ reported.  Under a pact reached Saturday night, the Fed would keep its powers to set up emergency lending programs without first getting congressional approval, the WSJ reported, citing aides familiar with the legislation.  Negotiators did agree the central bank won't be able to replicate programs identical to the ones it started at the start of the pandemic without getting prior approval. The Fed's ability to initiate different programs would be unaffected, the sources told the WSJ.    Why this matters to the crypto world:    Because the stimulus package would be a boost for stock markets, it could also provide a lift to the price of cryptocurrencies, particularly if stimulus check recipients use that money to buy cryptocurrencies.  Crypto investors have been betting all year that the flood of government and central bank spending to fight the coronavirus-caused economic slowdown will eventually lead to inflation, which would also be beneficial for bitcoin.  All the stimulus is calling into question the independence of the Federal Reserve, which to prevent short-term economic ruin has been basically printing money with abandon, leaving itself open to criticism about the mountain of debt these spending sprees are creating.

42411940,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEOG,1608490320,New to Bitcoin? How to Stay Safe and Avoid Common Bitcoin Scams,"Is this year the year that you finally take the plunge and buy your first few satoshis? Before you do, here are a few suggestions to avoid falling victim to some of the bitcoin scammers and hucksters who will try to take advantage of people who are still new to the wild world of cryptocurrencies.  Do your research  The first step in the journey is to set up a wallet to store your bitcoin safely. There are plenty of bitcoin wallets on the App Store and Google Play. Just be sure to read the reviews and research the wallets before you decide on one. You want to be confident you are depositing your newly acquired bitcoin funds into a legitimate wallet that will actually keep your crypto safe and not stolen.  Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoins  You’ll also need to decide on an exchange where you will be able to buy your first bitcoin. There are plenty of exchanges out there and come with varying degrees of security. Most will require some form of identity verification before you can set up an account, so be prepared.  When it comes to wallets and exchanges, be sure the site you visit is reputable before you send any money. A slick website is not necessarily the sign of a legitimate business. Similarly, just because a wallet app is listed in an app store, that doesn’t guarantee it’s safe. Even if they are legitimate, the cryptocurrency world has seen exchanges and wallets hacked time and time again.  Read more: How Can I Buy Bitcoin?  Check out how long an exchange or wallet company has been around. Look for reviews and feedback, review sites such as Reddit and read through a company’s social media history. Do a news search for whatever company you’re researching because most reliable exchanges and brokers have likely been covered by prominent media outlets.  Protect your bitcoin keys  Bitcoin isn’t like your bank. There is no helpline you can call, no fraud department that might help you sort out a transaction and no way to block a “suspicious transaction.” The ethos of bitcoin is that it exists beyond the traditional financial system and gives ultimate control to the user.  Read more: How FinCEN Became a Honeypot for Sensitive Personal Data  On the one hand, this means you aren’t paying overdraft fees or having the government gain access to your personal data through your financial transactions. On the other hand, there is no centralized authority who is going to step in and save you if you share your keys and have your bitcoin stolen. In some ways, it’s the ultimate test of personal responsibility.  If you’re just entering the space, it’s worth embracing one of the core ideas of bitcoin – ""not your keys, not your coins.""  A wallet generates two types of keys: a private key and a public key. The public key is used to create public addresses. These are the addresses that you will share with others to receive bitcoin.  A private key, however, should be kept absolutely private. This is the key you’ll need to encrypt and decrypt your wallet and is fundamental to making sure your bitcoin is secure. If you don’t control the private key to the wallet you’re storing your bitcoin in, then you really don’t control your bitcoin.  Sharing is not caring  Once again, don’t ever share your private key with anyone, and definitely don’t do it online.  Furthermore, when you create a wallet you’re often provided with a seed phrase. Also known as a backup phrase or recovery phrase, this is a group of words generated once upon wallet creation, and you’re instructed to write them down and store them in a safe place. The reason you’re usually instructed to write them down is so they aren’t stored on your computer, where they’re vulnerable.  This seed phrase is used to recover bitcoin funds on-chain and, as such, is often another target of scammers.  There is a reason that “not your keys, not your coins” is a common refrain. If a scammer gets your keys or your seed phrase they can clean your wallet out.  So step one, keep your private key private and your seed phrase safe.  Phishing scams: Check your links  Always be on the lookout for phishing scams. Phishing attacks are a favorite among hackers and scammers. In a phishing attack, an attacker typically impersonates a service, company or individual by way of email or other text-based communication, or by hosting a fake website. The goal is to trick a victim into revealing his or her private keys or sending bitcoin to an address the scammer owns.  These emails often look like they’re legitimate. For example, scammers have sent out fake emails that look like CoinDesk newsletters. Users of the hardware wallet Ledger have seemingly gotten emails from the company encouraging them to download a security fix when in reality, it was from scammers posing as company representatives.  These are just a couple of examples, but phishing attempts come in many forms, and not just email. You may get scammers impersonating other people on social media sending you links. You may get phone calls.  Read more: 4 Ways to Stay Safe in Crypto  Phishing scams come in many forms but the goal is to get you to give up data or information that could be used to compromise your digital security – and jack your bitcoin.  In any such unsolicited email, make sure you look at the sender’s address. A key clue in any phishing email is a slight misspelling of a real address or URL. For example, with the Ledger phishing scam, the email was from a “legder.com” URL, which is misspelled. An attacker will try to make the incoming email seem as real as possible, so always double-check. Another tip is to hover over any link to see where it is leading. Just because bitcoin.org is highlighted with a link does not mean it actually goes to bitcoin.org, for example.  A great habit to get into is to bookmark sites you regularly use to access your funds. Only visit those sites through your bookmarked addresses – not through an email link. That way you know you are only using legitimate URLs.  Read more: Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop  As Paul Walsh, CEO of the cybersecurity company MetaCert, told CoinDesk earlier this year, the vast majority of malware is delivered via email phishing and malicious URLs.  “Most security issues that involve dangerous URLs go undetected and, therefore, [are] not blocked,” he said.  In other words, Gmail’s spam filter isn’t going to catch everything, nor are those in more advanced security software.  No one is going to give you free bitcoin  Finally, take it slow and be cautious. There are more advanced hacking and scamming techniques out there. I’ve spoken with crypto users who have been scammed out of thousands of dollars by con men pretending to be investors in their companies, who carried out the scam over the course of months. I’ve seen cases where people gave “traders” their private keys so they could turn a profit, only to see their wallets slowly drained.  In 2020, for example, Twitter was hacked and prominent accounts from Elon Musk to Barack Obama to CoinDesk started tweeting, essentially, that if you sent them some bitcoin, they’d send you back more.  There are bitcoin scam ads out there on YouTube that are featured on legitimate cryptocurrency shows, even though they advertise crypto giveaways and pyramid schemes.  See also: YouTube’s Whac-a-Mole Approach to Crypto Scam Ads Remains a Problem  Fake exchanges are sending messages on Discord and other communication channels, promising free bitcoin to people who open accounts and make minimum deposits. (Spoiler alert: You won’t get free bitcoin and you’ll never get your deposit back.)  And the list of creative ways that scammers will try to take advantage of you goes on.  While it might seem farfetched that people would fall for these sorts of bitcoin scams, the Twitter hackers netted over $140,000 worth of bitcoin at the time. Overall, a report by blockchain analytics firm Crystal Blockchain found that security attacks and fraudulent schemes resulted in the theft of approximately $12.1 billion worth of crypto assets from 2011 to 2021.  This applies even if you think you might be too smart to be scammed. Fraudsters come in all shapes and sizes, often playing into your own psychology.  “We assume that only other people fall for cons and scams and it will never happen to us,” said Dr. Paul Seager, a professor of social and forensic psychology at the U.K.'s University of Central Lancashire. “That makes us feel a bit more secure about ourselves and bolsters our self-esteem. ‘We’re not stupid. We don’t fall for these kinds of things,’ but that self-serving bias lures us into complacency.”  So remember: Keep your private key secret, double-check every URL and if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | WALLET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/new-to-bitcoin-how-to-stay-safe-and-avoid-common-bitcoin-scams,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/df7f0a1126cc81088973a9f0fac595f07b43f971-2286x1311.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405595,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWJL,1608480033,You Say You Want a Bitcoin Revolution,"Before The Beatles became the most popular band of all time, they were mainstays at a hole-in-the-wall club in Liverpool called The Cavern. Between 1961 and 1963, the boys would play rock-n-roll nightly to a small but dedicated audience of fans. Those lucky enough to see The Beatles during this period understood they were witnessing something special and spread word of the band to their friends. Over time, the crowds grew bigger and The Beatles eventually became too popular for their hometown venue. Not six months after playing their last show at the Cavern, they had a number one record and were playing to millions on the Ed Sullivan show. That's hyper-Beatlization for you.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Justin Wales is a lawyer and the co-chair of Carlton Fields’ national blockchain and virtual currency practice. He is the author of “Bitcoin is Speech Notes Toward Developing the Conceptual Contours of Its Protection Under the First Amendment.”    I assure you this article is about Bitcoin.      For those lucky enough to see The Beatles in Liverpool, watching them go on to become “bigger than Jesus” must have been a mixed bag. Seeing something you loved first become accepted by the entire world is validating, but it also means that thing is no longer just for you. You now have to share it with the world and that risks it losing the qualities that attracted you to it in the first place. Before you know it, your favorite band is just a corporate brand used to sell socks.      Thinking about what it was like to watch The Beatles play some grimy bar is a good analogy to what many bitcoiners are going through at this very moment. In the last few months, it feels like the venue has gotten crowded and that it’s time for Bitcoin to leave to conquer the world.      New voices have entered the space and have changed the way we talk about the Bitcoin network. The conversation is dominated by those speculating about the bitcoin cryptocurrency's use as an investment vehicle for the already wealthy. Fewer and fewer people preach its role as a tool for democratizing finance. It is essential that throughout this bull run, as we celebrate the rewards that come with being at the right place at the right time, that we remember what makes Bitcoin unique and fight like hell to keep it that way.      Bitcoin is a network. That's its magic. It isn't like a stock or a bond or even like gold. It is just a powerful system that allows people all over the world to privately interact with one another in a manner that is wholly unconcerned with whether any institution or government likes it or not.      That is the revolution.      Bitcoin is not large PayMent [trademarked] processors allowing its customers to purchase, but never hold, bitcoin directly or the marginal efficiencies available to those wishing to transfer millions of dollars between corporate treasuries. Those types of things, and the general influx of institutional investors looking for a hedge against the dollar are fine and maybe even necessary for hyper-Bitcoinization to occur, but it’s not what makes Bitcoin special.      The ability to directly and discreetly transact with one another is what makes Bitcoin special. It is imperative on all of us lucky fools who got to see Bitcoin when it was still playing at the Cavern to remind people why that was, and is still, so important.      See also: Justin Wales – Why Bitcoin Is Protected by the First Amendment      The next year will be a lot of fun, but also a time when many new voices will be given a space to propose ways to take Bitcoin mainstream. In the goal of attracting institutional investors, many will cheer on regulations that undercut our ability to transact with Bitcoin without institutional or governmental approval. In other words, regulations that aim to change the fundamental characteristic that made Bitcoin special in the first place.      We already see this happening with rumors of impending regulations on the ability to send funds to self-hosted wallets from money service businesses and exchanges. Such restrictions are bad for Bitcoin and privacy generally and will require a lot more than retweets to be stopped. With your newfound gains, I recommend donating money to groups like Coin Center that fund research and advocacy focused on upholding the principles of liberty and privacy that were so vital to Bitcoin's founding.    As bitcoin becomes corporatized, it is imperative that its first objective of democratizing finance through disintermediation endures.    One last thing about the Beatles: I do genuinely love them. There is no better music made, as far as I am concerned. Because being a Beatles fan is so core to my identity, I have been gifted a lot of Beatles merchandise over the years. Last year, someone bought me a collection of officially licensed Beatles dress socks back before virus regulations shuttered my law office. Not 10 minutes after I put on a pair of these socks, I felt a tear and, sure enough, I tore a hole in the sock. I sat there looking down at my big toe popping out of John Lennon's torso under the words ""REVOLUTION."" I realized right then that these socks had nothing to do with The Beatles. It was just a product created to make a buck without offering me anything that made The Beatles special other than its branding.      It was a product masquerading as something revolutionary. How pathetic.      My bet is Bitcoin will be around for a long, long time. As large institutions and the CNBC crowd continue to recognize it as an investment opportunity, there will be an increasing number of ways for people to interact with ""Bitcoin."" But at some point, we're going to need to ask ourselves whether the things we brand as bitcoin are so centralized and overregulated that they no longer work toward achieving Bitcoin’s original goal of spurring a financial revolution.      As these “bitcoins” become corporatized and regulated into the mainstream, it is imperative that Bitcoin’s first objective of democratizing finance through disintermediation endures. The alternative is Bitcoin loses the very innovative principles that allowed it to grow in the first place and becomes just another product masquerading as something revolutionary.

42405596,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWIM,1608475439,Where Peer-to-Peer Finance Grabbed Hold This Year,"This past year will forever be marked as the global pandemic took hold of everything from our health and safety to financial security. It was a year of mass economic devastation, of ineptitude at the highest level and agitation for change growing from the bottom up.      It was also a year that crypto came into its own – perhaps because it is the people’s money, unfettered by dysfunction at the top. Despite a minor scare in mid-March – when bitcoin collapsed 55% in one day, bottoming at $3,782 – it quickly bounced back, and even (perhaps ironically) gained recognition as a safe haven asset. Hedge funds, billionaires and publicly traded corporations have allocated treasuries to bitcoin, to say nothing of the little guys.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Ray Youssef is CEO and co-founder of Paxful.    This year, the on-ramps got bigger and easier to use, and more people than ever have begun holding and trading cryptocurrencies. And, as online wallets and apps continue to improve, we will likely see more people enter the fold in the coming years.    Bitcoin shines    Nearing the end of 2020, several headlines rocked the cryptocurrency world. The biggest, perhaps, was news that PayPal partnered with Paxos to bring crypto functionality to its 300 million plus users. While the service was limited to a few large-cap coins – bitcoin, ether, litecoin and bitcoin cash – it drove a new bitcoin rally and reignited a conversation over the mass adoption of digital assets. This renewed confidence will only continue to gain momentum as we cross the threshold into 2021.      Then there were the institutional high fliers who changed their outlook on bitcoin. Legendary hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones committed to storing a percentage of his net worth in bitcoin, while a leaked internal document from Citibank revealed that a senior analyst predicts bitcoin could reach $318,000 by December 2021.      See also: Byrne Hobart – PTJ on BTC: Bitcoin Is Now the Macro Big Bet      As participation from the largest names in traditional finance continues to expand, 2021 will see limitless possibilities and further news of high-net worth individuals betting on bitcoin. And while bitcoin trading has not reached a volume where it is stable enough to be considered a true safe asset like gold, it has and will continue to show more and more inflation-resistant characteristics.      It’s likely that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will start decoupling from traditional assets, which may drive more institutions to add BTC to their treasuries. While additional fiscal stimulus was paused by a divided U.S. government, this only resulted in pressure on the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet and pump trillions of dollars into the global economy.    Bitcoin is the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies    It’s for all these reasons and more, bitcoin has a chance to continue to take market share from gold. With a current market cap of $300 billion, and gold’s at $10 trillion, it will only require a fraction of these assets to shift in order to change the dynamic of “inflation hedges.”    Stablecoins find a stable home    Though bitcoin is the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies and has proven its ability to empower people through its decentralized, uncensorable monetary system, stablecoins have emerged as a necessary tool to further these economic and social aims.      In the emerging world, stablecoins have proved to be a hedge against volatility and inflation. This was seen by growing use in Nigeria, South Africa and Turkey, as the naira, rand and lira faltered.      Stablecoins pegged against stronger currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro will continue to help preserve the wealth of everyday people who do not want to expose themselves to the volatility of purer cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether. It’s a trend I expect to continue to unfold.      See also: Bitcoin Dissidents: Those Who Need It Most      The explosive growth of stablecoin volumes will remain an agitator for central banks across the world to continue the research and development of creating central bank digital currencies (CBDC).    Location, location, location    Nigeria, China, India, the U.S. and Vietnam have become the main markets for peer-to-peer finance and have the potential to be leaders across the ecosystem.      These countries have managed to implement their own use cases for remittances, a major market in which bitcoin is unrivaled. For instance, Paxful’s global volume increased by nearly 31% this year. As more and more people adopt digital remittances, traditional remittance methods will be forced to take a backseat to bitcoin’s ease of use, lower fees and global availability.      The rise of price across cryptocurrencies is the result of growing societal and governmental dysfunction. The mainstream is awakening to a future of digital assets.

42405598,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWKK,1608463146,Dogecoin Jumps 20% After Musk's Twitter Shout-Out; Bitcoin Joke Spurs Dialogue With Saylor,"Why Elon Musk was tweeting about dogecoin early Sunday morning is anyone’s guess. But the small cryptocurrency spiked 20% following the SpaceX CEO’s weekend Twitter antics. It also started a dialogue with MicroStrategy CEO and noted bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor.    At 9:30 UTC, Musk opened Twitter and wrote to his 40 million followers, ""One word: Doge.""  DOGE immediately spiked to $0.0047, its highest mark since early July. At press time, some of the gains had been retraced with DOGE trading hands at $0.0045 on Binance.  Musk also fired off a series of entertaining – and often racy – bitcoin tweets (here, here, here, here). In one he said, ""Bitcoin is almost as BS as fiat money,"" which could be construed as a backhanded compliment if one tries hard enough.  One of those R-rated bitcoin tweets prompted a response from MicroStrategy's Saylor, who has famously loaded up his company's treasury with bitcoin.  ""If you want to do your shareholders a $100 billion favor, convert the $TSLA balance sheet from USD to #BTC. Other firms on the S&P 500 would follow your lead & in time it would grow to become a $1 trillion favor,"" Saylor wrote.  Musk soon replied: ""Are large transactions even possible?"" To which Saylor responded: ""Yes I have purchased over $1.3 billion in #BTC in past months & would be happy to share my playbook with you offline - one rocket scientist to another.""  While that back-and-forth between billionaires prompted comments from others, including one from Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of crypto exchange Binance best known as ""CZ"", neither Musk nor Saylor has responded since.  Dogecoin, a meme-based cryptocurrency, made headlines in July after TikTok users started a campaign dedicated to pushing the price of 1 DOGE above $1, per CoinDesk's prior reporting.  Tweeting about dogecoin is nothing new for Musk. The billionaire inventor has called dogecoin his ""fav cryptocurrency"" in the past (abbreviation for ""favorite"") in addition to temporarily including the label ""CEO of Dogecoin"" in his Twitter account biography. Sunday morning, Musk's account describes him as ""Former CEO of Dogecoin.""  At last check, dogecoin reached a total market capitalization of $588 million, per OnChainFX.
