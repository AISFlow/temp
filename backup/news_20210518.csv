42434370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCTZh,1621378511,Coinbase CEO Armstrong Lobbies US Lawmakers as Crypto Scrutiny Ramps Up,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recapped his week of mingling with U.S. lawmakers in the nation’s capital in a 21-tweet thread on Friday complete with a couple of selfies with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and former Speaker Paul Ryan, now a partner at Boston private equity investment firm Solamere Capital.      “I spent most of this week in D.C. meeting with members of Congress and heads of various federal agencies,” Armstrong tweeted.      The goal of his visit was to “establish relationships and help answer questions about crypto,” Armstrong continued, adding he wanted to see what could be done to improve regulatory clarity in the crypto space.      Armstrong’s Washington, D.C., trip came a month after Coinbase became the first cryptocurrency exchange to go public in the U.S. via a direct listing on Nasdaq. He went to Washington as part of the newly formed Crypto Council for Innovation (CCI), an alliance of crypto leaders aimed at promoting crypto use and regulation around the world. Besides Coinbase, CCI is supported by firms including Square, Paradigm and Fidelity.      Although a number of bills concerning the regulation of virtual assets have been introduced to Congress, the most consequential bill so far passed the U.S. House of Representatives in April. Known as the Eliminate Barriers to Innovation Act of 2021 (H.R. 1602), the bill stands to provide much needed regulatory clarity and calls for the creation of a digital asset working group with representatives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).      Industry advocates also want Congress to act on crypto taxation and improve the murky tax guidelines. Clarification on taxes has been particularly slow. On Monday, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced a tax bill that will protect taxpayers from penalties on certain gains or losses on forked assets. The bill was originally introduced in 2018, and again in 2019.      On Friday, the Coinbase CEO tweeted that some reactions, particularly from Senator Krysten Sinema (D-AZ) and Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), were “very positive” while he thought “skeptics” like Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) left with an open mind. All three lawmakers were tagged in the tweet.      Representatives for Sinema, McHenry and Warner did not respond to requests for comment.      In September 2020, Armstrong sparked controversy when he announced that his firm was apolitical, and offered severance packages to workers who were not comfortable with the company’s direction. Just months later, the New York Times published a report in which former employees of color at Coinbase accused the firm of discrimination.",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/18/coinbase-ceo-armstrong-lobbies-us-lawmakers-as-crypto-scrutiny-ramps-up,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c8f7b6f904b0545db9db961bd1b7fe5f635ac4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434382,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCTxh,1621375643,Crypto Traders Can Automate Legal Requests With New DoNotPay Services,"Robot lawyer platform DoNotPay is expanding to cryptocurrency businesses, offering a suite of services to automate the drafting and sending of legal letters to crypto exchanges.      Joshua Browder, DoNotPay’s founder, started the chatbot subscription service after moving to the U.S. from England and receiving a number of parking tickets, he said.      “I was writing the same letter over and over and thought, ‘This could so easily be automated,’” he said. “I started it by accident because I'm a bad driver [but] people were writing in with all the other problems they had. Lawyers were charging hundreds of dollars an hour.”      Over the past five years, the service offered letters for securing bank fee refunds, canceling subscriptions and suing robocallers. The expansion to crypto perhaps reflects the mainstreaming of digital assets, where Robinhood natives seize on the latest crypto coin of the moment with reckless abandon.      DoNotPay has now developed five products designed to send letters to crypto exchanges for a variety of purposes, such as asking exchanges to unfreeze funds. The service also plans to accept bitcoin and ether as payment starting on June 1.      “The first [form] is for getting funds frozen and unfrozen much more quickly, so we compiled all the laws around the freezing and unfreezing of funds, and we force the exchange to back up [their policies],” he said.      Another service will track funds stolen through hacks and notify exchanges if the stolen funds land in an exchange wallet.    Read more: ‘So Many Locked Out’: Binance Users Say Their Accounts Have Been Frozen for Months    Other services include reporting pump-and-dump schemes to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, filing exchange disputes and tracking airdrops.      “I think these big companies know the consumers are powerless if the disputes are small so we want to be the person that comes in [and helps],” Browder said.      DoNotPay is limited to providing legal letters for small claims, he said. It won’t replace the services of an actual lawyer with bigger issues.      “Our limitation is we don’t have people go into the courtroom, so any sort of dispute over $10,000 or more we could never do,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | BNB,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/18/crypto-traders-can-automate-legal-requests-with-new-donotpay-services,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/380ac6096e9f74e878268f02aadd8ec1e4aab27d-1920x1281.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434374,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCTfh,1621372653,Why Cathie Wood's ARKK Is Still Betting on Coinbase,"The overarching narrative of the stock market is in the midst of a deep realignment, with one of the largest shareholders of Coinbase, the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, at the center of attention. As tech hype cools and interest rates seem poised for a big shift, more speculative “growth” investments, primarily equity in quickly expanding or innovative companies, are having a rough few months. In their place there’s more interest in so-called “value” investments, such as equity in companies that are already generating profits.      That has led to deep losses and varying degrees of embarrassment for investors who’ve made highly forward-looking bets. The tech-focused Nasdaq index has seen big volatility and is currently flat against its mid-January level. High-profile professional growth investors like Chamath Palihapitiya, just months ago a relentless and celebrated champion of a kind of less-transparent initial public offering known as a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), have taken both financial and reputational hits.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    A lot of attention has been focused on Ark Invest, which manages exchange-traded funds investing in things like fintech, genomics and space exploration. Ark CEO Cathie Wood had become something of an investing rock star in recent years, thanks to a rich 45% annualized return over the past five years in Ark's flagship Innovation Fund (ARKK), which has grown to more than $50 billion in managed assets.      But the fund has dropped by close to 30% since mid-February thanks to serious collapses of its stakes in everything from gene editing to Tesla. ARKK is also one of the largest holders of Coinbase stock, which is similarly down 25% since its IPO on April 14.      By and large, these drops have been driven less by disappointing current performance than shifting expectations about the future – arguably the defining risk of growth investing. Because the present price of growth investments is so dependent on projected returns far into the future, small present changes in a company’s results, positive or negative, can translate into huge impacts on the stock. The pandemic has encapsulated this perfectly: Lockdowns created major spikes in “stay home” tech stocks because trendlines suddenly pointed to immense future growth. However, reopening has pulled those expectations back down to Earth, driving a lot of ARKK's losses.    Read more: Cathie Wood: Ahead of the Curve (Profile)    (This is, it should be said, far preferable to the way some prominent speculative investments worked in the past. A practice known as mark-to-market accounting was widely abused by entities including Enron and Lehman Brothers in the 1990s and 2000s, and basically amounted to letting growth companies disguise themselves as present successes by putting a price on their own future earnings and booking them as present revenue. But that’s a topic for another day.)      Perhaps even more significant than coronavirus pandemic reversals are increases in Treasury bond yields and inflation upticks that might lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates more quickly. Bond yields and interest rates in particular are a direct threat to growth investing because they create more attractive returns on very low-risk investments. At the same time, higher rates make debt and other capital more expensive for growth companies, which typically don’t have the cash flows to fund their own growth.      There’s no real way to escape these sorts of risks when you’re attempting to monetize the future. What matters is how a growth investor responds and, crucially, whether that response follows the same forward-leaning logic as the initial investing thesis. Wood is catching heat right now because of ARKK’s trouble, but her response has been nothing if not consistent. She has repeatedly and loudly declared that the slump in growth stocks is a buying opportunity, with falling prices only amplifying potential future returns.    Higher rates make debt and other capital more expensive for growth companies, which typically don’t have the cash flows to fund their own growth.    Because Ark funds publicize their trades, we know Wood isn’t just talking: ARKK has been steadily buying assets like Square, Twilio, and even Zoom as the stocks head south. The fund is also aggressively buying the dip in Coinbase, growing its position as of today to 624 million shares – 3% of ARKK’s holdings and, incredibly, more than 10% of all Coinbase shares. That’s particularly bold because Coinbase could be described as a growth investment squared: Its own growth is deeply dependent on demand for assets that are, in turn, highly speculative themselves.      I assume Wood’s belief in her bets is sincere, but it’s also just good optics for a growth fund. Halting buys on Coinbase or other bets as they go down would be an implicit admission that previous buys at higher prices were a mistake. Buying an asset that’s slumping in the short term is a strong signal of long-term belief.      Wood’s consistency, along with her track record, appear to have been fairly effective in helping investors keep the faith even in the face of short-term losses. It’s inevitable some will reflexively sell a ticker that drops 30% in four months but, according to Seeking Alpha, ARKK only saw $1 billion in capital outflows, or around 2% of the fund’s total assets, over the past week.      That’s far from amazing, and at that rate it could add up quickly. But it’s also far from a worst-case scenario. Selling future profits to present buyers is as much about credibility and faith as it is about numbers.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $43,324 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $42,658-$45,736 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $3,402 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 0.22% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $3,209-$3,551 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin, cryptocurrency market volatility up    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was down Tuesday by 2.1% as of press time and going as low as as $42,658 around 23:15 UTC (7:15 p.m. ET). BTC was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-day, a bearish signal for market technicians.      Crypto investors seem to be back to hitting the buy button on some cryptocurrencies, however, after the mercurial Elon Musk seems to have slowed his crypto Twitter activity - at least for now.      “Last week, just a few hours before Elon Musk's incendiary tweet about bitcoin, we warned that there was more downside potential than upside potential,” said David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for quant firm ExoAlpha. ”In terms of volatility, it has definitely increased over the last few days, but not to historical stratospheric levels. So there's no panic yet.”      Since the start of April, crypto volatility has cropped up, according to CoinDesk Research data that tracks major blockchain-based assets. BTC volatility is up, although lowest on the spectrum, while ether volatility is pushing 110%, one of the highest as of Monday’s closing data.    It’s all relative    Vishal Shah, founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, said that despite volatility cropping up, he thinks bitcoin is still relatively stable, compared to assets like ETH.      “I think overall volatility feels a bit subdued,” Shah said. “We have been in a large, but measured range for about three months now in BTC.”      Spot bitcoin has ranged from $42,658 to $64,829 (a record high) over the past three months.    Short-term momentum weakens    “Short-term momentum has weakened behind bitcoin, with resistance having been discovered near $60,000, leaving a lower high on the chart relative to April,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst for consulting firm Fairlead Strategies. “Long-term momentum is still positive behind bitcoin despite its weak intermediate-term momentum, favoring a bullish bias beyond the corrective phase.”    Trading volumes increase    Since the start of 2021, bitcoin’s volume numbers have been up, which is always a positive momentum indicator. Over the past year, spot BTC volume averages on eight major CoinDesk 20 exchanges were at $271 million. Since the start of 2021, that average has doubled, at $545 million per day.      While crypto is heading upward Tuesday, Michael Gord, chief executive officer of trading firm Global Digital Assets, noted the most recent Elon Musk-related crypto shakeout is good overall.      “No market can keep going up forever and especially with the recent memecoin craze,” Gord said. “I think this was a healthy dump where projects with no usefulness are being shaken out.”      Read More: Bitcoin Chart Indicator Suggests Worst of Pullback May Be Over    Bitcoin-ether correlation rising    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether, was trading around $3,402 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), up 0.22% over the prior 24 hours.      ETH went as high as $3,551 around 06:00 UTC (2:00 a.m. ET). The asset is near the 10-hour moving average as well as the 50-day, a bullish-to-sideways signal for market technicians.      “Initial support for ether can be gauged by its latest breakout point near $2,038,” said Fairlead’s Stockton. “Intermediate-term momentum is positive but should moderate.”      As of the most recent closing data on Monday, ether’s 90-day correlation to bitcoin was 0.71, which is trending upward after falling since April 19, when it hit a nine-month high of 0.82. Correlation measures how similar two assets perform: A 1 would mean perfect correlation while 0 would mean two assets are totally differentiated.    Retail capitulation    It’s possible increased retail participation might be setting up for a slower market that might have the two assets working more in sync in the weeks and months ahead, at least according to one analyst.      “Only over-leveraged retail players have capitulated,” ExoAlpha’s Lifchitz said.      “Bitcoin and, even more, ether have had a torrid ride over the last six months, so it wouldn't be surprising that they go more or less sideways for a while until a new upward catalyst shows up,” Lifchitz added. “Like Musk announcing that he will focus on building better cars instead of a toaster on wheels, and stop tweeting about crypto.”      Read More: Swiss Asset Manager Valour Launches Cardano and Polkadot ETPs    Other markets    The price of paxos gold (PAXG) token, which is backed by gold, jumped on Monday.

42434381,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCTth,1621368322,Why You Shouldn’t Look at Bitcoin Backwardation Like an Oil Trader,"Bitcoin (BTC) futures on the Chicago-based CME exchange slipped for a few days into ""backwardation,"" a condition sometimes observed in commodities markets where prices on near-month contracts exceed those for further-out delivery dates.      The backwardation appears to have started late last week and continued through early Tuesday. The unusual condition might have been an indication that immediate demand for the cryptocurrency was outstripping supply. Crypto analysts, however, aren’t sure if the interpretation holds for bitcoin.      ""BTC's backwardation does not necessarily imply tighter supply conditions,"" Nathan Cox, CIO at Two Prime Digital Assets, said.      Bitcoin's CME-based futures backwardation was relatively short-lived, as is often the case: The May contract is back to trading at a slight discount to the June contract (this structure is known as contango).      Backwardation refers to a downward sloping futures curve where front-month contracts trade at a higher price than far-maturity contracts. For example, bitcoin's May expiry futures contract traded at a premium of $15 to the June contract early Monday, per data source TradingView. At one point on Friday, the June contract drew a premium of $55 over the July futures.    Backwardation in bitcoin vs. oil    Per Investopedia, backwardation results from ""higher demand for an asset currently than the contracts maturing in the coming months through the futures market."" However, that definition is more applicable to oil markets, where demand is a function of economic growth, and the market often faces tighter supply conditions due to production cuts or a sudden surge in economic activity.      Analysts sometimes also attribute the opposite condition, known as contango, to the cost of storing commodities for longer time periods.      One point of reference might be the futures market for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude – the primary benchmark for U.S. oil prices. That market slipped into backwardation in November 2020, reflecting a supply shortage at the time, in the wake of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' sustained production cuts. WTI prices rallied from $44 in late November to hit multi-month highs near $68 in March this year.      ""Oil spot and futures markets have very different inputs into the calculation, and the oil demand outlook can be quantified much more explicitly than digital assets, which tend to be an indication of pure price expectation versus actual usage or demand,"" Cox said.      West Texas Intermediate futures, which are listed on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), are settled physically.      ""When the WTI contract expires, a quantity of the oil that previously existed only on paper is converted into physical barrels that need to be used or else stored at a major U.S. storage site,"" Reuters noted last year.      However, bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are cash-settled, meaning a credit or debit is issued, marking either a profit or loss in the trading account. In other words, the buyer does not get the actual delivery of coins, which makes the CME futures more of a speculative instrument.      ""Bitcoin is different than oil in that it's mainly speculative,” Ben Lilly, crypto economist at Jarvis Labs, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""What we find is backwardation tends to be more predictive of a reversal or buying opportunity, especially in a bull market.""    BTC backwardation bearish?    So far, the bullish sentiment supposedly conveyed by the recent futures backwardation has failed to translate into higher prices. Bitcoin was trading near $43,000 at press time, having printed a 3.5-month low of $42,142 on Monday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""It points to the fact that future price expectations for BTC are actually lower than spot,"" Cox said.      According to Gamma Point Managing Partner Rahul Rai, the backwardation is hardly a bullish sign. To wit, the condition might represent a bearish sentiment among institutions.      ""CME is a venue for them to get short BTC exposure at scale,"" Rai said.    The carry trade    Rai added that backwardation is not the result of immediate supply squeeze but is driven by institutional arbitrage flow – cash and carry trades, also known as basis trades, seeking to profit from the spread between futures and spot market prices.      ""CME is where institutions execute the short futures leg of the basis arbitrage trade, and hence there is constant selling pressure coming from funds running the cash and carry trade at scale,"" Rai said.      A cash and carry strategy involves selling a futures contract against a long position in the spot market. That way, fund houses pocket a fixed return, as the premium decays over time and converges with the spot price on the expiry date.      Carry traders usually execute the short futures leg in far-month contracts, offering higher premiums than near ones. In the process, they end up pushing the premium on far-month contracts lower.      Another factor that makes the CME futures vulnerable to backwardation is the low retail participation. Despite the bigger lot size, the exchange offers relatively low leverage than its unregulated peers, such as Binance.      Also read: Crypto Exchanges See Fastest Bitcoin Inflows Since ‘Black Thursday’ in March 2020      ""As CME futures have a minimum trade size of five contracts, i.e., 5 BTC, (micro futures only just launched) retail leverage seeking flow, that typically bids up futures over the spot and widens the basis, has primarily been on centralized exchanges rather than CME,"" Rai said.      ""Bitcoin markets statistically spend less than 10% of their time in backwardation,"" Cox said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/18/why-you-shouldnt-look-at-bitcoin-backwardation-like-an-oil-trader,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fe33d848e391b77a0b024e39c2e79fd0ca45fa5-1300x1025.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Michael Hsu, the new acting comptroller, said in prepared remarks that he requested a review of all of the federal bank regulator's pending matters, interpretative letters and guidance, including issues around digital assets and cryptocurrencies.      Much of the OCC's crypto guidance was issued under the administration of former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks, and marked what seemed like a watershed moment for the crypto industry's acceptance from the broader banking sector. Brooks now leads Binance.US.      ""At the OCC, the focus has been on encouraging responsible innovation,"" Hsu said. ""For instance, we created an Office of Innovation, updated the framework for chartering national banks and trust companies, and interpreted crypto custody services as part of the business of banking. I have asked staff to review these actions.""      Hsu said that he intends to keep an open mind but is ""committed"" to ensuring banks remain safe for consumers.      ""My broader concern is that these initiatives were not done in full coordination with all stakeholders. Nor do they appear to have been part of a broader strategy related to the regulatory perimeter. I believe addressing both of these tasks should be a priority,"" Hsu said.      Hsu will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in a hearing that will include all of the U.S.' federal bank regulators.    OCC's crypto rethink    The hearing memo also discusses digital assets and the OCC's crypto-related actions under Brooks' leadership.      It states:    ""Technology is rapidly affecting the financial system, with online lenders, payment processors, and other fintech companies increasingly growing in market share. Consequently, many of these companies desire a national charter that eases the state-by-state burden and allows them to perform bank-like activities, with the OCC and the FDIC in particular allowing firms to engage in banking activities while being subject to less regulations and supervision.""    Still, while Hsu sounded cautious about some of these actions, he noted that fintech firms are not going away.      ""I will expect any fintechs that the OCC charters to address the financial needs of consumers and businesses in a fair and equitable manner and support the important goal of promoting the availability of credit,"" he said. ""Recognizing the OCC’s unique authority to grant charters, we must find a way to consider how fintechs and payments platforms fit into the banking system, and we must do it in coordination with the FDIC, Federal Reserve and the states.""      This year, the OCC has granted three crypto-related firms trust charters: Anchorage, Protego and Paxos. While Brooks was still at the regulatory agency when Anchorage received its trust charter, the other two were granted after his departure.      In a statement, Kristin Smith, executive director of the industry lobbyist Blockchain Association, said:    ""It's not surprising that a newly appointed Acting Comptroller would review recent policy decisions upon showing up to the job. We are encouraged by Acting Comptroller Hsu's nod to the importance of financial innovation, and we hope to be a resource to him in his new position.""    Hsu's remarks come a day after the OCC announced that Chief Counsel Jonathan Gould, who signed many of these interpretative letters, would be departing the regulatory agency.

42434378,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCTph,1621362560,Dave Portnoy Just Wants to Have Fun,"I’m not mad at David Portnoy. It’s impossible to be mad at David Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, semi-professional pizza reviewer and perhaps the world’s most well-known day trader. Yesterday, Portnoy held a “press conference” where he announced he would champion a single altcoin, SafeMoon. It was a move perfectly emblematic of the times: irresponsible, ironic and self-aware.      In the video, which has been viewed 2 million times on Twitter, Portnoy laid out six options representing “the new breed of s***coins” to choose one to diversify his crypto portfolio into. He says he put $40,000 into SafeMoon and will hold the cryptocurrency for the long term. It’s a synthesis of two investment trends that developed over the past year: the outsized role influencers can play in markets and the embrace of meme assets (coins and stocks alike).    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    SafeMoon is a cryptocurrency designed (as the name implies) to pump – and maybe not much else, critics say. It disincentivizes selling by charging a 10% fee on each sale, a portion of which is distributed to holders as a sort of dividend. And by one metric – attention – it’s certainly taken off. But its mechanics, name and the fact that 50% of the total supply is held by creators has set off warning bells.      We’re living through one of the greatest market rallies in history. Propelled by stimulus checks, cheap money and a wave of young investors coming into the market, distortions have taken hold. It’s a period where memes and personality often matter more than due diligence, and where projects that announce themselves as scams are more than welcome.    Read more: Meet the ‘Meme Manager’ Bringing the Legacy Web Into NFTs    ""Why? I don't know f***ing why, it could be a Ponzi scheme,” Portnoy said yesterday, explaining his investment decision. “I like the word 'moon,' because that's where I want to go.” He urged his 2.5 million Twitter followers not to take his words as investment advice and to do their own research.      The video is significant not just for its blatant appeal to greed – something of a signature for Portnoy – but for how clearly it defines this moment where single investors can have outsized impacts on markets. Portnoy calls out Elon Musk for “pulling levers” to affect the price of bitcoin and dogecoin. But in the same category are Roaring Kitty, the amateur stock analyst who catalyzed the GameStop rally, and Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood.      It’s a role Portnoy has played before. During the height of the coronavirus pandemic, he led a pack of mostly millennials and Gen Z investors – the “Davey Day Trader” army – who would plow money into momentum trades. It’s also not his first rodeo with crypto.      In a follow-up presser this morning, Portnoy clarified he liked SafeMoon because it already had a number of backers, it’s difficult to buy and it provides the chance to be early on something. It's also funny. (Cyndi Lauper’s 1983 hit “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” played in the background.)      Indeed, SafeMoon has garnered a number of advocates hoping the crypto will do what the name implies – safely go to the moon. It’s shilled endlessly on Twitter. Fortune reported there could be 2 million SafeMoon holders.      But there are also legitimate concerns that it’s a scam – or at least supports scammy behavior. SafeMoon CEO John Karony has warned publicly that “the core team will never ask for your wallet,” apparently in response to scammers.    Read more: Buying Your First Crypto? 10 Things You Should Know    Crypto analyst and investor Lark Davis compared SafeMoon to known Ponzi scheme BitConnect last month. ""Remember, just because you make money off of a [P]onzi does not change the fact that it is a [P]onzi,"" he tweeted.      “Everybody knows it's a joke, but nobody cares because as long as they get into the joke early enough and sell before the peak they're happy. That's the game,” Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal wrote in his morning newsletter.

The drop in market sentiment follows the past week's plunge in the bitcoin (BTC) price to about $43,200, down from last month's record near $65,000.      The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is now at 21, down from a ""greedy"" level of 73 just last week, according to the report from hosting site Alternative and quoted by Arcane Research, a Norwegian analysis firm.      ""The past week has been filled with fear, uncertainty and doubt, and the bitcoin price has crashed down,"" the Arcane analysts wrote. ""In the past, an extremely fearful market like this has historically presented solid buying opportunities during bull cycles.""      Other market indicators are reflecting that fear, according to Arcane:    The so-called ""Grayscale discount"" has widened to a record 25%. This is the difference between the price of bitcoin, as implied by the trading level of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust shares, and the spot-market price. ""If the discount becomes of sufficient size, this could post a short-term risk for bitcoin,"" according to Arcane. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  Funding rates in the market for bitcoin derivatives turned negative. The funding rates fell below 0% on two separate occasions over the past week – during the May 12 sell-off, and again on Monday as the market reacted to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's latest comments on the cryptocurrency. ""As the market headed downwards yesterday, $1 billion worth of longs got liquidated as the market turned sour."" By Tuesday, according to the report, the funding rate had returned to neutral territory, according to the report.  Short-term price volatility has climbed to the highest level since February. The 30-day volatility is now at 4.5%, indicating that the bitcoin price has been moving 4.5% every day over the past month, on average.

42434389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCU7h,1621357945,Research Shows How SEC Actions Move Markets,"As Gary Gensler takes the helm at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the cryptocurrency industry is awash with questions. What will be the SEC’s new enforcement priorities? Which crypto project will be the next to receive a complaint? Will SEC enforcement actions catalyze the onset of the next ""crypto winter""?      While no one has all the answers, one repeated focal point is what impact SEC actions have on token prices. To analyze the impact, we carried out an analysis of how SEC announcements correlate with short-term price movements.      The takeaway: Depending on the nature of the announcement, the SEC does move markets in directionally intuitive ways, though given the fast-moving nature of the industry and limited data points, it's impossible to know if these trends will continue.    Lindsay Lin is partner and counsel at Dragonfly Capital. Nothing in this article is or should be construed as legal, investment or financial advice. Dragonfly Capital does not hold a position in any of the cryptocurrencies discussed.    One tangential data point is BitConnect: Starting on Jan. 4, 2018, bitconnect coin (BCC) dropped from about $450 per coin to $7 per coin over the course of a month after the company received cease-and-desist orders from Texas and North Carolina securities regulators. Those orders ultimately compelled BitConnect to shut down operations entirely. While those state securities regulators have a narrower scope of jurisdiction than the SEC does, their actions did lead to the demise of BCC.      Obviously, securities regulators certainly can have a large impact on price if a project chooses to shut down. But even if the project decides to continue operations, price can be affected. Why?      First, litigation is a costly and time-consuming process. Most projects already aren’t able to deliver code, products or partnerships fast enough, and litigation is a black hole for the company’s time with discovery, depositions, negotiations, court appearances and everything else. Additionally, the initial stages of securities litigation could cost hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars, leaving much less in the treasury for actual development.      Second, a securities lawsuit tarnishes a project’s reputation, often rightfully so. Potential business partners, investors and employees are hesitant to work with a company that is allegedly operating illegally and may need to imminently shut down. Community members may decide they do not want to bear the regulatory risk of the project and take their talents elsewhere.      Third, most cryptocurrency exchanges are not securities broker-dealers, and so exchanges will likely delist the token to minimize securities risk. That will hurt liquidity and make it more difficult for people to access and use the token.      Fourth, the SEC or another securities regulator may demand that a project register sales of its token as a securities offering. If the project does so, transactions of the token may be allowed to take place only on securities exchanges and applicant tracking systems (ATS), and they would be subject to securities trading restrictions. If the token is a payment token or used for decentralized activity, the friction of registration will almost completely kill its utility.      In short, there would be good reason for the value of a token to drop upon news that the SEC has sued a project.      That said, if a project reaches a favorable settlement with the SEC, it’s a different story. If the settlement requires a monetary fine but otherwise allows the token to trade like normal today, it may cause temporary brand harm but at least the project can continue development. Arguably, the project can even continue its course with greater regulatory certainty.    Analysis    I tracked SEC announcements against certain projects and these project tokens’ subsequent price movements in a one-day, seven-day, 30-day and 90-day timespan. Because a rising market lifts (or pumps) all boats (and vice versa), I examined token prices based on bitcoin's (BTC) price.      This analysis is focused on longitudinal market price impact, so I excluded tokens that were required to repay investors’ contributions, offer rescission to token purchasers and/or register with the SEC as a security, such as bitclave (CAT), dropoil (DROP), gladius (GLA), Paragon’s PRG and Airfox’s AIR. Those tokens aren't publicly traded, and so there’s no market price.      I broke down the remaining tokens into two categories: news of a “favorable” resolution (defined as a settlement or final judgment that does not require rescission or registration of the token) and news of a SEC complaint. I include Kik’s KIN in both categories because Kik progressed in litigation prior to a final judgment.    EOS (“In the Matter of Block.one”)  SALT (“In the Matter of Salt Blockchain Inc. f/k/a Salt Lending Holdings Inc.”)  KIN (“SEC Obtains Final Judgment Against Kik Interactive For Unregistered Offering”)    SEC Complaints:    LBC (“Securities and Exchange Commission v. LBRY, Inc.”)  XRP (“Securities and Exchange Commission v. Ripple Labs et al”)  KIN (“Securities and Exchange Commission v. Kik Interactive Inc.”)  Results    I tracked the closing price of each token on T-1, T, T+1, T+7, T+30, and T+90, with T being the date of the announcement. Afterward, I calculated the percentage change of the price at each date from the close at T-1 to track the delta over time. To illustrate, a 0.00% change at T+7 would mean that the price did not change from T-1.      Projects that achieve a favorable resolution end up maintaining or exceeding the price of their tokens in BTC terms at T+90. They may even see an increase in price on the day of announcement, since a favorable settlement may be perceived as a “victory” and clears up regulatory uncertainty surrounding the token.      On the other hand, projects that are actively undergoing SEC litigation tend to suffer the day of announcement and end up suffering a drop in T+90 price relative to BTC, though in U.S. dollar terms they could be up due to overall market forces. This weakening against BTC suggests these projects may be losing market share and the strength of their ecosystems.      A caveat: There aren’t enough cases to form a rigorous finding. The analysis also doesn’t isolate other shocks that could’ve happened, such as new releases or key executives leaving. It could also be the SEC was more eager to take a favorable resolution during different periods of market activities. That said, a pattern does seem to emerge.      The goal of this article is to provide a surface-level analysis. For those who want to perform a more rigorous analysis, I’d recommend analyzing how a basket of 10 or 20 of the top tokens may move against BTC during the same time period as a control, and factoring in each token’s average volatility via tests of statistical significance.    Takeaway    Based on the data, it seems that projects that reach favorable resolutions with the SEC experience positive price movements against BTC, whereas projects undergoing litigation will experience negative price movements against BTC. However, note that it’s difficult to quantify what should be the true price impact of any such announcement. Thus, it’s difficult to say if a piece of news is “efficiently” priced in.      Market composition also matters. Most cryptocurrencies trade globally and different regulators have different definitions of what constitutes a security. Global traders may not care about the SEC’s designations if they reside in countries where securities laws are more lax regarding crypto. For example, the Japan Financial Services Agency has declared that XRP does not meet the definition of a security under Japanese law, in contrast to the SEC’s stance under U.S. law. Therefore, if the primary trading base of the token are non-U.S. users, prices may justifiably not move as much upon SEC news compared to tokens primarily traded by U.S. users.      As institutional holders, professional market makers, professional traders and more conservative investors (e.g., pensions and endowments) enter the industry and become a more dominant presence relative to retail, it’s likely SEC complaints may have more of an impact. Few parties subject to reporting and/or licensing requirements would want to assume the risk that they may be unlawfully performing unlicensed, unregistered securities activities.      In conclusion, SEC announcements do seem to matter to markets and in directionally rational ways. As the SEC enters a new era of enforcement with Gary Gensler leading the charge, it’ll be interesting to see whether these trends persist.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lindsay Lin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/18/research-shows-how-sec-actions-move-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b28193b57d2c4a74df062f1df5140c65f98c419c-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434385,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCU3h,1621349165,Crypto Exchanges See Fastest Bitcoin Inflows Since ‘Black Thursday’ in March 2020,"Bitcoin inflows to cryptocurrency exchanges surged on Monday by the most in 15 months, blockchain data shows, in what might be a sign of more retail traders looking to liquidate their holdings in a falling market.      Crypto exchanges registered a net inflow of 30,749.89 BTC on Monday, according to the data provider Glassnode. That was the biggest single-day tally since March 12, 2020, when the bitcoin price tanked by 40% amid coronavirus-induced panic selling in the global financial markets – earning the date the moniker of ""Black Thursday.""      Investors typically transfer bitcoins to exchanges when they want to liquidate their holdings. On Black Thursday, for example, exchanges witnessed a net influx of over 40,000 BTC.      Bitcoin fell to $42,102 on Monday, extending the preceding week's 20% decline and hitting the lowest level since Feb. 8, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The sell-off gathered steam over the weekend with some Twitter users suggesting that the U.S. electric car maker Tesla may be selling its bitcoin holdings.      Tesla CEO Elon Musk clarified early Monday that the company has not sold any coins. So far, however, Musk's declaration has failed to lift the cryptocurrency beyond $45,000.      While net inflows spiked on Monday, the majority of the action was concentrated mainly on Binance, a preferred venue for retail investors, as per Glassnode. Meanwhile, the U.S. exchange Coinbase continued to register bitcoin outflows, potentially indicating persistent demand from institutional investors looking to buy the price dip.      ""Coinbase has seen almost entirely net outflows of BTC since breaking last cycles $20,000 all-time high, a trend that has continued this week,"" Glassnode said in the weekly newsletter published on Monday. ""Coinbase is the preferred venue for U.S. institutional accumulation, and given the scale of typical daily withdrawals (10,000 to 20,000 per day), it suggests that larger buyers remain in active accumulation during this correction.""      While Binance received more than 80% (or 26,000 BTC) of the total net inflow of 30,749.89 BTC on Monday, the U.S.-based Coinbase registered a net outflow of 146 BTC.      The two exchanges have seen diverging trends in net flows in recent weeks. The balance held on Coinbase has declined by 34,408 BTC since April 19. Meanwhile, the amount held on Binance has increased by 95,397 during the four weeks.      The magnitude of the net bitcoin flows on Binance has picked up sharply in recent months in a sign of ""volatility in Binance user macro sentiment,"" as noted by Glassnode.      Also read: Bitcoin Chart Indicator Suggests Worst of Pullback May Be Over      ""This provides further indication that the recent inflows are likely to be driven by both new market entrants (panic sellers) and potentially due to capital rotation into other crypto assets,"" Glassnode's weekly newsletter said. For example, some investors could be transferring bitcoin to Binance to snap up alternative cryptocurrencies.      That said, inflows do not imply immediate liquidation, just traders getting into position to make a quick sale, and it's hard to gauge how many of the coins were already liquidated, partly due to limitations on the data.

42434386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPCU5h,1621348200,"State of Crypto: Meet Lael Brainard, the Fed's CBDC Champion","Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard has been one of a handful of prominent regulators addressing crypto over the past five years, from warning regulators to pay attention to crypto in 2016 to addressing central bank digital currencies three years ago to announcing the Fed’s research into a central bank digital currency last year.      Programming note: Next week is CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021. State of Crypto will be published a few days late (next week only!) and as a reminder, I’m moderating sessions with Brad Garlinghouse and Brian Brooks. If you have any questions for either CEO, email nik@coindesk.com, subject line “Consensus question.”    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Studying a digital dollar  The narrative    Three years ago, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard declared that she saw “no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency.” Then came libra, and later COVID-19.      Facebook’s unveiling of a global stablecoin project worried regulators worldwide. Brainard was among those criticizing the effort, revealing in February 2020 that the Fed had already begun researching digital payments and determining what issues may exist around them. The pandemic appeared to accelerate those efforts.    Consensus 2021: Dr. Lael Brainard will appear at CoinDesk's Consensus by CoinDesk, our virtual experience May 24-27, in the ""State of Crypto in China"" track. Register here.    Americans slowed down their spending in the early days of the pandemic, only to increase their spending once stimulus checks began rolling out, Brainard said in another speech last August about the need for a modern, efficient payments system. In that same speech, Brainard announced the Boston Fed was working with MIT to study different technology bases for a possible digital dollar, which could use “innovative technologies” to boost financial inclusion and lower payment costs.      And shortly, Brainard, who will speak next week at CoinDesk's Consensus 2021, went from a skeptic of the idea of a virtual greenback to one of its most prominent champions in Washington.      “The COVID-19 crisis is a dramatic reminder of the importance of a resilient and trusted payments infrastructure that is accessible to all Americans,” Brainaid said in August, explaining why the Boston branch of the Fed was now examining different technologies and how the U.S. central bank can take advantage.    Why it matters    A former Treasury Department undersecretary for international affairs, Brainard has reportedly been in the running for Treasury Secretary and remains an influential government official who has been studying the cryptocurrency sector for years – while in office. Unlike many high-profile government officials who recently entered public service after spending some time at private cryptocurrency companies or researching the technology, Brainard has been in her role at the Federal Reserve since 2014, giving speeches on crypto as long ago as 2016, when she said regulators should engage in the sector.    Breaking it down    “We have been conducting in-house experiments for the last few years, through means that include the Board's Technology Lab, which has been building and testing a range of distributed ledger platforms to understand their potential opportunity and risk,” Brainard said in her August speech.      Officials at the Fed later confirmed this was not just a surface-level drive-by look. The central bank branch was deeply examining up to 40 different technology stacks to see which would best meet its policy goals.      (A spokesperson for the Fed pointed CoinDesk to Brainard’s August 2020 speech but declined to make her available for an interview.)      “Given the dollar's important role, it is essential that the Federal Reserve remain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding CBDCs,” Brainard said.      The speech and subsequent research set Brainard apart as one of the few high-ranking U.S. government officials engaging in digital currency beyond just giving speeches. Others include SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, former CFTC chairmen Chris Giancarlo and Heath Tarbert, CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz and Acting OCC Comptroller Brian Brooks.      Brainard has a long history of being the lone dissenting voice on Federal Reserve policy, a 2019 profile by American Banker noted. At the time of the article’s publication, she had dissented on six different votes. Today, that number is 23, according to a review of public records, with three abstentions.      Notably, Brainard’s dissents tend to come with links to statements explaining the policymaker’s reasoning.      Federal Reserve Vice Chair Randal Quarles seemed to say that Brainard’s dissents in particular may result in “sharpening the resulting proposal,” according to the American Banker article.      All this points to the likelihood that if and when Brainard announces the results of the Boston Fed’s research into CBDCs, we’ll have a better understanding of just how the U.S. would design a digital dollar.      The same Fed spokesperson referred CoinDesk to comments Chairman Jerome Powell made last month at the Federal Open Market Committee. The chair said the U.S. isn’t in a hurry to issue a digital dollar, but would rather “get it right.”      “Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we're going to see some of them around the world. And we need to understand whether that's something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve,” Powell said, referencing the work the Boston Fed is currently conducting into the technology.    The big three (plus one)    The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Chair Jelena McWilliams, said the federal agency is about to publish a request for information to learn how banks are currently interacting with the cryptocurrency sector, how they might interact with crypto in future and what, if anything, the FDIC should be doing.      The actual RFI went live yesterday, giving the general public until mid-July to respond. It asks questions about use cases for digital assets, compliance management, deposit insurance, supervision and other issues.      This comes on top of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is issuing trust charters to cryptocurrency companies and dangling the possibility of treating a crypto firm as a bank, and the Federal Reserve, which is looking into allowing fintech companies and other entities with novel forms of bank charters access to its master accounts.      That’s the game right there. The three main federal banking regulators in the U.S. are either actively letting crypto companies tap into the national banking system or looking into how they might enable crypto-related activities.      The Fed regulates the bank holding companies and certain state-chartered banks, the OCC regulates the actual national banks and the FDIC regulates state chartered banks that aren’t members of the Fed and provides deposit insurance to all these financial institutions.      It’s entirely possible that at some point in future we may have a crypto bank regulated by the different federal regulators that can a) help other crypto and fintech firms gain banking services (which is an ongoing problem, if somewhat less of an issue than it was in years past) and b) provide customers with some comfort if they’re looking to transact with regulated and insured financial institutions.      There’s also the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which recently posted a job listing for an individual who would deal with cryptocurrencies. The posting comes after Vice Chair Kyle Hauptman floated the idea of the NCUA following in the OCC’s footsteps in allowing its regulated entities to interact with crypto.    The Biden Bunch  Changing of the guard    Michael Hsu, acting comptroller at the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, has appointed Benjamin McDonough as senior deputy comptroller and chief counsel. Like Hsu, McDonough comes from the Fed, where he served as associate general counsel. Also like Hsu, McDonough has experience in the bank supervision sector.      Perhaps more pertinent, McDonough will succeed current Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Counsel Jonathan Gould, whose name and signature appear on numerous pieces of guidance the OCC issued granting federally regulated banks permission to interact with the cryptocurrency space. Gould will move back to the private sector, according to the OCC’s announcement.    Elsewhere:  ‘So Many Locked Out’: Binance Users Say Their Accounts Have Been Frozen for Months: My colleague Colin Harper spoke to dozens of Binance users (including those using Binance.US and Binance Australia) about issues they’ve had withdrawing their cryptocurrencies.

Users say they have difficulty contacting the exchanges generally, and it’s often not clear why their accounts are frozen.  SEC Staff Calls Bitcoin ‘Highly Speculative,’ Hints at ETF Skepticism: Initially this felt like a word of warning about bitcoin exchange-traded funds, but members of the SoC Telegram group pointed out this refers more to proposals filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “40 Act”), meaning this isn’t actually a new warning. Basically, a company can file for a bitcoin ETF under two different laws, and the process for approval differs for each (click here for a more in-depth explanation). The SEC last week seems to be reiterating a warning against filing under the 40 Act. Anyways, now I’m wondering how the Elon effect will play with the SEC’s concerns about market manipulation.  Outside CoinDesk:  (Wall Street Journal) A number of major banks are planning to share customer data in an effort to help individuals without credit scores access credit, reports The Wall Street Journal. This program, conducted under the auspices of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under former Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks’ Project REACh effort, may help underserved populations access financial services that were previously out of reach.  (Reuters) Daylight, a new online banking service, is one of a new set of startups aiming to provide financial services to those currently underserved by more traditional banks, including immigrants, members of the LGBTQ community and other minority groups, Reuters reports.

The California-based chip-making giant announced via its blog Tuesday it will apply a reduced ETH hashrate to newly manufactured RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards.  Set to start shipping later this month, the cards will be labelled with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier to “ensure that customers know exactly what they’re getting.”  As the company has stated before, Nvidia said its priority is to ensure its gaming cards end up “in the hands of gamers.”  It first announced in February that all GeForce RTX 3060 graphics cards would ship with a reduced Ethereum hashrate.  It is unclear if the hashrate cuts will affect the overall performance of the graphics cards and not simply curb their mining power. Nvidia did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for clarification.

Specifically, the company has transferred $637 billion and seen a 2023% uptick in transaction volume since 2020.      “In January, we were doing around $60 billion of settlements per month,” said Michael Shaulov, CEO and co-founder of Fireblocks. “Now we are at $124 billion for the last 30 days.”      The company said retail-facing businesses like Revolut, BlockFi Trading and Celsius are boosting growth on the crypto custody platform.      For example, Revolut reported 300,000 new cryptocurrency customers, adding 100,000 of them in the first six days of 2021, a few months after they integrated with Fireblocks. Meanwhile the Celsius Network, an early Fireblock client, announced in April it boosted its growth to 500,000 new users and had over $10 billion worth of digital assets under management.    Read more: Fireblocks Raises $133M to Serve More Megabanks With Crypto Custody    From Q4 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021, Fireblocks has also nearly doubled its client list, from 60 to over 110. Shaulov said it’s not just new clients that are coming to the space; it’s also clients that were in the space and are scaling up.      “There are completely new logos of companies that I haven't seen before and not operating in that space before,” said Shaulov. “We're seeing a lot of traditional asset managers as well as traditional funds stepping in and looking to deploy active strategies in this space.”    Multiparty computation    Part of Fireblocks’ attractiveness to customers is their Multiparty Computation (MPC) approach. MPC allows for large pools of data to stay encrypted while permitting information to be extracted from those data pools using encrypted computations. Other methods include, for example, multisignature (multisig) wallets, which require two or more private keys to sign and send a given transaction.    Read more: MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money    “Multisig just became an infeasible technology for anyone that has to do a high volume of transactions on Ethereum,” said Shaulov. “It just doesn't scale, so the only alternative to do it securely is basically MPC.”      He’d previously told CoinDesk that multiple wallets based on multisig are associated with higher fees than regular, single address transactions, but MPC-based wallets are represented on the blockchain as a single wallet address, with the actual distributed signature computed outside of the blockchain.      “Thanks to Fireblocks, we significantly reduced blockchain fees for ether and ERC-20 token transfers. MPC technology eliminates the multisig smart contract that makes transactions consume additional gas,” said Max Sapelov, co-founder and CTO of CoinLoan in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/18/crypto-custody-firm-fireblocks-has-handled-more-than-500b-in-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d54ed86af6cb37f865aee6b5def6f3585fe9a3c1-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386745,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8X9,1621342833,Banking App Current Picks Polkadot for Its DeFi Debut,"Fintech Current is gearing up for a ""crypto crossover"" on Polkadot.      The financial services app said Tuesday it will integrate Acala, a Polkadot-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, into its core banking product.      It’s a first step toward introducing in-app DeFi tools for Current’s 3 million users, Chief Technology Officer Trevor Marshall said in an interview.      Wonky crypto-finance tools like multichain stablecoin transfers and yield farming, perhaps, won’t be showing up next to Current’s deposit, cash-back and checking account features until later this year, Marshall said. In the meantime, Current will join Polkadot’s validator set.      Current, which last grabbed Web 3 headlines for its copyright lawsuit against a Facebook-backed stablecoin project (whose name and logo have both since changed), said the Acala integration marks its crypto debut after six years of carefully plotting its entrance.      “In some ways, this partnership is really just the beginning of the actual rollout of what we've been building toward this whole time,” Marshall, a self-identified multicoiner, said.      Read more: Facebook’s Calibra Sued by Mobile Banking App Over Similar Logos    Current’s crypto journey    In 2015, Marshall staged a Ripple payments prototype for Current only to find the chain lacking in utility. There was one notable feature: “Now anyone could see your balance,” he said. That was obvioulsy not a good feature, and Current abandoned the crossover.      Marshall followed up three years later with an Ethereum-based process, but the economics just didn’t work; gas prices, high then, are even higher now. Current nixed the crossover.      Current chased both prototypes because it believed that decentralization could help it bring users extra value. “We've been every year kind of checking back in” to see if crypto had a workable crossover, Marshall said.      This year’s checkup yielded Polkadot DeFi and the possibility of generating “real returns"" and “real yield” from the decentralized world.      “It’s only over the last year where we start to see ecosystems like Polkadot starting to gain traction, where it is economically viable to have something where the core mechanic can be truly decentralized,” Marshall said.

42386739,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8Pb,1621342699,India's Developers Are Web 3's Sleeping Giant,"India’s growth story is inevitably tied to its growth as a leading global technology hub. With more than 4.2 million developers, the country is home to the largest talent pool in the world for developer talent.      A large number of blockchain developers should be an advantage for India when it comes to developing blockchain-based applications or improving existing ones. Some data estimates from 2018 indicated that India had the second-largest number of blockchain developers in the world, just behind the U.S. However, blockchain is not quite the fast-growing tech sector in India as it is in the rest of the world.    Tanvi Ratna, a CoinDesk columnist, is the founder and CEO of Policy 4.0, a research and advisory body working on new policy approaches for digital assets.    Some estimates place the size of India’s developer base at over 20,000. While this is a large pool of developers globally, it is a drop in the ocean compared to the 4.2 million+ might of the overall developer ecosystem. It is a known fact that public blockchain and cryptocurrencies have not attracted the attention of India’s top developer talent to the same degree as AI, ML and other emerging technologies. The stigma around cryptocurrency holds back Indian developers who are skeptical of the country’s regulatory environment.      Starting from 2013, the Reserve Bank of India issued regular cautionary guidance against cryptocurrencies, citing market volatility, risk and no legal recognition for cryptocurrency. The developer ecosystem in India was starting to grow with the bitcoin boom in 2017-2018. However, that came to a halt when, in April 2018, the central bank issued a circular prohibiting the banking system from dealing with entities dealing in virtual currency. The ecosystem went into a veritable freeze and the chilling effects of regulation have been felt for a long time, arguably even today.    Read more: India’s Millennials Embrace Digital Gold Despite Proposed Bitcoin Ban    In 2019, the central government released a report with its position on virtual currencies, preferring a complete ban on the instruments, with a draft legislation for the same. After the Supreme Court struck down the RBI circular as being unconstitutional, the industry could finally move again.      In February of this year, it appeared that a legislative move for a ban was possible, and recent challenges with banking access have reinforced the image that the sector has far too complicated regulations and may not guarantee job security. In such an environment, both the evolution of the industry and the agility of local pioneers are tested.    Regulations dictates India’s blockchain ecosystem    While India’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies has been negative, there has been very vocal support for blockchain technology by policymakers. The focus on distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications created a divergent path for some developers, who chose to focus on enterprise applications.      However, three years on, there are as yet no large-scale enterprise blockchain applications live in India. Most DLT developers have been limited to proof of concepts or pilots for the most part. Some have worked on large overseas projects as an outsourced vendor. The scale for such applications within India remains limited.    Read more: Tanvi Ratna: China’s Digital Yuan Blurs the Lines Between CBDCs and Crypto    India has gone through its own journey in the blockchain hype cycle. The year 2017 saw a large wave in cryptocurrency projects with the initial coin offering boom. By 2018, most large IT majors in India – Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Infosys – had formed blockchain teams, conducting active meetups, conferences, and contributions to code. Various companies were starting to explore pilots and proofs of concept, and even consortium approaches were being experimented with – the most well-known of these was Bankchain, a consortium led by one of the largest banks in India. Most top-tier cities in India saw a rise in developer activity with the adoption of DLT by big conglomerates like Tata and Infosys, along with several crypto trading companies and active blockchain meetups in India.      After the circular of April 2018 and the government of India report of 2019, activity in the ecosystem dropped considerably, with most participants going back to their Web 2 jobs. After the Supreme Court verdict of 2020, the renewed crypto bull run and the rise in global institutional acceptance, the industry in India has seen a new wave of investors and developers.      Anecdotal evidence from some startups suggests that many of the participants in this wave may not be from 2017 but are new participants, either investing or developing in crypto for the first time. Multiple projects are also drawing in new rounds of funding from global investors, adding to the activity in the sector. However, recent developments of a possible ban and issues with bank access, are raising the same questions around legitimacy.    Indian startups operate with multiple challenges    The gray zone under which cryptocurrencies currently operate in India throws up multiple challenges for developers, notably around registrations and the management of tokens. At the same time, good blockchain developers are in short supply.      There is a dearth of high-quality formal training programs for blockchain developers, a direct consequence of regulatory and market forces. This reduces the channels to hire quality developers. In addition, with the high degree of decentralized work in the industry, some firms find it even harder to find the right talent at the right time.      “We spoke to some Indian projects who were hiring engineers from outside India for their projects because they simply couldn’t find developers for their project easily,” said Jason Rodrigues, who handles India operations for Celo, a mobile-first decentralized finance (DeFi) project.      Finding and hiring developers is fairly unorthodox, with a focus on social media and code contributions. “We track Discord discussions and GitHub submissions to identify talent,” says Samyak Jain of Instadapp, a DeFi wallet project. Hackathons have also served as a central plank of building the ecosystem and finding talent in India. A lot of the post-prohibition growth of the blockchain developer community has been sustained through hackathons and community meetups, rather than any structured programs.    Read more: Tanvi Ratna: Visa and PayPal Can Be the Cosmos and Polkadot of CBDCs    Additionally, there exists a strong competition for talent. Because the market is global and decentralized, good developers can easily tap into international opportunities that pay anywhere from two to five times the rates for Indian developers. This creates further pressure on indigenous projects. Most projects have taken on the strategy of upgrading the skills of Web 2 developers for Web 3. This comes with its own challenges because building code is sometimes the least complex aspect of building for blockchain.      A common challenge with Web 2 developers is orienting them to the privacy, security and transparency aspects necessary in a public blockchain. “The idea that you can’t outsource all security to your cloud provider is a different one than what most Web 2 developers are used to,” says Mayur Relekar, founder of Newfang, a decentralized storage platform.      A lot of improving skills of these Web 2 developers often has to do with the new philosophy of Web 3 architecture than the actual code, where concepts such as wallets, key storage, encryption and the security of the network hold the major weight. Understanding the cryptocurrency market, understanding financial products and their composability, being able to create such products through smart contracts – Web 2 developers in India are not actively engaged with these ideas.      Although India has all the capabilities to be a leading hub for blockchain talent globally, developer interest in the technology is yet to go mainstream. Application and software development has been a forte of Indian developers for close to two decades. However, engagement on Web 3 development remains low in the country.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,Tanvi Ratna,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/18/indias-developers-are-web-3s-sleeping-giant,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd27429d75ee2817b68073aec956ce8720804db7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8iT,1621335514,Foundry's Mike Colyer on US-China Mining Rivalry and Why Clean Bitcoin 'Makes No Sense',"Mike Colyer leads one of North America’s biggest crypto mining companies, Foundry. Owned by Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk's parent company), the startup emerged in 2019 and has quickly come to exemplify a trend: the comeback of U.S. crypto mining after years of living in the shadows of China’s greater hash power.      We caught up with Colyer for a preview of his thoughts on the China vs. U.S. rivalry in bitcoin mining, institutional adoption and the controversial concept of “clean bitcoin.”    Consensus 2021: Mike Colyer will appear at this year’s CoinDesk’s Consensus conference on Monday, May 24, in a track entitled “Big Capital: How North America is Finding Its Spot in the Global Hashrate Race.” Register here.    The following has been edited lightly for brevity and clarity.       CoinDesk: Foundry is aimed at institutional clients. Why should they start mining bitcoin and other assets? What’s wrong with just holding?      Decentralized infrastructure means anybody in the world can participate in these networks. It opens up an incredible opportunity. With mining, these computers are basically securing the Bitcoin network and you get paid to secure the Bitcoin network. It's an incredible concept and we're seeing more institutional players recognize it.  In the early days, bitcoin, you could mine it on your PC. Then it moved from CPU to GPU mining for basic mining. And then it became more about who's got the capital to deploy large amounts of these computers. In the last bull run, every once in a while you'd get somebody who would deploy, say, $1 million worth of machines. Today, people are making $10, $20, $30 million purchases of equipment. And it's scaling. It's not a question of ‘are the institutions going to get into this game?’ They're already here, and they're doing it.    Can China control the Bitcoin network? It really can't. But for the uneducated, there's a perception it could, and therefore they don't get involved.    In the next phase, we’re going to see energy companies realize they can combine bitcoin mining to make their energy projects more cost effective. They’re already experimenting with this and we’re going to see them deploy significant amounts of money in the space. After that, the next wave will be nation-states having a strategy around bitcoin mining, just like they have a strategy around gold mining or any natural resources.      You definitely have to bet counter-cyclical if you want to make the big returns. But if you're in it for the long term, I think, you can see a good, steady return on your investment over time. If bitcoin were to crash, the network is going to adjust the difficulty over time and you can still make money in the downside cycle of the industry. So it kind of protects the downside. And if you're investing longer term, there's an additional premium over the value of bitcoin.      In the long term, bitcoin mining is going to be more like a utility. You buy a utility stock because it's stable and it's gonna produce a dividend over time. And I think the same thing is true for bitcoin mining. We're just in the early stages where it's a little more volatile.      Does the U.S. need a national mining strategy?      We put a big focus on helping decentralize the Bitcoin network, so we wanted to get more hashrate into North America. The U.S. was behind the game early on, and China got out to a fast start on bitcoin mining. But what we've seen over the last three years is bigger institutional players got into the game and they started building out large data centers.      Last year, we saw they were short on cash to buy the next-generation machines. And that's why we decided to launch Foundry. We launched an equipment financing business to help get them the cash to buy these machines, so they could get more hash power into North America. A significant amount of the equipment is now being purchased by North American miners. And we're seeing a lot of hashrates start to come to the U.S.      It's very important long term for the U.S. to have a proactive strategy around bitcoin mining. I think it's done differently in the U.S. in the sense that we're capitalists, we're a democracy, we're a capitalist society. So I think it's around creating a regulatory environment. And today it's very friendly for it to just flourish. We're seeing this with the different states.    Read more: Kentucky Governor Signs Tax Breaks for Crypto Miners Into Law    Kentucky is passing laws to entice miners to come there. The governor of Texas is tweeting on how great Texas is for mining. Of course, though, New York just continues to make announcements on how it wants to kill business in New York.      I'm glad the internet was essentially created and funded out of the United States. And I'm glad Google calls the U.S. home. Because I think that does provide a different online experience because of that. We want to have a strong footprint in blockchain technology so we can help guide where this thing goes over time and a big part of it starts with the infrastructure.      China still dominates hash power. Should we worry about it taking over somehow?      We feel like there's a certain percentage of people who are not investing in bitcoin because of this narrative that China controls the mining space, or bitcoin is controlled by China. We feel very strongly about killing that narrative so more people [can] feel comfortable getting involved with bitcoin.      The reality is, yes, China does have a lot of the hashrate; yes, it does have a monopoly right now on the pools or it did have a monopoly on the pools. But there really is not much it could do to attack Bitcoin or control Bitcoin, right? If all of a sudden China says we now control 60% of the Bitcoin network and we're going to 51% attack it, naturally we’re going to see a fork in Bitcoin. There's going to be a China version and there's going to be a rest-of-the-world version.      If you go back in time it actually played out that way in 2017, with the big block-small block war. Bitcoin did fork and we had Bitcoin Cash. And where's that today? It's essentially irrelevant.    Read more: Mining Bitcoin for Heat, Strawberries and Chickens    So can China control the Bitcoin network? It really can't. But for the uninformed, there's a perception it could and therefore they don't get involved. And that's why it's been really important for us to kind of rebalance it from a perception perspective.      Sometimes we're talking about a national competition between these two countries. But when you peel it back and you look at U.S. citizens and Chinese citizens, we're trying to do the same thing. We're trying to build and strengthen the Bitcoin network. So we all have a bigger goal in mind. That's why I'm involved in Bitcoin. I think we're building out a solution to the world's problems. And it is a totally unifying technology. We're not really competing with each other. We're trying to build something much greater than any one of us. And that’s really gratifying.      Is there much demand from your clients for so-called “clean bitcoin?”      I've been in the mining space for four years. In that time everyone has talked about a premium for virgin coins or newly minted coins. But I have yet to find anybody anywhere who has been willing to pay a premium for those coins.    So, in my mind, it's more of a marketing kind of gimmick.    The idea that there's like a special claim on certain coins just doesn't make any sense to me. They’re fungible. But if somebody does want to pay extra for a newly minted bitcoin, I have lots available and I'm more than willing to sell those at a premium. Give me a call! We can definitely help you.      But we haven't found anybody who's actually willing to pay a premium. So, in my mind, it's more of a marketing kind of gimmick. And, you know, when you start peeling it back, the concept doesn't even really make a lot of sense. Because, you know, every time you mine a block, you're adding it to the last block, and you're basically validating all transactions that ever existed on the Bitcoin network and you strengthen that network. Also 18.6 million bitcoin have already been mined and are in existence. There's only 2.5 million bitcoin left. Are those all going to be special coins? I don’t think so.

Announced Tuesday, the funding was co-led by Dawn Capital and Target Global, and included Illuminate Financial Management as well as existing investors LocalGlobe and MMC Ventures.      Dawn Capital and Target Global led Copper’s Series A funding in February 2020, bringing total capital raised to date to $60 million.      The safekeeping of digital assets is a crucial component for large or traditional institutions looking to enter the cryptocurrency space and specialist crypto custodians have become desirable entities, evidenced by a slew of recent acquisitions and partnerships.      Copper’s muscular raise broadly reflects the bull run that has been happening across the cryptocurrency industry in the last several months.      “We have seen revenue and client growth tripling in the course of around the quarter, and meeting that demand has created some challenges, but in a good way,” said Copper CEO Dmitry Tokarev in an interview. “We are involved in a lot of conversations with financial institutions, with something like 84 NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] in place.”      See also: Copper Now Enables Funds to Create Complex Crypto-Backed Securities      Tokarev said Copper currently has some 200 staff and plans to double that number over the next 18 months or so.      Asked if Elon Musk’s recent tweets about possibly selling off Tesla’s bitcoin holdings might lead to a cooling down of companies looking to add crypto to their balance sheet, Tokarev said: “We have a long-term vision of how financial market infrastructure will evolve.

42386753,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBV8hD,1621332218,Bitcoin Chart Indicator Suggests Worst of Pullback May Be Over,"Bitcoin's bull market correction may be coming to an end, according to the relative strength index (RSI) – a technical indicator widely used to gauge momentum and identify overbought and oversold conditions.      The 14-week RSI has now dropped to 53.00, a level that has consistently acted as solid support and marked an end of corrective pullbacks during the 2016-2017 bull run.      The RSI support has come into play as bitcoin charted a 35% drop from $64,801 to $42,000 in the past four weeks. While Twitter comments from Tesla CEO Elon Musk look to have scared some retail investors into selling, there were already signs of exhaustion in the market. Whales had started moving money out of bitcoin, leaving less-wealthy investors struggling to do the heavy lifting above $60,000.      However, the bull market looks intact, with the cryptocurrency still up 365% year on year and evidence of long-term investors buying the dip. Coupled with the weekly RSI hovering at historically strong support, that suggests the cryptocurrency may soon resume its uptrend.      Bitcoin is showing signs of life at press time, trading 4% higher on the day at $45,300, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      As shown above, bitcoin saw at least four significant corrections during the 2016-2017 bull run that ended with the weekly RSI near 53.00.      The make-or-break level was finally breached in January 2018, marking bitcoin's entry into a bear market. What followed was almost a year-long sell-off to as low as $3,200.      Since then, crossovers above and below 53.00 have served as reliable indicators of bullish/bearish trend changes. The RSI moved above 53.00 in April 2019 and April 2020, kicking off major price rallies. Meanwhile, drops below the level in September 2019 and February 2020 brought significant losses.      While the weekly RSI is currently hovering at strong support, the daily RSI is signaling oversold conditions with a below-30 print.      ""From a technical point of view, the price is finding some support from the 200-day exponential moving average, plus other momentum indicators such as the RSI, which shows that the price is somewhat oversold,"" said Simon Peters, cryptoasset analyst at multi-asset investment platform eToro.      Also read: As Newbies Panic in Latest Bitcoin Correction, Old Pros Appear to Buy on the Dip      ""This means there is a possibility of buyers now stepping in to push prices up and, as we have seen before, investors waiting on the side lines are already using the sell-off we have seen to invest in cryptoassets, taking advantage of the volatility,"" Peters added.

Along with financier Gilbert Armenta, Ignatova and OneCoin were certified as being in default according to documents filed in a U.S. federal court in New York on Monday.  The case commenced in May 2019 with Ignatova and OneCoin accused of defrauding millions of investors of more than $4 billion in a Ponzi-like scheme.  Investors were told OneCoin could be mined and had actual value, though in fact it did not exist on a blockchain and its perceived value was manipulated by automatic generation of new coins.  The documents filed Monday stated the defendants had “not filed an answer or otherwise moved with respect to the complaint.""  Earlier in the case, plaintiffs Christine Grablis and Donald Berdeaux were warned by the judge in the Southern District of New York that they risked jeopardizing the case by not filing regular paperwork on efforts to serve court papers to the defendants.  According to the latest documents, they had served papers to Ignatova, who is wanted by U.S. and other authorities after disappearing in late 2017.

Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) first presented the Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets Act in 2018 and then again in 2019 to address what critics have viewed as a gap in the IRS’ approach to taxing income derived from hard forks.  In October 2019 guidance, the Internal Revenue Service said any new cryptocurrency generated by hard forks (when blockchains split into two networks, each with a native asset) would count as taxable income.  The IRS' determination followed a letter earlier that year from Emmer and other lawmakers asking the agency to clarify its policies on cryptocurrency.  In a press release Monday, Emmer said the latest IRS guidance has ""unfairly punished"" those investing in an emerging technology, adding that ""what has been issued by the IRS so far is not pragmatic.""
