The program, which will include Quiznos’ high-traffic Denver airport location, will launch in mid-August, the companies said.  Quiznos customers who download the Bakkt App, purchase bitcoin and use it to pay for their next meal at select locations will receive a $15 bitcoin reward.  Bakkt Chief Revenue Officer Sheela Zemlin said that the firm would ""closely watch how this pilot performs, with the potential to expand the partnership to additional Quiznos locations across the country.""  Bakkt has been recruiting retail chains and other businesses to its app, which it launched in 2019 to make it easier to execute bitcoin transactions. Bakkt App users can pay for products and services in bitcoin, use bitcoin in tandem with loyalty and rewards points programs or convert bitcoin to gift cards and cash.  Mark Lohmann, president of Rego Restaurant Group, Quiznos' parent company, said that working with Bakkt was appealing primarily because it would allow Quiznos “to accept bitcoin directly at the point of sale” quickly and smoothly.  “As we continue our digital transformation journey and respond to mobile and millennial consumer demand for alternative and cryptocurrency payment options, we are excited to offer yet another accessible way for customers to buy a meal,” Lohmann said.

XTZ, YFI and NU Are Out","The CoinDesk 20 ranks the most heavily traded assets in crypto, as measured by dollar volume on trusted exchanges. As such, it defines a core group of 20 digital assets that matter most to the crypto markets. The reconstituted list, which went live on Tuesday on the CoinDesk website, incorporates one new asset not seen before in the list: MATIC.  MATIC is the native currency of a layer-2 network built on top of the Ethereum blockchain known as Polygon. Polygon’s end goal is to provide an improved user experience for Ethereum decentralized applications that are impaired by high gas fees and transaction processing times. Polygon aims to improve network speed and lower the cost of using the Ethereum blockchain by using sidechains, which are separate blockchains anchored to Ethereum’s main chain. It is one of Ethereum’s most popular layer 2 scaling products, expanding to more than 26 million unique addresses so far in the third quarter.  Recent surges in transaction activity on Polygon have boosted the price of MATIC. Year to date, MATIC is up about 4,800%, making it one of the top 20 digital assets by market capitalization. Its dollar volume over the first half of 2021 makes it the 11th most traded by dollar volume in the CoinDesk 20. Volume data for quarterly CoinDesk 20 reconstitution is provided by Nomics.  Beyond the addition of MATIC, dogecoin and ethereum classic have returned to the ranks of the CoinDesk 20 after being outperformed last quarter by a slew of decentralized finance (DeFi) assets. Only half of the DeFi assets from the second quarter remain in the catchment of the CoinDesk 20 this quarter.  The three assets that were removed from the CoinDesk 20 in the third quarter were yearn.finance YFI, nucypher and XTZ. Apart from XTZ, which is the native cryptocurrency of the smart contract blockchain Tezos, yearn and nucypher are ERC-20 tokens, running on the Ethereum blockchain. Half of the assets on the CoinDesk 20 in the third quarter are ERC-20 tokens.  Here is how every asset on the new CoinDesk 20, plus MATIC, performed in July.  For more information about the CoinDesk 20, which is reconstituted every quarter, and the methodology behind it, read the CoinDesk 20 methodology paper.

42407113,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBOKt,1628022864,Market Wrap: Bitcoin in Pullback Mode as Regulatory Concerns Rise,"Bitcoin extended its pullback on Tuesday as buyers continue to take profits from the $40,000 resistance level. The cryptocurrency was trading around $38,000 at press time and is down about 4% over the past week. Ongoing regulatory concerns in the U.S. and China have kept some bitcoin buyers on the sidelines, with lower support seen around $34,000 to $36,000.      “We expect the pullback to mature in one to two weeks near the 50-day moving average around $34K, after which bitcoin is likely to clear $42.6K for a revised upside target near $51K,” wrote Katie Stockton, managing director of Fairlead Strategies, in a Monday newsletter.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $38,077 -3.08%  Ether (ETH) $2,468.5 -4.88%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4423.3, +0.82%  Gold: $1810.4, -0.13%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.181%, compared with 1.173% on Monday  Ether in the lead    Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has broken out of a two-month consolidation relative to bitcoin. The ETH/BTC ratio faces initial resistance near 0.07, and a decisive break above that level could yield further upside towards 0.08.      ETH could find support around $2,300 to $2,400. “If ETH successfully holds above support, we expect upward momentum from the current move toward a proof-of-stake Ethereum 2.0 to push for a retest of the all-time high (around $4K),” wrote QCP Capital in a Telegram chat.    Some ether bulls are also enthused about the Ethereum blockchain's upcoming London hard fork, an upgrade expected later this weekhttps://ethernodes.org/london that's expected to reduce the network's net issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency.    “We are less optimistic about BTC and we think that upside on BTC might be capped in the near term,” QCP wrote.    Bitcoin futures contango    “Last week’s short squeeze led a large contango to open in the futures market, but as bitcoin failed to break out from its range the contango has declined in recent days,” wrote Arcane Research in a Tuesday newsletter.      Contango is a term used to describe bullish arbitrage, which occurs when the bitcoin futures price is higher than the spot price. Since April, bitcoin’s contango has narrowed as bullish sentiment waned.      “The CME contango remains substantially below the unregulated exchanges, suggesting that the institutional investors remain more cautious than the crypto native traders,” Arcane wrote.      The growing contango could also suggest an accumulation of leveraged long positions, albeit slightly lower over the past week. “Be wary of potential long squeezes if bitcoin fails to find support above $37,000,” Arcane wrote.    Exchange outflows    A significant amount of bitcoin has flowed out of exchanges over the past week, which could indicate investors’ preference to hold rather than sell positions.      “The exchange net position change metric maps out the monthly rate of coins flowing in (green) or out (red) of all exchanges,” wrote Glassnode in a Monday newsletter. “This week we have seen an extremely large volume of coins flow out of exchanges, comparable to the peak outflows seen in November 2020.”    Stablecoins in the spotlight    The amount of the stablecoin gemini dollar (GUSD) on exchanges has seen a sharp decline recently, which may imply an ongoing rise in bitcoin’s price, according to a chart by Mignolet on CryptoQuant. In 2018, when the downward trend of bitcoin price was reversed, GUSD saw a drop in its amount.      Meanwhile, the combined market cap of the largest two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, is approaching $90 billion, while the market cap of USDC increased sixfold since the beginning of the year, according to Skew, a data provider.    Tether frequency    The tether stablecoin’s daily usage on Ethereum has shifted slightly later in the day from Asian business hours toward European and U.S. market hours, possibly a result of China’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and USDT users’ migration to other blockchains from Ethereum, a new report suggests.      In 2020, most USDT activity on Ethereum happened between 2:00 and 14:00 coordinated universal time, while the period from 6:00 to 8:00 UTC was the busiest, according to the report by blockchain-analysis firm Coin Metrics. However, in 2021, there has been less usage during 2:00 and 6:00 UTC, and more during 15:00 to 20:00 UTC.

42407102,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBO95,1628021476,Spain Opposition Party Introduces Bill to Allow Mortgage Payments With Crypto,"Partido Popular (PP), the leading opposition party in Spain, has introduced a bill that would allow for the payment of mortgages with cryptocurrencies and create a national crypto assets council to analyze the implications of the use of crypto and blockchain in that country.      According to the text of the “Digital Transformation Law,” homeowners would be able to use cryptocurrencies to pay their mortgages, while the real estate sector would be able to use crypto to invest in mortgage pools. Banks, on the other hand, would be able to use blockchain as a system to manage mortgages and insurance, and streamline the payment of indemnities with digital currencies.      According to the PP, the bill seeks to ensure that transactions with cryptocurrencies “are carried out in a framework of trust, security and transparency.”      According to lawyer Cristina Carrascosa, CEO of ATH21, a law firm specializing in crypto, this project is innovative as it is an implicit recognition of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment because of their debt-releasing capacity.      So far, she added, banks do not accept payments in cryptocurrencies.      Carrascosa added that in order for the law to be implemented, a change of legal category for cryptocurrencies would have to be made: from the current “means of exchange” status to “means of payment.”      PP’s project, presented on July 26, also proposes the creation of a national crypto assets council (CNC) to serve on an advisory basis. It would be made up of representatives from the Directorate General of the Treasury, the National Securities Market Commission and the Spanish Central Bank.      According to the proposal, the CNC will study and analyze the implications of the use of crypto assets and other services using blockchain, evaluate the introduction of blockchain in public administration and ensure the establishment of mechanisms to detect fraud and tax evasion.      The proposal adds that cryptocurrencies may be accepted as means of exchange between two parties, in the “fulfillment of private obligations, to the extent that they are freely agreed upon by the parties to the transaction as alternative, contractual and immediate methods of payment and are used for no other purpose than to serve as such.”      The bill clarifies that private obligations involving exchange of goods or services with cryptocurrencies will be subject to the same tax regime as monetary transactions, without prejudice to the tax liability that corresponds to the entities issuing cryptocurrencies or exchanges.      According to Carrascosa, the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is currently permitted in Spain, following two rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014, so the proposal’s provisions are not new.      ​​The draft also establishes that cryptocurrencies or tokens issued through initial coin offerings will be considered as negotiable securities, and that investments of less than €6,000 through ICOs will not have to be disclosed to the authorities.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/spain-opposition-party-introduces-bill-to-allow-mortgage-payments-with-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d30c22f4a17be1534e5235607fa675fc05b2576-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBO59,1628019127,Crypto Tax Proposal in US Has Had Limited Impact on Bitcoin Market,"On the face of it, a U.S. bill proposing to raise $28 billion through extra cryptocurrency taxes might unnerve some bitcoin investors. But so far, the market reaction to the bill has been remarkably muted.      Last Wednesday, lawmakers drafting a bipartisan infrastructure bill in Congress proposed to raise $28 billion in extra crypto taxes by applying new information-reporting requirements to exchanges and other providers of crypto services.      According to a draft of the bill, any broker who transfers any digital assets will need to file a return under a modified information reporting regime. That would enable the Internal Revenue Service to collect taxes already owed on capital gains from sales of digital assets.      Given how digital-asset markets often react fairly quickly to news announcements – the recent rumor that Amazon would accept bitcoin as a form of payment being one example – the bill’s plan for the extra crypto taxes has so far had little impact on bitcoin prices.      Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, climbed in recent weeks as the news of the bill surfaced, though it has slipped in the past few days, changing hands at around $38,000 at press time.      “This isn’t a game changer for the institutional world,” said Edward Moya, a senior analyst at Oanda. “However, the announcement did disrupt a steady flow of bullish macro developments that had bitcoin poised to break out of its recent trading range.”    Read more: SEC Boss Gensler Eyeing Robust Regulation of Crypto Market: Report    Moya predicts that additional crypto taxes might dissuade some retail traders from investing now, but he said the majority of the crypto world will be “unfazed.”      Some crypto experts said the bill might have a positive impact on the market, because it could give digital-asset markets more traction and visibility. Henrik Kugelberg, a crypto over-the-counter trader, views the bill as a positive sign of adoption for the market.      “Most people are OK with paying taxes on their earnings,"" he said. ""This makes crypto more commonplace.”      Jason Deane, an analyst at Quantum Economics, points to the fact that cryptocurrency is “truly a global phenomenon, and the U.S. is merely one jurisdiction, meaning impact is limited outside of it.”      Deane said that “while some within the U.S. might be discouraged from trading under the new rules, others will find confidence in the clarity, creating a neutral reaction.”      He also noted that the limited market impact so far might come down to the bill’s implementation being far off. The measure still needs to be negotiated in Congress and signed by President Joe Biden, and it wouldn't become fully effective until 2023. Lobbyists for the digital-asset industry are seeking to kill or water down the extra crypto taxes.      John Todaro, vice president of crypto asset and blockchain research at Needham & Co., agrees that the near-term effect on markets from the proposed crypto taxes isn’t worrying because the legislation wouldn't come into effect for quite some time.      Todaro is watching whether the bill’s language will change. It could get further adjusted so that it wouldn't affect “every company in the space, such as miners, which was where the bill started,"" he said.      ""It was quite broad,” Todaro said.      Deane said that despite a potential tax increase, the net effect is likely to be a “positive one on the cryptocurrency industry.”      “This move effectively legitimizes these transactions in the eyes of the government and provides a clear and robust framework of rules in which investors can operate without fear of repercussion, as long as those rules are followed,” he said.

42407109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfBOHw,1628016506,USDT Usage on Ethereum Shifts Away From Asia Daytime Hours,"The Tether stablecoin USDT’s daily usage on the Ethereum blockchain has shifted slightly later in the day from Asian business hours toward European and U.S. market hours, possibly because of China's crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and USDT users' migration to other blockchains, a new report suggests.      Last year, most USDT activity on Ethereum happened between 2:00 and 14:00 coordinated universal time, and during that time, the period from 6:00 to 8:00 UTC was the busiest, according to the report by blockchain-analysis firm Coin Metrics. This year, however, there has been less usage from 2:00 to 6:00 UTC and more from 15:00 to 20:00 UTC.      Investors can trade crypto 24 hours, seven days a week, but local stock exchange times can be used as a proxy for when traders in any given region are active.      Several factors could have contributed to the shift of USDT’s daily usage pattern on Ethereum, according to Coin Metrics, including that some trading activity has shifted to other blockchains that offer lower fees than Ethereum, such as Tron and Solana.      Also, as China reiterated its crypto ban and started cracking down on crypto mining in May, the migration of crypto miners and investors may have led to a drop in Asia-based USDT activity. That migration, however, wouldn't explain the changes before May, Coin Metrics noted.

42407085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfAIci,1628016463,Riccardo ‘Fluffypony’ Spagni Hires Top Attorney to Battle Extradition to South Africa on Fraud Charges,"Former Monero maintainer Riccardo Spagni, who was arrested in Nashville, Tenn., on July 20 at the request of South African authorities, is fighting extradition with the help of one of crypto’s top lawyers, Brian Klein.      Spagni, known online as “Fluffypony,” has been accused of stealing approximately $100,000 from his former employer, Cape Cookies, by creating fake invoices and routing payment to his personal bank accounts between 2009-2011.      South African officials issued a warrant for Spagni’s arrest in mid-April after he failed to show up for a trial in Cape Town, South Africa for the fraud charges.      According to court documents, Spagni is being held without bond pending his extradition hearing, the date for which has not yet been set.      Klein, who has previously represented big-name crypto clients including Erik Voorhees and Charlie Shrem, has filed a motion to allow Spagni to be released from custody on bail until his extradition hearing.      In his motion, Klein claims the U.S. government has “misstated both the facts and the applicable law in this matter” and calls the case against Spagni “fatally flawed” due to a lack of evidence and a prosecution that has “stopped, started and meandered for over a decade.”      Read more: Meet Brian Klein, Crypto’s Own ‘High-Stakes’ Trial Attorney      The motion disputes the U.S. government's claim that Spagni's offense carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison, instead claiming that under South African law Spagni's alleged offenses are only punishable by up to 60 months in prison.      According to independent extradition expert and attorney Jacques Semmelman, however, the distinction makes no difference for Spagni's extradition.      ""As long as the conduct is punishable in both countries by a year or more in prison, it is an extraditable offense,"" Semmelman told CoinDesk.      The motion also argues that Spagni has health conditions, including asthma, that make him more susceptible to severe illness or death from the Delta variant of COVID-19, and that necessitate his release from custody until his extradition hearing.      A hearing on Spagni’s request to be released on bond will take place Thursday morning.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | XMR,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/riccardo-fluffypony-spagni-hires-top-attorney-to-battle-extradition-to-south-africa-on-fraud-charges,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89c7f7044433bb039a035e6cbc469ad7b6f82060-2082x1226.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42390182,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bX3wi5,1628014668,A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse,"The metaverse isn’t just a sci-fi term anymore.  When technology changes our lives, it’s not often by surprise. The internet, the smartphone and the cloud, to name a few, all arrived to the world preceded by a presence in science-fiction. It’s likely that the “next big thing” of the digital age is about to arrive, and with it the potential to change everyday life. It's called “the metaverse.”  The metaverse is a superset of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet. Its tendencies exist in forms you may already be familiar with, such as in popular video games like Roblox, Fortnite and Animal Crossing. The term was first coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash,” where a pair of delivery drivers travel the metaverse to save themselves from a capitalist dystopia.  The metaverse that many futurists envision is similar to the ones portrayed in sci-fi stories like ""Ready Player One."" While no one knows for sure what the metaverse will look like, its basic characteristics are established – it spans physical and virtual worlds, is centered around a fully functioning economy, and allows users to travel through its different “places” with relative ease, maintaining their purchased goods and avatars.  Like a virtual theme park with no limits to its size and creativity, users will be able to move seamlessly from place to place with thousands of other people, all within the same digital universe.  Why the metaverse matters  Even if the metaverse fails to reach the epic vision many have in store for it, it could fundamentally change the way we interact with the digital world. A collective virtual experience could bring new opportunities to creators, gamers and artists in the same way non-fungible tokens (NFT) have, not just reshaping the creator economy, but inventing it anew.  The virtual world of the metaverse could become its own trillion-dollar industry. A go-to for entertainment, commerce and for some, even a place of work. The metaverse is not being described as an extension of the internet but a successor. And it’s being built using blockchains and decentralized applications.  Venture capitalist and essayist Matthew Ball writes that the metaverse will become “the gateway to most digital experiences, a key component of all physical ones, and the next great labor platform.” He believes it will be the driving force in creating a new generation of companies, similar to what happened with the popularization of the internet. Maybe more interestingly, it could lead to the fall of incumbent industry leaders, as we saw with the rise of digital platforms.  Enter Facebook  At the end of June, Mark Zuckerberg told his employees at Facebook they’d be working “to help bring the metaverse to life.” The company has assembled a team of its executives to spearhead the project, including Instagram product head Vishal Shah and Facebook Gaming's Vivek Sharma and Jason Rubin.  In an interview with The Verge, Zuckerberg outlined his ambitions for what the metaverse could be. He discussed the idea of virtual workspaces, which he called “infinity offices.” Working in VR, he argues, allows for greater multitasking, and meeting in a virtual, metaverse type environment can be intrinsically more collaborative and productive. Zoom calls have their obvious limitations, and Zuckerberg says he already prefers to do his meetings in VR if possible.  Facebook plans on spearheading this development with its own set of investments. It currently owns Oculus, which makes the popular Quest VR headset. While VR technology still has a long way to go, according to Zuckerberg, it’ll be ready for metaverse capabilities “by the end of the decade.”  Other tech giants stepping into the metaverse  No one person or company can have control over the metaverse, but the usual suspects of the tech world are already staking their claim on the future of the space. Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Sony have joined Facebook in the XR Association, a consortium of tech companies aiming to shape the future of “experiential reality.”  Gaming is ahead of other metaverse technology in many aspects and could continue pioneering the space. For years, video games have leaned into the concept of in-game economies, where players can buy and sell goods that hold no real value outside the universe of the game itself. The most recent example is Fortnite, but an older example is the continued success of games like Grand Theft Auto V. Despite being released more than seven years ago, the game grossed over a billion dollars in profit in 2020, thanks to a large online community still active in the game’s online, open-world universe.  The metaverse aims to connect these in-game economies under one cohesive umbrella of virtual experience. Unlike in the world of video games, the metaverse is not objective-based. Our relationship to it will be more similar to how we treat the internet than some kind of virtual role playing game.  Where crypto fits into the metaverse  Behind the scenes of the metaverse will be a demand to deliver permissionless identity, financial services and high-speed exchange. Data will have to be stored and served to millions if not billions of people. The answer to these problems lies in the technology of cryptocurrency.  Companies like Decentraland and The Sandbox have developed virtual worlds that integrate cryptocurrencies so gamers can create structures like virtual casinos and theme parks, and monetize them. In Decentraland, the currency used is called MANA, and is available to purchase on exchanges like Coinbase. There are even casinos in Decentraland where you can gamble in MANA, with dealers paid in MANA to show up for work.  NFTs will also play a foundational role in the metaverse, giving people complete ownership of their characters, accrued in-game items and even virtual land. An NFT of a 259-parcel virtual estate in Decentraland recently sold for more than $900,000, the largest sale to date.  Eventually, it will be possible to buy and sell virtual goods from different games and universes on interoperable marketplaces. So someone might be able to sell their virtual plot of land in the Decentraland world and use the funds to purchase Fortnite skins, for example. Cryptocurrencies could become the sole legal tender used in the metaverse, with all virtual objects and intangible items being expressed as NFTs.  “I think people are truly blown away by the amount of money that players spend in digital assets. Hundreds, thousands, and probably millions of dollars spent on digital assets,” said Arthur Madrid, CEO and co-founder of The Sandbox. “I think making those assets NFTs, building an NFT economy, is going to add a new layer on top of the existing digital economy.”  While no one can predict exactly what the metaverse will look like, or when its final form will arrive, the importance of cryptocurrencies for its growth is a certainty. As we monitor the development of technologies like virtual reality, and the ways that current industry leaders like Facebook are getting involved, advancements in blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency sector will play an equally important role in shaping the metaverse’s future.",POSITIVE,MANA,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MANA | TECHNOLOGY,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/03/a-crypto-guide-to-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bfd785246f29f15f1eb769014c1998d7b802b8d0-2271x1703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407088,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfAIff,1628008891,‘Cautiously Optimistic': Crypto Brings Lobbying Muscle to Infrastructure Debate,"Bitcoin does not have a CEO but it does have lawyers. Currently, cryptocurrency lobbyists and activists are fighting on Capitol Hill to further update the language of the U.S. Senate’s bipartisan infrastructure bill that contains, buried in its 2,000+ pages, a sentence that could derail the entire crypto industry.      To pay off a portion of the $1 trillion spending package – a keystone policy for President Biden’s administration to upgrade American transportation and energy sectors – Senate Republicans have agreed to levy a $28 billion tax on the crypto industry.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    But the bill also contains a poison seed. Crypto advocates are working tirelessly to protect the public blockchain industry from political actors that seemingly misunderstand the very industry they’re looking to oversee. And so far, it seems like they’re winning.      “What's scary about this is the process is so compact,” Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, said. “When you get language like this, and one of those broad packages when you're only four pages of a 2,700 page bill, you're scrambling with all of those other interest groups to get the attention of lawmakers.”      In the past week, public interest groups like the Blockchain Association, Coin Center and the newly formed policy team at Coinbase have sent memos, taken meetings and leveraged their insider connections to try to reshape the wording of a quick-moving piece of legislation. A process that’s only made harder by growing concerns around the coronavirus.      Calling the bill “one of the top two policy threats” ever seen by the U.S. crypto industry, Smith said she’s been impressed by the progress made already. Over the weekend, Senate officials softened the language in the bill, turning what could have been cataclysmic into something merely concerning.      Now at stake are a few words in what is rapidly becoming a language game. As Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal put it: “We’re trying to change, like, two words in that.”      The proposed “spend-for” in the infrastructure bill would come from expanding the reporting requirements for crypto brokers (think intermediaries like Coinbase and Robinhood) to help prevent tax avoidance.    We're not out of the woods yet.    In so doing, the bill also recklessly broadens the definition of a “broker” to conceivably apply to any economic actor working in crypto. This would apply to anyone who is “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” on behalf of another person. That means miners, stakers, software developers might be forced to collect identifying information about anyone with whom they interact.      “We've had some people say, ‘Oh, that's not what we're intending.’ But the problem is the language as written can capture all of those things,” Smith said. “We really need to try to get it changed to match their intent.”      “If you get laws on the books that don't match well with how technology works in practice, you don't necessarily get the outcomes that you would like, whether it's from a public policy standpoint, a political standpoint, or a legal standpoint,” Nelson Rosario, a partner at Smolinski Rosario Law, said.    Read more: How Controversial Crypto Tax Found Its Way Into US Infrastructure Bill    Few of the policy experts I spoke with are opposed to requiring major cryptocurrency exchanges to report more detailed information to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In fact, the largest U.S. exchange, Coinbase, sought clarity on the form in question (1099) as long ago as 2017.      For an industry that has sometimes disagreed on the need for government lobbying capability, the process to amend the bill has seemed remarkably in lockstep. It’s no stretch to say crypto has little political standing on Capitol hill but its voice is being heard.      The Electronic Frontier Foundation put out a statement broadly condemning the privacy concerns of such an understanding of “broker,” while Sens. Pat Toomey and Ron Wyden (not known for his crypto advocacy) have also made statements calling for adjustments.      Although “cautiously optimistic,” Smith notes, “we're not out of the woods yet.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/cautiously-optimistic-crypto-brings-lobbying-muscle-to-infrastructure-debate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d90e20f76393cfb5aebb624e5cc10b014fe54d3f-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a speech at the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday, Gensler said he agreed with Jay Clayton, his predecessor at the SEC, who once famously said that in his view, ""every ICO I've seen is a security.""      ""Generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects,"" Gensler said in prepared remarks. ""I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.""

Gensler reiterated earlier comments that stock tokens and ""stable value tokens backed by securities"" qualify as securities in his view, meaning they must be registered and their issuers must abide by existing federal law.      ""A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token's legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities,"" Gensler said.      Gensler also briefly hinted at how his agency might approach exchange-traded funds (ETFs). More than a dozen industry participants have filed applications to launch a bitcoin ETF over the past year.      Gensler noted that investment vehicles with exposure to crypto, including mutual funds, already exist. While Gensler didn't comment on the proposals themselves, he called out the importance of having investor protections codified into law.      ""Given these important protections, I look forward to the staff’s review of such filings, particularly if those are limited to these CME-traded bitcoin futures,"" he said, referring to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/03/sec-chairman-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d665ab90796507cf7e0457c832262ab91701c33-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The protocol enables fixed interest rates and future yield trading on all yield-bearing assets in decentralized finance (DeFi) markets by splitting assets into principal and yield components and packaging them as ""Zeros"" and ""Claims."" These packages allow users to earn or borrow at a fixed rate and trade against future yields.      According to Kenton Prescott, the co-founder and CEO of Sense, existing yield trading solutions in DeFi are prone to protocol insolvency and capital lock-ups, and are often not user-friendly.      As DeFi continues to grow, users are increasingly looking for on-chain financial products beyond simply buying and selling tokens. While some financial products from traditional financial markets such as structured products and derivatives are thriving, concepts such as yield curves have yet to gain much traction.      Prescott said that yield curves, which are considered critical infrastructure in traditional finance, are underexplored in the decentralized financial markets and are key to DeFi’s maturity in the long run.

The wallet reached 7.3 million users in the three months through June.      MetaMask allows users to access the Ethereum blockchain and functions much like a bitcoin wallet while enabling users to sign in to decentralized applications and use them through a regular browser.      “What makes DeFi so alluring is that anyone with an idea can coordinate, pool funds, and even create tokens that represent your share within the organization,” the report said.

42407090,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfAIic,1627997400,State of Crypto: Infrastructure Bill Shows Congress Sees Crypto as Here to Stay,"The U.S. Congress has been talking about crypto for years, and we’re finally getting a sense of what sort of regulations lawmakers might enforce. The biggest issue is a controversial tax provision in the Senate’s infrastructure bill.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Infrastructure Week  The narrative    What a week. Seven days ago, the biggest thing on my radar was a trio of congressional hearings on crypto. By Thursday, we had two massive bills seeking to enforce regulations on the industry in different ways. The first bill, the Senate’s trillion dollar bipartisan infrastructure effort, would broaden the definition of a “broker” to capture all sorts of entities for the purposes of crypto tax collection. The second, by Rep. Don Beyer (D.-Va.), is much more of a long shot, but is the most comprehensive effort to regulate crypto yet.    Why it matters    The infrastructure bill has sparked controversy in the crypto world because of just how broad its definition of a “broker” originally was. A revised version, and the one that’s in the actual bill introduced late Sunday, tones the definition down a tiny bit in that it no longer explicitly includes decentralized exchanges as brokers. But it doesn’t explicitly exclude crypto miners or node operators, either.      The main takeaway is that crypto has gotten on lawmakers’ radar as an industry that is permanent enough to help fund the government.    Breaking it down    Okay, so the plus side for the crypto industry is that the attention lawmakers are giving it is a recognition that crypto is not just a casino that’s going to disappear when traders get bored. Congress clearly expects this industry to stick around long enough to generate at least $28 billion in tax revenue for the infrastructure bill. It’s arguably the most concrete recognition of crypto from Congress, and yes, I’m including all of the hearings Congress has hosted in recent months.      The downside is the confusion over just who exactly must file information reporting documents. Exchanges and over-the-counter trading desks should have no difficulty complying, and the fact they’ll even be directed to a specific form to fill out may even make it easier for these trading platforms in lieu of clear guidance from the Internal Revenue Service on the matter.      The problems arise when we look at decentralized exchanges, node operators, miners, etc. It’s less clear how they would comply.      The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which “scores” provisions, meaning it evaluates how much would be raised through the provisions, published a document stating the figure of just less than $28 billion, but didn’t actually say where the number came from. In other words, there’s no information right now on how the JCT expects these entities to report.      “It was inevitable” that brokers and dealers, registered exchanges and OTC desks would have to comply with these types of reporting standards, former lobbyist Reid Yager told me.      “Whether this year, in five years, they were going to get captured,” Yager said. “The fact that ‘broker’ could be interpreted to expand to software developers and providers, that’s an issue.”      We know that there’s bipartisan opposition to the specific wording of the provision in the infrastructure bill – Sen. Ron Wyden (D.-Ore.), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee (which oversees the IRS), as well as Sens. Patrick Toomey (R.-Penn.) and Cynthia Lummis (R.-Wyo.), who are both on the Senate Banking Committee – have all publicly stated that they don’t see the current definition as being feasible to implement.      The almost odd part is Sen. Rob Portman (R.-Ohio), who is behind the specific amendment, doesn’t intend to capture noncustodial entities like miners, according to a spokesperson for the senator.      “This legislative language does not redefine digital assets or cryptocurrency as a ‘security’ for tax purposes, impugn on the privacy of individual crypto holders or force non-brokers, such as software developers and crypto miners, to comply with IRS reporting obligations. It simply clarifies that any person or entity acting as a broker by facilitating trades for clients and receiving cash must comply with a standard information reporting obligation,” said Drew Nirenberg, the spokesperson.      At this point, however, it doesn’t seem like Portman is willing to put that kind of language in the infrastructure bill itself or in supplementary material that the IRS can point to in implementing the proposal.      So we now get about a week to see what amendments are offered and whether they’re accepted.      And then there’s the House of Representatives, which most likely won’t take the bill up until the fall and whose members may have their own issues with the bill (both crypto-related and not).      If the general public is interested in providing feedback, they should reach out to their elected officials, says Kristin Smith of the Blockchain Association, Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Michelle Bond of the Association for Digital Asset Markets.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    Dave Uejio, acting director of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), will face his confirmation hearing for the position of assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development on Thursday.

42407083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfAIZl,1627992000,How Controversial Crypto Tax Found Its Way Into US Infrastructure Bill,"A crypto-specific provision that would raise $28 billion for a $1 trillion infrastructure package before the U.S. Congress was so contentious that it briefly held up the entire bill.      Much of the controversy hinges on a technical detail: the definition of the term “broker.” The provision, which would define a “broker” as any person who provides a service “effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person,” has been questioned by industry participants due to the possibility that it will include non-custodial companies, such as decentralized exchanges and miners, that would be unable to file broker-specific tax reporting forms.      The crypto provision was one of a handful of issues that held up the entire 2,702-page infrastructure bill, according to an individual familiar with the situation. The Senate hoped to introduce the bill late last week, but it wasn’t published until Sunday night.      The holdup appears to be at least partly driven by concerns that removing certain businesses from the bill would change its “scoring.”      The way the provision is currently worded, non-custodial businesses are part of the scoring, or how the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) evaluated the amount of revenue it could bring in. It’s possible that explicitly excluding miners, for example, could change the scoring, meaning the provision would no longer be expected to generate $28 billion. This in turn could impact the rest of the bill, forcing lawmakers to find new ways of funding the overall package. Though the JCT published its overall score for the bill, the way the JCT arrived at the $28 billion figure is currently unknown.    Designating DEXs    The bipartisan infrastructure bill has been a priority for U.S. President Joe Biden. The $1 trillion bill would send funds to public transit (including passenger rail), bridges, roads, energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure, water rights, tunnels and more.      To fund these initiatives, the bill includes more than a dozen “pay-fors,” or provisions that would pay for the $550 billion in new spending. In addition to crypto, the bill looks to generate revenue by extending government-sponsored enterprise fees, sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reducing Medicare spending on discarded medications, reinstating some Superfund fees and several other areas.      The crypto information reporting requirements for tax purposes, as originally drafted, designated decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and seemed to designate miners, hardware manufacturers, software developers and others as “brokers” required to report transactions, despite the fact that some of these entities don’t have customers with know-your-customer information.      To be clear: The provision did not suggest a new tax. The contentious issue was the expanded broker definition, which seemingly went beyond what would normally be considered a broker in similar financial sectors.      “It’s not actually a tax, it’s increasing reporting rules,” said Reid Yager, a former lobbyist and current director of communications at Blockhaus. “Whoever came up with this is actually pretty crafty. It’s easy to say ‘hey, I don’t want to increase taxes on something’ but if it's just increasing reporting, it’s pretty hard to get a senator to turn their back.”      The provision was apparently inserted by Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), according to multiple individuals familiar with the negotiations. Portman said he was working on a crypto tax provision after a congressional hearing with IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig in April, but a spokesperson declined to provide further details at the time.      On Sunday, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, pushed back on the provision, tweeting that it “fails to understand how the technology works.”      Similarly, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said in a statement that it’s “easy to get [this industry] wrong.”      “This is why we need a real committee process to consider these issues, instead of secret drafting. We’re working on making it better,” she said through a spokesperson last week.      Sen. Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, likewise announced his opposition to the provision on Monday.    Process    The infrastructure bill is moving quickly. The bill was announced last Wednesday, and the Senate held a procedural test vote within a day. Yager pointed to Congress’ COVID-19 relief bills in 2020, many of which were voted on very shortly after their texts were published, as a precedent for this sort of speed.      Moreover, the bulk of the infrastructure bill has already been decided, with debate and amendments largely focusing on some details.      It’s not unusual for the text of a bill like the infrastructure legislation to be written until just before it’s fully introduced, Yager said, even as procedural votes are held to open debate on the bill.      Most lawmakers may not have had a chance to read through the full bill ahead of last week’s procedural vote, and the text itself wasn’t made available to the general public until late Sunday.      Indeed, much of the negotiation likely happened within a small group.      Typically, “there’s four old white dudes in a Senate chamber talking through the bill,” Yager said.      Alongside Portman, the infrastructure bill was largely negotiated by a group, including Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah), according to a joint press statement.      Over the next few days, lawmakers can propose amendments as they debate the merits and costs of the bill. It’s possible, though not guaranteed, that amendments to strip or modify the language will be included, though it’s unclear whether they’ll be adopted should that happen.      What is clear is that the provision fills a needed funding hole, and therefore may not be easily replaceable.      “For this infrastructure bill by itself, we have honestly seen some of the most convoluted attempts to find money in the U.S.,” Yager said. “They pretty much spent all their ammunition to find money across the U.S. government.”      Still, the actual methodology behind the $28 billion figure from crypto taxes is unknown, said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.      “Given all the other entities, miners, software developers, the others wrapped up in the language [who] have no ability to report on the revenue or the tax obligations, we don’t think it’s going to substantially change the score if we clarify that those entities are no longer part of the [definition],” she said.      Centralized exchanges may be able to provide the total amount by themselves, depending on how exactly the data was scored.      Perianne Boring, the president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, expects the bill to be finalized roughly around the end of this week.      Even after that, however, the House of Representatives still has to discuss and vote on the bill before it can head to the President for a signature.      In other words, the bill may not be finalized before September or October. During that time, the House may also try to amend the provision. Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) has already tweeted that he’s “on it.”      Read the crypto-specific provision below:",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/08/03/how-controversial-crypto-tax-found-its-way-into-us-infrastructure-bill,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fe074cef13cd2ecddb124b7213eaec8be7ea0746-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407081,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAfAIYm,1627990775,SEC Boss Gensler Eyeing Robust Regulation of Crypto Market: Report,"The head of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, said he is weighing a robust regulatory regime for the crypto market.    Gensler said in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that his interest in crypto does not mean he will take a hands-off regulatory approach for which many in the space were hoping.  “While I’m neutral on the technology, even intrigued – I spent three years teaching it, leaning into it – I’m not neutral about investor protection,” Gensler said.  He did not give a timeline on the introduction of SEC action on cryptocurrency, citing 49 non-crypto policy reviews – such as responding to the GameStop trading frenzy, that could slow down any progress on cryptocurrency.  Nor did Gensler comment on the potential approval of a crypto exchange-traded fund, despite the long list of applications the regulator has received.  Gensler has previously spoken of the need for the SEC to regulate crypto exchanges, and has now said this would be the easiest way to monitor digital token trading, which in turn could bring into play peer-to-peer lending on decentralized finance platforms.  The SEC could then regulate such platforms if they are advertising an interest-rate return on a crypto asset. Alternatively, platforms that pool digital assets could be regarded as mutual funds, which would also bring them into the SEC's purview.  Gensler's appointment as SEC chair was met with a positive reaction from large swathes of the crypto community given the consensus that he understands cryptocurrency in a way that few others in his field do, meaning his regime would bring greater regulatory certainty than has been experienced previously.

The ratio slipped to 0.51 on Monday, hitting the least since Dec. 25 and extending the slide from the July high of 0.67, data provided by crypto derivatives research firm Skew show.      According to Skew's Twitter feed, about 2,000 bitcoin call option contracts with a strike price of $140,000 and an expiry date of Dec. 31 changed hands on Sunday. Similar volume was seen in the December expiry call with a strike price of $200,000.      ""All this activity in calls has brought the put-call ratio to YTD lows,"" Skew tweeted on Monday. A call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer essentially purchases insurance against bullish moves by paying a premium to the seller. A put option gives the purchaser the right to sell.      Data shared by over-the-counter desk Paradigm and analytics firm Genesis Volatility show investors bought Aug. 6 expiry calls at $44,000 and simultaneously sold calls at $50,000, a so-called bull call spread, last week, pulling the put-call open positions ratio down.      The bull call spread involves buying call options at, below or above the spot market price and selling an equal number of calls with the same expiry at a higher strike price.      It's a limited-risk, limited-reward strategy designed to benefit from an increase in the underlying asset. The maximum profit is earned if the asset expires at or above the short call's strike price, that is $50,000 in this case, on the settlement day. The maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid while setting the strategy. It is arrived at by subtracting the compensation received for selling the $50,000 call from the premium paid for buying the $44,000 call.      Traders also bought September expiry call spreads at $64,000-$124,000 strikes last week. Other metrics measuring the implied volatility or price differential between call and puts also paint a bullish picture.      For the first time in nearly 10 weeks, short-term, medium-term and long-term put-call skews are displaying negative values, a sign of calls drawing higher demand or prices than puts.

""Unfortunately, our recent internal and external audit identified that some user payment passwords might have been compromised,"" the Hodl Hodl team wrote in a blog post on Monday. ""This affected a limited number of contracts, but we are taking proactive measures to ensure that everyone is safe."" The team said it is investigating the issue and working on safely moving funds from potentially compromised contracts.      Hodl Hodl declined to comment on the situation but promised to publish a report as soon as the issues are investigated and fixed. ""We have contacted external auditors and are doing external and internal audits on a daily basis,"" according to the blog post.      According to a user’s tweet, the issue pertained to the Hold Hodl lending platform, which went live in October 2020. Users also reported the Hodl Hodl website was down for some time on Aug. 2.      Answering questions on Twitter, Hodl Hodl's official account said the platform did not liquidate all contracts on the platform, only some.      Hodl Hodl is a peer-to-peer noncustodial marketplace. It doesn't store users' funds but provides a way for them to buy, sell, lend and borrow bitcoin from each other in an automated fashion. Hodl Hodl weighs in only when there is a dispute about a payment.      Users lock bitcoin in multisignature escrow wallets and use their personal payment passwords to release funds from it. Some of those passwords, according to Hodl Hodl's statement, might have been compromised.      On Aug. 1, user HodlBits tweeted concerns about Hodl Hodl, saying they received an email from the company ""where they are pushing us to close contracts in the next 2 hours,"" and the style of the email seemed weird. Hodl Hodl's official account responded that the emails were authentic.      Later the same day, Hodl Hodl tweeted that the platform started forced liquidation ""in those contracts that are still in In progress stage but are considered as 'high risk.' This is done to assure safety of YOUR funds. In order to complete the Liquidation process we will need you to undersign the Liquidation as well.""      A day later, Hodl Hodl published an explanation in its blog and apologized for not communicating with users in a more straightforward way. The team also published a PGP key on the website and in the blog to prove the social network accounts of Hodl Hodl had not been compromised.

The CoinJar Card, which marks an Australian crypto first under the Mastercard brand, is available either physically or digitally through both Google and Apple Pay integration.      CoinJar's card supports up to 30 different cryptocurrencies and features a 1% conversion rate that is returned to customers via an in-house rewards program, the company said in a press release on Tuesday.      Dominic Gluchowski, chief marketing officer at CoinJar, told CoinDesk via email on Monday the card was the first ""Australian-native"" crypto card. The exchange brought in assistance from payments solutions provider EML for technological advice.      ""All transactions are denominated in Australian dollars (AUD) and are routed through Australian banks and payment providers,"" said Gluchowski.      Other providers utilize the U.S. dollar or Singaporean dollars, which in turn, leads to ""crippling"" international transaction fees while using their cards for everyday purchases, Gluchowski added.      The move comes hot on the heels of Global payments giant Visa approving local Australian startup CryptoSpend to issue a similar product in July.
