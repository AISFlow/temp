42393869,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb18h,1675374582,Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin and Ether’s Divergent 2023 Paths May Present Opportunity for Crypto Investors,"Bitcoin and ether have been taking different paths so far in 2023, which could present a buying opportunity for crypto investors.  The two largest cryptocurrencies’ net position change on exchanges has veered away from one another after correlating closely throughout 2022. An asset’s net position on exchanges is the difference between deposits and withdrawals.  BTC’s net position on exchanges reflects declining supply, while the increase in ETH’s net position indicates a larger stockpile on exchanges.  An asset’s exchange net position is noteworthy because increases in value often precede the asset being sold, while decreases indicate that investors are removing the asset from exchanges to place it in cold storage. Investors may be able to anticipate the resulting price changes.  The shift in net position for bitcoin and ether occurred at approximately the same time (Jan 19). Investors may be treating BTC and ETH as substitutes for each other, or possibly indicating they prefer bitcoin to ether.  The ETH/BTC currency pair is down 3% year to date, after being off as much as 8%. Ether has underperformed bitcoin, despite its supply contracting by 6,700 ETH since September. With no change in ETH’s overall utility and its traditionally high correlation to BTC, investors may find it odd that the asset has fallen relative to bitcoin.  ETH’s correlation coefficient relative to BTC has fallen 18% since Jan. 23, without a clear explanation why. A return to correlation norms in conjunction with a continued rise of BTC prices would imply an accelerated move higher for ETH.  Future flows of ether onto and/or off exchanges may show whether investors believe that the difference in performance represents an opportunity. Ether's price is still up 39% year to date, but trails BTC’s 43% move higher. Should investors begin to remove ETH from exchanges, the trend could signal the asset’s move higher.  Ether also appeared on a Thursday morning screen of approximately 90 cryptocurrencies that identify assets whose price has surpassed the upper bound of its Bollinger Bands.  The Bollinger Bands indicator measures an asset’s 20-day moving average, while plotting “bands” that sit two standard deviations above and below the average. An asset breaching the upper band indicates increased volatility along with a price move outside normal expectations.

42421940,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQSGK,1675373215,Crypto Software Firm President: We're Trying to Make California’s DMV More Efficient With Blockchain,"Does anyone really enjoy dealing with state motor vehicle department bureaucracy? California, which has the highest number of car registrations in the U.S., may soon be able to use blockchain technology to verify car titles and registrations.  “The partnership with the DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles] is almost a perfect matchup of a system based on paper that has been crying out for more efficiency,” Andrew Smith, president of crypto infrastructure company Oxhead Alpha, told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Thursday.  Oxhead Alpha focuses on advancing protocols, research and development, and is turning to the Tezos blockchain as to make a “very clear case of better, faster [and] cheaper” to the state, he added.  That was part of the reason why the firm selected Tezos, Smith said. It boiled down to three areas: a responsible consensus algorithm, on-chain governance that can reduce forking issues and an overall robust security model. Tezos currently ranks 40th by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Via the Tezos blockchain, paper car titles will be reflected as digital assets on-chain, said Smith.  “The digital model that we’ve put together on blockchain nears that where you need an attestation from both parties,” Smith said. He said vehicle odometers are one of the ways to verify a driver’s information.  A proof-of-concept testnet conducted last week shows how the partnership's with the state agency can succeed, according to Smith. ""The administration out there is actually very forward thinking and we should have systems in production this first quarter,"" he said. Production, he explained, means ""a shadow ledger, which will be our first step in the path to full deployment."" The ledger would essentially reflect California’s current driver database.  But don't get your hopes up too much – moving the information on-chain will not eliminate the DMV’s role.  “The DMV is not removed from the transaction process,” Smith said. “While the end users are able to initiate transfers, the DMV still has oversight because the implementation is a lot like an escrow contract.”  He said certain things still need to be done with a vehicle title “in order to effect a real transfer,” but with the blockchain-based protocol it can be done “digitally and asynchronously.”  State lawmakers, he said, are not sure what to make of the blockchain plan.  ""I think they see very clearly this split between speculation and application. And when you get into the application and you can explain the benefits, they see,"" he said. ""They see the massive costs on the infrastructure and the aging [DMV] infrastructure and maintenance that they have, and they're looking for ways to bring that into the future.""  In May, Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order promoting blockchain technology. However, in September he vetoed crypto licensing legislation that would have created a California version of New York's BitLicense.

42421931,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQRj2,1675371966,MicroStrategy Books Impairment Charge of $197.6M on Q4 Bitcoin Holdings,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) posted a digital asset impairment charge of $197.6 million on its bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the fourth quarter, up from a $727,000 charge in Q3, according to its latest earnings report.  The company's digital asset impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired. Under standard accounting rules the value of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies must be recorded at their cost and then only adjusted if their value is impaired, or goes down. But if the price rises, that does not get reported unless an asset is sold.  The price of bitcoin began the fourth quarter at roughly $19,100 and ended the quarter (and year) at about $16,500.  Late in the quarter, MicroStrategy made some (previously reported) modest net purchases of bitcoin (BTC), bringing its holdings to 132,500 bitcoins at a total acquisition cost of roughly $4 billion. The value of those tokens were worth about $1.84 billion at the end of the year.  That value has risen considerably thus far in 2023 as bitcoin has jumped almost 50% to just shy of $24,000. Alongside that big gain for the crypto, MicroStrategy shares – which fell 35% in 2022 – have doubled so far this year.  ""Our corporate strategy and conviction in acquiring, holding, and growing our bitcoin position for the long term remains unchanged,"" said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Kang.  Overall for the quarter, the company posted a loss per share of $21.93 and revenue of $132.6 million, which topped consensus estimates for $131 million.  Speaking on the earnings call, Executive Chairman Michael Saylor said that though bitcoin has gone through a very rough stretch, the performance of MicroStrategy stock since the company began buying bitcoin in August 2020 is better than the major indices and mega-cap tech monopolies Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.

If you missed it, there's probably still a chance to get in at good prices. Moving forward, ETH could outperform Bitcoin. Thesis Summary Ethereum (ETH-USD) has rallied strongly with the broader crypto market, and it seems like a bottom could be in. If this is the case, and you feel like you missed the boat, there's no need to worry. History suggests there will be a chance for investors to get in at more favorable prices. Furthermore, given the current fundamental and technical outlook, I believe Ethereum could outperform Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in 2023, though I still advise holding both coins for the long-term. EWT Outlook First off, let's begin by looking at the EWT outlook for Ethereum. Below I present two possible counts: ETH EWT (Author's analysis) I'll try to be as concise as possible. Since around April 2021, ETH has been completing an ABC correction. Back in June 2022 Ethereum dipped under $1000, passing the 38.2% retracement level, and giving us sufficient price action to count five impulsive waves to the downside. If this is correct, then the low is in, and what we are now setting up is a 1-2 structure inside a larger wave III marked in blue. However, until the wave I high is broken convincingly, we could also count all the moves since the June low as an ABC for wave 4. This count can be seen in black. This would mean that we still have a final leg lower to go, which could take us down into the $700 region. This represents the next key fib level, the 50% retracement, and would also be close to the 2 ext of the wave 1 in red measured from the top of wave 2. At this point, not having some exposure to Ethereum is a risk, though we could still get another good chance to go long in the wave 2 of III. An Eerie Similarity History doesn't repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes, and if that's the case, the chart below is definitely worth looking at, Ethereum comparison (TradingView) This chart compares the dynamics that played out in the 2019-2020 correction and what we are witnessing today, and we can see some similar dynamics are in play. These dynamics are the result of supply and demand distribution and the market testing resistance and support levels. In 2020, ETH sold off and almost broke its recent lows, and if this plays out again, then we should see Ethereum hit near $1000 again. However, this will depend broadly on the macroeconomic outlook, something which I've discussed more in depth in my marketplace. In 2019, the COVID crash contributed towards a sell-off. Another event of such magnitude seems unlikely at this point, but numbers suggest the economy could be heading into a recession, and the Fed is not done tightening. Will Ethereum outperform Bitcoin? The big question though, if you are already invested in crypto, is which of the two major coins will perform better in 2023. From a fundamental side, there's a lot to say in favor of the Ethereum network. It has more use cases, an expanding ecosystem and a deflationary currency: ETH Supply (Ultrasoundmoney) The only real concern for Ethereum is regulation, since this cryptocurrency could be treated as a security moving forward. This seems less likely with Bitcoin, which is being considered more like a commodity. Now, from a technical perspective, the ETH/BTC chart also looks ready to head higher: ETHBTC (TradingView) We are hovering just above the trendline in ETHBTC, suggesting we should at least be able to rally into the upper resistance. From a charting perspective, this could arguably be identified as a ""cup and handle"" structure, which would also imply a break to the upside is in the cards. Takeaway In conclusion, Ethereum looks like a bottom could possibly be in. For those that missed the train, history suggests we might get another chance to add much closer to the bottom, but a lot of this depends on the macroeconomic outlook. Looking into 2023, a strong case can be made that Ethereum can outperform Bitcoin. Still, I advise holding both, as I see these cryptocurrencies as complementary. And of course, tokens needed for Ethereum scaling should also perform well if/when Ethereum rallies. A clear example of this is Polygon (MATIC-USD).",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574756-ethereum-looks-better-than-bitcoin-here?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8685644.jpeg

The sector is attracting attention around non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the Metaverse, Web3, and, more recently, artificial intelligence. Related Reading: Binance Integrates Binance-Pegged BUSD On Optimism Network The VeChain Foundation has announced the “Spiritual Rebirth” launch of the 2019 VeChain Summit, introducing The Hive to achieve goals that “create tangible economic value with blockchain technology.” The Foundation claims that it has been “invigorated” by a stream of positive developments and opportunities for the growth of its community. In an official post, the non-profit organization suggests that the VeChainThor blockchain is ready to “take center stage of the upcoming digital-sustainable web3 revolution.” The Web3 Revolution And The Blockchain VeChainThor The Hive aims to “foster collaboration across the web3 community” and to act as an “inclusive beacon” for sustainability, focusing on developments for the blockchain ecosystem. The new event will take place on March 4, 2022, in Las Vegas, according to the VeChain Foundation. During the event, the Foundation promised to make new announcements of consequence for the blockchain VeChainThor and the launch of a new whitepaper to take their global concept on digital ecosystems to the worldwide market. With the economic difficulties of the past and the recent announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED), VeChain remains optimistic for further regulatory clarity to unfold around the crypto industry. This gives VeChain and its foundation a panoramic view of an exciting new phase for blockchain. The Foundation anticipates a “productivity plateau” in 2023. It is confident that the blockchain VeChainThor will become a leading platform in the coming years as adoption accelerates exponentially in line with the Layer 1 smart contract platform. VeChain On A Path To Sustainability? Another of the Foundation’s critical elements for 2023 is the continued development of the “digital ecosystem” concept, which the Foundation claims represents an “evolutionary leap” in connectivity, information sharing, and collaboration through the power of the blockchain VeChainThor. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit Taking Reaches Levels Not Seen Since Nov. 2021 According to the Foundation, in this new era, blockchain technology provides benefits in exchange for the “consensual provision of user data that contributes to a greater good, such as sustainability.” VET’s digital ecosystem concept represents a milestone in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), which have a deadline of 2030.

42421942,hkpwiFmxYEifjUax0eQSDY,1675368582,Crypto Winter Led to 91% Plunge in VC and Other Investments for January,"Investment in cryptocurrency companies plunged 91% in January from a year earlier. Given that these deals can take months to get done, any funding drought resulting from the November collapse of FTX might not even be fully reflected yet.  Venture capital (VC) and other investments in privately held crypto startups amounted to $548 million last month, a huge drop from $6 billion in January 2022, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. The number of transactions shrank to 62 from 166, and most of the 2023 deals were for smaller, early-stage companies, CoinDesk's analysis shows.  It was a difficult year-over-year comparison for the industry, in part because the 2022 figure caught the tail end of the bull market. There were 17 investment rounds in January 2022 that exceeded $100 million, including the transaction that valued the now-collapsed FTX crypto exchange at $32 billion. An investment in Blockstream was the only deal that big a year later.  Funding rounds can take months to finalize or close, and some of the investments reflected last month were likely already raising money when the FTX collapse started in early November. The coming months will show exactly how much investment capital dried up after the FTX scandal came to light.  Stepping away from CeFi  FTX’s demise created doubts about the whole centralized exchange (CeFi) model of trading crypto, and persuaded some that decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) are the better way forward.  The fundraising data compiled by CoinDesk shows that wariness may have showed up in investments, with CeFi deals sinking 99% to $22.8 million in January 2023. Also, the CeFi firms that managed to raise money had a tie to DeFi. That includes Architect, a startup founded by Brett Harrison, former president of FTX US, which raised $5 million to build trading software.  Infrastructure projects had the softest landing, dropping a relatively small 59% to $357 million, the CoinDesk data shows. That dollar amount was also the highest for any category. Infrastructure startups Blockstream and QuickNode raised $125 million and $60 million, respectively.  VC firms had telegraphed that infrastructure projects might enjoy a tailwind.  When Andreessen Horowitz published its inaugural ""state of crypto"" report in May, it reiterated its belief that developers build during bear markets, boosting industry optimism and eventually, in theory, asset prices.  In a December interview with CoinDesk, David Pakman, managing partner and venture investing head at crypto-focused VC firm CoinFund, revealed the investment trends he expected would emerge this year, including blockchain and Web3 infrastructure.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/02/crypto-winter-led-to-91-plunge-in-vc-and-other-investments-for-january,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ace1c65dd22f637deb31a7fe255a4e0478c0c99-4752x2983.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The 27-year-old will stay in jail until at least Feb. 14.  In October, Eisenberg revealed himself to be part of the group that exploited the Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Mango Markets for $114 million. After pulling off the heist – which Eisenberg described on Twitter as both legal and a ""highly profitable trading strategy"" – he returned $67 million to preempt the Mango Markets decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) from suing him in civil court.  The gambit didn't work. Eisenberg is currently being sued by Mango Labs for the remaining $47 million, and he's been indicted on three criminal offenses including commodities fraud, commodities manipulation, and wire fraud.  Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico in the early evening of Dec. 26, and was held there until Wednesday, when he was transferred to New York. Eisenberg's lawyer, Brian Klein, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Willis that his client was tired from his travels, which included a stopover in Oklahoma.  ""He didn't get a lot of sleep last night,"" Klein said.  Eisenberg, wearing a canary-yellow jumpsuit and ankle shackles, sat slouched in his seat next to Klein and occasionally ran his hands through his hair. Eisenberg's parents were also present.

The documents from 2021 probes of Tether by the New York Attorney General and the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission reveal the previously unknown ownership structure of the secretive issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin. Tether’s USDT stablecoin is a key piece of infrastructure in the crypto world, easing the movement of money in the industry. Yet, the people behind it have not always been forthcoming about how they operate.  Tether began from separate companies led by ex-plastic surgeon Giancarlo Devasini and former child actor Brock Pierce. Devasini, who helped develop crypto exchange Bitfinex and is now its chief financial officer, owned about 43% of Tether in 2018, according to the documents seen by the Journal.  Two other executives of both Bitfinex and Tether, CEO Jean-Louis van Der Velde and Chief Counsel Stuart Hoegner, each owned roughly 15% of Tether in 2018, the documents revealed.  The fourth major owner as of 2018 was a businessman with British and Thai citizenship known as Christopher Harborne in the U.K. and Chakrit Sakunkrit in Thailand. He controlled about 13% of Tether.  Together, the four men owned approximately 86% of Tether through their own holdings and another related company.  Tether declined to comment to the Wall Street Journal about its ownership structure, and a Tether spokesperson did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment on the story.  In a tweet following the publication of the WSJ's article, Paolo Aordino, the chief technology officer of Bitfinex and Tether, called the piece ""a clown article,"" adding, ""People understand that Tether is standing for freedom and inclusion.""

That was largely boosted by bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) 1.6% rise to $23.76K as of shortly before 3:00 p.m. ET, as well as ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) 3.3% climb to $1.67K. The tokens shot up 42.7% and 37.9% YTD, respectively, following a disastrous 2022. Traders' optimism around the Fed acknowledging its progress on the battle against persistent inflation is being seen across various risky asset classes, including stocks, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq ( COMP.IND ) soaring 2.6% (buoyed by big-tech earnings). Market participants will keep close watch of Friday's jobs report, which will provide more insight on whether the U.S. economy added less jobs growth during the month, a decrease of which economists are expecting. Slower labor growth is what the Fed wants to see as it seeks to reduce the gap between labor supply and demand so that wages don't contribute to inflationary pressures.

42388138,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR6oTJ,1675358691,Coinbase Shares Soar as Crypto-Related Stocks Continue Post-Fed Rally,"Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) jumped more than 20% on Thursday after the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike and Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted progress in fighting the high rate of inflation.  The U.S.-based exchange also got a boost after it won a dismissal on Wednesday of a proposed class-action lawsuit by customers who claimed Coinbase sold them unregistered securities.  The company’s stock is up more than 100% this year as the crypto industry started recovering from the FTX exchange's collapse. Because Coinbase makes most of its revenue from trading volume, its stock price is highly correlated with bitcoin (BTC), which has been rallying so far this year.  U.K. bank Barclays said in a note on Thursday that Coinbase volumes rose 56% in January from the previous month, and that “volumes are now near levels seen in October before the collapse of FTX, but remain below the average for 2022.”  Most crypto-linked stocks are also rallying, along with the broader equity markets. Business software company MicroStrategy (MSTR), which sometimes acts as a bitcoin proxy because of the large amount of its holdings, rose about 10%, while crypto bank Silvergate Capital (SI) shares soared more than 30% on Thursday.  ""We might be getting six more weeks of winter, but it doesn’t seem like we will be seeing an ice age in crypto,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, referring to the latest Groundhog Day forecast. ""January was a robust month for crypto and the [Federal Open Market Committee rate] decision helped keep all risky assets going higher,"" he added.  Meanwhile, crypto miners, which are heavily exposed to the price of bitcoin, are also outperforming. Stocks of miners Marathon Digital (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), Hive Blockchain (HIVE), CleanSpark (CLSK) and Hut 8 (HUT) were among those that climbed more than 10%. Peer Cipher Mining (CIFR) outperformed the group, rising by more than 20%, after reaching all-time high in computing power in January.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin was trading as high as $23,830 on Thursday, while ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, rose 2% to trade at $1,675 as of press time.  ""Bitcoin is riding this risk-on mood from Wall Street, but it might struggle to break above massive resistance from the $25,000 level​,"" Moya noted.  The tech-stocks heavy Nasdaq index rose about 3%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.3% on Thursday.

42411233,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMKJZ,1675356624,Why Ex-SEC Official John Reed Stark Is Wrong About Crypto,"In earlier eras, town criers would announce the latest news, a royal decree or warn the population of some threat. These figures were especially important at times of low literacy rates in society, where they could transmit, through common spoken language, the most vital announcements.  Something analogous exists today with social media replacing the public square, allowing any digital citizen to warn the netizens of this opportunity or that calamity. Our world has become considerably more complicated and technologically complex, and we now rely on modern town criers to help us understand a world filled with competing opinions.  Miller Whitehouse-Levine has overall strategic and operational responsibility for the execution of the DeFi Education Fund’s mission and goals.  Crypto is no different, and a recent deep-dive Twitter thread by former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark fits the pattern. His recent thread reviewing the “design language” of the “crypto-Ponzi” scheme is a good example of thoughtful criticism focused on how we talk about crypto.  One of the biggest criticisms of crypto is that it has not fulfilled its promises of increasing financial inclusivity, especially among groups that have historically had limited access to traditional financial services. Stark, who is now president of John Reed Stark Consulting LLC, makes this point, and further accuses the entire crypto industry of orchestrating a malicious effort to capture these disaffected groups and extract fees from people who don’t know any better.  While it is certainly true that crypto has hardly improved financial inclusion, it would be shortsighted to accept the status quo and disregard the potential of building financial infrastructure accessible via the internet.  The question is at least worth exploring, given the human prosperity tech has unlocked. Can crypto do the same for financial services as the internet and smartphones did to provide access to information and knowledge. If one believes that crypto cannot, then what can?  According to the World Bank, there are roughly 1.4 billion “unbanked” people around the world. Of those 1.4 billion, 1.1 billion have access to an internet-connected phone. Would critics write off crypto completely, asserting without doubt that it has no part to play in bringing financial services – a prerequisite to wealth creation – to those billion people?  Is it possible to be at once disappointed that crypto has not yet made those hoped-for gains while also remaining open-minded to the possibility it is the only extant potential solution to this civilizational-level problem?  Stark also decries crypto’s promises to “restore freedom and liberty” to oppressed people around the world. In fact, as the past several years have shown, one of the primary use cases for crypto is to move capital out of repressive countries, such as Russia, Venezuela and China. Ukraine’s minister of digital transformation has said crypto is invaluable for the country’s wartime logistical needs.  For those reasons alone, we should support the development of crypto services that provide increased autonomy for citizens that cannot rely on stable institutions and fair government in their own countries.  One of Stark’s final points is a familiar one: Crypto gives criminals the best chance to steal from other people and abscond with their ill-gotten gains. This doesn’t accurately reflect the evidence, and one cannot compare the prevalence of illicit financial activity in crypto and in the traditional financial system because it is nearly impossible to even estimate the level of illicit activity in comparatively opaque TradFi.  See also: Crypto Gets the Regulation It Deserves | Opinion  Any amount of fraud, theft or other financial crime in crypto is unacceptable, but overstating the prevalence of illicit activity will not lead to sound policies that promise to combat illicit activity in crypto. Indeed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified in April 2022, “It’s harder on a large scale for an economy to actually use crypto to evade sanctions.”  Counter to crypto’s mainstream reputation as a comfortable haven for cyber criminals, the U.S. Department of Justice has become quite adept at disrupting this sort of illicit activity because of blockchain’s unique attributes. According to Chainalysis, illicit activity, as a percentage of all crypto transactions, reached an all-time low in 2022.  Most importantly, we must never conflate an individual’s desire for privacy with illicit intent. There are countless legitimate reasons to protect one’s privacy apart from a desire to commit a crime without consequence. Indeed, this concept is a foundational element of our social contract and system of governance, and it deserves reassertion now more than ever before.  See also: 2023: The Year Regulators Finally Grasp Crypto? | Opinion  Without doubt, crypto needs critical town criers. But we shouldn’t wholly write off a technology that has real promise, nor should we pass harsh judgment on users and developers for not yet fulfilling the aspirations of this new technology – aspirations that include solving some of our most intractable, costly and long-standing societal problems.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Miller Whitehouse-Levine,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/02/why-ex-sec-official-john-reed-stark-is-wrong-about-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/962130f8655ed9441220f0d93aa449e80a912ccd-2048x1242.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42388131,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR6o5v,1675356623,Giant Bitcoin 'Taproot Wizard' NFT Minted in Collaboration With Luxor Mining Pool,"Independent developer Udi Wertheimer claims he minted a giant image of what appears to be a bald, bearded wizard donning sunglasses and promoting “magic internet JPEGs” on the Bitcoin blockchain via the Ordinals protocol.  His announcements in the Discord channel “taprootwizards.com” and on Twitter sparked further flames of division between Bitcoin purists and Ordinals proponents. The block that minted the non-fungible token (NFT) was mined by bitcoin mining firm Luxor Technologies, which said it was “the largest Bitcoin block” ever mined.  Battle lines were drawn when the Ordinals protocol, which stores non-fungible tokens on Bitcoin, launched on the dominant blockchain last month. That showdown created two factions – purists who insist on using bitcoin (BTC) exclusively for payments and Ordinals fans who welcome NFTs, including this “Taproot wizard” sketch that nearly filled an entire 4 megabyte (MB) block, incurred no transaction fees (although a premium off-chain fee was likely paid) and left Bitcoiners of both stripes mystified.  The image itself is a throwback to an early Bitcoin meme featuring a similar wizard, crudely rendered in MSPaint, inviting all and sundry to “Join us” on the then-popular r/bitcoin subreddit.  Read more: Bitcoin Community Erupts in Existential Debate Over NFT Project Ordinals  Bitcoin transaction blocks are capped at 4MB, while individual transactions are limited to 1MB unless a user directly approaches a miner to process a larger non-standard transaction (like the wizard NFT) that fills an entire block. The image, which was a massive 3.94 MB, had many Bitcoiners asking: Who would go through the trouble of processing this non-standard NFT mint (or “inscription” in Ordinals lingo) and why?  Earlier Thursday, Wertheimer tweeted about the Taproot wizard, stating that “we made history” and linking to the Taproot Wizards Discord channel. The channel contains a Jan. 31 announcement message from Wertheimer alluding to the future minting of the Taproot Wizard.  He and Luxor CEO Nick Hansen collaborated to ensure the Taproot wizard NFT was included in a block mined by Luxor, according to a Luxor spokesperson.  Amid much online criticism, Luxor Chief Operating Officer Ethan Vera tweeted the company views the Taproot Wizard as “short term R&D” as it looks to maximize the revenue potential for both the company and its clients.  ""Luxor's payout method is based on a full-pay-per-share model, meaning miners get paid an equal market rate for their hashrate based on the total value of bitcoin and transaction fees mined in a given timeframe,"" Colin Harper, head of research and content at Luxor, told CoinDesk.  ""Miners are paid the same regardless of how many (or how few) blocks Luxor mines in a given timeframe. As such, any transactions that weren't included in the NFT block would have been included in subsequent blocks and the variance would even out. This block did not affect miner compensation.""  Veteran Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, who vehemently opposes having Ordinals on Bitcoin, says he’s developed a rudimentary “spam filter” that screens for inscriptions and prevents them from being relayed through the Bitcoin network. An inscription is when arbitrary content (like text or an image) is added to sequentially numbered satoshis (sats) – the smallest units in Bitcoin – to create unique “digital artifacts.”  Critics of Ordinals argue that NFTs will compete with traditional payment transactions by crowding blocks and driving up transaction fees.  Casey Rodarmor, creator of the Ordinals protocol, disagrees but isn’t fazed by Luke’s new invention. In fact, he welcomes it.  “It filters inscriptions from an individual Core node’s mempool,” Rodarmor told CoinDesk. “I actually told him how to look for inscriptions to filter them.”  UPDATE (Feb. 2, 2023 18:00 UTC): Adds data size of the NFT and a quote from Luxor's head of research and content, Colin Harper.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | RESEARCH,"Frederick Munawa, George Kaloudis",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/02/giant-bitcoin-taproot-wizard-nft-minted-in-collaboration-with-luxor-mining-pool,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7798b65f7dbc1a0d2f7c94aa11647a19a8ec3dfa-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411226,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMK32,1675355025,How Crypto Advocacy Must Change Post-FTX Collapse,"Four years ago, around the end of the initial coin offering (ICO) era, I said in a YouTube interview that “Rebellious Teenager Crypto Is Maturing.” For three years it did indeed appear so as financial institutions, mainstream venture funds and Big Tech companies streamed into the space. Unfortunately, over the last 12 months the failure of centralized finance platforms such as Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network, BlockFi, FTX and Genesis [a CoinDesk sister company] has seriously hurt the industry’s reputation.  While the financial impact is likely transitory, the shift in public perception of the industry has changed the ground rules for crypto advocacy. Whereas advocacy in 2020-2022 focused on legal arguments and political bargaining, advocacy in this new court of public opinion requires a far more thoughtful and measured approach.  Ajit Tripathi is a CoinDesk columnist, an angel investor in multiple crypto startups and a contributor to key Web3 ecosystems, notably Polygon. He has previously worked at Aave, Binance, ConsenSys and Goldman Sachs.  Advocate for internet-style regulation of ‘tech crypto’  One key lesson of 2022 is that “money crypto” and “tech crypto” need to be treated differently. Money crypto in this context includes crypto-financial services such as custody, exchanges, market making, investing and lending. And tech crypto includes open-source, public permissionless innovation such as blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT), Web3 gaming, wallets, tools and infrastructure. Financial stability and consumer protection failures in crypto did not arise from the failure of technology, but the failure of oversight and controls. DeFi blue chips continued to operate without a glitch last year, while large opaque, centralized crypto financial institutions collapsed like dominoes.  Unfortunately, financial regulation, essentially a patchwork of crippling rules accumulated over a century, is not conducive to any form of technological innovation. If the United States and other major economies want to be competitive in the metaverse era, they need to create new legislation for tech crypto that is inspired by internet rules and not by financial regulation. This future is what the crypto industry advocates must work towards.  Tech crypto is a continued evolution of the internet, and needs to be regulated in a similar way as regulators approach the Web.We can find a parallel for this type of legislation in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides immunity from liability for providers and users of an ""interactive computer service"" who publish information provided by third-party users. Without Section 230, the internet would not have become the overall benevolent, democratizing, liberating influence it has become for 8 billion people.  See also: Crypto Gets the Regulation It Deserves | Opinion  As an extension of internet technologies, tech crypto needs its own Section 230-like rules, a “do no harm” regime that protects participants from liability. This would protect open-source developers and innovators from oppression by the state or oppressive litigation by private interests. However, just as the protections of Section 230 are not unlimited, regulators should also be given space to pursue bad actors from rug pulls, scams, malicious exploits, pumps and dumps, grift and fraud.  Advocate for innovation while distancing ourselves from opportunism  Before LUNA imploded, Web3 policy advocates had shown little intent to challenge the off-chain opportunistic, unsustainable growth-hacking Ponzi scheme that the 20% yield in the Terra system's Anchor protocol represented. In fact, the LUNA mechanism had loud, unmitigated support from some of the most passionate industry advocates on social media. And while some on Crypto Twitter had called out Alameda Research’s “pump and dump” schemes, predatory tokenomics, “front end glitches,” mysterious liquidations and other dubious practices well before FTX imploded, many more were [FTX CEO] Sam Bankman-Fried boosters.  If we crypto advocates do not make the distinction between well-intended innovators and dubious or disreputable actors, we can not expect the general public to do so. We need to be very clear on who we represent and who we don’t. If we don’t make this delineation ourselves, the rest of the society – voters, courts and legislatures – will find it rather hard to do so on our behalf.  Back claims with research and data  Crypto are a matter of prejudice rather than fact. Critics like John Reed Stark tend to cherry-pick examples that validate their preset notions about the industry. Supporters, too, often take refuge in unfalsifiable slogans such as “bitcoin is a battery” or claims like “bitcoin is used by the poor in Nigeria and Lebanon,” neither of which provide actionable insight to design and implement public policy.  What the industry needs to do instead is back up its revolutionary objectives and claims with independent and objective data-driven research published in the journals and forums that policymakers follow. For example, industry advocacy groups could sponsor methodologically robust research on the impact of open finance in regions that lack a functioning currency or banking system, the environmental footprint of bitcoin mining and crypto’s utility as an internet native micropayment system. We also need studies looking at refugee and inner city African American communities, financial literacy and the benefits of transparent and decentralized finance protocols.  This approach is necessary for two major reasons. Where our assumptions are valid, the industry will benefit from the shift in attitudes and public perception. Where they are not, the industry will be able to tweak and tailor our approach to enhance our positive impact and mitigate any negative impact. Without rigorous evidence, saying crypto minimizes oppression and destitution or that finance benefits from transparency are just theories.  Solicit community feedback and avoid backroom deals  One of the factors that triggered immense crypto community anger towards Sam Bankman-Fried was the revelation the FTX founder was looking to cut secret deals with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other authorities to benefit his centralized operation at the expense of decentralized finance. Similarly, well-heeled venture funds have allegedly proposed regulations that would favor their investments.  While it's natural in political bargaining for market participants to look to tilt the policy in their own favor at the expense of other participants, doing so in a clandestine, opaque manner is antithetical to the values of transparency and community participation in Web3. It is also unnecessary. During 2017-2019, the ConsenSys-sponsored Brooklyn Project routinely solicited public feedback from the global crypto community before making substantial representations to policymakers. This is also something Coin Center has consistently done well.  See also: A 5-Pronged Approach to Sensible Crypto Regulation After FTX | Opinion  While some of the policy positions of the Brooklyn Project were intended to benefit Ethereum and ConsenSys, the open and transparent approach prevented unnecessary strife, mistrust and bad behavior by industry participants.  Learn about the history of financial regulation  While financial regulation, in aggregate, harms consumers and is not conducive to innovation, we do need to understand the purpose and motivation of the rules that exist today. Builders and industry representatives need to take the time to speed read why some of the key regulations such as MIFID II, Basel III, the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act and the Dodd Frank Act were created and what the main substantive criticisms of these regulations are.  Provide substantive examples of technological innovation  As Stanford University professor of cryptography Dan Boneh recently acknowledged, investment in blockchain technology has accelerated the evolution of zero-knowledge cryptography by several years. Zero-knowledge cryptography has privacy and identity applications well beyond blockchains. Similarly, NFTs have enabled many artists and creators to distribute their art directly to their fans and followers. At a time when there’s a lot of bathwater, we must find and demonstrate evidence of the baby – and there are a few of those.  Think beyond the United States  For good reasons, the crypto industry has largely focussed on education and advocacy in the United States but the opportunity in crypto is global. This means thinking globally but acting locally. The United Kingdom., European Union and India have a very different institutional architecture than the U.S., and the concerns and dynamics are very different. For example, India merged its versions of the CFTC and the SEC after the famous Harshad Mehta stock market debacle of 1992, while the U.K. reorganized its architecture after the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers. Understanding these differences and their origins can lead to informed, credible conversations. Ignoring them can lead to an instant loss of credibility.  In summary, let’s not delude ourselves into believing that an eventual market rally put bitcoin back in the public’s good graces. FTX, as a mainstream brand, has brought the industry significant unfavorable attention, not only from governments but from the voters that elect the governments.  See also: Why Real Regulatory Change In Crypto Has Not Happened | Opinion  All is decidedly not well, and complacency will mean adverse crypto regulation across the world that will cripple both Web3 tech and crypto markets. Tech crypto, which continues to drive exponential innovation in fields ranging from art and culture to distributed computing and cryptography, deserves a far better reputation, public perception and popular support than the unfortunate failures of money crypto have allowed us. Therefore, it’s time to invest far more energy and talent into policy, education and advocacy than we ever have as an industry.  At some point, all rebellious teenagers have to grow up.

Twitter Scraps Free API Access In an announcement on February 2, Twitter, one of the world’s largest social media platforms, said they will no longer support free access to their v2 and v1.1 APIs. Instead, anyone interested must have to subscribe to the basic paid tier. Starting February 9, we will no longer support free access to the Twitter API, both v2 and v1.1. A paid basic tier will be available instead 🧵 — Twitter Dev (@TwitterDev) February 2, 2023 The Twitter API platform provides access to data sets generated and posted by millions of Twitter users. Only registered applications can access Twitter APIs and, by default, would access public data transmitted from any of the five endpoints, which include access to accounts and users, and tweets and replies. The social media giant pointed to the quality of its data, saying that over the years, trillions of user-generated tweets have been sent by millions of users across the world. Billions of tweets continue to be sent every week. Related Reading: Elon Musk Lifts Twitter Ban On Dogecoin Accounts; DOGE Pumps 7% – Here’s What Happened The social media platform said its data sets are powerful considering their diversity and depth. Even with the new requirement, they will continue “enabling fast and comprehensive access” so developers can continue building using their data. In the development world, APIs are critical for developers and businesses. With APIs, it is easier for developers to collaborate. Data flows through APIs to ensure products are continuously improved. Most importantly, new applications can be integrated into existing architecture using APIs. APIs are also important in the crypto world, considering the fast-paced nature of the industry. Through APIs, developers can create complex functionalities more quickly and securely, eliminating the need to incur costs in software conversions. Crypto Development Using APIs The social media giant is used by over 368 million people every month across the globe. Therefore, the diversity of data means there is density, a quality that developers use to integrate or improve their products. Crypto developers have created different tools, including real-time trackers for gauging prevailing sentiment on top crypto assets, including Bitcoin, using the platform’s APIs. By tapping into the social media’s Developer Portal and using their APIs, bots can be deployed to serve different functions according to the needs of the creators. Above all, it should be noted that bots cannot function without these APIs. Related Reading: Twitter Working On Its Own Crypto Wallet Prototype It is not immediately clear why the Elon Musk-owned company is scrapping free access to its APIs.

42410850,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggs24p,1675351373,UK Crypto Industry Celebrates Government’s Planned Exemptions for Crypto Ad Approvals,"The U.K. crypto industry has welcomed a government decision to introduce a bespoke exemption for crypto companies looking to advertise to local customers. But the country’s financial regulator is a bit more cautious.  As part of the government’s plans to bring crypto promotions into the scope of regulations, a new rule added to the Financial Services and Markets Act moving through Parliament included restrictions on who gets to approve crypto ads. The requirement would have meant most crypto firms “will not be able to communicate their own promotions, unlike other financial services firms” which are authorized “by virtue” of having other relevant permissions, the U.K. Treasury said on Wednesday, but the exemption (which is not in effect yet) announced on Tuesday means crypto companies can approve their own promotions for the time being.  Feedback from the industry made it clear that not many qualified people would have been willing to approve crypto ads, and the government's plan would have amounted to “an effective ban,” the Treasury said.  “I think that was a great win for the industry. I've lobbied for this and I know some of my clients have, industry bodies have and I think we got exactly what we asked for,” said Diego Ballon Ossio, a senior associate at U.K.-based law firm Clifford and Chance. Ian Taylor, director at lobby group CryptoUK and Mark Aruliah, senior policy adviser at Elliptic echoed this.  Read more: Proposed UK Rules Will Make Advertising Crypto a Lot Harder, Industry Warns  Not everyone welcomes the Treasury’s exemption. Given the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) increasing focus on consumer protection “it is hard to see how the regulator could ever agree to this,” said James Alleyne, legal director at Kingsley Napley, who worked at the FCA previously in an emailed statement.  A new set of much-anticipated regulatory plans published by the Treasury on Wednesday could make it mandatory for crypto firms to be authorized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). For now, firms have to apply for FCA registration under its anti-money laundering regime.  But registration isn’t exactly a walk in the park either. The FCA has only approved 14% of the registrations it received from crypto businesses, and is known for being critical of crypto, unlike the U.K.’s Conservative government, which has repeatedly stated its desire to turn the country into a crypto hub.  “We will publish our final rules for crypto asset promotions when the relevant legislation is made. We expect to take a consistent approach to that taken for other high-risk investments,” an FCA spokesperson told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. “Crypto assets are high risk and anyone who purchases them should be prepared to lose all their money.”  The government has “taken the hard decision to listen to the industry,” regardless of what the regulator thinks, Aruliah said.

Binance Integrates The Optimism Network In a press release on February 2, Binance said their users can now begin depositing and withdrawing the wrapped token via the Optimism Network. The Optimism Network is a layer-2 protocol on Ethereum seeking to scale the smart contracting platform and drastically lower fees. Transaction fees on Optimism are several folds lower than on Ethereum, and dApps launching on it can benefit from rapid transaction processing speeds. The Optimism Network is the second largest Ethereum layer-2 platform with a total value locked share of 32.58%. Its native token, OP, is currently trading at $2.79. Following this integration, Binance allows users to transfer Binance-pegged BUSD, a wrapped version of BUSD, on the Optimism network. BUSD is a stablecoin that tracks the USD and is issued by Paxos under the Binance brand. The issuer of BUSD says the stablecoin, compliant with the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. The Binance-pegged BUSD is a version of BUSD that can be used to move value beyond Ethereum to Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance ecosystems, including the BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Related Reading: Optimism Edges Other L2s In Gas Efficiency, Despite Loss In TVL, Revenue Binance said holders can swap BUSD and Binance-pegged BUSD freely between chains. As a wrapped token of BUSD, Binance-pegged BUSD is held by a third party and is a different product from BUSD. Nonetheless, Binance has assured holders that it is safe to hold. Over the years, the Binance ecosystem has grown. Although there are bridges with Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) remains interoperable with other networks, association with Ethereum is critical. The decision by Binance to integrate Optimism Network could boost activity in the BSC. Scaling Ethereum Using Layer-2 Solutions The Optimism Network is among the many layer-2 protocols aiming to scale Ethereum. As a general-purpose platform, dApps can deploy and retain the base layer’s security. Over the months, layer-2 platforms, dominated mainly by Arbitrum and Optimism, have been processing increasingly more transactions. Dune Analytics’ data on January 10 showed that Arbitrum and Optimism processed 1.12 million transactions versus Ethereum, at 1.06 million. Related Reading: How Arbitrum and Optimism Made Millions in 2022 According to Vitalik Buterin, scaling Ethereum through layer-2 solutions, including Optimism, will form a base for further throughput enhancement in the future. With the merge completed, the goal of Ethereum developers is to gradually improve on-chain scalability through Sharding. Then, Ethereum developers would process over 100,000 transactions per second, establishing themselves as a smart contracting platform leader.

January’s Crypto Exchange Vetting evaluated over 450 exchanges, clearing 18 with a “Vetted” status: Binance.US, bitbank, Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Bitso, Bitstamp, Bittrex, BTC Markets, CEX.IO, Coinbase, Coincheck, CrossTower, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, LMAX, Okcoin and Zaif.  Ten exchanges were considered “watchlist exchanges” for potential future inclusion on the vetted exchanges list: Binance, Bitrue, CoinEx, CoinTiger, Crypto.com, Gate.io, Huobi, KuCoin, LATOKEN and Phemex.  Growing up  DAR’s big business is working with institutional investors to conduct detailed due diligence on opportunities within the digital assets space.  Today, more of those investors are buying exchange vetting and counterparty diligence services from DAR, according to Schwenk. Instead of vetting one or two counterparties at a time, they are often looking at lists of 10 or more, implying that more investors are considering diversifying around counterparty risk by using multiple exchanges.  “I think this is an opportunity to really raise the bar as an industry, because we’ve had a couple of challenges,” said Schwenk. “A big one is just the immaturity of many of these counterparties. As centralized exchanges grow up, many of them are stubbing their toes along the way. Things are not as buttoned up and put-together as we would like them to be.”  There are also plenty of bad actors in the digital assets industry, according to Schwenk. But differentiating immature actors from bad actors is often only possible in hindsight, after the money’s gone.  Read more: When Regulating Crypto, Please Target the Bad Actors, Not the Asset  The path towards more maturity and trust in digital assets will be paved by transparency. After 2022’s failures, investor and consumer expectations for transparency are going up.  “We’re working on developing and defining what the expectations of transparency should be that are reasonable for the industry to meet at this stage of its maturity, and necessary for those who are taking risk,” Schwenk said. “We’re going to see a lot of solutions to some of these problems being worked out and built out, whether it’s the ability to trade on Binance while your assets are in custody in a separate entity and in theory segregated client funds, or net settlements solutions.”  About FTX  One of the biggest failed exchanges in 2022, FTX, was not on DAR’s vetted exchange list ahead of its collapse.  “FTX was not on our vetted list, but we definitely had some things that worked, and some things that we could have done better with or that we just missed,” said Schwenk. “We had some immediate fails in our diligence based on public information on FTX, one being the lack of robust [know your customer] and [anti-money laundering] controls – you could actually trade on FTX.com without providing proof of identity, and that opens up the opportunity for wash trading and market manipulation as well as money laundering concerns.”  The opaque relationship with crypto hedge fund Alameda Research was another red flag, according to Schwenk. Attempts to get FTX to clarify its relationship with Alameda were dismissed.  Eventually, Sam Bankman-Fried stepped down from Alameda Research to focus on FTX and the nature of his continued involvement in both firms was obfuscated.  “They were just not very forthcoming,” said Schwenk. “One of the things we got right was in recognizing that there was no clarity into how they were managing those conflicts. You could jump to conclusions and suspect that there was a possibility Alameda was front-running clients or has fast-track access to the exchange – we didn’t know exactly what it meant, of course, but without a policy governing or for managing those conflicts, the suspicions were warranted. You need to have questions about why they weren’t offering to address the issue.”  Other concerns included the likelihood that FTX’s native FTT token was actually a security, and that FTX was potentially running afoul of securities laws.  Read more: The FTX Downfall: Full Coverage  DAR was engaged by a large hedge fund to conduct institutional due diligence on FTX – and when the analysts requested more transparency from the doomed exchange, they were met with resistance.  “We came in with a request for more transparency around the number of what would be deemed confidential materials,” said Schwenk. “This is something we’ve done successfully with CoinBase, Genesis, Hidden Road, Falcon X and a number of more mature centralized counterparties. The response of FTX was that ‘we are not willing to engage in diligence at all, especially given the questions we think you are going to ask.’”  So Schwenk and DAR tried to leverage personal relationships they had with people behind the scenes at FTX, but were “boxed out” of any amount of diligence they tried to conduct.  To see a digital assets exchange interested in courting large clients but unwilling to participate in modest due diligence “screamed red flags,” according to Schwenk.  “When you make those kinds of overtures, the tone and manner of the response, there’s valuable information in that,” Schwenk said. “It lets you know that they’re either immature, or that bad things are happening – and it turns out that it was both at FTX, based on the information we have now.  “I lived through the financial crisis as COO of a $1 billion hedge fund, we did diligence on Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Lehman Brothers, and we stayed out of Lehman because of the inherent risks and didn’t get caught in the bankruptcy,” he said. “Crypto people need to apply the same thinking in times of stress.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | BNB,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/02/02/better-exchange-due-diligence-could-help-define-cryptos-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c7f96c3dbeab29213e395e84d79f35fde787e5c-5126x3417.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Solana co-founders, in a blog post published earlier this week, commented on the ‘crypto market 2022’ while also preaching a better future for the Solana ecosystem. The co-founders said in the blog post: 2022 saw perhaps the steepest decline ever in the general public’s trust in crypto. Much of the decline can be attributed to companies that did not practice the ideals of web3, and the disastrous events that followed are a direct result of their betrayal of the values we hold dear. Solana Growth Despite The Bear Market While praising the network for the survival of the FTX contagion, the Solana co-founders outlined Solana’s growth over the bear market. According to the blog post citing a recent report from Electric Capital Developer, the network has recorded an 8% year-over-year growth of full-time developers on the network. They also added: The developer numbers on Solana are up 83% as of Dec. 2022 from a year earlier. There are now more than 2,000 monthly active developers building on Solana — second in raw numbers only to Ethereum.” Furthermore, part of the product of the bear market effect on Solana included a massive increase in the number of validators and adoption of the network and a second validator client introduced by a third party. It claims up to 0.6 million transactions per second in a test environment. Related Reading: Why This Analyst Thinks Traders Should Not Be Bearish On Solana Notably, the founders touted Solana’s transaction high throughput stating that it matches that of the New York Stock Exchange or other centralized computer networks. The co-founders said this feature is enough to accelerate crypto potential even further. We believe that Solana making blockspace abundant and cheap will leapfrog crypto into its full potential. The Past The Past Moving Onto The Next Undoubtedly, the FTX saga was so contagious and disadvantageous that it brought down every single firm of the project connected to it. Though the unfortunate event affected Solana significantly, the team is willing to leave that in the past and move on to the next thing looking forward to what the new year has in store for the ecosystem. Solana co-founders said: We believe 2023 will be a year where the Solana community continues to take the reins and continues to build the framework for a decentralized and permissionless economy. They further outlined their vision mentioning their aims to make one billion people in the world self-custody their private keys while reflecting on the network’s mobile phone, Solana Mobile. The founders added Solana aims to move toward a better, decentralized web and make on-chain transactions as cheap and affordable as ever.

8671740,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518427,1675346420,Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Profit Taking Reaches Levels Not Seen Since Nov. 2021,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin short-term holder profit-taking has reached high levels not seen since the November of 2021. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Shot Up Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, a near-term top usually becomes more probable when this trend forms for BTC. The relevant indicator here is the “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR), which tells us whether the average Bitcoin investor is selling at a loss or at a profit right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are realizing some profit on their selling currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold suggest the overall market is selling at some loss at the moment. Naturally, the indicator having a value exactly equal to 1 would suggest the average investor is just breaking even right now as the total amount of profits being realized in the market is equal to the losses currently. The SOPR here covers the entire market, but the metric can also be modified to cover only certain segments of the market. One major part of the sector is made up of the “short-term holders” (STH) which is a cohort that includes all investors that acquired their coins within the last 155 days. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin SOPR specifically for these STHs over the last several years: The 30-day MA value of the metric seems to have seen some rise in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day MA Bitcoin STH SOPR had been below a value of 1 throughout the 2022 bear market, implying that these investors had been selling at a loss during this period. Related Reading: Stablecoin Supply Approaches Death Cross, Bad News For Bitcoin? The quant has also marked previous instances of such a trend with the green boxes in the BTC price chart. It looks like this trend was also observed during bearish periods of the past cycles. Recently, with the latest rally, the metric has sharply climbed and broken out of this zone, as its value is above 1 now. This suggests that there is more profit harvesting happening from this cohort than loss realization currently. This makes sense as prices right now are significantly higher than they were during the last 155 days window, which is when the STHs would have bought their coins, so these holders must be in some decent profits currently. As the rally has continued, the STHs seem to have rapidly ramped up their profit-taking as well, since the SOPR indicator for them has also continued to shoot up. The level of their profit realization is now comparable to that seen in November 2021, when Bitcoin set its all-time high. Related Reading: FED To Put Off Interest Rate Hikes, Bitcoin Rallies: Here’s Why As for what this current profit-taking may imply for BTC, the analyst explains, “when retail starts to get euphoric, the probability of a near-term price top starts to increase.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $23,800, up 3% in the last week.

42388136,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR6oOd,1675346404,Top Republican on US Senate Panel Ready to Work on Crypto Rules,"CORRECTION (Feb. 2, 14:24 UTC): A previous version of this story said in the headline that the Senate Banking Committee was releasing its priorities for a crypto regulatory framework, not Sen. Scott.  U.S. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, wants to start work on a bipartisan regulatory framework for cryptocurrency on Thursday, he said in a Thursday statement.  ""The committee should work to facilitate a bipartisan regulatory framework,"" said Scott, whose participation will be key, because that committee would need to clear any major crypto legislation. Scott hasn't addressed his views on crypto, so the industry has been eager to hear from him. He's now moved into the position once occupied by former Sen. Pat Toomey, one of the industry's most staunch champions in Congress.  So far, Scott's brief Thursday statement, which included digital assets regulation as one of his seven priorities for this new session of Congress, read as skeptical on the industry.  ""Recent years have seen expansive growth in the digital assets industry, including an increasing number of consumers interacting with cryptocurrencies,"" Scott's statement read. ""Several high-profile failures resulted in lost consumer assets, exposed regulatory gaps, and highlighted concerns with illicit finance.""  U.S. lawmakers are expected to get to work on the first significant pieces of crypto legislation this year. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) paved the way for crypto legislation in November, sending a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen revealing his willingness to work towards a wide-ranging regulatory framework.  This committee has widely been seen as a bottleneck for regulatory efforts, which have made more progress in other corners of Capitol Hill, such as the House Financial Services Committee and Senate Agriculture Committee. If Scott and Brown find common ground, the panel could become a key venue for what Congress produces on crypto regulation.

Now PleasrDAO is back with a second live auction, and the item for sale is the very couch the meme-famous Shibu Inu, Kabosu, sat on in the picture that spawned a million doge memes.  The item is close to PleasrDAO’s heart. The group made news in 2021 for purchasing the popular Doge NFT for $5.5 million and then selling fractional non-fungible token shares of the famous photo. This sale led to the foundation of the Own The Doge Community, which has encouraged donations to animal and children's charities.  The second live auction event will start streaming on February 8 at 7:30 p.m. ET with guests Kabosu and her rescuer and photographer, Atsuko Sato. Fans of Kabosu will be able to ask questions during the broadcast by participating in polls and chats on PleasrHouse. This rare appearance by Kabuso follows sad news the 17-year old dog was diagnosed with leukemia.  The 24-hour auction for the couch will officially start at 8:30 p.m. ET and is being held to raise money for a good cause. The charity chosen by Atsuko and the Own The Doge community, Save The Children, will receive the proceeds from the sale of the couch. The Own The Doge community has previously donated $1 million to Save The Children.  For more than a decade, Kabosu has been the subject of appreciation on a global scale, serving as the model for the meme coin dogecoin and the ""Do Good Everyday"" charitable and educational concept.  The winner of the auction will receive an NFT with the right to the actual couch. There will also be an open-edition NFT drop to give Kabosu and the charity even more support.

42388137,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qR6oAb,1675346400,The =nil; Foundation Says Its New Software Is Rocket Fuel for Zero-Knowledge Developers,"The =nil; Foundation, the playfully-named blockchain infrastructure startup, introduced a toolkit Thursday that it said will radically decrease the time it will take for developers to build platforms that use zero-knowledge cryptography.  The new project from =nil; called zkLLVM, is intended to act as a compiler for developers building zero-knowledge circuits – fancy algorithms that enable someone to guarantee something is true without walking through the steps to prove it.  ZK technology has been around since the 1980s, but its applicability to crypto – which ranges from transaction privacy to blockchain scaling – has fueled a kind of ZK renaissance in recent years. Breakthroughs in ZK research have driven hundreds of millions in funding to startups like Matter Labs, StarkWare and Mina that develop ZK-based blockchain infrastructure, and CoinDesk reported last week that =nil; had raised $22 million to build its own suite of zero-knowledge products.  Komarov says =nil; created zkLLVM to dramatically slice workloads for ZK developers by making it possible for them to easily turn code written in familiar programming languages – like C++ and Rust – into fully working zero-knowledge circuits.  Writing a zero-knowledge circuit tends to be a complicated, timely endeavor for developers. It generally involves familiarizing oneself with niche programming languages and finicky, domain-specific software libraries.  LLVM, which stands for “low-level virtual machine,” refers to a set of open-source code libraries that developers use to “compile” their human-readable code into a format that can be interpreted by a computer. Building off the LLVM project, “we built a compiler from mainstream languages that are already known to everybody” =nil; founder Mikhail Komarov told CoinDesk.  The zkLLVM project will also automatically plug into =nil;’s recently announced ZK proof market, which it created to help ZK teams decentralize their operations, and outsource certain kinds of computation to third parties.  Read more: The =nil; Foundation Raises $22M to Build Marketplace for Zero-Knowledge Proofs  The =nil; Foundation released the project Thursday on Github under an open-source license, meaning any developer can freely use or modify the zkLLVM code.  The =nil; Foundation says its technology will be particularly useful for the myriad companies racing to build so-called zkEVMs, a kind of Ethereum scaling solution that uses ZK technology to slice the blockchain’s fees and wait times.  Using the zkEVM platform Scroll as an example, Komarov explained that “they built their circuits manually” using a special software library developed for the Rust programming language. “They spent like a year and a half for that and a lot of money as well,” said Komarov. “If they had access to what we made a little bit earlier, maybe they could have spent only a couple of months to just build and debug stuff.”  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  ZK circuits are increasingly used to secure the flow of valuable digital assets, meaning programming errors can prove extremely expensive. Komarov acknowledged to CoinDesk that zkLLVM will need to prove itself before it earns the trust of developers. When an earlier version of the zkLLVM codebase leaked online, some developers said they would be wary of trusting =nil;’s circuit-generation capabilities, given the code’s complexity.  Komarov also noted that zkLLVM currently has limitations when it comes to handling particularly large circuits – programs that are more complicated to translate into zero-knowledge form. He hopes, however, that the zkLLVM codebase will mature to a point where developers can finally stop thinking about the nitty-gritty of ZK-circuit building and focus on other parts of their software.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/02/the-nil-foundation-says-its-new-software-is-rocket-fuel-for-zero-knowledge-developers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/097600320ce0236bbc342c014527badc709c73cc-651x488.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The acquisition sees the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume re-enter South Korea's market, having closed its affiliate there in December 2020 due to low usage. Terms for the deal were not disclosed. Binance's investment in GOPAX came via the Industry Recovery Initiative, which Binance leads and committed $1 billion to in November, after the collapse of FTX.  Shares of Silvergate Capital (SI) fell sharply after the market closed on Thursday after Bloomberg reported the U.S. Department of Justice’s fraud unit was looking into the crypto bank’s dealings with the now-bankrupt FTX and Alameda Research. The criminal investigation is looking at Silvergate’s hosting of accounts tied to FTX and Alameda, according to people familiar with the matter speaking to Bloomberg. Silvergate hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing and the investigation could end without any charges being brought, according to Bloomberg.  Proposals to subpoena FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, his immediate family and senior staff of the bankrupt crypto exchange have been opposed by the U.S. Trustee, a branch of the Department of Justice dealing with bankruptcy. The plans, set to be discussed at a Wednesday hearing, would duplicate any independent examination of the exchange’s downfall, U.S. Trustee Andrew Vara said in a legal filing made Thursday. An independent examiner has yet to be appointed.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the percentage of stablecoins that smart money wallets hold in their portfolio over time.

""This upgrade offers a new level of modularity, simplicity, and Ethereum equivalence for layer 2 solutions, providing unprecedented performance and functionality,"" the proposal added, noting additional benefits that may lead to a Cambrian explosion of layer 2 protocols.  OP has rallied nearly 25% in the past 24 hours, hitting a new record high of $2.90, CoinDesk data show. The Bedrock proposal seems to have driven the token higher.  The community will vote on the proposal after two weeks of discussion. If approved, the upgrade will be implemented on March 15 at 9:00 a.m. PT (17:00 UTC).  Bedrock is a rollup architecture developed by Optimism. Rollups enable batching and publishing hundreds of transactions in a single mainnet block. In other words, they compress many transactions into one, speeding up the blockchain.  Per Messari's Kunal Goel, the Bedrock upgrade will help Optimism improve transaction fees and speed and create a foundation for future improvements like decentralized sequencing, helping it compete with its main rival, Arbitrum. ""OP Labs expects Bedrock will make optimism the cheapest rollup on Ethereum,"" Goel said in a research note last month.  Web3 research and development firm Xord's research writer Zainab Hasan expects the Bedrock upgrade to reduce the block time of Optimism in case of pending transactions from 13 seconds to 2 seconds and facilitate faster deposits.  ""With Bedrock, Optimism will be the first EVM-based rollup to deliver Ethereum-level security guarantees,"" Hasan said in an analysis published in October.  OP token leads the way  Optimism's OP token has rallied nearly 200% in the past few weeks, outshining bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) by a big margin. The top two coins have gained 44% and 39%, respectively. Optimism's rival Arbitrum doesn't have its native token yet.  Optimism has also outpaced in terms of the percentage growth in total value locked in the decentralized finance ecosystem in the past 30 days.  Data from DeFiLlama shows the total value locked (TVL) in Optimism has increased by 47% to $744 million, while that in Arbitrum has gone up by 27% to $1.3 billion.  ""One of the big narratives of 2023 looks to be Layer 2's and the only way to get direct exposure to them right now is through the OP token,"" Conor Ryder, research analyst at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, said. ""TVL on Optimism has also outpaced Arbitrum, its closest competitor, to start the year.""  The layer 2 adoption kicked off last year with Arbitrum and Optimism experiencing a steady growth in the user base despite the broader market swoon. Active user participation on Optimism surpassed that on Arbitrum at the end of December.  If that's not enough, early today, Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, announced the integration of its dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD and its wrapped version Binance-peg BUSD on Optimism.  Binance users can now move BUSD and Binance-peg BUSD across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, TRON, Avalanche and Optimism networks.  The integration may galvanize more investor interest in Optimism, considering BUSD is the world's third-largest stablecoin by market value. At press time, BUSD has a market cap of over $16 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $12.14 billion.  ""BUSD is one of the largest stablecoins, and having it on Binance simplifies the user experience for retail and institutional traders without the need for decentralized bridges,"" said pseudonymous DeFi researcher Ignas, speaking to CoinDesk.  ""Currently, only Ethereum, Polygon, Avax, and Tron are supported. Surprisingly, Arbitrum is not yet supported,"" Ignas added.  Edit: 13:36 UTC, Feb. 3: Corrects Messari analyst's name to Kunal Goel.

With the Fed turning dovish after being hawkish all through 2022, it has been a beacon for the crypto market to rally and the liquidations have ramped up as the market took advantage of this. Crypto Market Liquidations Cross $130 Million With bitcoin’s rally above $24,000, short traders have once again drawn the short stick and are getting brutalized in the market. As of Thursday morning, the volume of liquidations over the last 24 hours has quickly crossed $130 million. Related Reading: Are Nigerians Really Buying Bitcoin For As High As $34,000? Over 47,000 traders have seen their positions liquidated with the market rally and as expected, the vast majority of these have been short traders. Data from Coinglass shows that 72.96% of all traders affected during this liquidation event were short traders. Furthermore, almost half of all liquidations took place on the Binance crypto exchange at 48.34%, while Bybit accounted for 19.37%, and OKX followed closely behind at 14.96%. Interestingly, the largest single liquidation took place on the Bybit exchange on the BTCUSD pair worth $1.69 million. Liquidations cross $130 million | Source: Coinglass Bitcoin leads the pack with over 1,670 BTC liquidated worth $39.67 million. Ethereum saw 20,560 ETH liquidated with $34.31 million, as the price of ETH rocketed past $1,660. Aptos, Solana, and Optimism made the top 5 with liquidations of $6.10 million, $4.05 million, and $2.95 million, respectively. In the last four hours though, there seems to be a turn in the trend with bitcoin’s drop below $24,000. While short traders are still suffering the majority of liquidations (58.14%), long positions are catching up. What Happens If Bitcoin Keeps Growing? Bitcoin has since retraced after climbing above $24,000 but the digital asset still maintains its bullish streak. This means that there is still a long runway for bitcoin and it could possibly climb back above $24,000 before the trading day is over. Related Reading: Data Suggests Sharks Were Behind Litecoin’s 89% Rise To $97, But What About Now? If this happens, then the liquidations are expected to ramp up quickly. BTC’s consolidation over the last few days had worked to sow doubt in the market, and short positions were opened during this time. The Fed’s decision to only raise interest rates by 25 basis points has already instilled more trust in investors who are now more willing to take risks. BTC trending above $23,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Presently, with BTC ranging above its 200-day moving average, $25,000 is more likely a point for the digital asset to end its rally before a major pullback. At the time of this writing, bitcoin is still changing hands just below $24,000 at $23,800.

However, a known SHIB whale could derail the hoped-for price rally. As one of the industry-leading blockchain security companies PeckShield reported via Twitter today, bankrupt crypto lender Voyager has moved some of its crypto holdings. According to PeckShield, about $9.6 million of cryptocurrencies were transferred from Voyager to crypto exchanges Coinbase, Binance US, and Kraken. Among them were around 4.9 million VGX ($2.1 million), 221,000 LINK ($1.5 million), 3,050 ETH ($3 million), and also 270 billion SHIB, equivalent to around $3 million. As the security company also informed, Voyager still holds 6.8 trillion SHIB, equivalent to around $82 million This makes Voyager the 18th largest whale of Shiba Inu and a potential threat to the SHIB price if the tokens were to be sold at some point in the future. The reasons for the transfer were not known at press time. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Observes Highest Rise In Burn Rate – Is This Normal? Rumors are circulating on Twitter that Voyager may want to profit from the recent market rally and liquidate the altcoins to compensate its creditors. If this is true, SHIB could face a sell-off that could push the price down sharply. Shiba Inu Price Remains Unaffected Whether the rumors will actually come true remains to be seen. Binance.US agreed to buy a part of Voyager’s assets in December after the deal between the company and FTX fell through. However, the deal is still in limbo due to opposition from government regulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Committee on Foreign Investments in the U.S. (CFIUS). Another hearing is scheduled for March in the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. In addition, approval by a majority of Voyager’s creditors is also required. At least at press time, the Shiba Inu price showed no signs of a major sell-off. SHIB was trading at $0.00001205, up 4% in the last 24 hours. This is in line with the broader market rally following yesterday’s Fed rate decision. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Face Make Or Break Moment The SHIB price has seen a bounce up from the 200-day EMA and could now target the resistance zone above $0.00001250 once again. In addition to continued positive sentiment in the crypto market, the ‘expected’ launch of Shibarium on Valentine’s Day, February 14 could be a catalyst for the breakout. If the Shiba Inu price were to succeed in writing a new local high, there would be a possibility that SHIB could make a new attempt to break the October 29 high at $0.00001519. Such success could mean a return to the bullish territory.

In fact, despite experiencing severe price drops together with the rest of the broader crypto market during the final quarter of the previous year, the altcoin has managed to stand out as one of the better performers this week. At the time of writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, AVAX is changing hands at $21.81 and has gone up by more than 13% over the last 24 hours. On a weekly and bi-weekly basis, the crypto is sporting upticks of 22.2% and 38.2%, respectively while during the past 30 days the digital asset’s value recorded a tremendous boost, going up by an astonishing 96%. Avalanche Records Massive Jump In Daily Transactions Count This impressive rally that AVAX is currently enjoying seems to have rubbed off in other aspects of its ecosystem, as evidenced by the 85% increase in the average daily transactions its native blockchain processes which now peaks at 288,120. Moreover, before exiting 2022, the smart contract-focused network tallied a daily active address average of 48,023, 3.2% higher of what was recorded during the third quarter of last year. The first institutional Subnet is here! .@IntainFT, a structured finance platform that facilitates administration of $5.5B in assets, is launching IntainMARKETS, an on-chain marketplace for tokenized asset-backed securities. Let’s take a look at why Intain #ChoseAvalanche /🧵 pic.twitter.com/yFGqLIasD1 — Avalanche 🔺 (@avalancheavax) January 31, 2023 In addition, after registering just 18 transactions per second from July to September 2022, Avalanche tallied 33 TPS during the succeeding quarter, nearly doubling its previous tally. It is important to note that these developments happened despite the greater cryptocurrency market being pummeled by the negative effects of events such as the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange company and the long crypto winter, to name a few. Avalanche Moves Toward Institutional Adoption It can be recalled that Amazon Web Services (AWS) was recently in need of a platform where execution and management of smart contracts could be facilitated for transfers of ownerships as well as live market data financial transactions. With Ethereum being the leader in smart contracts, analysts and experts were surprised when Amazon made the decision to pick Avalanche, sparking hopes of greater and better institutional adoption for the blockchain and its native crypto AVAX.

The blockchain seems to be playing all the right cards with regards to this as it announced on January 31, 2023 that it will be partnering with Intain – a structured finance platform responsible for the administration of more than $5 billion worth of assets. With this, Intain becomes Avalanche’s first institutional subnet. AVAX is undeniably responding positively to these developments as it continues to paint its charts in green, recording massive upticks in its value over the last few days.

The wallet also received $4.5 million worth of USD coin (USDC) from an unknown entity as it appears to be consolidating assets in line with bankruptcy proceedings, bringing the total to $10.5 million in the last 24 hours.  “Alameda had an account on Bitfinex and Bitfinex is collaborating with the liquidators to return what’s left,” a Bitfinex spokesperson told CoinDesk.  The wallet, which has received several transactions from another Alameda Research address since its creation 31 days ago, now holds $183 million in various altcoins and $26 million in ether (ETH).  The largest holding is $54 million worth of BitDAO tokens (BIT), although that token has significantly thin liquidity with 2% market depth of just $15,000 on Coinbase, according to CoinMarketCap. Market depth is a metric that assesses how much capital it would take to move an asset by a certain percentage.

Do more and worry less with Coinbase Wallet👇https://t.co/qqr1dmntgo pic.twitter.com/TjYrl7aaol — Coinbase Wallet (@CoinbaseWallet) February 1, 2023 Coinbase Wallet is amongst the most popular non-custodial wallet, after MetaMask, used by many to access DeFi, gaming, NFT, or Metaverse platforms. It is compatible with all EVM-compatible networks. These are platforms that can connect to Ethereum. As a non-custodial wallet, users are in charge and fully liable should they lose any of their assets. Typically, any swap or transfer from Coinbase Wallet must be approved by the owner, who signs with the private key. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Take-off If It Clears This Key Resistance Zone However, hackers are taking advantage of this ability and devolution of power. Through sophisticated phishing campaigns, token and NFT holders unknowingly end up signing off their assets to nefarious agents. Hours later, they discover their mistake, long after the hacker has sold the asset or transferred it to a mixer to cash out. Coinbase Wallet seeks to address this through the Transaction Preview feature. Being a safeguard, the wallet creator said users would now preview their transaction before signing it off by pressing confirm. To achieve this, Coinbase Wallet will first simulate the transaction through a copy of the blockchain to estimate the transaction’s outcome. Once this is done, the sender will have greater peace of mind knowing exactly what the confirming means to their asset balance. With the Transaction Preview feature, Coinbase Wallet says the user has more visibility into their transaction and is a “game changer”. The overall objective, they add, is to make web3 transactions easier and safer. Still, despite the feature aiming to ease and make transaction execution safer, they recommend that users double-check before confirming.

""Instead, it’s a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house, entered into in a country where gambling contracts are traditionally regulated only by states that compete in laxity,"" Munger wrote. ""The U.S. should now enact a new federal law that prevents this from happening.""  In 2021, Munger labeled bitcoin's (BTC) relative success, at the time as ""disgusting"" after alluding to how it is used by kidnappers and extortionists. A year later, the 99-year-old called bitcoin an ""investment in nothing"" as he doubled down on his skeptical stance.

A golden cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of the security's price moves above its 200-day SMA, producing a cross on the price chart. Because moving averages are backward-looking indicators, the signal tells us only that the market's short-term gains have surpassed its long-term gains. Still, chart analysts and traders see it as a harbinger of higher prices over the long run.  ""The winds of change have started to blow with the increasing likelihood of bullish golden crosses in the near future,"" analysts at Valkyrie recently noted in a newsletter, referring to the impending crossover on the daily bitcoin and S&P 500 charts.  Bitcoin will likely see its first golden cross since September 2021 in the next week or two, according to charting platform TradingView. Meanwhile, the S&P 500's averages appear on track to produce the golden cross on Thursday.  The concurrent appearance of the golden cross on bitcoin and the S&P 500 might motivate trend-following crypto traders to hit the market with fresh bids. Bitcoin has evolved as a macro asset since early 2020 and tends to move more or less in line with the S&P 500.  Traders, however, should note that while bitcoin's big rallies often start with a golden cross, not all golden crosses lead to a big rally.  Bitcoin has seen eight golden crosses to date, of which three, confirmed in February 2012, October 2015 and May 2020, were on point, presaging at least a yearlong bull market that saw prices rally between 100% and 350%, data from TradingView shows.  On the other hand, golden crosses of July 2014, July 2015 and February 2020 were bull traps as the cryptocurrency crashed violently into a death cross in the following weeks/months. The death cross is the opposite of the golden cross and represents a bearish shift in the long-term trend.  The remaining two golden crossovers, formed in April and September 2019, were undecisive, with prices rising sharply in the following two months only to slip into a death cross later.  The S&P 500's past data paint a similar picture. The index has seen 52 golden crosses since 1930. In that time, stocks rose in the following year 71% of the time, according to a MarketWatch report quoting Dow Jones Market data.  So, the golden cross appears unreliable as a standalone bullish indicator and should be read in conjunction with other factors, mainly the Federal Reserve's policy, which is becoming less hawkish with each passing month.  As expected, the central bank stepped down to a smaller 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday, lifting the benchmark borrowing cost to the new range of 4.5% to 4.75%. During the post-meeting press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledges that ""inflation has eased somewhat"" while downplaying the risk of tightening-induced economic recession, bringing cheer to risk assets.  According to ING analysts, the Fed is likely to deliver another 25 basis-point increase in March and then pause the rate-hike cycle that rocked financial markets last year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/02/bitcoin-sp-500-close-in-on-bullish-golden-cross-price-signal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb15c222bbbfe895f62597d168a5256b8bdd48a1-3170x1612.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

South Korean prosecutors had sought Kang's arrest last week along with two other executives including his younger sister, Kang Ji-Yeon, the CEO of two publicly traded Bithumb affiliates, Inbiogen (101140) and Bucket Studio (066410), according to local reports.  Bithumb Korea distanced itself from Kang, who has also been identified as a former chairman of the exchange, saying he is connected to Vidente (121800), a publicly traded broadcasting equipment company that is a shareholder of Bithumb.  ""Kang Jong-Hyun is not related to Bithumb Korea. Definitely, he was NOT the former chairman of Bithumb Korea. NEVER,"" the company's PR team said in an email. ""We deny allegations and suspicions that he is our owner.""  The arrests come during a turbulent period for Bithumb. On Thursday last week its offices were raided as part of an investigation into price manipulation of a coin listed on the exchange, Yonhap reported. Last month, the National Tax Service opened an investigation into possible tax evasion at Bithumb Holdings and its affiliates, and earlier in January former Chairman Lee Jung-Hoon was acquitted on charges that he committed a $100 million fraud connected to the exchange.  The investigation into Kang and the other executives is separate from the tax probe and centers around allegations that Kang and the others stole company money and conspired to manipulate stock prices.  Neither Kang Jong-Hyun nor his lawyers could not be reached for comment. CoinDesk has reached out to the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor’s Office for comment.  Bithumb is one of only five Korean crypto exchanges following a 2021 crackdown in which approximately 70 domestic exchanges closed after failing to meet regulatory requirements.  In December, Vidente Vice President Park Mo was found dead outside his home in South Korea after being named as a suspect in prosecutors’ investigation into the alleged embezzlement and stock manipulation. Local media reported that he took his own life.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Crypto investors may have been expecting a 25 basis point rate hike, but the Fed's announcement didn't stop them from sending bitcoin and other cryptos higher. Will crypto assets move higher as more economic data pours in?  Insights: Waves' USDN token is exiting its stablecoin model in an XTN rebrand. What is the significance?  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,118 +43.3 ▲ 4.0% Bitcoin (BTC) $23,967 +865.0 ▲ 3.7% Ethereum (ETH) $1,677 +90.1 ▲ 5.7% S&P 500  4,119.21 +42.6 ▲ 1.0% Gold  $1,969 +39.1 ▲ 2.0% Nikkei 225  27,346.88 +19.8 ▲ 0.1% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin Embraces the Fed's Latest Rate Hike  By James Rubin  The Federal Reserve decreed a 25 basis point interest rate hike the world would see.  Bitcoin was moved, and then pushed past its former $23,000 threshold groove.  At least for a few hours following the central bank's much anticipated dovish tilt, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was feeling poetic, recently trading at $23,967, a roughly 3.7% gain over the past 24 hours. BTC soared past $24,100 at one point Wednesday after lingering below $23,000 for much of the past week.  Investors seemed more interested in Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments Wednesday that the U.S. central bank's inflation fight was far from over than his remark that ""[the] disinflationary process has started."" The Fed is still looking to slash inflation to 2% from its most recent 6.5% level in December.  How long bitcoin continues to trade in its current range near or above $23,000 remains unclear with some market observers believing that prices will retreat, but others highlighting more optimistic signs, including the Fed's last two more moderate rate hikes. ""Historically, as interest rates rise moderately, as opposed to aggressively the average returns and bitcoin increase massively, more so than traditional assets since the speculators return quickly to buy as the credit and money become more available,"" CoinDesk Indices Managing Editor Jodie Gunzberg told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Gunzberg noted ""evidence of the number of bitcoin on wallets of [over-the-counter trading] desks rising in January, a signal that ""institutional investors such as hedge funds that typically use these desks for large transactions"" were buying bitcoin, pushing up its price.""  Ether fared even better on Wednesday, jumping close to $1,680, a 5.7% rise since Tuesday, same time. Other cryptos spent much of their day in the green with layer 2 network Optimism's OPT token, a big winner a week ago, climbing almost 25%, and layer 1 blockchain Aptos Network's APT token rising more than 9% to continue its momentum from January. APT surged 387% last month.  Equity markets also embraced the Fed announcement, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, rising 2% and 1%, respectively. Less than three months ago, with inflation lingering above 7%, a heftier increase seemed more likely. ""Markets have been proved right today as the Federal Reserve announced a lower-than-previously-indicated rate hike of 25 bps,"" Oliver Rust, head of product at independent inflation at economic data-aggregator Truflation, wrote in an email.  Still, investors will be eyeing new data over the next two days, including jobless claims, and fourth quarter earnings from tech giants Amazon and Google, which in recent weeks have both announced mass layoffs tied to recessionary concerns. On Wednesday, social media platform Meta Platforms (META) reported that it had continued to lose massive amounts of money in its fledgling Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations. FRL accounted for a loss of $4.3 billion in the quarter, better than the consensus of analyst estimates for a loss of $4.4 billion and up from a loss of $3.7 billion in the third quarter.  In its January markets report, CoinDesk Indices noted that bitcoin's nearly 40% monthly increase was its largest since October 2021 near the end of the last bull market and 12th best month in its history, and that other digital assets had fared even better. ""Crypto made a comeback in January as the macroeconomic environment turned brighter with decelerating inflation and expectations the Fed will dial back the pace of interest rates,"" the report said. It added that a falling dollar was further buoying the market and that ""as inflation and interest rates moderate, it also propels bitcoin more than traditional assets historically.""  Gunzberg highlighted cryptos' rising volatility relative to ""traditional asset classes,"" a sign of optimism. ""The change in sentiment on the macroeconomic backdrop is driving crypto buying especially from the speculators,"" she said. ""It's the first stop where investors play as the credit and the money become more available.""

Insights  Waves’ USDN Token Abandons the Stablecoin Model in XTN Rebrand  By Shaurya Malwa  Stablecoins formed a distinct sector in the past bull market cycle, with centralized tokens including USD coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) reaching billions of dollars in market capitalization even as their decentralized counterparts mostly failed to maintain the $1 peg.  Terra’s UST was perhaps the poster boy of failed stablecoins. The algorithmic token, which relied on a basket of assets that supposedly backed its $1 value, fell over 90% to a few cents as the Terra ecosystem imploded last May. The price of Terra’s luna token suffered even more, falling 99% within days to nearly zero.  Those declines stemmed from how algorithmic stablecoins like UST operated. One UST could be redeemed or minted for exactly $1 worth of LUNA at any time. In theory that helped UST retain its value and created demand for both tokens.  Traders could continuously buy and sell LUNA and UST to maintain the peg and profit by doing so, incentivizing them to maintain UST’s peg.  Terra’s horrors have dissuaded decentralized finance (DeFi) developers from launching algorithmic stablecoin projects. Some, like the recently launched Djed on Cardano, have shifted and positioned themselves as an overcollateralized token – with $1 worth of djed backed by $4 to $8 worth of Cardano-based tokens.  A rebrand  Some of the few surviving DeFi stablecoins are changing their models and rebranding entirely.  Neutrino, which issued the USDN stablecoin on Waves blockchain, floated a community vote last year to move away from an intended $1 peg altogether. The vote was passed earlier this week.  “Before the 2022 bear market, USDN was a reliable option for those looking to store value,” Neutrino developers said in a recent post. “With the current setup, clearly, USDN can not withstand the unprecedented market volatility. However, the team and community believe USDN can still perform a valuable use case in the Waves ecosystem by pivoting to a different model.”  USDN was among the several stablecoins that depegged last year. – it lost 9 cents in August, a slip that Waves founder Sasha Ivanov defended at the time.  The pivot to XTN will see the coin being collateralized by a basket of tokens from the Waves ecosystem, with its value floating based on supply and demand and the Backing Ratio (BR).  The BR represents the total value of all assets held in collateral against the circulating supply and will target a 100% ratio, making the price tend towards $1 for increased stability.  The role of SURF, a token issued to recapitalize USDN reserves, will still exist during the pivot, with 10% of reserves being automatically converted from SURF to XTN when the BR reaches 115%.  The roadmap for the pivot to XTN includes the development of functionality in January, the release of a technical litepaper in late January, and a full rebrand of USDN to XTN in mid-February.  The addition of $15 million of ecosystem tokens as collateral through governance will occur between February and April.

We value Coinbase on the basis of FY '24 results where we expect adj. Diluted EPS of $20.17 at 8x forward earnings. Based on the suppressed valuations in the space and ongoing bad news cycle, we weight a lower exit valuation, as we believe Coinbase is undervalued by 160%. Assuming markets and investors have foresight and start to trade the stock on anticipated Bitcoin price recovery, the stock could easily trade at a $160-$200 range by the end of the year. We recommend Coinbase at strong buy, and anticipate returns to be among the strongest among large cap tech stocks. Coinbase ( COIN ) is one of the more contentious stocks heading into Q4 ‘22 earnings as we think investors under-appreciate the immense optimism tied to cryptocurrencies but the overwhelming difficulty in generating positive returns from the category in a continued market downtrend. Even so, we believe Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) might be in for a bottoming in 2023. Furthermore, we write about Coinbase in relation to Bitcoin in this report to address the prospective upside from a bullish Bitcoin market and how it could positively impact earnings results as we get closer to the Bitcoin block halving on April 2024, which isn’t too far away and will likely get priced-in ahead of and following the reduction in Bitcoin mining rewards. Analysts estimate that Coinbase will report -$2.48 dil. EPS and revenue of $593.68 million in Q4 ‘22. We estimate that Coinbase will report results slightly above consensus expectations. For FY '22 we estimate that Coinbase will report $3.76 billion revenue, which compares to consensus estimates of $3.15 billion, and we anticipate an Adjusted Dil. EPS loss of -$12.61, which is lower than the consensus estimate of Adjusted Dil. EPS of -$6.79. Coinbase Investment thesis We value Coinbase on the basis of FY ’24 earnings results, and anticipate the stock to trade at 8x FY ‘24 $20.17 adj. EPS after applying a discount rate of 8.4% on our 2024 price target. We anticipate that the stock will reach $160 implying 160% upside from current levels. We expect COIN to recover on the basis of block rewards for Bitcoin halving and a reversion to the long-term price appreciation trend in bitcoin. We remain optimistic of the cryptocurrency space though we’re skeptical of the near-term estimates to Coinbase. We anticipate that FY ‘23 earnings results will be based on a steep climb-up from losses. We anticipate that Coinbase will struggle to generate the types of margins it experienced from FY ‘21 in FY ‘23 given the lower revenues and volumes. We provide enough room in our model for Coinbase to deliver on expenses and revenue over the next 12-months, and we think the stock is fundamentally undervalued as we’re experiencing the extreme emotional lows of a cryptocurrency bear market. We think accumulating in this environment will translate to substantial returns once the cryptocurrency market turns the corner, which will get priced into Coinbase, and could even get priced-in ahead of Bitcoin price gains, which is why we rate the stock a strong buy in this environment. Why we like Coinbase and the future of Centralized Finance or CeFi Coinbase has done a lot to differentiate itself from peers in the space, and while it’s not necessarily the leader in decentralized finance products, it’s emphasis on being a more custodial and centrally regulated figure in cryptocurrency lends itself to becoming a great on-ramp for buying and selling and transferring to digital wallets, which can then be leveraged into either decentralized finance DeFi products (U niswap ), along with a host of other decentralized web 3.0 applications, intended to leverage smart contracts, NFTs, collectibles, rare art, games, and so forth. We believe that central finance or CeFi products tied to USCoin USD ( USDC-USD ), Coinbase’s dollar-backed stablecoin to be the next major wave on its platform. It seems less gimmicky, and fraught with a lot less risk at the present time, as we think there’s tremendous value in the savings and staking component of assets tied to digital wallets, or really digital currencies. We are of course, very much Bitcoin purists in the sense that on an absolute basis returns from cryptocurrency are best optimized by leveraging Bitcoin, we would view Coinbase as another viable means of investing into the space. Because of the negativity tied to the Sam Bankman-Fried or abbreviated as SBF scandal, we think the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong looks better to public market regulators and investors. Coinbase does have to settle various fines , which various readers do note. But, the fines are small in scale. Coinbase tends to be proactive in negotiating terms with regulators, and also COIN doesn’t have the same risks posed to public market investors as some decentralized exchanges, which are less regulated, but provide more liquidity in many cases. We think decentralized finance and exchanges who operate outside the scope of regulators are more prone to compliance failures paired with the fact that as a category crypto finance is relatively new, and most people don’t know how to operate a regulated financial product in a less-regulated space. Even so, we acknowledge that pure cryptography based ledgers are required in order to sustain liquidity in the space, and efforts to maintain the use of wallets and decentralized swaps between independent users, decentralized exchanges, and also regulated exchanges is what continues to provide a use case albeit convoluted. It’s the transferable value nature of crypto assets as a commodity, and the ability to move these hidden and more secure assets across regulated and unregulated markets by leveraging a wallet that makes the decoupling of older financial networks compelling. When compared to the current US Dollar which is part of a centralized bank ledger that hardly anybody can monitor... A publicly viewable financial network like the Bitcoin blockchain or USDC-USD is rather revolutionary. In this case, we’re mostly agnostic on exchanges, so as long as exchanges are numerous and provide liquidity outside the constraints of regulators or within the scope of regulators so as long as it creates a better user experience for managing and transacting money while also storing money privately and in a format that’s useful such as USB, on computer devices, or on data center networks, or even via financially regulated and insured accounts. From our own experience, asking recent business school grads to combine financial concepts into a digitized asset, people are stuck at the part where either the technological jargon gets too complicated, or the financial jargon starts to get so complicated that whatever orchestration of transaction that’s intended to occur on a peer to peer basis leveraging financial contracts gets obfuscated by the technical hurdles and difficulty in communicating the viability of a new technology plus differentiated financial product. Basically, it’s really hard to generate any scale or amass any adoption for new financial products let alone the launch of a successful cryptographically based financial product. We like the packaging of Coinbase a lot more than the abundance of alternative ideas, and we think owning Coinbase is one of the ways to avoid the countless scammers in the cryptocurrency market. Valuation summary on Coinbase We value Coinbase on the basis of FY ‘24 earnings similar to other stocks in our coverage. However, we apply a more depressed financial multiple across adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA, and also sales multiple on the stock as well. We value the business using a blend of 12x forward earnings, 14x EV/EBITDA, and 3x sales given the lumpiness of financial results and the likelihood that the crypto exchange will need a bull market in Bitcoin, which seems likely at some point later in the year. However, because Coinbase trades like a tracking stock to Bitcoin with some forward expectations embedded into the exchange operators revenue and income we value the company at approximately 8x FY ‘24 earnings, and further discount those estimates by the firm’s WACC of 8.4% to arrive at our price estimate of $160.21. Figure 1. Financial Model of Coinbase Coinbase Financial Model 2023 (Trade Theory) We arrive at our financial estimate, because we anticipate that from 2024 onwards the Bitcoin market block reward will decline by another 50%, which will land on FY ‘24 for Coinbase, sparking a likely recovery in trading revenue, and custodial related revenue on Bitcoin re-testing the $60,000 level over the next 24-36 months. We anticipate that FY ‘23 results to be mostly in-line with consensus estimates or above, given added volatility and on-going adoption of various staking products. Not to mention, we anticipate that the business will exit FY ‘24 with revenue and adjusted dil. EPS that’s just 38%, and 24% better than FY '22 actual results. This is because of the added user base, and likely increase in Bitcoin network value translates to a rapid improvement in commissions, but when averaged across the forecast period, the average growth rate for the firm across earnings metrics, and sales metrics aren’t all that great on an annualized basis. Hence, we apply multiples to the business model that are much lower than the industry average to offset the cyclical nature of the business, and the likelihood that a sudden period of out-performance will be followed by another cryptocurrency winter making it harder to justify an inflated value premium even in more difficult times. It’s unlikely that Coinbase breaks from its historical past of being primarily a cryptocurrency exchange, so we have to contend with the cyclical nature of the business. Notwithstanding, we value the business at $160.21 which implies 161% upside from where the stock is currently trading. We think there’s even more upside to our model assuming investors trade the stock at a premium in the next Bitcoin fueled rally. However, we want to keep ourselves somewhat grounded in our appraisal of the company, and provide a conservative exit valuation to our model, and also conservative growth inputs from the prior peak to provide room for us to raise expectations and estimates tied to our Coinbase model. Key takeaway heading into quarterly earnings We like Coinbase given its solid positioning as a regulated cryptocurrency exchange, and its ability to launch new cryptocurrency products without exposing the shareholder base to unnecessary risks. We view the recent FTX scandal as being disproportionately advantageous to Coinbase as it limits competition and further asserts the need for added regulation, which favors the COIN thesis considerably. We acknowledge that the absence of trading revenue in the near-term puts risk on the stock, but given the nature of cryptocurrency markets and the likelihood of a recovery based on the cyclical nature of the market, we think investing into Coinbase at this point in the cycle provides immense upside, or 160%+ from where COIN is trading (roughly $65 per share). We also rate the stock a strong buy, as we think it’s difficult to find large cap stocks capable of making these types of returns. The stock could appreciate by an added $95 to reach our price target of $160 from current levels, and we think a combination of strengthening volumes and improving sentiment in the space paired with underlying price gains in cryptocurrency assets will drive the stock to those levels. Absent a major recovery in the price of Bitcoin in 2023, the stock likely recovers in 2024, and so the price gains from a re-surging Bitcoin market mostly gets captured from FY ‘24 financial results onward. Risk factors to investing in Coinbase To be fair, there are risk factors to investing into Coinbase, or any cryptocurrency exchange for that matter. The original founder of Bitcoin anticipated that exchanges would fail, and that trading should be decentralized. The only way to protect Bitcoin assets is through the use of wallets not custodial accounts. Coinbase stands in the way of Satoshi's original idea of decentralization, and so it remains the one exchange that has managed to protect itself and its reputation through scandals, fraud busts, and is the anti-thesis to Bitcoin in some sense. Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange and the less regulated equivalent. Most cryptocurrency exchanges are similar to Binance, and decentralized exchanges is how Bitcoin found its origin. Coinbase wasn't the first exchange or broker. Regulated cryptocurrency exchanges are undervalued and don't fit in any particular category to financial sector investors, or cryptographers. Being the last one standing doesn't make Coinbase any less risky, it just means it's going to outlast a shrinking market for Bitcoin if BTC ultimately goes the way of tulip mania, and so the two main risks to Coinbase are 1) can it withstand the test of time and avoid a major default tied to cyber theft or ransomware? 2) Does Bitcoin continue to exist in the future? Because if Bitcoin fails, the whole cryptocurrency economy goes with it (even Ethereum most likely) and also Coinbase. Assuming those two major risk factors don't get invoked we think Coinbase has substantial upside. When heading into Q1 ‘23 earnings results, we anticipate that the stock will be responsive to comments tied to outlook and the launch of new centralized finance products. Updates tied to USDC-USD and usage of USDC-USD in lending transactions or progress tied to those efforts to legitimize CeFi would also help the Coinbase thesis considerably.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4574406-coinbase-undervalued-and-could-upset-earnings-results?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/8640316.jpeg

8639319,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=518385,1675296031,"MATIC May Take The Crypto Market By Surprise, Here’s Why","MATIC made a 180-degree turn at the beginning of the year, following Bitcoin’s lead. The token, used to govern and secure the Polygon Network, had consolidated since mid-July, with some erratic price action recorded in November. Related Reading: Bitcoin Monthly Signals Stack Suggesting Bulls Are Ready To Stampede At the time of writing, Polygon’s token has maintained its momentum since January with a gain of 42.6%, breaking the range formed in 2022. Can MATIC holders continue the streak and aim for further gains? February, A Month Of Love Or Disappointment For MATIC? MATIC’s funding rates remain neutral, with long positions paying short positions on most exchanges, except OKX and CoinEx. According to on-chain analytics firm Jarvis Labs, negative rates and aexceptikely present as a buying on-chainity for investors. In addition to the above, the number of active addresses fluctuates according to MATIC’s price. Whenever the price action dips, the number of addresses follows. However, according to historical data from Jarvis Labs, the number of addresses holding the token has increased since January. Similarly, as investor confidence in Polygon’s native token has grown, price volatility has increased over the past month, pushing the price to new highs since November. Jarvis Labs’ analysis suggests that when the 30-day price volatility increases on MATIC, the price tends to trend to the downside. Both price and volatility metrics are currently up on the 30d timeframe, which could suggest the token will retrace some of its gains. In addition, the MATIC/USDT trading pair Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) based on the volume traded remained neutral. On the other hand, the MATIC/BUSD pairing Matic has seen spot bidding while the perpetual CVD has been decreasing. In short, Jarvis Labs’ analysis suggests that after MATIC’s long period of consolidation and breakout, the sentiment in the token should not be taken lightly. However, there are warning signs of a pullback as well. Investors Trust In Polygon For The Long Ride Recently global investment manager Hamilton Lane Inc. announced that individual investors can now access its equity fund, Equity Opportunities Fund, through a new securitized fund tokenized on Polygon. Hamilton Lane closed the Fund at nearly $2.1 billion and made a portion of the vehicle available to retail investors through a feeder fund on a secondary basis. It will significantly increase access with a minimum investment of $20,000 from an average of $5 million. The Polygon token is trading at $1.1320, down 0.8% over the past 24 hours. MATIC is currently trying to break the next resistance level at $1.27. Failure to do so may result in a pullback to the next support level at $0.98.
