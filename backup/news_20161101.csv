42427135,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzY1h,1478034366,Ethereum Energy Startup Awarded Blockchain Patent,"A Brooklyn blockchain startup has been awarded a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for its work using the tech to facilitate peer-to-peer energy transfers.  LO3 is one of several startups seeking to using a blockchain system to reimagine how energy transfer networks function, looking to distributed networks as a means to cut inefficiencies and costs.  Founder Lawrence Orsini and TRC Energy Services project manager Julianna Yun Wei are listed as inventors. The application was originally submitted to the USPTO last November.  The patent, published on 25th October, focuses on the ""use of computationally generated thermal energy"".  The patent details how blockchain comes into play, using the tech – ethereum in the case of LO3 – to ""confirm transactions between each other or with other devices on the network"".  The patent goes into further detail:  ""The distributed computation applications may be Turing-complete which allows for their creation and operation on the distributed computing network that is independent of the individual nodes of the network. This provides for the autonomous, secure control of computing devices on the network.""  Earlier this year, LO3, in partnership with startup ConsenSys, spearheaded a project in New York that saw local residents selling excess power via a blockchain prototype that utilized the ethereum network as a distributed mechanism for selling those units of power via smart contracts.  The startup is also involved in a separate initiative, called Brooklyn Microgrid, which is aimed at helping neighborhoods manage energy loads more effectively.

42427137,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzY5h,1478027561,3 Blockchain Projects Win E&Y Startup Challenge,"A startup contest hosted by professional services firm Ernst & Young ended with three blockchain companies receiving honors.  The six-week E&Y Startup Challenge accepted six blockchain-focused startups in September, which focused on two application areas for the tech: digital rights management and energy transfer.  Bitcoin mining firm The BitFury Group receiving an award for “Best Pitch” after it developed a blockchain-based tool for digital rights management. Smart contracts startup Adjoint won “Most Investable Pilot” with a platform for creating smart contracts while JAAK won an award for “Most Innovative Pilot” after it developed an operating system, based on Ethereum, that was focused on digital content management.  Those spearheading the E&Y event say that the next steps include continuing to hone their concepts, with an eye to potentially move products to market in the months or years ahead.  Jamie Qiu, founder and lead of the EY Startup Challenge, said in a statement:  “Media and energy are two sectors where we expect to see the most disruption over the next few years and blockchain is a reality that can transform these two industries. We are looking forward to continuing our work with these fantastic entrepreneurial businesses over the next couple of months and helping them accelerate and commercialise their solutions.”  Blockchain startups Blockverify, BTL Group and Tallysticks also took part in the event.

42427128,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXph,1478024394,Blockchain Trading Sees Securities Exchange Trial in Myanmar,"A major securities brokerage in Japan is reportedly testing a blockchain-based stock trading system in Myanmar.  According to Nikkei, Daiwa Securities Group’s research outfit has been in Myanmar working with the Yangon Stock Exchange. The goal, the Asian regional newspaper reported, was to test mechanisms by which problems with critical trading infrastructure could be avoided or resolved more efficiently.  Testing is said to have begun in March, involving five local firms along with the Yangon-based exchange. Daiwa, according to local sources, has an ownership stake in the exchange.  The publication further detailed:  “On the assumption of using blockchain to connect the Yangon Stock Exchange and local brokerages, the test was conducted to gauge how the system would work in the country, which is often hit by power outages and phone lines going dead.”  The trials don’t represent the first time the technology has been tested within Myanmar. Earlier this year, a microfinance firm began testing blockchain to streamline how its internal systems operate  One notable characteristic of the trial, according to Nikkei, is that the Yangon Stock Exchange “only matches buy and sell orders twice a day”. As a result, Daiwa said that it doesn’t expect to run into any major obstacles as it looks to integrate the system into live trading.  Daiwa is Japan’s second largest securities brokerage. The country’s largest, Nomura, has also been pursuing exchange-related applications of its own through its research arm.

42427132,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXlh,1478016302,Hyperledger Eyes Mobile Blockchain Apps With 'Iroha' Project,"A blockchain project developed by several Japanese firms including by startup Soramitsu and IT giant Hitachi has been accepted into the Hyperledger blockchain initiative.  Developed by Hyperledger member and blockchain startup Soramitsu, Iroha was first unveiled during a meeting of the project’s Technical Steering Committee last month. Iroha is being pitched as both a supplement to other Hyperledger-tied infrastructure projects like IBM’s Fabric (on which it is based) and Intel’s Sawtooth Lake.  At the same time, Soramitsu is positioning Iroha as a means to encourage the development of mobile applications within the Hyperledger community.  Co-founder and co-CEO Makoto Takemiya said in a statement:  “By creating C++, mobile, and web development environments for Hyperledger, new developers can join the project and help contribute not only to Iroha, but to other sub projects, such as Fabric and Sawtooth Lake.”  Though spearheaded by Soramitsu, the project was developed in partnership with fellow Hyperledger members Hitachu and NTT Data, as well as Colu, another blockchain startup. According to Takemiya, his team is also working with the University of Aizu, Sompo Holdings and Rakuten Securities. Soramitsu is also pursuing other research initiatives as well, using Iroha as a basis.  Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Hyperledger project, said the addition of Iroha adds another layer to the initiative’s growing list of member-driven projects.  “Iroha allows even more developers to interact with Hyperledger to build infrastructural projects and applications requiring distributed ledger technology,” he said.  Since launching in December, Hyperledger has seen a range of projects submitted by contributors, including a distributed ledger platform dubbed Juno, from Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan. Intel, which contributed Sawooth Lake, previously demonstrated a fantasy sports trading game built using the technology.

42378937,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUKz,1478005207,Former AOL Exec Named Ripple CEO as Chris Larsen Steps Down,"There's soon to be a new man in charge of distributed ledger startup Ripple.  Four years and almost $100m after CEO Chris Larsen joined the aspiring Swift alternative, he's handing over the reins to the company's president, Brad Garlinghouse.  Larsen positioned the appointment as part of Ripple’s overall plans to grow, but both executives stopped short of saying it was part of an more formal exit strategy.  Larsen told CoinDesk:  ""We’ve got this great position and now we want to jump to the next lily pad, which is scaling.""  In Larsen’s new role as executive chairman — an employee position for which he'll take a salary — he’ll continue to focus on steering the company's strategic direction. Larsen said he stepped down to spend more time with his family.  Garlinghouse, on the other hand, will immediately focus on hiring 30 new employees and adding to Ripple's list of clients that already includes Standard Chartered and Mizuho.  The changes will go into effect 1st January, 2017.  Global plans  After some early confusion over how exactly Ripple's distributed ledger technology operates independently of publicly traded permissioned blockchain, 2016 has proved a banner year for the company.  Whereas the traditional interbank infrastructure provided by Swift requires that banks wait days for their transactions to clear, Ripple's shared, distributed ledger seeks to do the job in as little as five minutes.  As a result, this June, the San Francisco-based firm announced seven financial institutions had joined as partners, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), Santander and UBS.  Then, earlier this month a group of global banks and the R3CEV blockchain consortium announced they had conducted tests using Ripple’s native XRP currency as a means to more quickly send cash across borders.  In total, Ripple has completed 30 bank pilots, according to a representative of the company, has 10 banks currently in commercial deal phases and its network now includes 15 of the top 50 global banks.  ""That means we have 35 banks still to get,"" Garlinghouse told CoinDesk.  Year over year Garlinghouse says Ripple has doubled its customers. His target for the next year is to do the same.  Peanut butter  But growth to Ripple doesn't mean expanding, according to Garlinghouse. Growth means gaining deeper market penetration with the company's cross-border platform.  Prior to joining Ripple last year Garlinghouse was perhaps best known as the former president of AOL and as the author of the so-called ""Peanut Butter Manifesto"", an internal memo from his time at Yahoo about how important it is for companies to avoid spreading themselves too thin.  In that spirit, he said that as the new CEO of Ripple he will continue the company’s current trajectory — at least for now.  As part of that growth the company currently has 30 jobs posted, for six engineers, six sales reps, six customer success specialists and more.  The hope is that with the right hires, there may be enough peanut butter to spread around.  Garlinghouse said that if all goes according to plan, in two to three years there will ""for sure"" be opportunities for Ripple to enter other market segments.  Exit event  Off a total of $93m venture capital, Ripple has so far mustered a $410m valuation, according to investor analytics platform Pitchbook.  Though companies have exited for far less returns than that, the serial investor with six exits under his belt said an IPO isn't yet a part of his thought process.  Garlinghouse says the board has control over Ripple's shares and with Chris Larsen still the controlling shareholder the team has the leverage it needs to continue without an exit.  Garlinghouse concluded:  ""When you’re in this position you just think about the next goal. We're trying not to think about liquidity events as a goal.""

42378920,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mU27,1478002976,42 Banks Join Blockchain Consortium in Japan,"Forty-two local and regional banks in Japan have joined a new blockchain consortium focused on cross-border payments.  Launched by financial services group SBI and a joint venture co-launched with distributed ledger startup Ripple, the consortium’s membership includes a wide range of both large and smaller institutions. The launch of the consortium comes days after SBI announced that it would establish its own digital currency exchange in Japan.  Those involved in the project plan to share resources and collaborate on a cross-border proof-of-concept, with an eye to create a basis for commercial-scale products next year.  SBI said in a statement:  ""The Consortium will promote discussion, from both technical and operational perspectives, on activities required in domestic and foreign exchange services to utilize blockchain and other new technologies, consolidate domestic and foreign exchange services, and build 24-hour and real-time remittance infrastructure, and will try to finish PoC by next March to move forward commercial base.""  SBI said that efforts to organize the consortium began in August, with an initial aim to launch with 15 member banks. The group’s ranks swelled following a period of “active responses” during the solicitation phase, the company said.  The SBI-backed consortium is the latest effort of its kind to emerge. Similar organizations, formed among Russian financial firms or European insurance companies, have launched in recent weeks.

42378932,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mUEh,1477998131,BTCC Takes Aim at Bitfinex With US Dollar Bitcoin Trading,"""It's both a liabilty and an opportunity.""  At least that's how BTCC CEO Bobby Lee describes his Shanghai-based bitcoin exchange startup's affiliation with its domestic market. Formerly known as BTC China, BTCC markets itself as the ""world's longest-running bitcoin exchange"", but it's now taking steps to expand its customer base internationally.  BTCC announced today that it is launching a new service BTCC USD Exchange, one that boasts a new user-interface and that is operated by a separate legal entity. Run out of Hong Kong, the US dollar trading arm will complement BTCC's Chinese yuan trading, and Lee said support for more currencies is likely to follow. It officially launches tomorrow.  Lee told CoinDesk:  ""The USD exchange is our first concrete step to show the world we're going to be an international company.""  Notably, the offering will not yet be available to US customers, as BTCC has yet to receive approval from FinCEN or the NYDFS. (Lee said the startup had applied for both, though it's far from alone in waiting to launch services in New York).  But Lee also sees a strategic opening in the market given the breach of Bitfinex, the Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange that this August lost nearly 120,000 BTC (then worth more than $60m) in a high-profile hack.  ""We're trying to go up against Bitfinex,"" Lee said. ""I think their volume is thin.""  In conversation, Lee was open about thinking that BTCC could ""outdo"" the exchange, which has long held an appeal with traders given its margin trading system.  In this light, Lee said that BTCC is exploring whether to add margin trading, and that it is taking steps to court already active bitcoin exchange users.  BTCC said it will use a link-based referral program, FIX APIs and maker-taker model to incentivize customers. Further, it will offer faster deposits due to an integration with its existing mining pool.
