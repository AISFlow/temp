42399804,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymMj,1493676637,Gnosis Tokens Double in Value After Exchange Debut,"The price of tokens sold as part of a fundraiser for the decentralized prediction market project Gnosis is on the rise following their release to auction participants today.  At the time of writing, GNO tokens were trading for over 0.0455 BTC ($64) on the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, a move that represents a more than doubling in value over just a few hours of live trading.  The increased activity appears so far driven by the quick actions taken by major exchanges to list the cryptographically secure asset. GNO holders, for example, can now trade the token on San Francisco-based Kraken, with trading pairs denominated in bitcoin, ether, US dollars and the euro.  Kraken was swiftly followed by Poloniex today, which announced support for GNO/BTC and GNO/ETH trading pairs. (Poloniex does not offer fiat trading).  However, at press time, it seems that GNO tokens were having trouble finding demand at current prices, with well over 1,000 BTC of unfulfilled buy orders at time of writing.  Muted reaction  Still, the release today follows a controversial sale in which the mechanisms used to incentivize buyers pushed the total valuation of the token supply to $300m even though only 4% of the tokens were sold.  In a statement following the conclusion of the auction, Gnosis founder Martin Köppelmann said that the team was ""humbled"" by the community's support, and outlined a roadmap for the coming months and years.  ""We strongly believe that this distribution will benefit all token holders by ensuring we have sufficient tokens to incentivize ecosystem growth,"" he wrote in response to concerns about the lopsided initial distribution.  Currently, 99% of the tokens held by Gnosis have been locked for a period of a year.  ""These tokens are held for the purposes of incentivizing projects building on top of Gnosis and to bring in additional funding or token distribution for the project if necessary,"" Köppelmann wrote.  After the initial boost in trading, eyes are now likely to fall on upcoming announcements concerning the remaining 95% of tokens currently held by the Gnosis team.

42399800,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymHo,1493659815,Norway’s Central Bank is Researching Anonymous Digital Currency,"Norway’s central bank is in the early stages of researching the issuance of a digital currency.  Appearing at the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters on 25th April, Jon Nicolaisen, Norges Bank’s deputy governor, spoke in part about the differences between money held in banks today and the proliferation of digital currencies, casting the central bank’s research in this area against the backdrop of a world in which bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have found broader use.  Particularly attractive for some users, he said, are the peer-to-peer and identity-obfuscating aspects that mirror cash – something that ""new payment solutions may be able to offer"" in the future.  Nicolaisen went on to say:  ""Private digital currencies providing anonymity are already on the market. These currencies can also be used even if banks’ systems fail – as long as the Internet is still functioning.""  It's these characteristics, he said, that have led Norges Bank to consider new options. Among those possibilities: the issuance of a digital currency through which consumers could hold an account at the central bank. Another proposal, Nicolaisen said, is the introduction of an app that would enable anonymous, cash-like payments.  Norges Bank is far from alone in exploring this area, sparking what Nicolaisen described as a long-term effort to explore which directions the institution might take. A number of central banks worldwide are looking at blockchain as a possible mechanism to issue the currencies.  And, echoing representatives from other central banks, including the Bank of England, Nicolaisen said that a central bank launch of a digital currency could have significant implications for today’s financial system.  ""For many consumers, electronic central bank money could provide an alternative to deposit money in a bank, as cash does today. Banks can attract deposits through the interest rates they offer,"" he said, adding:  ""But their ability to create money and extend credit could nonetheless be affected, especially if this new form of electronic money enters into widespread use.""

42399799,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymIn,1493655005,"Bitcoin Price Passes $1,400 to Hit Highest Value in History","The price of bitcoin rose above $1,400 today, setting a new all-time high.  At press time, the cryptocurrency's price had climbed to as much as $1,407.05, a 4.4% increase for the day, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  This latest price increase builds upon the gains that the cryptocurrency has experienced over the last several sessions – during which markets have repeatedly risen to new highs – and that have effectively rekindled bitcoin's early 2017 momentum. It also comes as prices in ether markets (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) rose to new all-time highs as well this morning.  After spiking to new highs in January, the cryptocurrency's price languished for several weeks in March after the SEC rejected the bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. While bitcoin prices hit $1,325.81 in the hours before the ruling, they went on to fall below $900 later that month, according to the BPI.  After bottoming out at $891.51 on 25th March, the cryptocurrency's price resumed its upward climb, rising to fresh highs of $1,335.56 on 27th April, $1,343.59 on 28th April and $1,348.65 on 30th April.  Bitcoin prices are currently averaging $1,402.03, according to data from the BPI.

42399801,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymJm,1493650919,Meet 0x: The Protocol That Lets You Trade Ethereum Tokens For Free,"A decentralized exchange protocol called 0x has raised an undisclosed sum as part of a bid to serve the rapidly growing economy of tokens being created on the ethereum blockchain.  Polychain Capital, Blockchain Capital and Pantera Capital, along with Chinese investment firms Jen Advisors and FBG Capital, all participated in the unusual investment round, announced today, in exchange for a 30% discount on its future tokens.  But those involved know that a decentralized exchange designed to function as a universal, shared order book is only as powerful as its users.  So, in an attempt to get a jumpstart on other decentralized exchanges, 0x co-founder and CEO Will Warren explained that, despite the VC funding, the exchange will be operated as non-profit foundation.  Warren told CoinDesk:  ""We don't extract any value from people who use it. Essentially, it's an open protocol. We don't extract value from people who use this protocol, and people can build their own applications on top of it however they please.""  Early investors and advisors include Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, Augur co-founder Joey Krug and Coinbase product manager Linda Xie. Further, the Zug, Switzerland-based project has revealed partnerships with token projects Augur, Melonport, Maker and Aragon.  Last week the firm made its first hire, an engineer, who will help design 0x to support all ethereum assets that use to the ERC20 token standard. By integrating with the decentralized exchange, Warren hopes that app builders will be able to let their users conduct transactions in other cryptocurrencies without leaving the app.  For example, in a similar way that Facebook Messenger lets users hire a Lyft ride without leaving the application, the idea is that a Melonport user could make a prediction from the Augur decentralized application (dapp) without having to visit the other site.  On a technical level, this means 0x plans to introduce a process called ""token abstraction"" to obfuscate smart contract interactions between app tokens and the blockchain, making it appear to end users that they are only paying fees in ether.  What about the competition?  But while 0x will likely make a big splash with its list of well-known investors, it is not the only company aiming for decentralized exchange hegemony.  Already, Ether Delta, iDex, Maker Market (now Oasis Dex) and Shapeshift are building exchanges with similar functionality.  Unlike more traditional economic systems that benefit from competition that drives down price and increases efficiency, the founder of Polychain Capital argues that in the world of decentralized exchanges, there will likely only be one.  Comparing 0x to more centralized exchanges Gemini, Kraken and GDAX, the latter run by his former employer Coinbase, Olaf Carlson-Wee said a single, well-crafted decentralized exchange would move all the liquidity to one place — making it more attractive to users — without the risks of centralization suffered by Mt Gox and others.  ""The world is the most efficient if everyone is on one order book,"" said Carlson-Wee, adding:  ""The price is the most accurate, there's the most liquidity, there's the least volatility. For all participates it's a superior experience with there being a single order book and a single execution engine.""  Decentralized resilience  But as the failed decentralized ethereum investment platform known as the The DAO made clear, just because something is decentralized that doesn't assure it is safe from attack.  To help ensure the resilience of 0x founder Will Warren says the firm will use 100% the money from the investment and a corresponding future token sale to build open source software tools and infrastructure that supports the ecosystem.  Warren concluded:  ""What we're building is essentially a completely open, publicly accessible piece of infrastructure.""  0x logo via website; Wishing well via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,Michael del Castillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/05/01/meet-0x-the-protocol-that-lets-you-trade-ethereum-tokens-for-free,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c008e87b49698890ec78587297d0329369609f5c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42399805,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymLk,1493645423,Ethereum's Ether Price Climbs Above $80 to Set All-Time High,"Ether prices have climbed above $80 per token for the first time, setting a new all-time high.  Data from Poloniex, the digital currency exchange that sees the most bitcoin-denominated trade for the ethereum-based cryptocurrency, suggests the price rose as high as $84 during morning trading. The news comes just days after ether passed $60 on 27th April, setting a previous high.  Prices are currently averaging about $81, according to available data.  Thus far, markets are continuing a trend seen in late March, with bullish sentiment appearing to establish a floor beneath the digital currency’s price. That sentiment seemed to have been buoyed last week amid news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is weighing up whether to approve an exchange-traded fund linked to ether.  As CoinDesk reported last week, the SEC has officially begun assessing a proposal initially put forward last July to create an ‘EtherIndex Ether Trust’.

42399794,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymBu,1493643615,A Branch of the UN Just Launched Its First Large-Scale Ethereum Test,"Starting today, the United Nations (UN) will begin distributing funds to thousands of people in Jordan as part of a trial using the ethereum blockchain.  For the next month, cryptographically unique coupons representing an undisclosed number of Jordanian dinars will be sent to dozens of shops in five refugee camps across the nation. Then, instead of using a smartphone or a paper wallet to access the funds, recipients will rely on yet another emerging technology.  Eye-scanning hardware made by London-based IrisGuard, already in place to verify the identity of some of the 500,000 recipients currently receiving traditional aid, is being repurposed to grant access to coupons.  Multiple cashiers at each of the shops will then use technology co-developed by the WFP Innovation Accelerator, ethereum development startup Parity Technologies and blockchain big data firm Datarella to redeem the entitlements at the point of checkout.  From the ground up, the solution was designed to scale, not just within Jordan, but beyond its borders to some of the 80 other countries served by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).  Datarella founder Michael Reuter told CoinDesk:  ""This product wouldn't make much sense if it only worked in the Jordanian refugee camps alone. It should work in other environments.""  Blockchain aid  Built with the ethereum client developed by Gavin Wood's Parity Technologies (previously called Ethcore), the Jordanian coupon project will see a total of more than 10,000 people receiving funds, according to WFP financial officer, Houman Haddad.  From there, the WFP hopes to expand to 100,000 people in Jordan in August, with the entire Jordanian refugee population receiving aid by the end of next year.  Whereas blockchain itself includes widespread promise for advancing the way we prove our identities, this project was built under the assumption that its users might not have access to a smartphone or internet device that could someday power these solutions.  In the meantime, identity is being verified by IrisGuard, which the UN has been using to serve Syrian refugees in Jordan since last October. Previously, IrisGuard was powered by Jordan Ahli Bank and its counterpart Middle East Payment Services.  To ensure the current aid program progresses without interruption from the blockchain project, multiple contingency plans are in place should the system fail in this first live application, though the details of those contingency plans are not being revealed until after the test.  Future expansion  But while the ethereum application being launched today appears to be the most advanced effort being conducted by a division within the UN, it is not the only effort.  Last week, CoinDesk reported on an early-stage effort spearheaded by the UN Office for Project Services, consisting of a potential pan-organizational effort involving a total of seven agencies.  Though future efforts are only in the development phase, Reuter said the current project was built to make it easily adopted in other nations as well.  He concluded:  ""I’m totally excited seeing what is possible within a very, very short time-range, with a client like the UN. I never had thought that it would be possible to do what we are starting.""

42399807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymNi,1493640037,21 Inc Opens Bitcoin Email Service to General Public,"Bitcoin startup 21 is making its new '21 Lists' product available to the general public today.  Soft launched  in February, the paid email platform enabled users to send surveys, tasks and requests to curated lists of individuals and professionals, incentivizing those actions with small bitcoin payments.  Original users included what 21 described as ""famous people"", largely VCs backing the firm, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz.  Starting today, however, anyone can apply to join to create a profile page and join 21 Lists based on their preferred area of expertise.  In a blog post, the firm heralded the move as one that would open the door for users to engage in ""microconsulting"" – a way to earn additional income by offering their expertise to individuals outside their social network.  The company went on to explain:  ""Depending on the selectivity of the 21.co list that you gain admission to, the expected income for a given list’s annual stream of microconsulting work should be on the order of $10 to $1,000+ per year.""  Further, some lists will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure the quality of responses does not degrade, 21 added. For example, the firm said individuals in lists that target specific digital currency users will periodically ask users to sign transactions to verify that they still qualify to receive tasks in this area.  The move is the latest that finds 21, one of bitcoin's best-funded startups, evolving its offering from a focus on bitcoin mining hardware to one centered on disrupting social media networks through micropayments.

42399793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymAv,1493636436,Trump's Obamacare Overhaul Could Be Blockchain Adoption Catalyst,"As pressure mounts on Republicans to overhaul the Affordable Care Act (ACA), blockchain advocates are hoping bullish modifications to the law could provide a springboard for the adoption of distributed ledger tech.  Since the 2009 passage of the ACA – colloquially known as 'Obamacare' – the US healthcare system has continued to grapple with the escalating spending, inefficiencies and antiquated systems that prompted calls for reform in the first place.  Now, President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress are seeking to repeal and replace Obamacare with a new plan, dubbed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), which they deem to be simpler and more consumer friendly.  While that goal remains elusive and details are subject to change, its core thesis is that healthcare should be driven by consumers to put downward pressure on costs – and that has many blockchain tech proponents eying the legislation as a potential catalyst for the upstart technology.  Corey Todaro, chief operating officer of Hashed Health, a consortium of healthcare companies exploring the use of blockchain in the industry, noted that costs are continuing to ""explode"", creating pressure for change.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We're on the path to $5tn in healthcare spend from the current $3.5tn – it's just insanity. We need anything that can begin to take cost out of the system, and we think blockchain can play a crucial role there.""  Before it was pulled from the agenda in March, the AHCA – among other things – sought to replace Obamacare's network of insurance premium subsidies with a significant expansion in the use of tax credits and health savings accounts.  This arrangement would conceptually give consumers more freedom and responsibility to shop for their own insurance plans and health services instead of obtaining them through an intermediary. But after an initial failure to corral enough intra-party support, the bill was revived last week with the addition of several new amendments designed to bring more conservative Republican dissenters on board.  Avik Roy, president of the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity (FREOPP), argues that while the plan has its flaws, it could serve to generate demand for lower costs, more transparent pricing and greater consumer control over personal data.  These are items that blockchain could play an instrumental back-end role in delivering.  ""Where there's a unique opportunity for blockchain in healthcare is this idea that if patients in particular can have more control over their healthcare dollars, they'll also have more of an incentive to have control over their healthcare data,"" he told CoinDesk.  Data expansion  But it isn't just about costs and control, it's also about data warehousing.  While climbing healthcare costs grab the most attention, the data being produced by the industry has increased 44-fold since 2009, according to a recent report by Intel.  And further, the infrastructure on which that data is stored and transferred remains heavily siloed and incompatible with a more consumer-driven system, according to industry entrepreneurs like Micah Winkelspecht, founder and chief executive of Gem, a blockchain solutions company.  Winkelspecht said:  ""This is leading to a breakdown in the existing system, because in healthcare your data doesn’t travel with you, it travels with the provider.""  By serving holding unique identifiers that can direct patients and providers to the location of individual data records, blockchain offers an alternative to existing efforts to remedy this problem, he said.  Over the long term, this could potentially patch together existing data silos with APIs or create even larger, decentralized data storage facilities.  Drop in a bucket  Still, opportunities will occur within a larger context.  Roy emphasized that the segments in healthcare currently experiencing the most tech innovation and receiving the largest capital inflows are areas such as digital health and cosmetic surgeries that are largely outside of the purview of insurance companies.  ""LASIK really is the best example because it is driven by the things that insurance doesn’t pay for,"" he said, referencing the laser eye surgery that is far cheaper now than 20 years ago.  In this regard, Roy added, an expansion of tax credits and health savings accounts could expand the pool of funds that innovators can tap into.  ""That's more out-of-pocket dollars that digital health entrepreneurs will be able to take advantage of to provide services that patients really want, including things that relate to blockchain,"" he said.  At $3.5tn, the US healthcare industry would be the fourth-largest economy in the world by gross domestic product if were its own country, trailing only the US, China and Japan.  That figure is projected to balloon to $5.5tn by the year 2025.  Consumer focus  With numbers of that scale, reformers say that even modest implementation of new technologies like blockchain in healthcare administration and supply chains have the potential to reap hundreds of billions of dollars in savings.  Todaro of Hashed Health reckons that another way AHCA could facilitate blockchain in healthcare is by rethinking some of the complex regulations that surround payment and delivery systems, medical data and health insurance products.  ""The patient really does not sit in the driver's seat in terms of the provision of their own care. There's not really a marketplace where you can compare prices and act like a consumer in your own best interest,"" he said, adding:  ""Getting rid of those kinds of regulations I think could be a springboard for a really robust kind of consumer-centric model, and I think that could be mediated very effectively by blockchain.""  For example, a more nuanced feature of the Obamacare law was a migration away from the traditional fee-for-service billing model toward fee-for-value schemes in which healthcare providers are compensated based on outcomes delivered rather than simply services rendered.  Barriers to entry  But to be truly effective, fee-for-value programs require a far more robust data infrastructure than currently exists.  Any tweaks to these rules that facilitate the flow and storage of such data could be a gateway for blockchain tech.  ""Those kinds of programs are ideally suited for blockchain because they involve the transaction of information in as [close to] real time as possible among a wealth of intermediaries on a continuum of care. That's difficult given the way current health IT stacks are structured,"" said Todaro.  Gem's Winkelspech said that, here, regulation gets in the way.  ""The largest problem is that the regulations tend to be too prescriptive. Rather than defining what outcomes the government wants to achieve, they tend to pick winners and losers in technology and software,"" he said.  Specifically, Winkelspech emphasized the 2009 Meaningful Use rule requiring the implementation of electronic health records – a regulation that many in the space are closely monitoring for potential modifications in the AHCA.  ""[Hospitals] were highly incentivized to digitize health records at a time when there weren't many health record systems. So, what it sort of did was it funneled all these companies to a few players, and those players have become quite large and quite powerful in the industry,"" he said.  Todaro further said that while such highly prescriptive rules force hospitals out of their comfort zone, they tend to suck of the energy out of the room.  ""Some of those specific provisions I think incentivize health systems to look for solutions like blockchain, but on the other hand it exhausts them,” he said, adding:  ""We've talked to health system [providers] who say 'We are busy enough implementing a multi-billion dollar, multi-year installation of a comprehensive electronic medical record system. We have got no appetite for exploring new technology even if it could be useful.'""  Help on the way?  Still, blockchain advocates in Congress also see the legislation as a chance to codify a use case for the technology.  Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, the Republican co-chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, for instance, is exploring ways of prioritizing blockchain usage in certain government bodies that handle health data.  Action is already happening on the state level, where Arizona has passed a law in March that would expand the definition of an electronic record to include those hashed or stored on a blockchain system. Likewise, in Delaware, a similar effort is underway, but with a more specific focus on corporate records.  As such, regardless of the fate of the AHCA, some believe momentum for the kinds of reforms blockchain could enable won't be going away.  ""The patient is responsible now for a lot more of the healthcare costs and that’s going to be an increasing trend,"" Winkelspecht said, concluding:  ""Consumers, when they go to shop for a doctor, are going to become way more price conscious as more and more of the responsibility for costs is pushed on them.""

42399803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymKl,1493632802,Behind on Blockchain? Central Banks Are Catching Up Quick,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  A traditionally opaque and conservative sector is becoming more transparent and active in its approach to innovation research – I'm talking about central banks.  Bank of Japan  , Bank of England, Bank of Korea, the National Bank of Cambodia, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank of China.  I could go on, but you get the picture. All are emerging as early and active on blockchain and DLT. Now, compare this to a few years ago.  Going over CoinDesk articles from 2013 and 2014, you see that most headlines with the words 'central bank' in them also included the word 'warning'. It wasn't until mid-2015 that attention turned away from the potential threat of cryptocurrencies to the intriguing potential of the underlying technology.  A natural evolution, you say? Perhaps, but with some nuances.  A late start  Commercial bank interest in blockchain technology, by contrast, started much earlier.  Central banks are understandably more conservative – they are public institutions, charged with maintaining the integrity of monetary policy and the banking system, neither of which allows for risk that is difficult to quantify.  However, as the murmur of blockchain interest from the banking sector became a roar, central banks had no choice but to take note.  As part of the oversight of their respective banking sectors, they need to know what constituents are up to, and they need to ensure that no systemic risk can jeopardize the system. In other words, to remain relevant, they need to become familiar with the tech that banks are experimenting with.  The situation brings to mind the words of one of the leaders of the French Revolution who said:  ""There go my people. I must find out where they are going so I can lead them.""  Sparks fly  If central banks fall 'behind the curve' and lose touch with the banking sector, they cease to be prescriptive. And in a fiat system, that could be deadly.  Also, as bitcoin enthusiasm infiltrates the hallowed halls of economics, the potential threat of currencies that don’t need central banks begins to look more real, as does the intriguing opportunity to rethink the way money works.  Obviously, systemic change is slow and fraught with institutional barriers. Yet central banks are, on the whole, stepping up their innovation game.  Most of the work is being done in silos, although some collaborations with the public sector and with other central banks are underway.  A few weeks ago, the Bank of England and the Federal Bank of Boston caused a stir by being the first central banks to join one of the larger constortia, Hyperledger. More will likely follow suit.  The next step  What central banks need to do, however, is form their own consortium. While each bears a unique combination of structural, economic and geographic considerations, their goals are similar. Much of the central bank work currently being done is repeated behind gilded doors elsewhere.  Collaborating on research and testing, with each other and even including private components of the ecosystem, will advance the work much faster.  It would also mark a turning point in history.  Central banks are always implicitly cooperating to keep the global economy ticking along with relatively stable currencies and trade flows (to paraphrase the band 10cc: ""You need a yen to make a dollar""). However, with the exception of regional initiatives, they have not yet formed an association aimed at furthering the development of their own role.  A central bank blockchain consortium would need to do more than test applications. It would need to exchange ideas on the future of the institution itself.  Will new tech allow it to consolidate influence over sprawling economies, reinstating monetary influence and changing the way we see banking? Or will its role end up being usurped by smart contracts and fragmented payment methods that devolve financial independence to end users?  Such debate is inevitable, especially given technological developments underway.  Better, then, to engage in a cooperative fashion, applying a range of experiences and seeking shared solutions. The resulting lessons learned, not to mention successful innovations, will help the central banks jointly bring their respective economies into a new phase of development.

42399797,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbymEr,1493629209,Defense Giant Lockheed Martin Integrates Blockchain,"The largest defense contracting firm in the world has announced plans to leverage blockchain technology in its operations.  Revealed  last week, Lockheed Martin is now working with Virginia-based GuardTime Federal to integrate blockchain into its supply chain risk management, a deal that comes two years after the two firms began working on cybersecurity initiatives.  According to Defense News, Lockheed Martin earns more than $40bn in total defense revenue annually for work on everything from ballistic missiles to combat systems.  Lockheed said in a statement:  ""With this effort, Lockheed Martin becomes the first US defense contractor to incorporate blockchain technology into its developmental processes, enabling more efficient and assured offerings to the federal government.""  Ron Bessire, VP for Lockheed Martin, suggested that the goal would now be to use blockchain technology to enhance data integrity, speed up problem discovery and reduce regression testing.  But while details are scarce overall, it's a notable development given the US government's increasing interest in leveraging blockchains for defense purposes.  The US government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) began work on potential applications for the tech last year, and the US Homeland Security Department has awarded multiple grants to companies working on applying it to its various ongoing initiatives.  The new follows an announcement last year that a bitcoin analysis tool was being built at one of Lockheed Martin's facilities.
