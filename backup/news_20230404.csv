11427569,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525631,1680649223,"Arbitrum (ARB) Continues Rally Despite Circulating FUD, Here’s Why","After suffering from a weekend filled with uncertainty, Arbitrum (ARB) now appears to be in for a rebound despite rumors about its whale and supply still circulating. Over the past 24 hours, Arbitrum native token ARB has surged by nearly 10%. Meanwhile, ARB has seen some large sales recorded on-chain, indicating that some investors are still frightened and panic selling their ARB tokens. Related Reading: Buy Or Sell Arbitrum (ARB)? Here’s What Whales Are Doing ARB Continues Rally, Why? So far, ARB’s latest price action has happened to be a bullish move attributed to just three factors. Arkham Intelligence, a crypto analyst-focused platform, recently revealed data indicating that ARB whale activity in the past 7 days is now balanced. According to the platform’s analysts, roughly 18 million ARB has been withdrawn from the exchange, slightly higher than the 12 million ARB deposited to exchanges over the weekend. Notably, withdrawing an asset from an exchange indicates a buy, as exchanges are where whales go to purchase large amounts of tokens. In contrast, a large amount of deposit of an asset on an exchange may also indicate an upcoming selling pressure, as this is where most large investors go to sell off their holdings. Another factor attributed to ARB’s latest price action is the increase in stablecoin inflow to the Arbitrum ecosystem since the airdrop announcement. This can also indicate a strong buying power that benefits ARB’s value, as many investors may be accumulating the token. In addition, despite the uncertainty in the Arbitrum market, the community has remained optimistic based on the history of other airdropped tokens. Following the launch of APT and OP, both tokens experienced a drastic fall after initially surging at the launch date. However, eventually APT and OP enjoyed a rally which has now put both tokens up by over 200% and 400% from their all-time low, respectively. Related Reading: Arbitrum Whales Dump 3.73 Million Tokens, Impacting Market Prices Arbitrum Surges Nearly 10% In The Last 24 Hours After surviving a bearish trend over the weekend, ARB is in the green by 8.3% in the last 24 hours.

ARB’s market cap has surged, aiding the token’s climb to rank number 39 in market capitalization among other cryptocurrencies in the global crypto market. In the past 3 days, nearly $5 billion has been added to the assets market capitalization as its market cap currently sits at $1.5 billion, up by more than 10% in the last 3 days.

42414023,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAtqj0,1680646374,'Shark Tank' Star Kevin O'Leary Calls Litigating Your Crypto Regulator 'Really Stupid',"Venture capitalist and ""Shark Tank"" star Kevin O'Leary said that crypto exchanges shouldn't be taking legal action against regulators.  ""Litigating your regulator, in my opinion, is a really stupid idea,"" he told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" on Tuesday in reference to Coinbase (COIN), the largest U.S. crypto exchange by trading volume. Coinbase may face regulatory action from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  O'Leary is a strategic investor in Canadian crypto exchange WonderFi, which plans to merge with two other Canadian exchanges, Coinsquare and CoinSmart.  Last month, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to Coinbase, which warned that the agency may pursue legal action against the company for allegedly violating securities laws via its exchange operations and staking services.  In Coinbase's case, O'Leary said, it would be ""better to sit down and work it out"" with regulators, and if a ""U.S. regulator doesn't want staking or lending, so be it.""  However, San Francisco-based Coinbase said in a blog post last month that the exchange was ""confident in the legality of our assets and services.""  O'Leary said Coinbase's pushback against regulators may ultimately not work out in its favor. ""You've got to read the room,"" he said. ""You have to read the writing on the wall.""  According to O'Leary, staying within the good graces of regulators should be what other crypto exchanges aim to do.  ""If the crypto community and crypto investors like me want to fit into the existing global financial services system, we have to tuck under the regulator,"" he said. ""I no longer have any interest in going to war with regulators, litigating regulators and suing regulators. That is not the future of crypto.""  Is Canada the guinea pig of regulated crypto platforms?  As American regulators target its largest trading platforms, the future for three Canadian crypto exchanges may soon spur interest in the digital asset industry from investors in the U.S.  WonderFi, Coinsquare and CoinSmart plan to merge into one entity. They have a combined 1.65 million users and over $600 million in assets under custody, so would be considered one of the largest regulated crypto trading platforms in the world upon combining.  Canada ""may be the guinea pig that is forging forward with all kinds of regulation that is effectively working,"" O'Leary said.  O'Leary said the partnership is a ""necessary merger"" and one that could only be done by scaling, in part because of the cost of compliance, which, he said, is expensive.  ""We've moved our assets to Canada because we're able to stake there,"" O'Leary said. ""There's enough tokens under the regulatory environment that we can get full exposure to the volatility of crypto and do it in a way that we can report to our compliance departments and tax regulators in some way.""

11426231,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525619,1680645624,"Ethereum’s (ETH) Price Rally Set To Persist, On-Chain Data Shows","Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has regained its bullish momentum and is continuing its bull run. The cryptocurrency has managed to break multiple significant resistance levels since rebounding from the $1,000 area in November 2022, signaling a potential upward trend in the market. Ethereum is trading just below the $1900 mark, representing uncharted territory since August 2022. Despite breaking its correlation with Bitcoin, the question remains whether Ethereum can continue its upward trend and reach new yearly highs by surpassing the $2,000 milestone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicators Points To Imminent Resistance Break, Study Shows Will Ethereum Maintain Its Bullish Trend? According to a recent Twitter post by crypto analyst and trader Ali Martinez, on-chain data reveals a potential breakout above the $1,900 level. According to Martinez, the next critical resistance area for Ethereum is between $2,100 and $2,150. In addition, over 200,000 addresses had purchased over 18 million ETH at the $2,100-$2,150 level, as seen in the chart above, making it a crucial resistance area for Ethereum’s price action in the mid-term. However, if Ethereum can maintain its momentum and surpass this resistance level to establish it as support. In that case, the cryptocurrency is well-positioned to reach new yearly highs and potentially consolidate above the $2,000 mark, further solidifying its upward trend. 2019 Fractal Mirrors Bullish Pattern For ETH Another interesting trend has emerged in Ethereum’s price action, dating back to its diagonal breakout in 2019. Crypto Analyst under the pseudonym “Woetoe” has identified a blue fractal in ETH’s charts that could offer valuable insights into the cryptocurrency’s future price movements. According to Woetoe’s fractal, Ethereum could potentially experience a significant uptrend shortly. This prediction is bolstered by the upcoming Shappella upgrade, represented by the vertical red line, which could further drive Ethereum’s price upwards. In addition to its recent surge, Ethereum has also seen a high rate of liquidations, with approximately $30 million worth occurring within just 24 hours at the $1,880 level, as Glassnode data shows. It is now crucial for ETH to maintain its current level as a support and potentially consolidate above the $1,900 mark. However, if Ethereum fails to consolidate at this level, it is likely that a healthy pullback will occur, potentially pushing its price action toward the $1,830 mark. As of this writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,867, reflecting a gain of more than 2% over the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has posted significant gains in wider time frames, with 8.5% and 7% profits in the seven-day and fourteen-day periods, respectively.

Tokenized gold is a type of stablecoin that pegs its price to gold, while the tokens on the blockchain represent ownership of physical gold managed by the issuer. It offers investors a way to get exposure to the precious metal without the management fees of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or the burden of storing gold bullions.  The two largest gold stablecoins – by far – are pax gold (PAXG), issued by the New York-based fintech firm Paxos Trust Company, and tether gold (XAUT), issued by Tether, the same company behind the $80 billion-pegged stablecoin USDT. At the time of publication time, the market cap of PAXG and XAUT is $518 million and $499 million, respectively, per CoinGecko data.  The price of gold, a traditional safe-haven asset, has risen since March amid investor concerns about flailing banks and a possible government bailout, which would lead to expanding fiat money supply and currency devaluation. The metal was trading at $2,021 per ounce on Tuesday, just some 3% off its all-time high recorded in August 2020.  Bitcoin (BTC), which is often called digital gold due its program-coded supply cap, has rallied to as high as $29,000 from $20,000 in tandem with gold’s surge.

Data from crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant showed the amount of bitcoin (BTC) held by digital asset managers such as trusts and exchange-traded products (ETP) started to fall sharply in early March, dropping below 688,000 bitcoins on March 14 in the immediate aftermath of the failures of Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.  In the weeks since, however, these fund managers have added back about 4,000 bitcoins, with holdings above 692,000 as of April 2, or nearly $20 billion worth at the current price just above $28,000.  “Recent reports suggest that trust has returned to holdings,” CryptoQuant analyst Grizzly wrote in a note published on March 31. “This, I believe, is bitcoin's first significant test in the face of a severe crisis,” he told CoinDesk.  Grizzly further noted that widespread speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve has reached the end of its interest rate hike cycle has persuaded investors to boost their holdings.  While Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave no assurances of a pause at his last press conference in late March, the CME FedWatch Tool currently shows 58% of traders are not expecting a rate hike at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in May.  ""Investors seem to be adopting a wait-and-see approach since the initial rush back into bitcoin,” James Butterfill, head of research at European digital asset manager CoinShares, told CoinDesk.

According to a press release, the store is working with service provider BitPay to allow customers to purchase merchandise using bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Polygon's token, MATIC.  In addition, the brand is working with Web3 community Poolsuite to release a co-branded non-fungible token (NFT) that will be gifted to existing holders of the Poolsuite NFT membership collection. Members will gain exclusive access to a ""special event"" and be able to update their ""Leisurist"" avatars with digital Ralph Lauren wearables.  The brand is planning an immersive three-day experience at a private estate in North Miami at the end of April in conjunction with the store opening.  ""This store will be an opportunity for us as a brand to gather key insights as we continue to explore the space,"" Ralph Lauren's chief innovation and branding officer, David Lauren, said in an interview with WWD. ""We are in the early stages of our road map, but we see an exciting opportunity ahead across digital goods and virtual experiences to build upon our past touchpoints in the metaverse.""  Ralph Lauren has recently been testing the waters of Web3 and released digital clothing collections with popular gaming worlds Roblox and Fortnite. The company's CEO, Patrice Louvet, said in January 2022 the company was actively seeking new ways to connect with younger consumers, including through metaverse activations. ""There are a lot of parallels actually between the metaverse and Ralph’s vision because we are not a fashion company.

According to data from secondary marketplace OpenSea, Trump Digital Trading Card holders collectively sold 30 tokens in the hour after his court appearance – a 462% increase – and 47 over a six-hour period.  Though it was a large jump, it's also a relatively small amount of activity for the NFT space. For context, one of the top trending collections, Nakamigos, had 1,286 sales in the same six-hour period.  The former president released his series of digital collectibles in December. For $99, a buyer could purchase a token featuring his likeness and enter a sweepstakes to earn exclusive experiences with the former commander-in-chief. The collection quickly sold out, and the price more than doubled on the secondary market.  The floor price has stayed steady at around 0.5 ether (ETH), or about $930.  The NFTs representing sweepstakes prizes associated with the Trump Digital Cards mint have had zero sales in the last six hours.

However, in the last 24 hours, the altcoin has shown signs of consolidation. Continued consolidation could potentially cause it to lose its bullish momentum if it continues. The technical outlook for Solana indicates that both bulls and bears are evenly matched due to the sideways movement on the daily chart. While buying strength has recovered, sellers still have the upper hand. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Forms A Falling Wedge Pattern, Can Price Touch $0.11? The demand for SOL must increase in the immediate trading sessions, or accumulation may decline. Despite the indicators not fully favouring the bulls, SOL has the potential to rise above its immediate trading sessions if it remains above local support. The SOL bulls must overcome two critical resistance levels for the price to continue rising. Broader market strength is also crucial for the asset. The market capitalization has also seen an uptick, indicating the presence of buyers in the market. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was trading at $20.90 at the time of writing. The recent price appreciation allowed the bulls to break through a crucial resistance level and turn it into support. The overhead resistance for the altcoin was $21.50, and if breached, SOL could encounter another resistance at $23.40. Successfully surpassing $23.40 could drive SOL to $26. Conversely, the first line of support for the altcoin was at $19.30, and failing to remain above it could cause SOL to trade close to the $18 mark. The amount of Solana traded in the last session turned green indicating an influx of buying strength on the one-day chart. Technical Analysis Although buyers were still trying to establish their position in the market, SOL was not entirely bullish. The Relative Strength Index showed a slight uptick but remained slightly below the half-line, indicating that there were more sellers than buyers. Additionally, the price of SOL was below the 20-Simple Moving Average, indicating that demand was still low and sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. Due to the low demand for the altcoin, it displayed sell signals on the chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator, which measures price momentum and reversals, began to show a red signal bar, indicating sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Here’s Why Bitcoin Could Break At Least $33,000 In This Rally However, the price direction of SOL had not yet shown any significant change. The Directional Movement Index indicated a negative trend, with the -DI line (orange) above the +DI line (blue). Additionally, the Average Directional Index was red and below the 20-mark, indicating that the SOL price trend lacked significant strength.

42421223,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqij,1680637478,Magdalena Kala: How I Invest in Web3,"It started with blackjack. Magdalena Kala, aka “Crypto Mags,” used to play blackjack on the regular. She loved it. She was good at it. She even became a professional card-counter, fascinated by the game’s dynamics and strategy. “I’ve learned everything about human psychology, business and risk management from blackjack,” says Kala.  And it was Kala’s approach to psychology – specifically consumer psychology – that fueled her obsession with Web3. “With Web3, I love what it means to give people an ownership mindset, as opposed to a passive mindset,” says Kala. “These are fundamental things that humans care about. If we didn’t care about ownership, we wouldn’t be giving employees stock options.”  Magdalena Kala is speaking as part of the ""Big Ideas"" program at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in Austin, April 26-28.  Kala, who is based in Miami, believed in this thesis so strongly that she doubled down on it, launching an early-stage Web3 fund called, well, “Double Down.” (A nod, of course, to blackjack.) In late 2022, Kala raised $30 million for the fund (whose backers include blue-chippers including Chris Dixon and Marc Andreessen), and she now focuses on Web3 projects that impact consumer culture. “My overarching thesis has always been about the why and how people spend their time, money, and attention,” says Kala. People increasingly spend their time and money online. Web3 (in theory) lets them do it better and with more ownership.  But what does it actually mean to run a Web3 fund? What’s the job like? Where do you go to find ideas, hunt for an edge, and vet worthy investments? Kala opens up about what it’s actually like to run a fund, confessing that “basically, every non-sleeping, non-exercising hour I’m working on this, because that’s what I think about.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  You once made a joke on Twitter about how there’s the “Instagram” version of being a fund manager and then the reality. So what’s the reality like? How do you spend your average Tuesday? How many hours do you work?  There's no average day. And I don’t even know how to count the hours. And the reason is that I'm a big believer in work-life integration. I think when you strive for work-life balance you're just setting yourself up for failure. I love the work that I do. And, very frequently, I cannot tell you if the hour I'm spending is a work hour or a non-work hour.  What’s an example?  If I go to dinner and there's, like, six other Web3 people in Miami, is it work? Is it not-work? I don't know, we're all friends. And I generally love hanging out with these people. And we actually probably tend to talk 80% of the time about Web3 anyway. So that might be my normal brunch on a Saturday, right?  And this is what I read about in my free time. I don't know how to even consider that work or not-work, right? Basically, every non-sleeping, non-exercising hour I'm working, because that's what I think about.  So what I’m hearing is that your entire life is basically all-work?  [Both laugh.] But the work is just so varied, right? I do a lot of meetings, whether Zoom or in person. In Miami, people are constantly coming through town. I love to meet people in person.  I'm a big believer in work-life integration. I think when you strive for work-life balance, you're just setting yourself up for failure.  How else do you spend your time?  I used to spend a lot more time on Twitter. Now it just doesn’t have that same signal-to-noise ratio as it used to. I spend a lot of time in Telegram groups, WhatsApp groups, the kind of smaller and private sets of people. And I actually spend a lot of time talking with other investors, too. There are a bunch of people in the industry who share my thesis, and we talk a lot about what we’re seeing both in general terms, and with specific companies.  Where do you go for investing ideas? Are companies coming to you, or are you scouring the space for under-the-radar projects?  In crypto, most people build in public because it's all publicly available. So whether it's Twitter, Farcaster [a Web3 social media platform] or group chats, people are constantly sending each other messages like, ""Hey, try this out."" My telegram is filled with DMs from friends who are, like, ""Hey, have you heard of this?"" Or ""Hey, you should check out this product."" So a lot of it is that people know what I like to invest in. People are pinging me saying, “Hey, have you seen this?"" And I constantly play with new products and projects.  What do you look for in a project?  At the end of the day, it's all about the team. But unlike a lot of early-stage investors I don't think it's ALL team. In other words, I have to love the team, but if I don't believe in the product I'm not going to invest.  Part of the challenge is that so many teams building in this space are very technologist-first. And they don't know what it takes to build a scalable organization. So I love teams that combine industry expertise with a very Web3-native skill set.  How do you evaluate teams?  References play a huge role, because there's only so much you can figure out in conversations. And then one of the best predictors is just the speed of execution. You might not know everything, but how quickly are you iterating on your product? How quickly are you gathering insights? How quickly are you able to ship features?  You’ve been very bullish on investing in Web3 culture. How has your thesis evolved in the bear market?  The number one thing is that all of the most interesting applications of Web3 – of the practical ways that Web3 is different versus everything else – are the things that are making the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] most upset.  How so?  The shared ownership and the upside [of digital assets], basically, is very security-like in the SEC's mind. Think about it this way. If I'm earning a token for free for an activity I'm performing, and then that token is going to appreciate in value, that should not be a security. I didn't even buy it, I just earned it. But people think it's a security, right?  And because I earned it, and I can sell it and people can trade it on the secondary market, it has all these characteristics. But rewarding people with things that have upside potential is such a core thing for me in Web3. And it's actually really hard to do well while not having a regulatory framework.  Last question. Your Twitter bio says that you are the “Queen of Hot Takes.” Give us a hot take.  I've been trying to tone down on the hot takes. [Laughs.] So this isn’t a hot take because I feel like everyone in the industry would agree on this, but the U.S. is shooting itself in the foot with the lack of a regulatory regime.  In general, we complain about Europe being overly regulated, but personally I think it's a better situation right now for crypto. It might be more stringent but you know exactly what the framework is. You know what is legal versus not legal, and you can work around it. And in the U.S. right now we can't. So a lack of clarity prevents innovation and doesn't serve anyone. Not users, not builders, not the overall economy.  I think you’re right. Most in the space would agree.

42414030,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAtr9X,1680636459,Texas Bill Limiting Benefits for Crypto Miners Unanimously Passes Committee Vote,"A proposed new law that could restrict key benefits for bitcoin miners in Texas passed a state Senate committee on Tuesday and is now headed to the full chamber.  Senate Bill 1751 caps how much miners can participate in grid balancing programs, said Satoshi Action Fund co-founder and CEO Dennis Porter, who added that there were no committee votes in opposition. That puts the legislation on the ""uncontested"" list, he continued, meaning its has more than a 95% chance of winning Senate approval. From there, it would head to the Texas House.  Texas is one of the world's largest hubs for the energy-intensive bitcoin mining industry, largely due to low electricity prices and a favorable business environment. However, the tide started to turn for the industry around the summer 2022 as the Texas grid operator slowed approvals for new facilities due to influx of miners.  Read more: The End of the Texas Bitcoin Mining Gold Rush  Texas miners often shut down their operations at times of high energy demand in return for credits they can use later. Riot Platforms (RIOT), for instance, earned $21.3 million in such power credits in the first nine months of 2022. Crucially, this new legislation will cap miners' participation in grid ancillary services – such as demand response programs – to 10% of the total participation.  The bill will also take away tax abatements for certain property and require miners with more than 10 megawatts (MW) of computing power to register as large flexible loads operators with the Texas grid operator, ERCOT.  SB 1751 is sponsored by three Republican state senators: Lois Kolkhorst, Donna Campell and Robert Nichols. None of the senators could be reached for comment at the time of publication.  ""We urge all Texas residents to reach out to their representatives and encourage them to vote against this anti-free market bill that would increase ERCOT’s cost for procuring demand response services, ultimately leading to increased costs for Texas ratepayers and reduced grid stability,"" said Texas Blockchain Council Director of Business Development Kristine Cranley.  ""It's not an attack on bitcoin miners,"" Texas resident Jackie Sawicky told CoinDesk. Sawicky, who is petitioning against Riot's facility Texas' Navarro County, said the proposed new law is ""just revoking this special treatment.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/04/texas-bill-limiting-benefits-for-crypto-miners-unanimously-passes-committee-vote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4968f9bd2a2b1ebcee5f7237246a1196368a2ba5-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414033,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAtrUl,1680635007,Real-World Tokenization Is Surging as TradFi Grows More Receptive to Blockchain,"Blockchain-based tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is gaining traction among major financial service firms and other big brands. That makes a number of industry watchers upbeat about the trend in 2023.  They say tokenization of RWA – a way of putting ownership of tangible assets such as stocks and bonds on the blockchain – offers the convenience of buying and selling these assets around the clock because the transactions do not involve traditional brokers.  This concept isn’t new, but over the past few months a number of large banks and other companies have begun using the process. In November, for instance, U.S. banking giant JPMorgan executed the first live trade using tokenized versions of the yen and the Singapore dollar on the Polygon blockchain. A month later, asset manager WisdomTree unveiled nine digital funds, adding to the one it had started successfully earlier in the year. The funds allow the transfer agent to keep a secondary record of shares on either the Stellar or Ethereum blockchains.  More recently, Hong Kong's central bank offered an inaugural $100 million tokenized green, or sustainable investment, bond, and just this week French investment bank Credit Agricole CIB and Swedish bank SEB agreed to develop a blockchain-based platform for digital bonds.  A recent S&P Global Ratings report shows that issuers distributed around $1.5 billion in digital bonds on the blockchain in 2022, up from just a few bonds the previous year.  These businesses aim to create efficiencies that traditional markets can’t achieve, according to Daniela Barbosa, executive director of Hyperledger Foundation.  “If you think about traditional corporate bond issuance, for example, there's a lot of paperwork and tracking,” Barbosa told CoinDesk in an interview. “You’d have to have a bond certificate. When you tokenize these assets you can increase the usability of the assets because you can support automation with smart contracts platforms and put important information on these assets ... where in the past maybe you had to go with a third party or a middleman.”  Barbosa, who has worked in the crypto space since 2017, said more companies are more receptive to blockchain-enabled “business models, despite the series of debacles that have stung the industry over the past year. Those “failures we’ve seen in the marketplace have nothing to do with the (blockchain) technology,” she said.  For example, German-based Siemens’ $63 million digital bond on Polygon in February was a way for the engineering giant to reduce paperwork and open “new markets to new customers of those bonds,” she said. Public companies have traditionally used conventional methods – often Wall Street underwriters – to issue bonds to finance capital investment.  “If you're creating technology and platforms that allow more people to participate in the economy, it's going to have a positive impact on the economy,” she added.  Benefits and use cases  Bob Ras, co-founder of the exchange and digital asset ecosystem Sologenic, said tokenized real-world assets also account for fractional ownerships more efficiently and generate faster settlement times.  He noted that users can trade a fraction of a specific tokenized stock like Tesla (TSLA) that has been divided into smaller shares or units at lower cost, with the settlement completed in seconds. Orders in traditional markets usually take 48 to 72 hours for the actual stock to transfer from the liquidity provider to the bank or the platform, Ras told CoinDesk.  The speed and efficiency “give buying power to smaller investors"" and provide better accessibility ""for those who don't have a significant amount of investment funds,” he added.  Eliézer Ndinga, director of research at crypto investment product firm 21.co, said U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) offered a potentially strong argument for RWA, especially in countries suffering currency debasement or a collapse of the financial system, creating higher demand for the U.S. dollar.  “Tether is like the fiat-pegged currency of the world’s reserve currency,” Ndinga told CoinDesk in an interview. “From a remittances perspective, people can access it on a global scale as long as they have the internet connection, like the same way they would send emails to another party.”  Meanwhile, industry observers are also watching the increasing use of RWA in decentralized finance (DeFI), including MakerDAO’s investment in U.S. Treasurys and corporate bonds and Maple Finance's yield-generating strategies adopted from traditional finance.  In February, Berlin-based crypto exchange Swarm launched tradable, tokenized U.S. stocks and bonds via its DeFi platform. “To date, traditional market participants have not had a comprehensive and regulatory-compliant solution for issuing and trading real world assets on-chain,” Swarm co-founder Timo Lehes said in a statement.  Going forward  21.co’s Ndinga described the infrastructure of RWA as the equivalent of “dial-up” in the early internet – slow and less-than-ideal user experiences that will be resolved as the technology improves.  Market observers are also closely tracking how U.S. regulators will view tokenization. If their view is favorable, the regulatory clarity could spur more development by companies.  “We are now at the cusp of the convergence between traditional and decentralized finance, to some extent,” Ndinga said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/04/real-world-tokenization-is-surging-as-tradfi-grows-more-receptive-to-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de6c5d0886bb8589b33770052f22a88058e4bcb1-7360x4140.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether traded strong and has risen 3.8% over the past 24 hours, suggesting investors see it as undervalued. ETH is up roughly 55% for the year, while BTC, which traded lightly amid low volatility on Tuesday, is up close to 70%.  The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed that job openings fell by 632,000 in February to 9.9 million, the lowest level since May 2021. The 9.9 million mark exceeded expectations of a decline to 10.4 million and signaled the persistently tight jobs market may be loosening.  The general consensus for most of 2023 has been that weaker employment is a necessary precursor to the Federal Reserve pausing its pace of interest rate hikes. Tuesday’s reading fits with the current narrative that bad news for the economy equals good news for asset prices that have been weighed by inflationary fears.  Crypto markets were quiet. Bitcoin traded flat for most of the day, on lower-than-average volume. BTC trading volume has fallen below its 20-day moving average for 14 straight days.  ETH gains took the asset within shouting distance of $1,900 for the first time since August.  A sustained move higher than $1,862 would push ETH’s price past the upper range of its Bollinger Band, a bullish sign for the asset.  By contrast, BTC’s price is trading along its 20-day moving average, a sign the price is flattening.  The ETH/BTC ratio has increased 4.3% this week. ETH, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization after BTC, has narrowed the performance gap on its larger peer.  The recent difference in performance is reflected in a 22% decline in correlation between BTC and ETH since March 10.  ETH bulls may see this as an opportunity. While the correlation coefficient between BTC and ETH has declined to 0.77 from 0.99 on a daily basis, the monthly correlation between the two remains above 0.95.  The recent dislocation on a smaller time frame likely represents the flight to safety crypto investors made into BTC during the recent banking turmoil. The extent to which ETH was left behind, however, may be appealing to investors who still view ether as undervalued, particularly given the continued contraction of its overall supply.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/04/ether-gains-on-bitcoin-but-jolts-jobs-data-leaves-markets-unmoved,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e8f31d82759cc4cf4d4f846a57080017e74dccc7-5184x2769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414029,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAtr4E,1680631489,"OpenSea Launches OpenSea Pro, Courting Professional NFT Traders","Leading non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace OpenSea said Tuesday it’s rolling out OpenSea Pro, a marketplace with advanced features targeting the growing market of professional NFT traders that has helped rival NFT marketplace Blur surge since its launch.  The new product is a rebrand of Gem v2, which is the newest version of Gem’s NFT aggregation platform. OpenSea acquired Gem in April 2022, with plans to bring its professional trading tools to OpenSea users.  OpenSea Pro will operate with 0% fees and pull listings across 170 marketplaces to provide the best deals for traders. It will support advanced “floor sweeping” for traders, instant sales, inventory management, the ability to optimize gas fees for efficient trades, a watchlist feature and more. It will also be available on mobile devices.  Devin Finzer, CEO of OpenSea, told CoinDesk that Gem has helped OpenSea build OpenSea Pro to become the most efficient NFT trading tool on the market.  “[Gem v1] is amazing, you know, it’s an incredible aggregator tool, but this is really a dramatic step up from it,” said Finzer. “It's incredibly fast, incredibly real time. It’s really the fastest user experience for purchasing NFTs.”  OpenSea vs. Blur  The competition for market share of NFT trading volume between OpenSea and zero-fee platform Blur’s rise has been rapid since the marketplace’s launch in October – leading OpenSea to drop its required marketplace fees to 0% in order to court Blur traders.  OpenSea said in its launch of OpenSea Pro it's bringing its marketplace fees back to the main platform at 2.5%.  “We’ll certainly, with regards to fees, continue investing the revenue back into making the space stronger,” said Finzer.  While OpenSea’s move to release OpenSea Pro comes at a time where the marketplace is in fierce competition for top spot with Blur, Finzer specified that OpenSea will still focus on providing tools and improvements for retail traders and creators, including focusing on new partnerships, primary drops and smart contract standards.  “We're investing in really exciting features that make it easier for people to explore and purchase their first NFT and then really push the use cases forward for NFTs,” said Finzer. “Folks can come to OpenSea and graduate to a professional experience.”  Read more: Artists Weigh In on the Battle for Creator Royalties  UPDATE (April 4, 18:48 UTC): Updated language on marketplace fees.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/04/opensea-launches-opensea-pro-courting-professional-nft-traders,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15236dd74ba9c3d7397549584d368ed72921d162-3228x1816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This surge in value is attributed to market participants reacting positively to Twitter’s recent change of its home button to the doge meme. In the last 24 hours alone, the meme-coin experienced a boost of nearly 27%. It broke through the $0.10 price level. The technical analysis of the coin also suggests an extremely bullish trend on the chart, with buyers rushing to the market and a surge in demand for the meme-coin. Accumulation has also seen a substantial positive shift. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flips Cardano In Market Cap, Becomes 7th Largest Crypto Furthermore, Dogecoin has formed a pattern indicating a potential trend reversal, which could further increase bullish momentum. However, it is important to note that a price pullback is still possible despite this pattern. The coin must remain above the two vital price levels to continue its upward trend. Currently, Dogecoin remains stuck under a crucial resistance mark. Dogecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, DOGE was priced at $0.096. The coin briefly revisited the $0.101 zone before dropping below the $0.098 mark. Overhead resistance for DOGE was set at $0.99, and breaking above this level could push the coin back above the $0.100 zone. A falling wedge pattern has emerged for Dogecoin, indicating a potential trend reversal. This could further reinforce the upward momentum of the coin. If DOGE surpasses the $0.100 mark, it may encounter another resistance at $0.102, breaking which the bulls could revisit $0.107 and eventually target $0.110. Local support for Dogecoin was at $0.090; a drop from that level could drag the coin to $0.082. Therefore, it is essential that DOGE trades above the $0.082 support level to continue moving upward. The volume of DOGE traded in the last session was positive, indicating a rise in buying strength. Technical Analysis Buying strength of DOGE witnessed a sharp surge, causing the asset to become overbought and overvalued at the time of writing. This was indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) standing above 70, a signal for an overbought asset. Typically, after being overbought, the asset’s price tends to undergo a significant pullback. Likewise, Dogecoin moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line. This signified that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. With the increase in demand, other technical indicators have also aligned with the bulls. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates price trends and reversals, turned green with growing green signal bars tied to buy signals for the coin at the time of writing.

42421274,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmSD,1680628744,Arbitrum Governance Fracas Reopens the Question: Why DAOs?,"What exactly does crypto want decentralized autonomous organizations to be? I remember a conversation a few years ago over a few cold ones with a former CoinDesker who waxed poetic about the possibility of DAOs. While many people are willing to be quite reductionist when describing DAOs, with the soundbite “Discords with bank accounts,” there is also a real hope these tech-powered social organizations could grow into entities that rival traditional LLCs and government institutions.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This “third way” of thinking about the power, possibility and politics of DAOs shows smart contracts as a way to automate away human decision-making. Baseline rules for the group are predetermined and fixed in code, ultimately allowing token holders to make better governance decisions when those decisions are discretionary. DAOs, in this sense, both empower and minimize human activities. Multisig wallets eliminate single power brokers, blockchains make democratic processes transparent and token distributions give anyone with a stake a say.  However, the recent governance fracas at Arbitrum, one of the most-used Ethereum layer 2 blockchains, reveals how far DAOs have to go. If these systems are ever able to scale to replace or supplement centralized corporations or state activities, the industry needs to figure out what they’re actually good for. This isn’t to suggest that every DAO needs to follow a predetermined plot. (In fact, like any decent “general purpose technology,” much of the trouble with DAOs comes from being a messy categorization meant to describe many different and often unrelated types of institutions.) But participants should know what to expect when they’re signing on.  Arbitrum’s DAO was pitched as a way to “decentralize” control of the protocol’s development away from Offchain Labs, the company that launched Arbitrum, and bring users and “the community” into the fold. Tokens were airdropped, a reward to early adopters of the system, seemingly with great promise. Unfortunately, the project took some 18 months to build goodwill and a consistent user base, then damaged its credibility in five minutes, according to critics on the project’s Discord.  The DAO is a shining example of “decentralization theater,” more of a fig leaf for the newly created, Cayman Islands-registered Arbitrum Foundation, which would continue to direct protocol development. Some 750 million ARB (then worth about $1 billion) had been earmarked to pay off debts related to Arbitrum’s startup expenses, with much of the remaining tokens to be disbursed as the Foundation saw fit, The Defiant reported.  That in itself isn’t an issue. Many crypto projects have awarded tokens and granted “community-development” powers/responsibilities to foundations. The Arbitrum Foundation would receive 7% of the token supply, compared to builders of competing Ethereum layer 2 Optimism, which was granted 5% of the OP token supply to its foundation, or the Solana Foundation, which was given more than 12% of all SOL tokens.  It’s not worth relitigating exactly what happened, especially considering the Foundation is set to be reformed. But the trouble started because Arbitrum power brokers decided before votes were even cast to fund the organization. Described as a “leaderless cooperative,” the DAO was essentially reduced into a rubber stamp. This shows that there are often human actors behind autonomous smart contracts who get to decide exactly what decentralization looks like.  As Foundation member Patrick McCorry wrote on the DAO governance forum: “The Foundation treated this as a ratification of its initial setup, not an initial grant request from the DAO Treasury, and indeed has begun to use these tokens in the interest of the DAO, including conversion of some funds into stablecoins for operational purposes.”  There are legitimate questions over whether a layer 2 even needs a token to operate, as well as whether tech should be built via direct democracies, sham or otherwise.  See also: Arbitrum’s First Governance Proposal Turns Messy, With $1B ARB Tokens at Stake  This is a lesson crypto learned with perhaps the most well-known DAO experiment to date: ConstitutionDAO, which failed in its goal to acquire an historic copy of the U.S. Constitution. That project was beset with issues – including who would bid at the auction and how the capital would be refunded to crowdfunders – that still seem to plague crypto governance. Abstract away the tech that’s meant to abstract away human decision making and often you’ll find just a few key decision-makers.  There’s a silver lining in that the Arbitrum community has thoroughly rejected the initial plan, and is now demanding transparency. People looked at the record and found that 50 million ARB tokens were moved to Binance, presumably for sale, and 40 million were loaned to crypto market-maker Wintermute. It’s not so much that the ARB is a “useless governance token,” as many have argued, but that the governance was lopsided from the beginning. Perhaps that is unavoidable with any system that grants power in proportion to wealth, giving some users more power than others to dictate how the system operates.  Crypto today needs competent decision-makers to oversee the development of new technologies. DAOs can be powerful tools to increase participation. There are many examples of functioning organizations that are run collectively and state upfront that they’re really just Discords with a branded token. But before they “decentralize,” project leaders need to ask whether a DAO is needed in the first place, and what exactly their DAO should be.",NEUTRAL,SOL | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SOL | ARB | BNB,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/04/arbitrum-governance-fracas-reopens-the-question-why-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e3bc1da29caffa7236dd26d971257c6987e80f40-2328x1226.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funding round was led by Maven 11 and included contributions from various prominent crypto investment firms including 1kx, Delphi Ventures and Figment Capital.  Astria's aim is to enable anyone to deploy their own censorship-resistant rollup without having to rely on a centralized sequencer.  Sequencers coordinate transactions on layer 2 rollups – networks that offload activity from layer 1 chains such as Ethereum to decrease network congestion and reduce fees. Sequencers can technically censor or re-reorder transactions for some benefit before they pass those transactions down to a layer 1 chain. Therefore rollups seek ways of decentralizing this process.  ""By using the shared sequencer, rollups are able to maintain high throughput and low-latency soft commitments, while gaining cross-chain composability,"" Astria said in an emailed announcement on Tuesday.  Astria is also developing its Astria EVM, powered by the shared sequencer network and which it plans to serve as the flagship Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for modular blockchain Celestia's data availability layer.  ""Modular"" is used as a term for networks that separate the core blockchain functions – consensus, settlement, data availability and execution – into separate layers in order to prevent any being sacrificed in favor of any of the others.

11419140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525557,1680624007,"Bitcoin Indicators Point To Imminent Resistance Break, Study Shows","The world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has faced a significant resistance level of $28,600 for the past two weeks. However, despite local headwinds, Bitcoin’s natural volatility and ability to reach new local highs indicate that the resistance cluster is on the verge of breaking. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flips Cardano In Market Cap, Becomes 7th Largest Crypto Bitcoin Trades Above Critical Levels According to the trading group “Birb Nest,” the recent surge in Bitcoin’s price, climbing to new yearly highs, has resulted in BTC trading above all critical long-term resistance, anchored at the 200-week and 50-week moving averages (MA), which suggests a positive outlook, as these resistance levels are crucial in determining the long-term direction of Bitcoin. Furthermore, the trading group suggests that the daily chart indicates an “increasingly bullish outlook for Bitcoin.” This is because the primary trend represented by the 200-day MA is inclining upwards. This indicates a positive long-term trend for Bitcoin, which implies that the leading cryptocurrency in the market is leading the industry to a confirmed bull market. Bitcoin’s Critical Anchors In case of a potential price drop in Bitcoin’s price in the near term, the trading group has spotted critical support floors which can serve as an anchor. The BPRO baseline, a technical indicator used to analyze Bitcoin’s price movements, is inclining even more “aggressively” than the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). This provides a new reference point at $22,800, higher than the 200 simple moving average (SMA) support at $20,500. Both levels can serve as “dynamic” support areas as Bitcoin’s price fluctuates. Furthermore, this indicates a positive signal for Bitcoin, indicating that the bullish trend may continue in the long term. Moreover, Bitcoin’s midday chart indicates a continued sideways movement. This means that Bitcoin’s price may remain relatively stable in the short term. However, the HTF trailer of BirbicatorPRO, a technical indicator used to analyze Bitcoin’s price by the trading group, retains its bullish character. Additionally, the High Band resistance for Bitcoin is located in the $29,000 and $29,300 region, while the low band describes the support zone at $27,200. These bands are important technical indicators to predict potential price movements for BTC in the long term. Furthermore, a potential breakout outside Bitcoin’s resistance and support bands, as seen in the chart below, may signal a more powerful market shift, potentially leading to a new short-term trend for the cryptocurrency. At the current trading price of $28,100, Bitcoin is maintaining its consolidation within a range formed two weeks ago. Additionally, the trading group has identified several support levels of interest in case of a potential drop. These support levels, which include $25,200, $23,900, $18,600, and $16,191, can serve as reference points.

The capital will help build out the tech stack, team and community.  Nibiru raised the funds over an extended period starting last July, meaning a portion of the capital was raised before the collapse of centralized exchange FTX caused additional turbulence for the bear market. The startup plans to start raising for a Series A round later this year and is targeting a $200 million to $250 million valuation.  What Nibiru offers  DeFi has historically been dominated by crypto-savvy power users, while new traders have turned to the easier user experience offered by centralized exchanges. Nibiru – with a technology stack of smart contract applications driven by automation – wants to offer the user-friendliness of a centralized exchange without the off-chain settlements, discretionary custodying of funds or external liquidators. Nibiru products are similar to those of fractional reserve stablecoin Frax, decentralized exchange and automated market maker (AMM) Curve and decentralized perpetual exchange GMX.  Nibiru’s initial solutions include the Nibi-Perps derivatives platform that supports leveraged trading on a wide range of Cosmos assets, the Nibi-Swap automated liquidity protocol for spot trading and the Nibiru Oracle Module, where validator nodes act as oracles connecting blockchains to external data sources.

42421280,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmaT,1680623155,The SEC's Beaxy Suit Looks Like a Coinbase Case Preview,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against crypto exchange Beaxy last week, alleging it offered an unregistered securities sale through a 2018 initial coin offering, and that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker-dealer and clearing agency.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Preview  The narrative  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed charges against crypto exchange Beaxy last week, resulting in the exchange shuttering its doors after the regulator alleged it raised $8 million in an unregistered securities offering and that the company’s founder “misappropriated” nearly $1 million for personal use.  Why it matters  Among its allegations, the SEC said Beaxy operated as an unregistered exchange, a broker and a clearing agency. I strongly suspect – and I’m guessing I’m not the only one – that this may be a preview of how the SEC’s case against other crypto exchanges (cough) may go.  Breaking it down  The SEC’s complaint against Beaxy is fascinating to my non-lawyer eye.  Beaxy, for its part, claimed an “uncertain regulatory environment” as the reason for its shutdown ahead of the lawsuit’s publication.  But the SEC suit seems pretty clear. According to the complaint, Beaxy carried out the functions one might expect a national securities exchange, a broker and a clearing agency all would carry out despite not registering as any of these with the regulator.  The SEC took great pains to specify all of these issues in the complaint.  “Platforms like the Beaxy Platform require users to deposit with the platform all of the crypto asset securities that they traded there, resulting in the platform possessing, and even becoming the legal owner of such assets and thus a central securities depository,” the filing said. “This type of arrangement means that an unregistered crypto asset platform like the Beaxy Platform could use assets in their possession and control for its own purposes, thereby exposing investors to significant and at times undisclosed risk of loss of their assets. Investors who invest through such a platform may face a risk that, if the platform were to enter bankruptcy, they might not be able to withdraw their assets and would become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate.”  (This is what happened to most users of the various crypto lenders that filed for bankruptcy last year, including but not limited to BlockFi, Voyager Digital and Celsius Network, as well as fellow crypto exchange FTX.)  The next few paragraphs then contrasted Beaxy with the traditional securities world, noting that a national securities exchange would not “take possession or control” of an asset being traded, while clearing agencies handle settlement and broker-dealers.  “The Beaxy Platform also had the ability to trade crypto asset securities against its own customers, which gives it the means and the motive to put itself on the winning side of each trade, without regard to obligations that apply to registered broker-dealers,” the filing said.  The regulator also filed charges tied to Beaxy’s initial coin offering of BXY tokens in 2018, describing them as tokens that Beaxy and its founder marketed “by promoting its profit potential as tied to the success of the Beaxy platform” (under the precepts of the Howey Test) and its founder’s allegedly fraudulent conduct (misappropriating $900,000 of company funds, around half of which he paid back when giving up control of the company).  The SEC is looking for the usual penalties – disgorgement, fines, etc. – in the lawsuit.  This absolutely reads like a playbook for how the SEC could sue Coinbase, if that situation doesn’t resolve with a settlement or non-action. We don’t know a lot about the Coinbase Wells Notice. So far all Coinbase has said is that the notice lists “an undefined” number of its listed cryptocurrencies, and that its Earn, Prime and Wallet products potentially violate securities law.  It doesn’t look like Beaxy or its executives settled the charges with the SEC, but the fact the exchange is shutting down suggests this will be the kind of case the SEC may look to for a potentially easy win ahead of the Coinbase lawsuit.  While this complaint seems pretty clear, as ConsenSys’ Matt Corva pointed out, part of the issue with registration is figuring out the asset aspect of it all.

42412400,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4udo,1680621402,Peer-to-Peer Bitcoin Exchange Paxful to Suspend Operations,"Paxful – a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for trading bitcoin (BTC) – is suspending its marketplace, and is unsure whether operations will resume, according to a message from CEO Ray Youssef published on its website.  ""This will probably come as a big shock to many,"" said Youssef. ""While I cannot share the full story now, I can say that we unfortunately have had some key staff departures."" Youssef also took note of regulatory challenges, particularly in the P2P market and in the U.S.  The Paxful Wallet, said Youssef, will remain in operation in order for customers to retrieve their funds. Customers are being encouraged to transition to self-custody or use other service providers like Bitcoin payments company Bitnob and newly created peer-to-peer marketplace, Noones.  In December, Paxful suspended the trading of ether on the marketplace, citing the network’s switch to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work as a reason for the move. Since then, the platform has only been trading bitcoin.  Speaking on Twitter Spaces following this morning's surprising announcement, Youssef said there were concerns about the safety of customer funds thanks to a lawsuit by Paxful co-founder Artur Schaback. “I couldn’t guarantee the security of the platform,“ Youssef said. ”This is why this thing had to go down.”  “[Schaback] was pissed, so he sued the company and his litigation team was really nasty,” Youssef said. “They drove away all of our senior level staff. They just couldn't deal with this guy anymore and then he refused to pay our engineers and he refused to pay our compliance.”  Schaback couldn’t be reached for a request for comment from CoinDesk.  Youssef also voiced his frustration with U.S. regulators. “We’ve been bending over backwards for the past five years to try to comply with the highest standards,” he said. “The regulators still don’t get it and it’s painful to see.”  Update (April 4, 2023 16:25 UTC): Adds more details and quotes from Paxful CEO Ray Youssef.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Stephen Alpher, Helene Braun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/04/peer-to-peer-bitcoin-exchange-paxful-to-suspend-operations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cd2c3c4c7212ed9af5ca5f9f56eccb03687bbc5e-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round was led by Web3 fund Collab + Currency, with participation from investors including gmoney, the founder of digital fashion company 9dcc; Shan Aggrawal, vice president and head of corporate development at Coinbase Ventures; and Ryan Carson, former chief operating officer of Moonbirds, among others.  The nature-inspired avatars act as a vehicle for collectors to offset carbon emissions. Each Ecosapien owner can also purchase additional carbon credits to evolve their NFT and gain rarity traits.  Nihar Neelakanti, a co-founder of Ecosapiens, told CoinDesk that he was driven by a mission to help the environment. He said that utilizing NFTs as a channel for selling carbon credits is the most efficient way to participate in “impact-to-earn,” which allows consumers to help take climate action and earn rewards through activism.  “What if we could take carbon credits that actually made a big impact in the world, bring them on-chain to make it one-click accessible, but, really, just disguise these credits as the perfect signaling art piece?” said Neelakanti. “In that way, it's easy, economical and engaging to make a difference.”  Neelakanti told CoinDesk he plans to use the funding to build out the Ecopsapiens marketplace, test out minting strategies such as open editions and forge brand partnerships to expand its presence within Web3.  According to data from OpenSea, Ecosapiens’ Alpha Collection, which launched in February, has a floor price of 0.055 ether (ETH), or about $100.

42421281,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmZR,1680618595,Bitcoin and the Changing Definition of 'Safety',"Fortunately, we rarely have to think about Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, that triangle we saw in school that layers the key human requirements for flourishing. Until, that is, one of the needs towards the bottom isn’t being met, and then we think about it a lot.  To recap: At the very bottom we have the basics for survival: the physical needs of nourishment, rest and shelter, and then layered on top of that is safety. The next part of the stack is the psychological need of belonging and self-esteem, and then we come to the peak of the pyramid, which is about achieving one’s full potential. (I know that many academics disagree with the premise and that Maslow never actually drew a triangle, but bear with me as I sketch out this construct.)  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Some of you may notice there isn’t a separate layer for “trust.” One could argue that it is a requisite for every layer in that you need to trust the food you eat won’t kill you, your house won’t get blown away and a friendship will lift you up. But the layer with which it is most intertwined is “safety,” and I’ll argue that it is wedged into that category. Trust implies belief in the safety to feel and to act, and is a core component of pretty much everything that implies both personal and civilizational progress.  So, trust is necessary for safety (which is meaningless if there is no belief in it) and safety is necessary for trust (without basic reassurances, it’s hard to trust anything). What happens when our belief in what “safety” is starts to change?  In the financial world, what is and isn’t safe is starting to change. Let’s take a look at how “safe, sensible investments” have been doing recently.  U.S. government bonds are supposedly the safest assets in the market, in that the U.S. government is not going to default on its debt (right?). However, earlier this month their volatility reached its highest level since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Over the past year, with the fastest interest rate hiking period since the 1980s, interest rate risk has been higher than ever. Bond values have plummeted, and all this while the cost of insuring against a U.S. government default on its debt has soared to its highest level in over 10 years. That doesn’t seem so safe.  What about stocks? We’re told that they are among the riskiest assets, but over a long time frame they have been up and to the right. The below chart shows the S&P 500 together with an index of long-term government bonds. Which looks safer to you?  Then there’s the wisdom of diversification – mimic the large indices, we’re told, and your returns will be better distributed. Only, probing deeper, we see that high-risk tech stocks account for almost 30% of the S&P 500 and occupy the top six positions in the market cap ranking. That sounds more concentrated than diversified, which surely adds risk.  Anyone who has interacted with a professional adviser will have heard about the 60/40 portfolio, which counts on a prescribed stocks/bonds distribution to deliver a more counterbalanced return than focusing on just one or the other asset class. Yet, last year the typical 60/40 portfolio lost 18% on a nominal basis, pretty close to the damage done by the S&P 500 alone. Not that safe.  Houses must be safe, surely? Ah, wait – data released last week shows U.S. home prices are falling, down 0.2% in January from December and down 3% from last June. Those percentages may seem small compared to last year’s fall in equities, but since housing is often a family’s most significant investment those drops can hurt. Still, the house is presumably still standing and offering the safety of shelter.  Gold is one of the oldest “safe havens” known to man, a durable metal with a liquid market and (in theory) supply that can't be manipulated. But we can’t always be sure that what we have is actually gold, and it’s complicated to store and to keep out of the hands of people stronger than ourselves. Paper gold is more convenient, but even if we could be sure the bars backing it were real those bars are subject to seizure. While it’s unlikely, the value of our gold holdings could be zero.That doesn’t sound particularly safe.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Bitcoin and the Liquidity Question: More Complex Than It Seems  Of course, the “safest” thing to do is to shun securities markets and keep your money in your bank account. Despite official protestations that the U.S. banking system is “strong and resilient,” depositors are still nervous –although outflows seem to have slowed for now. But the digital nature of banking means that could change in minutes, and it is not yet certain that all deposits would be protected.  Then there’s bitcoin (BTC). We’re told it’s not safe at all, we’re even told it’s “dangerous.” And yet throughout the past year of crashes and disappointments, bitcoin kept on working. The price plunged but bitcoin didn’t miss a beat. What’s more, in times of turmoil an asset that is hard to seize but easy to transport would sound refreshingly safe to many fleeing their homes and/or worried about being shut out of traditional payment rails. And it is trivial to verify.  So, just as we are starting to realize that it’s time to re-examine what “safe” means, whether it refers to returns, continuity or independence, we have a cultural shift that is asking us to question why it even matters. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, trust in institutions had been dropping and the intensifying political polarization seen around the world weakens confidence for many that governments will offer protection, especially if – as we are regularly reminded – the planet is in trouble anyway.  Plus, there’s the “gamification” of investing, which rewards decisions with screenfuls of confetti or at least some social kudos. Fun generally trumps safety, especially when the future for which young people are supposed to save looks increasingly bleak through their eyes.  Overlaid onto this is a growing interest in a new type of asset that runs on rails totally outside the establishment system and that highlights the growing desire for independence, horizontal community and skepticism of the authorities’ good intentions.  All this points to an inevitable recognition that bitcoin and its peers represent much more than a “risky” investment asset. They represent a shift in investment philosophy that speaks to an increasingly independent generation of investors. They also represent cultural and political shifts that weaken the power of authorities attempting to invoke rules of safety that no longer make sense.  Going back to Maslow’s pyramid where trust and safety are intertwined: If one changes, so does the other. That’s why the investment framework shifts we’re seeing are about much more than portfolio allocations. They’re also about bigger social changes and the recognition that, while wisdom builds up over generations and should not be thrown out the window just because it’s “traditional,” questioning convention helps a culture be more flexible and resilient. A retreat from the new adds to fragility – not very safe at all.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/04/bitcoin-safety-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/334132e1aed014ae5ff9da58c231bd9aba88795e-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The funds will go toward building out an accelerator that aims to foster the growth of teams working to launch Web3 projects. The raise was Delphi’s first time courting outside investments.  “Over our ~6 years in crypto, we’ve consulted for, invested in, and helped build several multi-billion dollar protocols across every vertical in crypto. We know first-hand how hard it is to build a crypto startup and we’ve experienced all the common pitfalls,” wrote the Delphi team in a draft announcement post shared with CoinDesk.  Each team in the accelerator will receive $200,000 in funding. The main part of the program will last from four to six months, and project teams will be introduced to Delphi’s network of potential investors at the end of the program. Participants will receive hands-on advice from a core team of engineers, economists, designers, lawyers and entrepreneurs on everything from product development, legal advice and go-to-market strategies.  Delphi Labs said that the plan is to scale up to 10 teams per year. Each cohort of the accelerator will be focused on a particular Web3 ecosystem to allow for a more targeted approach to support. The first cohort will focus on the Cosmos ecosystem; applications are now open.  “Delphi has an exceptional team with extensive experience and a deep understanding of all aspects of managing a Web3 project. Their expertise ranges from intricate legal structures to tokenomics design and development, as well as building truly decentralized protocols and selecting the ideal technology stack,” said P2P founder Konstantin Lomashuk. “If I were to enter this field and launch a new venture, I would undoubtedly do so through the innovative Delphi Accelerator.”  Read more: Jump Crypto Wants You to Know Its Name",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/04/delphi-labs-raises-135m-for-web3-accelerator,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc9d2ead7ad0094b90ffbdad8da52c8233a56dee-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11417161,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525525,1680616812,"Here’s Why Bitcoin Could Break At Least $33,000 In This Rally","Bitcoin may be able to break the $33,000 mark in the current rally if this historical pattern of an on-chain indicator is anything to go by. Bitcoin Realized Price-To-Liveliness Ratio Has A Value Of $33,200 Currently According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC is currently in a range that has historically been associated with a macro transitional phase. The indicator of interest here is the “realized price,” which is a value derived from a Bitcoin capitalization model called the realized cap. Unlike the usual market cap, the realized cap says that the true value of a coin in the circulating BTC supply is the price at which it was last transferred and not the current Bitcoin price. The realized price is obtained from this model by dividing it by the total number of coins in circulation. The significance of this price is that it represents the cost basis (the acquisition price) of the average holder in the market. This means that if the normal price dips below this metric’s value, then the average investor in the sector enters into a state of loss. Naturally, a break above the level implies a return of profitability for the market. Now, the realized price makes the lower bound of the aforementioned macro transitional phase as the worst parts of historical Bitcoin bear markets have occurred when the price has been below this level. The below chart shows the trend in this indicator: Looks like the price is significantly above this level now | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 14, 2023 As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin broke above the realized price earlier in the year when the ongoing rally first started. This was a signal that the coin had entered into the transitional period between bearish and bullish trends. The realized price currently has a value of $19,800, which means the coin has now taken quite a distance over it. Now, BTC is not too far from the upper bound of this historical range, which is made by a metric called the realized price-to-liveliness ratio. Related Reading: Dogecoin Flips Cardano In Market Cap, Becomes 7th Largest Crypto This indicator is a modified version of the realized price that accounts for the degree of HODLing taking place on the network. As for why this weighting factor is applied to the realized price, Glassnode explains, “large scale HODLing acts to constrain supply, increasing the estimated ‘fair value’, and vice-versa.” Currently, the realized price-to-liveliness ratio has a value of around $33,200. From the chart, it’s apparent that tops of bull rallies have historically taken form at or above this level. The April 2019 rally, with which the current rally shares many similarities, also saw BTC break above this indicator before a top was encountered. If these previous instances are anything to consider, it appears possible that the current rally in the cryptocurrency will also at least touch the upper bound of this transitional zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin SOPR Plunges, Why This Could Be Bullish A retest of this level, however, doesn’t necessarily have to take place soon. In the 2015-2016 bear market, the asset spent 234 days in this period before it touched the upper bound of this zone. The current cycle has so far seen the coin spend a total of 116 days here.

OPNX, which is short for Open Exchange, is a platform for trading what it says is a $20 billion market for crypto-related bankruptcy claims. The exchange will offer claims of companies such as crypto exchanges FTX and CoinFLEX. In early March, FTX claims were trading at 20 cents on the dollar.

Now, more often than not, Schiff has always been wrong about Bitcoin but that has not stopped the economist from preaching strongly against the cryptocurrency. Once more, Schiff has asked investors to stay away from BTC with a gloomy prediction.

However, Schiff has been repeatedly wrong about Bitcoin for years. One user points out that Schiff discouraged buying BTC below $3,800 three years ago, predicting it would continue to fall. Rather, BTC rose to a new all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. BTC recovers above $28,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin is also being increasingly used as an inflation hedge by investors.

The fundraise comes a little over a month after the startup closed a $10 million strategic funding round from Binance Labs and Polychain. Getting two deals done so quickly stands out amid the crypto bear market that has nearly stalled investments in the industry.  Berkeley, California-based Polyhedra Network is building a suite of systems focusing on blockchain interoperability, scalability and privacy. Those systems include zkBridge, which facilitates cross-chain asset and data transfers.  ""ZkBridge uses zero-knowledge proof constructions to verify the validity of the consensus between two blockchains,"" Polyhedra co-founder James Zhang said in a statement. ""With zero-knowledge proofs, zkBridge offers strong security without relying on external assumptions and a significant reduction in on-chain verification cost.""  ZkBridge had been in testnet for the past six months, but the company announced a successful mainnet alpha launch on Tuesday, making the system available to users on a number of layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains.  Other backers in the round included ABCDE, Sparkle Ventures, HashKey Capital, Foresight Ventures, Kucoin Ventures, NGC Ventures and Arcane Group.  In the coming months, Polyhedra Network plans to integrate zkBridge into additional blockchain networks and launch application programming interfaces (API) and software development kits (SDK) to help developers build and collaborate.

Investors in the latest round included the crypto arm of noted investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, auction house Christie’s, Sequoia Capital and Samsung Next. The round had 33 total backers, including BOND, Circle Ventures and OpenSea Ventures.  The capital will go toward growth initiatives, including hiring and expanding the company’s presence in the Asia-Pacific region.  The funding round is a rare nine-figure deal during a crypto bear market that has seen investments in the industry slow to a glacial pace, though infrastructure-focused projects have proven the most resilient.  Vancouver, British Columbia-based LayerZero offers interoperability and cross-chain messaging infrastructure that allow decentralized application developers to reach multiple blockchains without the need for a middleman to facilitate the cross-chain interactions.  “LayerZero is to blockchains what the internet was to computing clusters. LayerZero allows chains not only to build bridges (to transfer assets / value between them) but send and execute arbitrary data just like a packet on the internet,” Bryan Pellegrino, co-founder and CEO of LayerZero Labs, said in an email to CoinDesk. “What this means is that you can now build applications that are orders of magnitude more complex than existing applications and do so with a completely seamless experience between chains.”  LayerZero emerged from stealth in September 2021 with a $6 million funding round. The protocol has since facilitated over two million messages relayed across more than 30 chains and has secured over $7 billion in total value locked , according to the company. LayerZero is used by a number of on-chain applications, including decentralized exchanges PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, TraderJoe and Uniswap.  “I think for us more than the money it really was just about aligning ourselves with an amazing group of partners, we had very specific goals for who we wanted to include with this fundraise and what our goals were, and we accomplished everything we were looking for,” Pellegrino said.

Coinbase unveiled the Derivatives Exchange (CDE), which is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), in June 2022 to attract more retail traders. Futures contracts require less upfront investment than traditional bitcoin futures products.  The cloud-based financial trading infrastructure deployed by TNS for the exchange will enable institutional investors to increase storage capabilities and process large data sets with minimal delay.  “Crypto has witnessed both volatile and liquid markets, and with institutional adoption remaining strong, we believe the time is right for the offering that TNS brings to the table,” CDE CEO Boris Ilyevsky said. “Dedicated cloud infrastructure connectivity coupled with our derivatives exchange represents a mission-critical step toward supporting and maintaining a vibrant and reliable crypto derivatives market.”  Crypto derivatives, such as futures and options, are a popular trading tool for investors looking to leverage or manage risk.

As a security tool meant for protecting user transactions, De.Fi claims to have recorded and analyzed over 12 million issues from 1.15 million contracts in the past two years.  In the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, users depend on themselves to self-custody their assets and protect against scams such as rug pulls, phishing attacks and contract exploits.  This year alone over $420 million has been lost to such scams, according to De.Fi's Rekt Database. Tools offered by De.Fi address these challenges by alerting users on common vulnerabilities and ensuring that they transact with trusted smart contracts.  De.Fi’s products for Fantom include Scanner, which can automatically assess and assign a security score to smart contracts on the blockchain; and Shield, which analyzes user wallets and allows them to revoke approvals deemed risky by the tool.  “As blockchain technology gains adoption and proliferates, so do threats to its security,” said Michael Kong, CEO at Fantom Foundation, in a statement to CoinDesk. “Fantom is pleased to welcome De.Fi’s Web3 Defense Suite to its ecosystem, which will further complement Fantom’s best-in-class smart contract security offerings.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FTM | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/04/fantom-network-adds-defis-security-tools-to-bolster-dapp-protection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32da388474a504bcc9fcb33001d9c1ef6fd0c19e-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412419,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4usm,1680610094,First Mover Americas: Dogecoin Pops on New Twitter Logo,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Dogecoin (DOGE) surged more than 35% after Elon Musk's Twitter replaced the social-media platform's familiar blue bird atop its homepage with the cryptocurrency's iconic Shiba Inu dog logo. DOGE was trading at around 10 cents on Tuesday. Before Monday, its price last exceeded 10 cents in December, according to CoinDesk data. Musk has frequently touted DOGE, suggesting the meme coin may offer better payments functionality than bitcoin. Following the logo change, Musk tweeted out a cartoon image as his first public comment.  Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has seen a sizable drop in market share after a U.S. regulator accused it of fraud and the exchange eliminated zero-fee trading for some trading pairs. Its market share of trading volume has sunk to 54% from 70% two weeks ago, according to data from research platform Kaiko. That’s the lowest level since Nov. 5 and the lowest sustained market share since August, Kaiko said. In the U.S., crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) market share fell to a weekly average of 49% from 60% during the first quarter, while Binance.US picked up the slack. Its market share rose to 24% from 8% during the quarter, Kaiko said.  Voyager Digital and its creditors stand to lose $100 million if legal objections brought by the U.S. government aren't resolved by April 13, according to legal documents filed late Monday night. The bankrupt crypto lender is taking urgent legal action to let a $1 billion purchase by Binance.US go ahead, fearful that quibbles over the contractual drafting could see the exchange pull out. “Consummation of the plan by April 13 is necessary to preserve massive creditor value,” a filing by Voyager’s creditors stated. “The evidence is uncontroverted that, if the deal is not completed, Voyager’s creditors will lose roughly $100 million in value.”  Chart of the Day  The chart shows dogecoin has rallied to a four-month high, breaking out of a ""Bollinger Bands squeeze.""  Bollinger Bands are volatility indicators placed two standard deviations above and below the price’s 20-day moving average.  A squeeze occurs when price volatility drops and Bollinger Bands tighten. A subsequent breakout represents a volatility explosion, paving the way for an extended rally, as seen in late October.

Dogecoin Has Observed A Strong Surge Over The Past Day While the cryptocurrency market as a whole has enjoyed some strong upwards momentum in the last few months, DOGE couldn’t quite put together any uptrend as impressive as some of its peers, which lead to it falling behind them. Over the last day, however, Dogecoin finally seems to have observed some sharp increase of its own. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading around $0.0984, up 26% in the past 24 hours. Here is a chart that shows how the original meme coin has performed recently: Looks like the value of the asset has rocked up today | Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView As you can see in the above graph, the price of Dogecoin had been consolidating during most of the past month, but the trend has significantly deviated over the last day. The reason behind this strong surge in the asset’s value seems to be the fact that Elon Musk’s Twitter has changed its icon to an image of the popular Doge meme, on which the cryptocurrency is based. It’s currently unclear what this move means, or if it’s a change that would stick around for too long. Nonetheless, the switch to the Doge icon has been enough to build up sufficient hype around the meme coin to fuel this price rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin SOPR Plunges, Why This Could Be Bullish Following this surge, there also looks to have been some huge whale transfers made on the blockchain, as data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert shows. 🚨 🚨 🚨 650,000,000 #DOGE (65,559,028 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/j1HVESp3fT — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 3, 2023 🚨 🚨 300,000,000 #DOGE (27,687,117 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallethttps://t.co/dwX7rx5Hi0 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) April 3, 2023 While these transfers could have been signs of large purchases from these humongous holders, they could also be a hint of a selloff. However, since they don’t seem to be heading toward exchanges, it’s possible that they weren’t made with the intent of selling after all. At least so far, the price hasn’t reacted negatively to these movements. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought 1.47 Billion DOGE In Q1 2023: Santiment After this rapid rise in the price, Dogecoin’s year-to-date (YTD) returns have hit around 40% in the green, meaning that the asset has now caught up with its meme coin rival, Shiba Inu (also with 40% YTD profits). DOGE Has Flipped ADA In Market Cap Dogecoin had previously been the 8th largest coin in the entire sector, but with this latest rally, the meme coin has advanced up the top cryptocurrency by market cap list. The below table shows where the asset stands among its peers now. The market cap of the asset seems to be around $13.7 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap Cardano was earlier the holder of the 7th spot on this list, but the coin has now fallen to the 8th spot after Dogecoin overtook it. The gap between the two, however, isn’t too much right now, so DOGE could still slip below ADA again in the near future. If the meme coin can continue this upwards momentum, however, a more proper margin between the two could end up being created, thus allowing DOGE to hold onto the spot more tightly.

The ether-bitcoin ratio rose over 1% to 0.066, taking back a small portion of the 7% decline seen last month.

42421277,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnmUH,1680608700,NFTs Are the Ultimate Disruptor of Hollywood's Entertainment Status Quo,"This year's Oscar award winner for ""best short film"" was ""Irish Goodbye"" by First Flights, a ""Film3"" company that produces films via crowdfunding models. While the production of ""Irish Goodbye"" preceded First Flights’ recent implementation of non-fungible tokens (NFT), the company has fully committed to embracing Web3, as demonstrated by its recent successful raise for its next short film.  Whether we like it or not, NFTs have become well-known beyond our industry bubble and are recognized by a much larger audience than we might think. However, it's important to note that Hollywood has only begun to explore the potential of blockchain technology and Web3, indicating that there may be much more to come for the industry  Andrea Berry is the head of business development at Theta Labs.  NFTs create an unmatched 1:1 relationship between the buyer and the issuer, helping build a community without dependence on multiple vendors. Over the last few years, businesses have been learning the power of their community but have struggled to quantify its ROI.  The data never lies  It's often said that ""the data never lies,"" and when it comes to success in the entertainment industry that statement holds true. While many believe that all you need are 1,000 dedicated fans to make it big, few have access to the kind of data that can truly help them understand what that means.  During my time at Vimeo I gained invaluable insights into the importance of communities when it comes to user acquisition, audience development, and distribution of video. At the time, Vimeo’s “Netflix-in-a-box” over-the-top (OTT) product powered approximately 1,000 channels, representing 3.6 million aggregated subscribers.  Through our research, we discovered that channels with broad appeal had a high rate of losing subscribers, with an average churn rate of 28%. These streaming channels also had a lower lifetime value per user, at only about $21.  On the other hand, streaming channels that focused on a specific niche, serving to a specific community, had a much lower churn rate of 12.7% and a higher lifetime value of $50 or more. Niche channels also had a higher engagement rate, with viewers spending an average of 506 minutes of viewership, compared to only 73 minutes per user for broad entertainment channels. What's more, subscription price increases had no effect on churn for niche channels, while it spiked for broad entertainment channels.  These findings confirm the powerful impact of community engagement and highlight the importance of community building for creators, particularly those creating niche content. Niche content represents communities tailored to a particular audience's interests and needs. Similarly, independent filmmakers who naturally make niche content can build their own communities around their work as they connect with audiences who share their creative vision and values.  A turning point for production  The film industry is utilizing Web3 technology to create communities and monetize niche content offerings, granting creators unprecedented leverage over major distributors and streamers. Web3 technology helps filmmakers overcome significant challenges such as funding, intellectual property protection and audience engagement. With such tools, creators can build unprecedented levels of leverage, even amidst the current streaming wars.  Julie Pacino, a photographer and filmmaker, faced resistance when trying to fund her film ""I Live Here Now"" due to its unconventional nature. She refused to give up and decided to fully fund the film through an NFT drop, which turned out to be a great success. Julie became the first filmmaker to fully fund a movie with NFTs, proving her critics wrong.  See also: NounsDAO Approves Proposal for Feature-Length NFT Movie  At the Sundance Film Festival, nonprofit organization Decentralized Pictures announced Miguel Faus as the first winner of the $100,000 Andrews/Bernard Financing Award, which is powered by blockchain technology. This makes Miguel's film, ""Calladita,"" the first European film to be fully funded by an NFT strategy.  Jordan Bayne, the founder and leader of The Squad, is the driving force behind the Film3 movement, an NFT-driven initiative aimed at transforming the film industry by providing a more equitable platform for underrepresented voices.  Let creators create  We finally have a technology with the potential to transform the way communities interact and participate in the economy by empowering creators, fostering collaboration and innovation, and building a more equitable economy. While NFTs are still a relatively new concept, their impact on communities and the economy is already starting to be felt, as creators monetize their work directly and reduce the power imbalances that have traditionally existed in the creative industries.  See also: 'It’s Always the Community': Web3 and the Future of Movies  As the film industry faces challenges with the looming writers' strike, more and more creators will seek out alternative means of entertainment and income. The rise of Web3 technology and NFTs provides the perfect alternative to the traditional content creation and distribution model, enabling independent filmmakers to reach their audiences more directly and retain more control over their work.  With the film industry at a crossroads, it is crucial that we embrace these new technologies and explore their potential to build more meaningful and sustainable relationships with audiences.  A new era of filmmaking is upon us. Supporting the creators on this path will lead to new experiences tailored to our passions.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Andrea Berry,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/04/04/nfts-are-the-ultimate-disruptor-of-hollywoods-entertainment-status-quo,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a57f6578ec077be955b19f87c3ff701256e4bb4-5181x2914.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The project’s backers include crypto notable Arca, and the round was co-led by Gumi Cryptos Capital and CMT Digital.  Franklin provides a tool for firms to make payments to employees and contractors in crypto, across the world, including the U.S. The project, which is built on the Ethereum mainnet and scaling solution Polygon, offers tools to automate payroll expenses and tax filings for a selection of cryptocurrencies.  “Payroll is one of the more complex types of financial transactions to solve in a crypto-native way,” Franklin CEO Megan Knab said in the release.  Serotonin CEO Amanda Cassatt said she green-lit the project after hearing from several of their public relation boutique’s clients about the need for crypto payroll options – calling the decision to build Franklin a “no brainer.”  See also: Wondering What Web3 Means? Listen to Ethereum's First Marketer  Serotonin has developed at least three in-house projects that have been or will soon be spun out as separate companies. Franklin’s seed round followed the apparent success of Mojito, a non-fungible token (NFT) back-end system used by Serotonin's clients which were beginning to explore the Web3 economy – notably including the legacy auction house Sotheby’s.  It’s a strategy that seems to be working for Serotonin, which has not taken on debt or sold equity to outside investors though offers employees partial ownership stakes, Cassatt said in an interview. Mojito had $120 million in sales revenue in its first 12 months operating, although traction has since dropped off in the bear market. Similar data was not made available for Franklin.  The third spin-off project has not been officially announced but involves the “creator economy” and tokens, Cassatt said. Franklin, for its part, plans to use its recent funding to expand into retirement accounts and health benefits. Its clients include Soul Wallet, Echooo and Alto, according to the press release.  Because Serotonin works closely with crypto clients to develop long-term marketing and business strategies, as well as venture capital firms that fund many of Web3’s largest projects, the firm sees itself as well-placed to identify basic operational tools that need to be built, Cassatt said.

In addition, OneOf is launching the OnePlatform, a turnkey option for companies looking to expand into Web3 that combines elements of e-commerce, data and loyalty programs.

It has partnered with companies such as internet browser Brave, rideshare company Uber, entertainment firm Warner Music Group and more.

11412905,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525513,1680605765,"While Bitcoin Stagnates, Is Altcoin Season Finally Here? QCP Weighs In","While the Bitcoin price has failed to sustainably advance into the $29,000 region since mid-March, several altcoins are currently experiencing a strong rally. Bitcoin dominance has risen to as high as 46.5% in recent weeks, but is currently seeing a small retracement. Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital says in an analysis today that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are entering a difficult time for monetization as both are wedged in a very tight range. Altcoins could benefit from this in the second quarter: Perhaps Q2 is indeed shaping up to be the quarter of #Alts and #Airdrops, while BTC takes a breather. Pricing has essentially gone nowhere since March 17, when BTC closed at $27.5k and ETH at $1.8k. Recession Gets More Likely, Bitcoin and Altcoins in Uncharted Territory According to the company, this is largely due to the tremendous resistance that Bitcoin and Ethereum are facing. Even the major events of the past few days have not been able to get Bitcoin out of its tight trading range. Neither the FOMC meeting on March 22 with the 25 basis point hike nor the CTFC’s lawsuit against Binance were able to change that. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Fair Price Of Bitcoin Currently Is $42,000: Renowned Analyst According to QCP, the markets have largely dismissed civil lawsuits because they are likely to have the same outcome as the BitMEX lawsuit in 2020. “We tend to agree. It is likely to go the same way as a suit against Bitmex a few years back where a large settlement was reached to conclude the affair,” the analysts wrote. That’s why they saw it as a buying opportunity; but “now on the first sign of a recessionary turn in US data last night,” the firm warned to pay attention to the recession narrative, which will be formed with the macro data coming up this week. Related Reading: Data Says Bitcoin Has Begun Its Most Bullish Month Historically Both the US dollar and bond yields turned sharply lower yesterday following the release of the ISM manufacturing index, which showed the sharpest decline since April 2020 amid the pandemic. And the recession outlook is likely to cloud further in the coming days, according to QCP: We expect more weak US data to come out this week, further cementing the recession narrative. After many false dawns, we believe this will indeed be the lasting one. Since both Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have never been in a recessionary environment, the asset class should be classified as “unproven”, according to QCP Capital, which is even more true for a stagflationary environment. However, should the Federal Reserve act quickly in a recession, as it did during the banking crisis last month, QCP expects Bitcoin to soar and lead the crypto market once again. But the risk of major headwinds is high according to QCP Capital – for both Bitcoin and Altcoins: Price-wise all the easy work is now done, and we have gotten to the hard work zone for bulls. Firstly, Q2 tends to be a difficult quarter for risk markets, crypto notwithstanding. At press time, the bitcoin price was at $28,329 and has fully recovered from the FUD crash over an Interpol Red Notice for Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao.

Both tokens have rallied by as much as 40% in the past 24 hours with hundreds of millions of dollars in trading volumes on local South Korean crypto exchanges.  The ICX-Korean won token pair saw over $420 million in trading volume on Upbit, a prominent South Korean exchange, CoinGecko data shows. The SXP-won trading pair saw over $490 million in volume, more than either bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) trading pairs.  In both cases, trading volume exceeded market value: SXP had a market capitalization of $455 million at writing time on Tuesday, while icon’s capitalization was just under $350 million.  The payments-focused blockchain Solar Network is the rebranded main network of Swipe, which was previously a debit card provider. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, purchased Swipe in 2020. Last week, Binance said it will support a token migration of SXP in the coming days – which may have buoyed recent interest.  ICX is popular in South Korea for its local roots. The network allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchains, allowing ICX to be used for staking, network governance and collateralization on decentralized-finance platforms.  South Korean crypto traders have a record of pushing euphoric rallies on tokens. The so-called Kimchi Premium originates from the region. That's when the price of bitcoin on local exchanges can trade as much as 30% above the price on international exchanges.

42412415,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4uqu,1680598672,"Bitcoin Volatility Index's Correlation With Price Flips Positive, Boosts Appeal of Bullish Call Options","Crypto options exchange Deribit's forward-looking bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) offers clues about the market's expectations for price turbulence over the next 30 days, just as the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, VIX, does for equities.  A key difference has emerged this year. While the VIX continues to serve as Wall Street's fear gauge, rising during bouts of risk aversion, the DVOL has developed a positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price. The 30-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin's price and the DVOL index flipped positive in early January and rose to a high of 0.85 last week. At press time, the coefficient was 0.72. That has made call options tied to bitcoin (BTC) more attractive than ever, according to observers.  ""Since the start of 2023, bitcoin has displayed a strong spot/implied volatility regime of positive correlation. That has flipped 2022 on its head,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at crypto data provider Amberdata, told CoinDesk. ""It's been rewarding call buyers with directional spot gains and increasing volatility gains.""  DVOL, introduced in early 2021, measures bitcoin's 30-day implied or expected volatility using Deribit's options order book. The VIX is based on the options prices of the S&P 500 stock index.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, a signal the holder has a bullish stance, while a put option gives the right to sell. Options prices are determined by several factors, including market direction as well as implied volatility, which is influenced by the supply and demand for options.  DVOL's positive correlation with the cryptocurrency's price means call options stand to benefit from both favorable directional movement and an uptick in implied volatility. In other words, calls are likely to see faster price appreciation during bullish moves than puts during bearish moves.  ""Assuming the spot/vol correlation persists, this raises the appeal of owning calls as a call buyer can hit a 'double whammy,' winning on both Delta [directional gains] and Vega [implied volatility gains] in a sharply rising market,"" Spencer Hallarn, an over-the-counter trader at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.  Caught off guard  The positive correlation is in stark contrast to last year, when bitcoin's turn lower after an 18-month bullish trend caught traders off guard, leading to panic buying of put options. At the time, DVOL spiked during notable price declines and puts saw faster price appreciation during bearish price action than calls during corrective rallies.  CBOE's VIX index rises during bearish market environments and falls or holds steady when the market rallies. That's because stock traders tend to be long-term bullish and are quick to snap up puts for protection on the first signs of weakness in the stock market. Demand for protection dissipates when the market rallies, leading to a decline in the VIX. The net effect is that puts see faster appreciation in value during market swoons than calls do during risk-on trends.  Bitcoin rallied almost 70% in the first three months of the year, contradicting expectations for a continued market decline. According to OTC tech platform Paradigm, funds have been piling into bullish positions via options.  The fear of missing out, or FOMO, could soon kick in, driving stronger demand for options and pushing DVOL higher.  ""The crypto market can sometimes spike up and everybody then wants to be fully in it (FOMO, especially since we came down from the $68K level),"" Pierino Ursone, head of options at Deribit, said while explaining DVOL's positive correlation with the price. ""When extra demand for out-of-the-money higher strike calls kicks in for crypto, one should beware it can be really strong and persevering.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/04/bitcoin-volatility-indexs-correlation-with-price-flips-positive-boosts-appeal-of-bullish-call-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd6d7f3dcc7690e7b3d8916310d6113caeba5c7a-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to CryptoSlam, NFTs sales volume dropped by nearly 31% since last month. This has been in complete contrast to the crypto market which regained lost ground from a disastrous 2022. Although several big developments around NFTs should’ve helped with the sentiment surrounding the asset, being a new asset class, there are still doubts about whether there is actual utility behind the tech. For now, let’s take a look at the dire situation the NFT industry is in. Related Reading: These Top 5 Meme Coins Are Bleeding As March 2023 Ends – Here’s Why It Doesn’t Look Great For NFT Industry The current data suggests that the industry will struggle in the short to medium-term. In terms of blockchains, Ethereum still leads the market in sales and transactions. Collections-wise, Bored Ape Yacht Club is still the market leader with $38 million worth of sales. Despite this, the market seems to freefall at the moment. Data from the Forkast 500 NFT Index shows a 4% decline in the past month. Buyers of NFTS also fell by a significant margin since last month, shedding 34% to its current value of 1.3 million. Total transactions have also decreased by 22% to 5.7 million Nonetheless, there seems to have a trend in the NFT market. The Ethereum blockchain, although still the number one chain to trade and mint NFTs on, has been suffering a significant dip in almost all metrics. Other “minor” blockchains like ImmutableX, Polygon, Solana, and Arbitrum all saw big jumps in transactions. It should be noted, however, that Polygon is a layer 2 platform built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The jump in transactions on the L2 might not reflect on the overall metrics of its parent L1 chain. Crypto total market cap retains peg on the $1.14 trillion level on the daily chart at TradingView.com Related Reading: Arbitrum Whales Dump 3.73 Million Tokens, Impacting Market Prices How This Would Affect The NFT Sector This recent development in the NFT market would certainly affect the rate of adoption of non-fungible tokens as both a form of asset and technology. However, the rising metrics of the minor blockchains reveal that investors are diversifying from NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. For NFT investors, the market could experience pain in the short to medium term. Investors and traders should then diversify in the minor blockchains with rising transactions as this is the place where they’ll get the most out of their money. -Featured image from Getty Images",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | ARB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/nft/nft-industry-hit-hard-in-march/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The bankrupt crypto lender is taking urgent legal action to let a $1 billion purchase by Binance.US go ahead, fearful that squabbles over the terms of the contract could prompt Binance.US to pull out.  “Consummation of the plan by April 13 is necessary to preserve massive creditor value,” a filing by Voyager’s creditors stated. “The evidence is uncontroverted that, if the deal is not completed, Voyager’s creditors will lose roughly $100 million in value.”  A parallel filing made by Voyager itself, also to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, said that delays could cost $10 million per month and that more than 1 million Voyager customers wouldn’t be able to access their savings.  Under the terms of the deal, originally signed in December and approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles in March, Binance.US can back out if the agreement isn’t closed within four months.  Lawyers for the U.S. government have protested that the terms of the contract would effectively absolve the company from breaches of tax or securities law, and last week, U.S. District Judge Jennifer Rearden agreed to put the deal on hold while the issue is settled.  In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission sought to argue that assets involved in the transfer such as the Voyager token VGX could constitute unregistered securities, but the agency was rebuffed by Wiles.  Binance.US didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Early last month, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao suggested he could pull out of the deal in view of legal delays, before adding that he still supported the deal to return funds to customers.

Binance also witnessed its lowest bitcoin (BTC) trading volume since July 2022 on March 27 after it halted its no-fee trading promotion for 13 bitcoin spot trading pairs. “Binance’s excess volume largely vanished with the end of zero-fee trading, which was reflected in an even dispersal in market share among the remaining exchanges,” Kaiko said.  Kaiko noted that as global exchanges are increasingly being targeted by regulators, the U.S. market is particularly fragile now for the remaining crypto exchanges.  In the U.S., crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) market share dropped in the first quarter, falling to a weekly average of 49% from 60% during the quarter, while Binance.US picked up the slack.

11408088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525474,1680595232,"Here’s Why The Fair Price Of Bitcoin Currently Is $42,000: Renowned Analyst","The founder of Capriole Investments, Charles Edwards, has shared in his latest tweet an assessment that Bitcoin is still significantly undervalued at its current price. The creator of the Hash Ribbons indicator and one of the leading publishers of on-chain models, stated that Bitcoin is currently trading at a 33% discount to its fair value. “The symmetry of the Bitcoin cycle and its fundamental data is something truly unique to Bitcoin. I suspect this is a trait only found in tamperproof assets, only Bitcoin,” Edwards wrote. The analyst provides a more detailed rationale in his Capriole Investments newsletter, which has been obtained by NewsBTC. BTC’s fair value, according to the analyst, is derived from Bitcoin’s energy value, which is calculated based solely on the energy expended to secure the network. “A clean, simple equation that values Bitcoin purely on watts of energy used to mine,” Edwards says. Currently, the Bitcoin Energy Value is $42,000, which means BTC is undervalued by 33%. Interestingly, both the price and hashrate have risen sharply since the beginning of the year. Therefore, although Bitcoin has increased by 70% since December, the relative value difference between the price and energy value has only decreased slightly. According to Edwards, BTC is therefore currently undervalued at around $28,000 to the same extent that it was undervalued in December 2022, when the price was trading below $17,000. Related Reading: Data Says Bitcoin Has Begun Its Most Bullish Month Historically Edwards further stated that the current undervaluation phase is similar to the bear market of 2018 where Bitcoin traded below its Energy Value for 285 days. Currently, BTC is already 298 days below its fair price. The fair value of Bitcoin has increased in tandem with price. Bitcoin is worth $42K today based on Energy Value, and has seen a comparable length period of undervaluation to the 2018 lows. Bitcoin Price Surges Due To Organic Demand In the newsletter, Edwards also discusses that Bitcoin’s significant price increase since the lows of the FTX scam in November 2022 has been driven by organic spot buying. Unlike previous rallies driven by speculators in the derivatives market, there is currently a much healthier price appreciation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back Above $28,000, But DXY Spoils Short-Term Outlook The ratio of derivatives to spot volume has never been lower since the widespread adoption of BTC perpetual swaps in 2018, according to Edwards, who draws two bullish conclusions from this. First, the price increase is caused by organic demand; second, “we’re incredibly early in this bull cycle.” At press time, the BTC price was at $28,047. Yesterday, the price briefly plunged by more than $1,000 on the rumor that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao received an Interpol Red Notice, reaching a low of $27,207. The rumor has since been debunked as fake news by the CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange.

VP Bank has tapped Metaco for its Harmonize platform, which it will use to expand its digital asset custody and tokenization services.

VP Banks follows Citibank (C), Societe Generale (GLE), DekaBank and DZ Bank in selecting Metaco to assist with the development of their digital asset services.  Following the collapse of prominent crypto-friendly banks Silvergate and Signature last month, the emergence of traditional finance (TradFi) firms offering similar services with the help of companies like Metaco could provide an alternative.

Paima Studios released this feature for the Cardano blockchain on Monday, developers tweeted. The move is possible because Paima is a layer 2, or an independent network that bundles transactions to a base blockchain for faster speeds and cheaper costs.  Cardano users can play any blockchain-based games without needing to bridge tokens to another network. Paima also supports the migration of games built on other networks to Cardano, allowing users of those networks to play a game based on Cardano without having to move assets.  Bridging refers to transferring tokens between different blockchains. However, bridges carry major security risks and were at the center of some of the biggest exploits in 2022.  As such, Paima said all games on the network are non-custodial, meaning funds remain in the user’s wallets and don’t have to be transferred to the game’s wallets – mitigating security risks.  The release is the latest in a series of network improvements and features for the Cardano blockchain, which may ultimately add value to its ADA tokens.  Last week Milkomeda, another layer 2 network, released a feature that will allow Cardano blockchain users to soon be able to gain access to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts with any ADA wallet.  An Ethereum Virtual Machine is where all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live, serving as a virtual computer used by developers to create decentralized applications, or dapps.  The new feature will allow Ethereum application developers to build on Cardano’s network using Solidity – the computer language used to code Ethereum – without the need to install new toolkits or learn a new computer language, as CoinDesk reported.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/04/cardano-gets-onchain-gaming-boost-as-paima-layer-2-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e4b05c2a332c345b1fe7dcec091456df9cd681b-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin seesaws and then stays below $28K; DOGE soars to its highest levels since December, while other cryptos are mixed.  Insights: Will Indonesia's CBDC offer an alternative to Visa and Mastercard?  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover,our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,205 −1.4 ▼ 0.1% Bitcoin (BTC) $27,804 −191.6 ▼ 0.7% Ethereum (ETH) $1,810 +24.9 ▲ 1.4% S&P 500  4,124.51 +15.2 ▲ 0.4% Gold  $1,999 +29.8 ▲ 1.5% Nikkei 225  28,188.15 +146.7 ▲ 0.5% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin's Seesawing Day  On a day of unverified rumors and soaring DOGE, bitcoin couldn't decide if it liked the air above $28,000 or below.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $27,680, down slightly more than a percentage point over the past 24 hours as investors did what they have done regularly for much of the past few months: make sense of disparate, sometimes unflattering but always interesting information. BTC spent Monday's first few hours (UTC) lingering below $28,000 before rising above the threshold through much of the midday and then tumbling again.  BTC has clung tenaciously to handholds around this level since mid March despite a near banking meltdown that engulfed two crypto-friendly banks, and amid generally more favorable conditions for digital assets. ""The current situation for bitcoin is pretty positive, that's the reality on the ground,"" crypto trader and author Glen Goodman told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program.  Goodman noted that the ""injection of new money into the economy"" as a backstop by a ""panicking"" U.S. Federal Reserve to address the banking crisis boosted investor liquidity for certain stocks and cryptos. ""People are feeling brave enough now with this new liquidity to get back into what they consider big, profitable companies like Microsoft, like Apple and likewise, in the crypto market, they're going for what are considered the safer cryptos, which are bitcoin and [ether].""  Ether was recently trading just over $1,800, up slightly from a day earlier after seesawing above and below this level. Other major cryptos were mixed. Popular meme coin DOGE was an exception to the more modest price shifts as it rose more than 35% to top 10 cents for the first time since December after Elon Musk's Twitter replaced the social-media platform's familiar blue bird atop its homepage with the cryptocurrency's iconic Shiba Inu dog logo (DOGE was recently up 25%). Musk has been an outspoken DOGE advocate, suggesting the meme coin may offer better payments functionality than bitcoin.  Meanwhile, crypto markets were mulling an unverified rumor that an Interpol Red Notice had been issued for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange's founder and CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. “A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action,” according to the Interpol website. Neither Binance nor Interpol responded to a CoinDesk request for comment, although The Block reported the exchange had denied the rumor in an email to the publication. Binance's BNB token was recently down 0.3%.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a measure of crypto markets overall performance, fell 0.6%.  U.S. equity indexes were mixed, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq inching down but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rising – all by a few fractions of a percentage point. In early trading in Asian markets, the Hang Seng fell 0.6% but the Nikkei was up 0.3%.  In a separate interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Coinbase Head of Institutional Research David Duong noted that OPEC's unexpected decision to cut oil production could send inflation higher again, spurring investor interest in bitcoin because of the crypto's ability to hold value.  ""What we've seen from OPEC definitely increases the chances that inflation could actually somewhat spark higher and therefore presents a macro opportunity for bitcoin as well,"" Duong said. ""We've already seen to some extent that bitcoin has been acting as an alternative to the traditional financial system, given what happened with SVB [Silicon Valley Bank] and the turmoil in the banking system.""

American credit card companies have significant control over the world’s commerce pipelines. Indonesia, with tourism playing a significant role in the economy, wants to change that.  Earlier this month, the country’s president, Joko Widodo, better known as Jokowi (many Indonesians only have one name), said he wants the country to lessen its reliance on Visa and Mastercard in the name of national security.  Indonesia is one of the few countries that declined to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Between arms and oil sales, Jokowi has faced difficult choices in navigating relationships with both Russia and the United States, particularly as he must address the need to buy more oil to offset a staggering jump in energy costs as well as an American desire to ally countries in the region together to contain China.  Tourist hotspot Bali, a favorite destination for Russian winter tourists, is feeling the economic pinch of the war despite being tens of thousands of kilometers away from the conflict zone.  “Many Russian tourists who were visiting Bali could not pay for hotels and had to be kicked out of hotels because their credit cards could not be used,"" Erwin Haryono, executive director of communications at Bank Indonesia, said to CNBC Indonesia in March.  Sanctions that Indonesia isn’t a party to prevent Visa and Mastercard from helping settle payments between Russian banks and Indonesian hotels, although the transaction wasn’t in U.S. dollars.  “We have to remember the sanctions from the U.S. to Russia, Visa and Mastercard could be a problem,"" Jokowi said at the opening of the Business Matching of Domestic Products, as cited by CNN Indonesia.  Financial sovereignty  In response, the government has highlighted some domestic alternatives to being completely reliant on foreign payment rails.  Jokowi wants Indonesia to be able to issue financial services such as credit cards independently, and has encouraged local and central governments to promote the use of the Domestic Government Credit Card (Kartu Kredit Pemerintah Domestik) and international Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard (QRIS).  The Domestic Government Credit Card and the International Standard of Indonesian Quick Response Code system were developed by Bank Indonesia under the coordination of Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.  These Domestic Government Credit Card and Indonesian QR code systems are just payment rails, which could process a CBDC like the digital rupiah just as easily as any other fiat-issued currency.  Mir knocked out of orbit  Indonesia isn’t the first country to try to claim some financial sovereignty from Visa and Mastercard’s payment rails.  Russia, at the center of U.S. sanctions, has tried to market its homegrown credit card competitor, Mir (named after the space station), as an alternative to Visa and Mastercard.  But as Bloomberg reported last year, even countries that are friendly to Moscow are wary about allowing their banks to process and settle transactions from the card because of the threat of retaliatory sanctions from the U.S.  Turkey, another popular tourist destination for Russians, but also a NATO member, stopped accepting the card in the middle of 2022. Vietnam, which is seeking to upgrade its relations with the U.S. to counter an aggressive China, had its banks abandon relationships with Mir. Thailand is also out.  Mir is still used in Belarus, Cuba, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Venezuela, and perhaps Iran.  Indonesia's ambassador to Moscow said in January that it was still “considering” the question.  Mir’s failure might give Indonesia a chance to promote its payment networks around ASEAN. Governments and central banks globally, even in countries neutral on the Ukraine war, were no doubt nervous about aligning with Russia – but Indonesia doesn’t have that political baggage.
