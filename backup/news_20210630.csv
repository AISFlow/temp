42406737,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8EZr,1625089614,Cryptocurrencies Are on FinCEN's First 'National Priorities' List,"The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), an agency of the Treasury Department tasked with preventing and punishing money laundering and other financial crimes, has reiterated its longstanding attention to cryptocurrency.      In the agency’s first list of government-wide priorities published Wednesday, FinCEN identified eight priorities: corruption, cybercrime and relevant virtual currency considerations, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational criminal organization activity, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.      So far, the agency’s list of priorities is not connected to any policies. According to FinCEN’s statement, the agency “will issue regulations at a later date that will specify how financial institutions should incorporate these Priorities into their risk-based AML [anti-money-laundering] programs.”      FinCEN has been wrestling with its approach to cryptocurrencies since March 2013, when it issued guidance on how U.S. anti-money-laundering regulations applied to the nascent field.      In late 2020, during the waning days of the Trump administration, the Treasury Department proposed a hotly debated rule that would require crypto exchanges to identify personal wallets making large transactions. Under the Biden administration, FinCEN has not decided whether to finalize that rule, the agency's director, Michael Mosier said in May.      The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), another agency of the Treasury Department, has also made headlines – first in 2016 and again earlier this year – for issuing controversial “John Doe” summons to crypto exchanges for names associated with large transactions.      FinCEN's list of priorities was made in response to last year's National Defense Authorization Act, which included new requirements for the agency's AML work.      The inclusion of virtual currencies and cybercrime in the list also comes in the wake of several high-profile ransomware attacks, like the Colonial Pipeline hack, in which the criminals were paid out in bitcoin (and later reclaimed).      “Treasury is particularly concerned about cyber-enabled financial crime, ransomware attacks, and the misuse of virtual assets that exploits and undermines their innovative potential, including through laundering of illicit proceeds,” FinCEN said in a statement.      FinCEN sees virtual currencies as “a substantial financial innovation,” but says they’re the “preferred form of payment” for a variety of illicit activities including ransomware, illicit drugs, and even “used by some of the highest priority threat actors to advance their illegal activities and nuclear weapons ambitions.”      Read the full document:      UPDATE (July 5, 01:35 UTC): Edits first paragraph to clarify that FinCEN has long paid attention to crypto; adds background in fourth, fifth and seventh paragraphs, replaces former FinCEN director's photo with current acting director's.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/30/cryptocurrencies-are-on-fincens-first-national-priorities-list,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d5b9cec97df61a444af8aaf16fb8445d83b0927-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406756,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8End,1625085838,BlockFi Rate Cut on Bitcoin Deposits Leaves Rivals Scratching Heads,"Crypto lending platform BlockFi is cutting interest rates on a number of crypto asset deposits, just about three months after the company lowered rates in March.      BlockFi says its decision was made based on the changing market dynamics and borrowing demand from institutional investors.      But unlike the last time, other leading top crypto lending desks such as Genesis and Canada-based Ledn are not following BlockFi’s lead move, at least for bitcoin deposits. Some of the executives at the firms are seeing increased borrowing demand compared with the previous quarter, so they need to attract the deposits to lend them out.    An outlier move    BlockFi announced June 25 the lower interest rates on deposits of crypto including bitcoin, ether, chainlink, litecoin and a few others will go into effect July 1. The annual percentage yield (APY) for bitcoin deposits larger than 20 BTC, for example, will go down to 0.25% from 0.5%.      BlockFi, in the announcement, said the decision was made due to “shifting market conditions.”      “Rates on cryptocurrencies held in BIA (BlockFi Interest Account) are primarily driven by demand by institutional investors for borrowing these assets,” Rishi Ramchandani, director of business development at BlockFi in Asia, told CoinDesk in an email response. “When institutional investors demand changes, that affects the rates we can offer our BIA clients.”      Ramchandani said borrowing demand from BlockFi’s clients “continues to be stronger than ever,” but that the tenure of the loans “has gone down” along with the rates.      BlockFi’s decision led to a string of snarky comments on Twitter.      More significantly, other major lending desks told CoinDesk they are not planning to lower their rates in the near future.      “Genesis is not lowering bitcoin rates on July 1, despite BlockFi’s rate reduction,” Matthew Ballensweig, head of institutional lending at Genesis, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Genesis can still pay 2.0% and more with no maximum quantity, as it still sees a robust institutional bitcoin lending market.” Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.      The Canadian crypto lender Ledn will also keep interest rates for bitcoin deposits unchanged, according to an executive at Ledn. Ledn’s APY for bitcoin accounts with at least 2 BTC is 2.25%. Ledn is cutting deposit rates on the stablecoin USDC to 9.5% from 12% starting on July 1.      Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel told CoinDesk via a spokesperson that it is not lowering interest rates for bitcoin deposits. Babel cut rates for tether deposits in May.      All three companies told CoinDesk they are seeing increased bitcoin borrowing demand from clients.      Some traders are betting the premium between spot cryptocurrency prices and futures, which has flattened recently, could widen again. So they’re borrowing bitcoin to short the spot market against a long position in the futures market.      That’s a contrast with the “cash and carry” arbitrage strategy that some traders pursue when futures draw a significant premium to the spot price; in that case, they buy bitcoin and short the futures to bet on a convergence of the two prices when the futures contract matures.      “Given the compression in the near-dated futures and spot basis spread, there are actually more opportunities to deploy bitcoin than last month,” Ballensweig said.      In Genesis’s first-quarter report in 2021, the company cited the wide spreads between bitcoin futures and spot markets as one reason for “lackluster” borrowing demand in the quarter. The company dropped its interest rates in March along with BlockFi.      “Borrowing BTC to short spot and long futures to bet on a widening curve doesn’t make sense when the basis is trading wide,” the report read.      According to data source Skew, bitcoin’s July expiry futures listed on major exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, OKEx, Deribit and Kraken are currently drawing an annualized basis of -20% to 3%.      Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of Ledn, said that a lowered interest rate for USDC helps to reduce the cost of bitcoin-backed loans.      Dan Burke, managing director of institutional sales in Asia-Pacific at BitGo, said decentralized finance (DeFi) offers another source of borrowing demand for bitcoin from institutional clients, who are looking to convert bitcoin to wrapped bitcoin. These “synthetic” versions of bitcoin are configured to run on the Ethereum blockchain, where they can be deployed in DeFi trading and lending protocols for extra returns or yield.      “From our institutional client base, we are seeing quite the opposite” from BlockFi, said Gary Pike, director of sales and trading at B2C2. “This may be because we only deal with institutions whereas BlockFi deals with retail as well.”      BlockFi’s CEO Zac Prince recently said the average balance held in an account on the platform rose fivefold in the past year, with the average balance of a retail client having jumped from $10,000 to $50,000.      “BlockFi largely borrows from retail and lends to institutional,” BitGo’s Burke said. “Some of the other lending platforms are also trading the assets themselves. It’s up to the users to decide what is riskier.”    GBTC in play?    Another possible factor behind BlockFi’s decision is the so-called Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) arbitrage trade, several market participants said.      The Grayscale arbitrage trade refers to a strategy used by investors to borrow bitcoin and deliver those to the trust in exchange for GBTC shares – relevant when the Grayscale trust shares used to trade at a premium to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, which is more closely tied to the value of its assets, or the underlying bitcoin.      After a six-month lockup, the shares could be sold in the secondary market to retail investors at a premium. After paying back the lender for the borrowed BTC, the investors would take the rest for profit. (Grayscale is also owned by DCG, CoinDesk’s parent company.).      As CoinDesk reported, BlockFi was one of the biggest GBTC holders as of February, when the company revealed that it holds $1.7 billion in shares of GBTC, about 5.66% of the total outstanding.      Max Boonen, director and founder of B2C2, said in a recent interview with New Money Review that some firms had taken advantage of the GBTC arbitrage trade in order to offer attractive interest rates on crypto deposits.      “They could borrow bitcoin from their clients (with or without collateral), put the bitcoin into GBTC, hold the GBTC shares for the six-month lock-up period, then sell them on the secondary market with a premium attached,” Boonen said.      At press time, GBTC shares are trading at a discount to the NAV, so the Grayscale carry trade has lost its charm.      The arbitrage trade “used to be a cash cow when GBTC was trading at a large premium,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Los Angeles-based Arca.      BlockFi did not immediately respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment about GBTC trading.      On its Terms of Service page, BlockFi tells depositors:    “Except where prohibited or limited by applicable law, in consideration for the cryptocurrency earned on your account, you grant BlockFi the right, without further notice to you, to hold the cryptocurrency held in your account in BlockFi’s name or in another name, and to pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend, or otherwise transfer, invest or use any amount of such cryptocurrency, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership, and for any period of time and without retaining in BlockFi’s possession and/or control a like amount of cryptocurrency, and to use or invest such cryptocurrency at its own risk.”- BlockFi Terms of Service    BlockFi raised $350 million in a Series D funding round in March and there have been rumors it is raising another round of funds worth several hundred million dollars at a valuation near $5 billion.      Dorman speculated the additional funds might serve “until revenue opportunities return.”      BlockFi declined to comment on the new funding round. But Andrew Tam, chief marketing officer at BlockFi, told CoinDesk his company is “on track” to exceed its $500 million revenue goal for 2021.      “BlockFi’s business is healthier than ever,” Tam said.      The company has faced challenges as it grows. Most recently, it incorrectly deposited to users’ accounts as part of a botched round of promotional payments. Instead of rewarding users with the stablecoin gemini dollar (GUSD) as planned, it sent BTC, sometimes millions of dollars' worth, to certain users. In March, the platform was attacked with fake sign-ups and abusive language on its web page.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/30/blockfi-rate-cut-on-bitcoin-deposits-leaves-rivals-scratching-heads,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42406758,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Eoc,1625085055,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Outperforms Top Cryptocurrencies in June,"Bitcoin traded lower on Wednesday as traders took profits into the June close. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is on track for a record second-quarter price drop of 41%, snapping a four-quarter winning streak that saw prices chart a sixfold rise to almost $65,000 in April.      The crypto sell-off over the past quarter was triggered by regulatory crackdowns, concerns about tighter monetary policy, environmental issues and a slowdown in institutional demand. Selling stabilized in June, leaving bitcoin in a tight range of between $30,000 and $40,000.      Bitcoin was trading at around $34,000 at press time and is down about 4% over the past 24 hours.      “Price swings reinforce the idea that volatility is a fundamental part of a nascent and expanding market,” Steve Ehrlich, CEO of crypto exchange Voyager Digital, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Investors are still buying the dip.”    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $34962.8, -3.92%  Ether (ETH) $2274.5, +2.31%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4300.4, +0.2%  Gold: $1769.5, +0.5%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.458%, compared with 1.473% on Tuesday  Relative performance in June    Bitcoin outperformed other large market-cap cryptocurrencies in June with a decline of 2.7%, versus declines of more than 30% in XRP, EOS and LINK.      The decline in altcoins stabilized bitcoin’s dominance ratio, or relative market share, at around 45%. There are signs, however, that altcoin demand has risen in recent weeks.      “While bitcoin remains in our top weekly net buys, we are seeing other altcoins gaining popularity in the wake of its dip, including SHIB and ETH which took the top two spots for the week,” Ehrlich wrote.      Bitcoin and ether volatility remains elevated, albeit lower than January 2020 highs. While both cryptocurrencies have experienced extreme volatile swings over the past year, traditional markets have remained relatively calm.    Bitcoin options probability    The bitcoin options market sees a 65% chance of price remaining above $20,000 by the end of the year. And there is a 20% chance that bitcoin will return above $50,000 according to options data provider Skew.      Bitcoin technicals are also improving as signs of downside exhaustion appeared on the charts last week, according to DeMark Indicators. That suggests buyers could remain active above $30,000 support over the intermediate term.    Lower returns following 'death cross'    Bitcoin registered a “death cross” when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average on June 19. Typically, a death cross signals a shift from a bullish to bearish trend and occurs after an initial price sell-off.      Returns following a death cross event can vary and tend to be low to negative. “We conclude that [the death cross] is not a consistent downside price predictor over 1, 3, 6 and 12 month periods,” tweeted CoinShares on June 22.    Bitcoin hashrate stabilizes    The Bitcoin hashrate has stabilized after falling for 10 straight days, and industry experts are speculating that the worst fallout from China’s recent mining crackdown might be over.      Bitcoin’s seven-day average hashrate stood at 90.6 exahashes per second on Tuesday, up slightly from 90.5 EH/s on Monday. The number is still down by roughly half from the peak rate reached in mid-May, according to data from Glassnode.      The majority of the reduction stemmed from China’s move to shut down cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, with a little bit from Iran, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform.      “We believe there isn’t much active hashrate left in China,” Doctor said in an email to CoinDesk.    Altcoin roundup  Ethererum mining: The balances of Ethereum 2.0 validators range wildly from 30 ETH to 65 ETH. The main reason for the extreme disparity is not because some validators are more profitable than others or because some validators started earning rewards on the network earlier than others. Roughly 168 validators out of 178,000 simply deposited their minimum stake of 32 ETH twice, by accident, CoinDesk's Christine Kim explained.  USDC expansion: USDC, the stablecoin now native to four blockchains, could soon be on eight to 10 more networks, CoinDesk has learned. That would be the broadest expansion of the $25 billion stablecoin to date, potentially surpassing the eight blockchains that support Tether’s USDT, the market leader with a $63 billion market cap.

42406749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Eii,1625084099,Gaze Into the Orb to Collect Your Worldcoin,"Sam Altman, former head of premier tech startup incubator Y Combinator, is starting his own cryptocurrency. The token will be called worldcoin and, according to new reporting by Bloomberg, you have to let the project scan your retina print to use the system.      Yeah, spoiler alert, it’s not great.      The core motivation for the Worldcoin project seems admirable: Altman says he was inspired by the concept of universal basic income (UBI), and wanted to use cryptocurrency to distribute funds equitably worldwide. The whole eyeball-scanning thing is Worldcoin’s solution to connecting real-world identities to system accounts reliably, so that no one can claim multiple accounts.      There’s also something to like about the basic idea. Early in the coronavirus pandemic, I wrote at length about the absurd slowness of the U.S. relief-check distribution, and advocated for some sort of federally managed direct payment system for use in future emergencies.      So why not do the same thing on a global scale, in a way that doesn’t involve government systems? That’s appealing not just out of government-agnostic principle, but because there are plenty of stateless or undocumented people in the world who wouldn’t be able to access a government-based direct payments system.      Based on what we know so far, Altman and the Worldcoin team seem to have hit on a way to make this appealing premise seem utterly dystopian. Users who want a Worldcoin account will have to register by scanning their unique retina pattern with an “orb” device that in its current form is the size of a basketball and costs $5,000 to make, according to Bloomberg.      This points to serious practical problems with the company’s plans, but let’s start with the larger issue – privacy. The thing about a retina print is that you can’t change it, so once it’s compromised that form of identity verification is invalid for you, forever. That makes it spectacularly and inherently risky for a private company to gather this kind of biometric data about everyone on Earth. Frankly, there’s a strong argument that it should be illegal until we have better data regulations in place (yes, I’m looking at you, Clear).      (Side note: If you’re starting a company that harvests data from people’s eyeballs in ways that could threaten privacy, don’t refer to your scanning device as an “orb.” It strongly implies the Eye of Sauron, Foucault’s Panopticon, the Saudi Intelligence Orb, Saruman’s palantir, and the for-profit spy firm named after it. In short, it’s creepy as hell. Sam, you can send my comms consulting fee via CoinDesk.)      Now, to its credit, Worldcoin has already said it won’t store iris scans as raw data, instead converting images into a “unique numerical code,” according to Bloomberg, and deleting source data. I take that to indicate some kind of hashing, similar to the transaction-batch hashes that link Bitcoin blocks.      But that leaves too many open questions. Most specifically, if Worldcoin moves its retina scans to a central server for hashing, it’s still far too risky to be justifiable, because data could be intercepted or stolen in the process. On-device hashing shouldn’t be incredibly computationally intensive, and the size and cost of the Worldcoin “orb” suggests that may be the plan. But it also seems likely that the device would be internet-connected, which would still leave it potentially vulnerable.      Let’s move on to the practical problems. Even if Worldcoin gets the cost and size of its scanner way down, the necessity of any device at all is a massive barrier to connecting billions of unbanked people around the world to the financial system. Who’s going to do the work of lugging a delicate metal basketball into the far reaches of the Serengeti to make sure everyone gets their worldcoin? How many of those devices would need to be deployed, with how many operators, to reach even a fraction of the world’s population in any sort of reasonable time frame?      More importantly, why is this worth doing when all of those people can simply create a Bitcoin wallet themselves, without having to trust some skinny American not to sell their eyeball-print to the highest bidder?      Of course, opening a bitcoin wallet doesn’t get you free money from Sam Altman, but the presence of a financial incentive is, if anything, more troubling: the Worldcoin proposal appears dangerously similar to bribing the global poor to compromise their privacy. Worldcoin says it’s necessary to prevent people from registering multiple times and defrauding the system, presumably by claiming multiple instances of the UBI payments Altman wants to enable. But that doesn’t come remotely close to justifying risking 8 billion people’s biometric data, with potentially serious lifelong consequences if it leaks even once.      There’s much more that could be said about Worldcoin, including that attaching real-world identities runs counter to the basic use cases for blockchain architecture, and that it could amount to an attack on Bitcoin. There’s also already a crypto called worldcoin (WDC), which is creating some issues: that totally unrelated and near-dead project has been pumping on speculator confusion over the Altman news. Altman’s worldcoin has not launched yet.      So, there are concerns. To be fair, Bloomberg broke the news about Altman’s Worldcoin before the company planned to exit stealth mode, so a lot could (and hopefully will) change before launch. But it’s hard to look at these ideas and hold out much hope the end product will be anything but extremely worrisome.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | WLD,David Z.

42406753,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf8Eme,1625083728,China Crypto Crackdown: Calendar Offers Clue as to 'Why Now?',"China recently cracked down on bitcoin, again. The question is: Why now?      The calendar may provide a clue. Thursday is July 1, the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. It is at least plausible that Chinese authorities would send a strong warning to the crypto industry in the weeks leading up to this big day.      This theory is already circulating around Chinese crypto circles, at least privately. But those familiar with China will recognize the tense solemnity that leads up to these kinds of events, which may be accompanied by crackdowns on activity that the government views as a threat to shehui wending, or social stability. Cryptocurrency appears to fit into that category.      “The greater context is that China has had enough,” said Bobby Lee, former CEO of early bitcoin exchange BTCC and now CEO of wallet service Ballet and author of ""The Promise of Bitcoin."" “China has seen a lot of fraud, illegal fundraising and people losing money on trading.”      “When people lose their money in a market crash, it causes social unhappiness, and that can cause political unrest,” Lee said.      According to Lee, the crackdown’s timing is not accidental. “July 1 is the 100-year anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. It’s a pride thing. They want to clean up the mess before July 1.” Lee likened it to having to tidy up your bedroom before your father’s birthday party.      The anniversary is a tightly choreographed event in which disruptions are clearly not welcome. The recent crackdown includes shutting down mining and instructing banks to stay away from crypto. China’s moves sent bitcoin’s price plummeting, at least temporarily. The last time China really spooked the global crypto market was in 2017, when it shut down exchanges and banned initial coin offerings. It’s worth noting that China ordered exchanges to shut down in September of that year, shortly before National Day on Oct. 1, which marks the founding of the People’s Republic of China.    ‘Protector of society’    This phenomenon is not limited to crypto. In 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported on authorities intervening to keep the stock market steady in the lead-up to the National People’s Congress. One investor told the WSJ his broker told him the Shenzhen stock exchange had deemed his transactions too “disruptive” during a politically sensitive time.      “The word from the exchange was that my trades were too large and too frequent, and I was told it was all because of the National People’s Congress,” the investor said.      The crypto market is notoriously volatile and vulnerable to scams, and Chinese retail investors have been burned by new, unstable industries. The 2018 collapse of the peer-to-peer lending market led to massive financial losses, protests and even death.      “Crypto has grown relatively rapidly in China, it could grow even more,” said Zennon Kapron, founder of Kapronasia, a fintech research and consulting firm. One of the lessons authorities learned from the P2P lending crisis is that “they didn’t stop it soon enough,” Kapron said. “Many retail investors lost a significant amount of money.”      There is another reason why the government might be so concerned about the plight of retail investors. In countries like the U.S., generally speaking, individual investors wouldn’t necessarily fault the government for their losses. This isn’t the case in China, at least according to Lee.      “When people in China lose money, they blame the government. The government serves the role of a protector of society. Government’s role is to make sure everything is orderly and safe. Anything that goes wrong, it’s the government’s role to fix it.”      Which brings us back to social stability. The last thing the Chinese government needs is for a flash-in-the-pan coin to implode, leading angry investors to take to the streets. Mass protests of any kind, whether against the government, a crypto project or an exchange, represent just the kind of unrest that Beijing wants to avoid, especially before a high-profile political event.    Capital controls    But while July 1 may help explain the timing of the crypto crackdown, it’s not the only reason for it. Key political dates may largely serve as catalysts for actions that the government is already contemplating.      Yifan He, CEO of Red Date Tech and executive director of BSN, China’s government-supported blockchain project, believes capital controls are a key factor in the crackdown. China only allows individuals to move a maximum of $50,000 out of the country each year, and cryptocurrency could help people circumvent that restriction.      He said one reason China can print money without creating major inflation is because it has foreign reserves of over $3 trillion. “If a lot of people are moving money outside China, that actually has an impact on the reserve.”      Another key timing factor may be the bull market of 2021, during which bitcoin continuously soared to new highs. “More and more Chinese people get involved in crypto trading, so it becomes a threat to the government,” He said. The main reason for the crackdown, He said, is “the rapid growth of the total users of cryptocurrency in China in the past 6 months.”      He said that while China’s stance on crypto has not really changed, the actions are stronger this time. “All the mining will be gone. No exception. So basically the entire crypto mining industry is gone from China.”      So what happens after July 1? Perhaps the atmosphere will become more relaxed, at least until the next major holiday. But some would argue that over the long term it doesn’t really matter. China’s 2017 crypto crackdown sparked a brief price crash, but it was followed by a bull run. The market has only grown exponentially since then.      “If China shut down all of its mining, bitcoin will continue,” Lee said. “That will prove bitcoin is resilient. The more stress tests we go through, the more trust people have in the system.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Emily Parker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/30/china-crypto-crackdown-calendar-offers-clue-as-to-why-now,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ca91607291cee8f239e261f6c624f341b38c26a4-2122x1412.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434704,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsj9h,1625077714,"Bitcoin Options Open Interest Hits 2021 Low as Frenzy Cools, or Maybe It's Soccer","The bitcoin options-trading boom that saw traders make ambitious bullish bets early this year has cooled in the wake of the recent price sell-off and subsequent consolidation.      ""After the large June expiry, open interest has dropped to levels last seen at the end of 2020,"" Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, the world's largest options exchange by open interest and trading volume, said. ""Open interest and volume have declined in both the dollar and bitcoin terms in recent weeks due to overall bearish sentiment caused by China's regulatory crackdown and other factors.""      Open interest in bitcoin options listed on Deribit, or the number of open positions, fell to almost 120,000 BTC on Monday, the lowest level since October. The tally peaked near 250,000 BTC in late March. On Deribit, one option contract represents one BTC.      The nominal value has more than halved to $4 billion, also the lowest since late 2020. Other exchanges like OKEx, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), LedgerX, Huobi, bit.com and Huobi have registered a similar drop in open interest.      Open interest reached a record high of nearly $15 billion during the height of the bull market in mid-April and has been falling since in nominal and bitcoin terms. The cryptocurrency peaked above $64,800 in mid-April and recently hit five-month lows below $30,000.      The data highlights that though options are mainly hedging instruments, they were widely used for speculation during the bull run.      ""This is more like a correction in the open interest just like there has been a correction in bitcoin's price,"" Martin Cheung, an options trader from Pulsar Trading Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. ""Price volatility has come off sharply, so we are now seeing less demand for options, which are hedging instruments.""      Bitcoin's one-month implied volatility has declined to near 90% from the high of 153% observed on May 23, according to data firm Skew.      Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin, at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, and a put option gives the right to sell.      Traders often take upside (calls) or downside (puts) protection based on their spot or futures market exposure when price turbulence is high. When volatility drops, however, the existing hedges are often squared off, and traders are less likely to take new hedges.    Hedging, or speculation    Often, particularly during a strong bull or bear run, options are used for speculation. For instance, traders piled into the deep out-of-the-money (OTM) call option at $80,000 strike in March and April in hopes that the rally would continue through the seasonally strong second quarter. That lifted open interest.      However, the cryptocurrency crashed in May and has been restricted mainly to a range of $30,000 to $40,000 this month. The downdraft may have forced traders to reassess their bullish expectations.      ""When markets become range bound, there is less demand for hedging,"" Shilliang Tang, chief investment officer of LedgerPrime, a $130 million crypto hedge fund, said in a Telegram chat. ""Also, there is less call buying as funds adjust expectations amid consolidation and absence of a V-shaped recovery.""      LedgerPrime bought deep OTM calls in the first quarter as the bullish momentum was quite strong and switched to ""carry trading"" – buying spot and shorting futures – in the second quarter. As of last week, its quant fund was up 78% year to date, versus bitcoin's 22% gain.      Also read: How One Fund Used the Carry Trade to Beat Bitcoin      According to some observers, the slowdown in the options market is a sign the price sell-off has crowded out a significant chunk of retail participation.      ""It's likely those new to crypto are licking their wounds now, and with no strong market narrative except the potential ether fork,” Chris Dick, a quant trader at B2C2, said in a Telegram chat. “There is little catalyst for retail to re-enter the market.""    Soccer absorbing the attention    According to Gary Pike, a trader at B2C2, retail traders with holdings under water may be less inclined to take additional risk, especially with summer in full swing and the distraction of sports.      “Soccer tournaments are continuing worldwide and drawing more attention away from retail crypto trading,"" Pike said, adding that he’s confident that activity will pick up.      ""The catalyst will come, and volumes will return to exchanges, if not from an event, then due to traditional players resuming after the summer break,"" Dick said.      While retail activity may have cooled, institutional participation on Deribit remains strong.      ""We are seeing growing interest in institutional on-boarding and a pickup in block trading volumes,"" Deribit's Strijers said, adding that it shows institutional demand is still strong. A block trade is the one involving large number of securities and is negotiated privately over the counter or outside of the open market for that security.      According to LedgerPrime's Tang, there is still ample demand from options yield generation/harvesting strategies, which seek to benefit from a prolonged price consolidation.

42434697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsivh,1625076341,Why I'm Skeptical of FATF's 'Extreme Right Wing' Watch,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering group, is keeping watch on “extreme right wing” (ERW) activity. In a new report, the U.S. Treasury-backed agency looked at how ethnically or racially motivated acts of terrorism are finding funding.      What it found, and defined, was a nebulous group of actors ranging from lone wolves to small organizations to international movements using an equally diverse set of mechanisms to finance their hate campaigns.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    “Notably, most of the funding for ERW groups appears to come from licit sources,” the FATF wrote. This includes crowdfunding, cryptocurrencies and commercial operations like buying real estate or hosting music festivals, among other sources of cash flow. “Successful disruption of ERW groups and individuals, and their violent activities, requires an understanding of how they are financed,” it said.      Indeed. Racially and ethnically motivated hate campaigns are among the most vile, contemptible and loathsome acts imaginable. And an understanding of how a rising trend of hate crimes is financed and propagated would only help.      But I would still caution skepticism when reading the FATF's report. The term “extreme right wing terrorism” (ERWT) covers a lot of ground in a paper short on detail. There’s no indication of how much money is being raised, how it’s spent or by whom. There’s no solid definition of what constitutes terrorism or the right wing. There were also few proposed solutions at this point from an agency that has often looked to increase surveillance.      “There is limited information on how ERW groups move their funds,” FATF wrote.      Throughout the 45-page document are examples of individuals or organizations – like convicted Norweigen terrorist Anders Behring Breivik, who killed eight people by detonating a van bomb, and Atomwaffen, a known neo-Nazi group – that showcase how certain payment mechanisms are utilized.      But scattered throughout the document are also statements like:    “The vast majority of ERW-motivated attacks in recent history have been perpetrated by self-funded individuals (so called lone-actor attacks), rarely involving complex organisation and weapons.""  “As expenses for these attacks are low, and do not differ from normal transactions, there are often few or no red flags in the financial system and most useful financial information is only discovered through police investigations after an attack has taken place.""  “This is partly because some ERW groups are not considered illegal and as such financial transactions associated with them or their members are not monitored.""  “Authorities may see these attacks as having fewer opportunities for financial disruption and place less importance on the financial investigation associated with these attacks.”    Those state that right-wing terrorism, as FATF defines it, is primarily committed at the individual level and financed through means familiar to us all. But it suggests that a more granular level of financial scrutiny might be called for.      Evidence of some of the most loathsome individuals crowdfunding donations, dropping links to their BTC wallets or soliciting funds over Telegram should not be grounds for further surveillance of these networks, which are primarily used by everyday people for everyday things.    Read more: DeFi Is Not TradFi: Why FATF’s Guidance Would Stifle Growth | Rebecca Rettig    In one section, FATF outlined further considerations, noting that not all jurisdictions “classify violent activity by ERW individuals or groups as terrorism” and that not all their activities rise to the level of a crime. While Atomwaffen may raise funds by selling merchandise online, that is an act of political speech under U.S. laws.      There was a time when civil liberties organizations fought for the right of the Worst to march, speak and organize, knowing that an encroachment on one group could be used against another (perhaps one you agree with).

42434702,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsj7h,1625075902,"There's a 'Clearance Sale' on Bitcoin, but Institutions Aren't Rushing In","At the beginning of the year, the dominant narrative permeating cryptocurrency markets was that institutions were going to add large swaths of bitcoin to their assets. Big, established investors from hedge funds to Wall Street mainstays and blue-chip companies would be quick to jump on the bandwagon.      Now, as bitcoin (BTC) trades close to half of the all-time high of almost $65,000 reached in April, things are starting to look slightly different: Despite what looks like a clearance sale on the cryptocurrency, data shows that institutions have shown a reluctance to take advantage of the bargain, apparently rattled by the same concerns that have pushed prices down.      Bitcoin “whale” addresses – those holding 1,000 BTC or more – tumbled to about 2,150 in May from almost 2,500 in February, according to the blockchain-analysis firm Coin Metrics. Since then, the number has languished around that lower level.      Glassnode, another blockchain analysis firm, noted in a report on Monday that a stagnation in the balance of bitcoins held on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase offers another view of the same dynamic.    Read more: More Energy-Efficient Blockchains Are Possible. Here’s How    CoinDesk reported last week that open positions in bitcoin futures had tumbled by 59% from an April 13 peak, an indication that institutional investors are being cautious.      “Institutional demand appears to remain somewhat lackluster,” Glassnode wrote in its Monday report.      The latest data might show why bitcoin has been stuck between $30,000 and $40,000 for the past month, after prices had risen over the past year partly on the expectation that a wave of new buyers was set to come in.      Signs continue to mount that institutions are preparing to pounce: The likes of BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are on the list of traditional financial institutions that have set up bitcoin funds and services in the past few months or that have acknowledged considering a move into cryptocurrency. On Tuesday, financial services firm TP ICAP announced it is launching a crypto-trading platform alongside the financial heavyweights Fidelity Investments and Standard Chartered.      But nagging concerns over bitcoin’s potential environmental harm, a regulatory crackdown on bitcoin trading and mining in China and, more recently, a decline in the underlying blockchain network’s computational power appear to have given big investors pause.      Another worry is the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten its monetary policy in an effort to fight inflation. The prospect of fast-rising consumer prices after trillions of dollars of central bank stimulus had been a key source of demand for bitcoin, because the cryptocurrency, with its hard-coded limits on new issuance, has been cast as a steady bulwark against dollar debasement.      Cryptocurrency industry executives say they see few signs that investors are going away or liquidating en masse:    “Despite there being a sign in the recent bear market that investors are scared off, we don’t see massive outflow from institutional users,” said Lennix Lai, director of financial markets at the cryptocurrency exchange OKEx.  “We speak to institutional investors every day. They are still allocating funds, in record sizes,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, a cryptocurrency investment firm.  “We are on-boarding a large group of institutional firms, various hedge funds and asset managers. We see the level of interest from the traditional finance space only increasing,” said Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, a crypto derivatives trading platform.  Companies slow to follow MicroStrategy’s lead    Then there are the corporations.      At the beginning of the year, MicroStrategy was the first U.S. corporation to invest its dollarized treasury in bitcoin, and CEO Michael Saylor has since been viewed as an influential presence to emerge from corporate America among the bitcoin community.      MicroStrategy’s investment kindled speculation that other big companies might follow suit. Guesses at the time pointed to Twitter, Tesla, Apple, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and even the burger chain Wendy’s.      MicroStrategy has kept up its buying, saying earlier this month that it is borrowing $500 million to purchase more bitcoin. And some small companies are still “active” in moving toward bitcoin, said John Todaro, vice president of crypto asset and blockchain research at Needham & Co.      But few additional big corporate buyers have materialized.      Bitcoin adoption announcements have “appeared to slow for larger companies,” Todaro said.

Bitcoin’s seven-day average hashrate stood at 90.6 EH/s on Tuesday, up slightly from 90.5 EH/s on Monday. The number is still down by roughly half from the peak rate reached in mid-May, according to data from Glassnode.      The majority of the reduction stemmed from China's move to shut down cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, with a little bit from Iran, according to Sam Doctor, chief strategy officer at BitOoda, a digital asset financial services platform.      “We believe there isn’t much active hashrate left in China,” Doctor said in an email to CoinDesk. ""What is left is probably not mining openly, and may continue until either they get shut down or they can get equipment out of China and find an alternative place to move them.""      Meanwhile, the mean block time for bitcoin, which measures the length of time it takes to create a new block, has fallen back to 16 minutes, after it surged to 23 minutes on Sunday, the highest level since 2010, according to Glassnode.      Though block time fluctuates naturally, the rise in block time could be a result of Chinese miners shutting down their current operations, according to several mining sites. As the hash power declines, it takes longer for miners to solve the puzzles and create a new block.      Bitcoin, which is designed to have a target block time of 10 minutes, will see its difficulty level reduced when the block times are greater than expected.

This is the first time in decades the city has used ranked-choice voting, in which New Yorkers may vote for multiple candidates, ranked by preference, rather than just one.    How prediction markets work    In prediction markets, investors bet on the outcomes of real-world events, from elections to sports matches.      Proponents tout these markets as a way to induce experts to express what they really think will happen, since there is money on the line, at a time when public trust in pundits and other authorities is eroding.      Whoever wins the Democratic primary will face Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, best known for leading the 1980s vigilante group Guardian Angels, in the general election on Nov. 2.      On PredictIt, Sliwa shares are trading at 3 cents, speaking to New York's strongly Democratic voter advantage. Former Sanitation Department official Kathryn Garcia is trading at 46 cents.

42434699,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsj1h,1625069139,Decentralized Investing Platform Syndicate Raises $800K From 100 Investors,"Decentralized investing platform Syndicate is decentralizing its investor base.      Some 100 investors have pitched in a total of $800,000 in a funding round that includes some of the biggest names in crypto – Balaji Srinivasan, Jeremy Allaire, Meltem Demirors and dozens more. Earlier this year, the platform raised $1 million in a seed round led by IDEO CoLab Ventures.      “Syndicate’s community raise is an important first step in democratizing our own platform and making Syndicate community-owned,” co-founders Will Papper and Ian Lee wrote.      The platform, which is still in private beta, aims to democratize investing by making it easier for people to spin up decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). DAOs are basically shared bank accounts on the blockchain with tools meant to facilitate group decision-making.      So far, Syndicate has launched six DAOs, including Audacity and the Komorebi Collective, which both provide venture capital to underrepresented founders in the crypto space.      Syndicate’s small but mighty approach to fundraising stands in stark contrast to the ongoing wave of institutional investment in decentralized finance (DeFi). It also speaks to the growing momentum of DAOs in the DeFi ecosystem.    DAO dogfooding    The community raise was done through a special-purpose DAO on Syndicate’s platform. Lee confirmed the investments were equity investments in Syndicate.      Lee told CoinDesk in an interview that the round was capped at 100 investors who were invited to invest after being a part of the Syndicate community for months. Contributors to the fund included notable crypto investors, entrepreneurs, professors and even a WallStreetBets moderator. (Note: It also included former CoinDesk writer Joon Ian Wong and Nathaniel Whittemore, host of CoinDesk’s ""The Breakdown"" podcast.)      “Syndicate is such a cool project because it gets us closer to a world of truly decentralized finance,” Wong told CoinDesk via Telegram. “It’s unlocking new ways for people to back the projects they truly care about.”      Lee said Syndicate’s investors also include members of the organization’s Discord group that previously purchased non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to commemorate the launch of various Syndicate DAOs. Some of these NFTs were purchased for as little as $100, which Lee said was important to the company to ensure equitable access to investing in Syndicate.      “We believe that investing is really, really powerful. It shapes what gets built in the world, by whom, and for whom, and where. At the same time, existing investment structures and models reinforce, in our opinion, inequality,” Lee told CoinDesk, adding:    “To solve that, we need to democratize that investment capability.

42434708,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsjDh,1625068254,'They'd Rather Buy Bitcoin and Take That Risk': An Interview With Paxful's Nena Nwachukwu,"In October, police corruption in Nigeria hit a low point when reports surfaced of a special anti-robbery squad (SARS) officer allegedly killing a young boy. Weeklong protests across the country followed.      The authorities tried to suppress the protests by freezing the organizers’ bank accounts. But bitcoin came to the rescue.      While authorities certainly were able to shut the protesters from sending and receiving nairas, they also underestimated people’s confidence in cryptocurrency and encouraged many to use bitcoin for the first time.    Nena Nwachukwu will speak at CoinDesk's Crypto State event, in Lagos, on July 8.    Nena Nwachukwu, the Nigeria regional manager at Paxful since 2020, is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency industry in Nigeria. Paxful is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace that allows buyers and sellers to meet with each other and exchange different cryptocurrencies on nearly 400 payment options. According to data shared with CoinDesk in January, Nigeria is Paxful’s biggest market, making the country a key player in the crypto industry.    Read more: Africa ‘Is Leading Global Cryptocurrency Adoption’: Paxful CEO    Right now, the company offers bitcoin, ethereum and the stablecoin tether. Nwachukwu joined Paxful last year after working for Chinese cryptocurrency trading platform Huobi in Dubai, where she was responsible for the company’s expansion to the Middle East and Africa. At Paxful, she focuses on business operations and developing new products while also managing accounts of VIP clients.      Nwachukwu, who will be speaking at CoinDesk’s Crypto State event on July 8, discusses Nigeria’s significant uptake in crypto adoption and entrepreneurship, which has made the country one of the biggest adapters of the cryptocurrency in the world, according to Statista.      The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.      CoinDesk: Nigeria is the leader in crypto trading. How did the crypto adoption in Nigeria evolve?      Nena Nwachukwu: When crypto first got popular in Nigeria, prior to October 2020, a lot of people had heard about cryptocurrency or bitcoin, but nobody really knew or cared about what it was – just a few select people who were tech savvy. In Nigeria, we’ve got a lot of economic and regulatory issues and unemployment and people have always been interested in finding an alternative source of income.      What was the main event that steered people towards crypto?      Bitcoin happened in 2020, during the police brutality protest, when the government stopped the organizers from accepting donations with their bank accounts, which led promoters to using cryptocurrency and bitcoin as a payment. That was the main game changer because that protest went on for about two weeks. People were talking about how organizers would pay for medical emergencies or how they would pay for those who are on the front, protesting all day, all night. Bitcoin got very popular because it came into the discussion. Now, almost everybody in Nigeria, even my Mom and my Dad, who never cared about what I did, are asking questions about bitcoin.    They’d rather buy bitcoin and take that risk.  Read more: Nigeria Protests Show Bitcoin Adoption Is Not Coming: It’s Here    Is cryptocurrency in Nigeria a way to escape poverty and unemployment?      I wouldn’t say people use it to escape poverty, because a lot of people that are into cryptocurrency already have the basic access to tools. However, what it has done is it enables financial empowerment, and one of the ways to do that is by cryptocurrency trading.      People don’t only trade within the country. They also trade across borders with other African countries. We find a lot of Nigerian traders trading with Kenyan, Chinese or Americans. One of the ways that a first analysis shows cryptocurrencies have helped people in Nigeria is cross-border payments. There is a lot of capital control in Nigeria. When you use your debit or credit card, you can’t spend more than $400 a day on an e-commerce platform outside of Nigeria. That’s a big challenge.      Cryptocurrency has enabled this. You find a lot of business people, traders and small businesses who mostly import their goods from countries outside of Africa, which is very difficult, make payments or pay their suppliers with cryptocurrency. Nigeria also has a very large brown community that needs to send money home, and you find a lot of them starting to use cryptocurrency, too.      Then, like everywhere else in the world, people use it for speculating, or for investments. There are also crypto enthusiasts who trade off the difference in currency prices. Of course, some of those use it for hedging because the naira [Nigeria’s currency] has been devalued several times since last year and right now, $1 is equivalent to [about 411 naira], which is extremely high. So you find people buying cryptocurrency as a way to store the value of their wealth versus losing it every day [if it is stored in naira]. They’d rather buy bitcoin and take that risk.      In February this year, Nigeria’s central bank imposed a ban that prevents financial intermediaries from processing transactions for crypto exchanges. What happened there?      That’s an interesting question, which at first we did not like to talk about but now thankfully the central bank clarified the position. When the news first broke out earlier this year, the trending topic was that the central bank banned cryptocurrency trading. However, they came back to clarify that cryptocurrency was not banned because they knew they cannot track the currency. Banks and nonbank financial institutions were stopped from supporting cryptocurrency payment companies, so if a cryptocurrency business wants a bank account, they’re not allowed to own that bank account anymore. But the central bank has clarified that they’re not stopping trading.    Read more: Nigeria’s Central Bank: We Didn’t Ban Crypto Trading    So, how has this changed people’s behavior around crypto?      When something like this happens, one would think people would stop trading cryptocurrency, but it actually got more people interested. It kind of works in a reverse way here. When the government bans something, it gets people more curious. After the ban was enforced, we saw a lot of interest. In fact, trading [on Paxful from February to March 2021] increased by about 23% after the ban. Trading itself was not banned, so now there are even more people [in the bitcoin movement]. People are also looking at dogecoin, which is always trending on Twitter around here. Trading hasn’t slowed down at all, and I don’t think it’s going to anytime soon because, again, the naira is devaluing and people are very interested in preserving the value of their wealth.    My only concern is that our government and regulators will be left behind if they don’t find a middle ground to work with everyone.    Could there be a way to work together with the government?      We will always be open to liaising with the government because we do understand their concerns and that they’re trying to protect the economy, which is their job and which is what central banks exist for. In fact, we’ve been in dialogue with the central bank along with the FinTech Association of Nigeria to hear them out about new proposed solutions, what their concerns are, etcetera. We’re happy to work with them and to find a middle ground because at the end of the day, banks are losing money (if people stop dealing naira and instead, trade in bitcoin.)      Nigerian authorities say that part of the reason why crypto was banned is because it could be used to finance terrorism. Is that a valid thought?      Terrorism existed before crypto. I don’t entirely agree that it’s a valid thought. I do see what they mean because by the nature of cryptocurrency, it’s anonymous, but we can actually track cryptocurrency transactions. Anyone who is trading on a crypto platform has to register. For Paxful, you have to provide proof of address and we have to verify it, so, technically, it’s not anonymous.      What’s the long-term impact of the government’s stance?      My only concern is that with this ban in place, our government won’t be able to take advantage of the opportunities that cryptocurrency presents, like El Salvador does. But as for adoption, I don’t see any dangers. So far, it has actually been good for us because with the many restrictions we have with international payments, it has eased the pain a little bit, and long term, I see more adoption coming on. My only concern is that our government and regulators will be left behind if they don’t find a middle ground to work with everyone.      Do you think bitcoin could become legal tender at some point in Nigeria?      Unless they find a way to control bitcoin – and I think that’s why China is cracking down so hard on it – I don’t see it being legal tender anytime soon. However, they might have a central bank digital currency, which the central bank is already working towards, but bitcoin becoming legal tender, I don’t see it right now.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/30/theyd-rather-buy-bitcoin-and-take-that-risk-an-interview-with-paxfuls-nena-nwachukwu,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e0cf1844e7d3e1ef4d532d7ec42628307ed3e13-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434700,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsj3h,1625063824,Dogecoin Millionaire Wants to Bring Back Culture of Giving With New Game,"Gary Lachance has a knack for getting people to help him out. One of the co-inventors of the Decentralized Dance Party (DDP) – a roving celebration powered by a radio transmitter, hundreds of boomboxes and thousands of dancers – he never struggled to find people willing to chip in for gas money or batteries to keep the radios going. DDP has been a money-losing operation since it kicked off in 2009. But Lachance isn’t fazed for his next throwdown.      On Saturday, he’s launching a blockchain-based game that rewards players with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and dogecoin. The beta release of Million Doge Disco combines elements of augmented reality (AR) games, like Pokemon Go, and the DDP, letting people encounter and dance with digital characters called “Dogeagotchi” in the real world that also live on a blockchain as an NFT.      To get this party started, Lachance is donating more than 1 million DOGE (worth about $260,000) to seed in-game giveaways and help fund development – though much of the work was volunteered. “That's like the majority of my DOGE; I will not be a millionaire once I give that away,” Lachance said. (Asked for evidence, he took off his sunglasses and said you can’t “prove how much crypto you don't have.”)      Dogecoin has had a fetching year. The cryptocurrency created in 2013 to be “as ridiculous as possible"" has chased bitcoin to become one of the most recognizable and noteworthy assets in the sector with a $32 billion market cap and devoted fanbase. Lachance was one of dogecoin’s early supporters, drawn by the community’s friendly and generous disposition. “We’re like, finally there's like a funny, silly version of Bitcoin that's good,” he said.    Read more: ‘Silliness Is Next to Godliness’: Why Doge Still Thrives    Although created as a joke, DOGE found legitimate utility as an internet-native currency. An ever-increasing token supply encouraged spending and a giving economy sprouted up. Redditors randomly gave doge to others. Holders famously paid the Jamaican bobsled team’s way to the Olympics. Lachance, who organized a Camp Dogecoin at the Burning Man festival and a DogeCon in Vancouver, British Columbia, gave out thousands of shiba inu stickers (and dogecoins) to strangers.      That sort of generosity and light-heartedness isn’t as common now in crypto as it used to be.      Part of Lachance’s motivation for Doge Disco is to “reinvigorate the culture of gifting.” He’s hoping that players may be inspired to help fund the giveaways once his stash runs out. Another ambition is to build a “party layer” above reality, “allowing anyone, anywhere to instantly step into a parallel dimension alive with sound, light and positive vibes,” according to the project’s website. Players may be graced with a daily dose of “dogely wisdom.”      It might sound like Lachance is living in an alternative plain beyond the metaverse, but the project is real enough. It’s built on the blockchain and AR development platform BLOCKv with tie-ins to Ethereum layer 2 Polygon and the Dogecoin blockchain. The in-game DOGE are tokenized, though players will receive real coins from a custodial wallet “with just a click,” Lachance said.      Kyle Kemper, the half-brother of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is a co-founder. More than 1,000 people have signed up for the wait list, Lachance said. A Zoom party will kick it all off on Saturday, which Lachance hopes will spill into the streets.      “We're just kind of figuring it out as we go along,” Lachance said, expounding some “dogely wisdom.” He said he had planned to die a DOGE millionaire and have his paper wallet buried with him. But after the massive run-up and run-down in the cryptocurrency’s price, he realized the opportunity to spread joy. “There's a chance all the money could just disappear. But this is the best possible thing I could ever think to do with this: just distributing it around the globe.”      “Everything comes back around eventually,” he said.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | SHIB | AR,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/30/dogecoin-millionaire-wants-to-bring-back-culture-of-giving-with-new-game,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7b83a30d376c6298a302956ef874dc29126736b6-2560x1576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42434685,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsidh,1625063408,FATF Report on Extreme Right Financing Highlights Cryptocurrency Use,"The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global anti-money laundering watchdog, has released a report on the ways extreme right-wing groups are financed, which includes a section on cryptocurrency.      The FATF’s report, titled “Ethnically or Racially Motivated Terrorism Financing,” points out that virtual assets like bitcoin have been used by extremists who have been gradually shut out of traditional payment platforms, in the same way extreme right-wing (ERW) groups have been blocked from social media.      The report highlights that some ERW groups have switched to “so-called ‘privacy coins,’ i.e., VAs [virtual assets] that allow a user to maintain total anonymity when making blockchain transactions.”      It’s worth noting that the blockchains underpinning virtual assets, even end-to-end encrypted varieties, leave some record of transactions – as opposed to cash, the preferred medium of exchange for criminals and terrorists.      It's also worth noting that other unconventional funding vehicles merit scrutiny:      “There has been plenty of interest in VAs from different ERW groups and individuals looking for anonymity, especially after being removed from mainstream payment platforms,” the report states, adding:    “ERW actors that feel more security-conscious and desire a greater level of secrecy, often choose VAs. However, notably there is limited information on the volume of funds being transferred in this way.    The FATF report goes on to list examples, such as one far-right organization in South Africa that created its own stablecoin that operates on a 1:1 ratio with the South African rand (ZAR).      “The stablecoin, managed by an application styled PayApp, enables the group to use digital money as cash,” said the FATF report. “The transactional data lasts 24 hours and thereafter is untraceable.”      FATF said bank statement analysis on the South African extremist group showed that the organization raised ZAR 268,000 ($17,469) in funds.      Other examples included Scandinavian ERW group Nordisk Styrke, which only gives cryptocurrency addresses on the organization’s donations page.      A financial investigation into the terror attack perpetrated by the Christchurch mosque shooter in New Zealand in March 2019 found that he had made use of virtual assets to transfer funds, the FATF report said.

Copper, which harnesses a cryptographic key sharding technology called multi-party computation (MPC), will be supporting Algorand’s native token, ALGO, as well as Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs), the tokenized representation of other asset types on the proof-of-stake blockchain.      Crypto custodians are adept at adding support for new tokens and coins, and Copper is no exception. Meanwhile, Algorand is supported by a range of specialist custodians such as Coinbase Custody and BitGo.      But the current pairing is a deeper partnership: Algorand is looking beyond Copper’s safe-keeping provisions to explore the custodian’s ClearLoop system of instant asset exchange and settlement, for example.      “Copper adds a layer of speed that you wouldn’t be able to find outside of their network, and of course this is right up Algorand’s alley of being extremely fast, secure and efficient,” David Markley, Algorand’s director of business solutions, said in an interview.

As well as looking after ALGO tokens, which may include those used for staking on Algorand, Copper will be charged with looking after the 4.5 million ASA assets represented on the chain.    Exotic assets    What can be thought of as the base layer of digital dollar equivalents, Algorand ASAs include a clutch of well-known stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, as well as Canadian dollar, Swiss franc stablecoins and Mexican peso to be added shortly, said Markley. One layer up from stablecoins, things get more exotic, he added.      “We have tokenized real estate via a handful of firms that have tokenized either home equity or individual homes and represented those on Algorand's blockchain,” he said. “We’ve also got a long list of partnerships with firms like Securitize and Tokensoft and the other security token issuers.

42434688,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsijh,1625057602,China's Bitcoin Mining Crackdown Is a Boon for Miners Elsewhere,"Just weeks into a stunningly effective purge of large bitcoin miners from China, reduced competition for Bitcoin block rewards has dramatically improved the profitability outlook for mining operations elsewhere.      “As the [mining] hashrate falls down, the difficulty [of mining] readjusts,” explains Kevin Zhang, VP of business development at mining firm Foundry Digital. Bitcoin’s hashrate is the measure of how much computing power is securing the network – and competing for Bitcoin rewards. (Disclosure: Foundry, like CoinDesk, is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.).      “[The hashrate] has fallen so much that it has actually kept on par with the bitcoin price,” Zhang says. “A miner that plugs in now has basically the same economics as when bitcoin was $50,000.”    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    “We are now mining more bitcoin on a daily basis than we were before, without doing anything, without adding any machines,” confirms Geoff Morphy, president of Bitfarms, which mines primarily in Quebec, but has plans to expand. Its stock was listed on the Nasdaq on June 21.      Declining Bitcoin hashpower benefits current miners because unlike real mining, bitcoin mining is essentially a zero-sum game. The same amount of bitcoin rewards are issued every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners are contributing hash power to the network. Since mid-April, Bitcoin’s hash power has plummeted by nearly half, meaning competition for those rewards is also almost half what it was.      A lot of that decline is thanks to the dropping price of bitcoin, which makes mining less appealing for operations with higher power costs or less efficient machinery. But it’s clear that miners are leaving China in droves – and leaving magical internet money on the table when they do.    You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here    Many exiled Chinese miners appear to be moving machines to nearby countries such as Kazakhstan or Russia. Others are reaching out to operators like Bitfarms in hopes of sharing facilities.      A third group of miners, according to Zhang, is mothballing equipment in hopes that Chinese policy will eventually reverse. Shentu Quingchun, CEO of China-based blockchain firm BankLedger, has estimated that 90% of China’s miners could be shut down in the current purge. Quingchun pegs China’s pre-ban share of global mining at one-third, but consensus estimates are closer to half.      Those hoping to relocate to North America are facing an uphill battle that has only gotten steeper.      “About three weeks ago, I got some emails and phone calls to see if we would be open to hosting miners previously located in China,” says Bitfarms’ Morphy. “Two weeks ago, the number of emails coming into me tripled. This week, they doubled again. Every day I am getting eight to 10 emails from people who are either looking for us to buy their miners, or to set up a joint venture.”      Zhang says Foundry’s phone has been “ringing off the hook” with similar requests.      This would normally be a good expansion opportunity, but the recent runup in the bitcoin price means firms outside of China have been pursuing expansion plans for months. That means building out power, cooling and space to fit a pre-planned number of machines, so many won’t have capacity to integrate a sudden flood of former Chinese rigs.      “We don’t have any excess capacity until some time next year,” says Morphy. “And some of these Chinese miners are willing to talk to us even if their miners aren’t plugged in for another nine months.”      Those hoping to set up entirely new mining operations outside of China will face other obstacles. Zhang says there’s now a “huge shortage” of electrical transformers, thanks to manufacturing disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. For industrial-scale bitcoin mining, transformers are needed to convert energy from a substation before it can be used by mining rigs.      The result, according to Zhang, is an insoluble bottleneck.      “Moving all of this is going to be nearly impossible. That infrastructure takes six to nine months to build up.”      That means established miners around the world will be benefiting from the drop in Chinese competition for a long time.    Repression’s long, heavy tail    China’s crackdown on bitcoin mining is part of a broader cycle of crackdowns on cryptocurrency as a whole. Statements from Chinese leaders and regulators have often focused on the risk of investment scams or financial fraud, and massive frauds like PlusToken have certainly thrived in the country.      “This is a widespread effort to tone down the fervor and interest” in speculative crypto-assets, says Zhang. He believes miners have essentially been caught in the crossfire of an effort that’s not truly focused on them.      Zhang also notes that the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party is coming on July 1. It will be celebrated as a nationwide commemoration, and Zhang believes the mining ban may in part have been a somewhat theatrical demonstration of CCP power ahead of the date.    Read more: Go West, Bitcoin! Unpacking the Great Hashrate Migration | Nic Carter    So once the crypto hype and Communist anniversaries pass, there may be room to reverse or loosen China’s mining ban. Some miners, according to Zhang, haven’t moved operations yet in hopes of that reversal.      But even if things change, the nature of China’s current crackdown will almost certainly keep a portion of miners away permanently. As I’ve discussed elsewhere, Chinese policymaking is not just undemocratic, but opaque and sometimes impulsive. That can be immensely destructive for business, and the mining case makes that crystal clear.    How much have China’s miners lost?    Let’s do some rough math. Currently, 900 bitcoins are issued daily to miners as block rewards. If we assume Chinese miners started packing their bags about three weeks ago, 18,900 bitcoin have been issued since, worth $680 million at current prices. China had half of global mining power before the crackdown. Let’s further assume, conservatively, that about half of Chinese miners were offline, on average, during those three weeks; some would have shut down late, some may have already set up again, and some smaller miners will remain in operation.      At current prices, that means China’s mining ban cost operators $170 million in revenue over three weeks. Meanwhile, many certainly still have expenses, from the salaries of the workers unplugging machines, to rent for warehouses to store unplugged machines. And the situation won't get markedly better anytime soon for most of them.      After getting a $170 million wedgie from an authoritarian government with little tolerance for pushback or even dialogue, many miners certainly won’t return to China, even if there’s a policy reversal.      Chinese mining pools, which can coordinate hashpower located elsewhere and have been dominant for years, could also see long-term harm as the crackdown highlights their riskiness. “Many [mining pool’s] servers are on, for example Alibaba,” says Zhang. “That could be cut off very quickly … any given day, if the government wants to shut it down, they can, and they will.”      As a knock-on effect of this crypto-washout, China could lose a huge amount of present and future blockchain talent – or worse, see that talent marshaled toward the invasive surveillance technology that is the digital yuan.      The mining ban makes a nice bookend to the downfall of Jack Ma – twinned case studies of the inherent difficulty of China’s attempt to create a dynamic market economy without political democracy. Capitalism is a system that fosters and rewards risks, innovation and daring. But in the span of less than nine months, two of China’s biggest forces for innovation have been publicly rebuked by the country’s leaders.      For the Chinese people, that’s a tragedy. For everyone else, it’s money in the bank.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING,David Z.

Blockware founder and CEO Michael Stoltzner declined to name entities involved in the funding round, but told CoinDesk the list of investors included several “prominent” individuals and crypto funds. This round brings Blockware’s total capital raised to date to $32 million since its launch in 2019.      The money will be used to purchase 14,000 mining rigs over the next two years, which Blockware has sourced from both Bitmain and the open market. The company will use 8,000 of the rigs to build out its new mining facility in Paducah, Ky., and will sell 6,000 rigs to other U.S.-based bitcoin mining operations.      Stoltzner said he chose Paducah for Blockware’s first large-scale mining facility because the city had everything he was looking for: friendly government officials, plenty of skilled and unskilled labor, and most importantly, cheap energy.      The Paducah facility will be built on land that is 100 yards from the Big Rivers Electric-operated energy source that will power Blockware’s rigs.      The Chinese government’s crackdown on mining operations has caused many to shut down, and bitcoin’s hashrate has plummeted in response. The situation has caused many in the crypto community to call for a more global, decentralized mining structure to reduce the network’s reliance on Chinese miners. Miners have also been under increased scrutiny in recent months as bitcoin’s sustainability debate, led by unofficial crypto figureheads including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, rages on.    Power mix    Stoltzner said the company chose to source power from Big Rivers Electric because the company used a mix of renewable and non-renewable sources, including hydroelectric, wind and coal.      “Kentucky is the largest coal-producing state in the country,” Stoltzner said. “That’s the resource they have. It's a tough argument, and people in Kentucky feel different about that argument than people in California.”      Stoltzner said Blockware is working on a program to purchase carbon offsets and is in the early stages of joining the Michael Saylor-led Bitcoin Mining Council.    Read more: Stronghold Digital Mining Raises $105M to Turn Waste Coal Into Bitcoin    According to Stoltzner, Blockware’s smaller-scale mining operations in upstate New York, Washington state and Newfoundland, Canada, are almost completely run on hydroelectric power.      Ensuring the sustainability of North American bitcoin mining is part of Stoltzner’s larger stated goal of increasing the bitcoin hashrate in North America, which currently only accounts for an estimated 10% of the hashrate worldwide.

42434681,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsdbh,1625052600,Valid Points: How Ethereum Miners Are Preparing for EIP 1559 and the Merge,"The Pacific Northwest is sweltering under a once-in-a-millennium heat dome. I feel as though the effects of it are being felt all the way in the Northeast, where I am currently sweating through my eyeballs as I finish writing this newsletter.      This week, I pull back the curtains on how miners are preparing for Ethereum’s forthcoming fee market change, EIP 1559. Also, I explain the hidden lesson behind the rare cases of Ethereum 2.0 validators with a balance of more than 64 ETH. For most of these validators, the high balance is not by choice.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Pulse check: double deposit incidents    The balances of Ethereum 2.0 validators range wildly from 30 ETH to 65 ETH. The main reason for the extreme disparity is not because some validators are more profitable than others or because some validators started earning rewards on the network earlier than others. Roughly 168 validators out of 178,000 simply deposited their minimum stake of 32 ETH twice, by accident.    Read more: Our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics to get up to speed about terminology used throughout Valid Points    A prime example of double deposits occurred on June 9, when a user submitted a batch of 100 transactions to the Eth 2.0 deposit contract through crypto asset staking pool Stakefish. Each transaction deposited the required amount of 32 ETH, which would enable the creation of 100 unique validators on the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain.      According to Jun Soo Kim, Stakefish’s head of strategy and operations, the user then “manually invoked” a second deposit of the same batch of transactions, causing each 32 ETH deposit to become a deposit of 64 ETH.      “Our user interface does not permit these types of action, as there are proper locking and internal checks in place. However, we literally can’t stop a user from invoking the deposit contract directly on Ethereum,” Kim said.      Speaking to the negative consequences of accidentally staking more than the required 32 ETH balance for a single validator, Consensys’ Ben Edgington noted in his biweekly newsletter What’s New in Eth2 that the additional stake would not earn any rewards on the network and would be “locked up until withdrawals are enabled in, perhaps, a year’s time.”      Other commentators, responding in a Reddit thread about the incident, called the double deposits a “huge mistake” and a “bummer” for the unlucky user who would be earning closer to 3% instead of the average 6% annual percentage return on his or her stake.      Confirming that sentiment, Kim said Stakefish has been “in close contact with the user and … notified them that there can’t be anything done until withdrawals are enabled.” Kim added, “We will be closely monitoring the upgrade proposals [for Eth 2.0] that will help the user withdraw excess ETH from validators.”      These double deposit incidents highlight the importance of taking extra precautions when setting up an Eth 2.0 validator, and in cases where a user is setting up multiple validators at once, they also highlight the benefits of running through the setup process on a test network before executing the steps on the Ethereum mainnet.      On the bright side, locking up any amount of ETH on the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain is one safe, secure and fail-proof way to hold onto, or “HODL,” your coins for a year’s time, if not longer.    New frontiers: upcoming network upgrades    The following is the first of a two-part series explaining how Ethereum miners are preparing for two upcoming network upgrades, the London hard fork and the Merge.    The London hard fork    The most imminent of the two is the London hard fork, which is expected to get activated on Ethereum in July. As I discussed in last week’s Valid Points issue, one of the most controversial code changes bundled into London is Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. EIP 1559 will radically change the fee dynamics of Ethereum by introducing a minimum fee to all on-chain transactions called the “base fee.”      Normally, transaction fees are set by users and accepted in full by miners. Under EIP 1559, the base fee is set by the Ethereum protocol automatically and is removed or “burnt” by the network instead of being awarded to miners. The burning mechanism of EIP 1559 is one of the most controversial aspects of the London upgrade because of its potential to reduce miner revenue.      “While we think [EIP 1559] will bring better predictability for transaction inclusion, we think that fee burning is a bad idea, considering many transactions requiring extended computing resources for smart contract execution … will no longer be compensated,” Slava Karpenko, the chief technology officer of Ethereum mining pool 2Miners, told CoinDesk in an email.      Despite the concern over reduced miner revenue, Karpenko and other Ethereum miners have made their peace about the activation of EIP 1559 this summer.      Residential Ethereum miner Brian Lee, who runs 11 GPUs in his garage in California, said that despite the initial “backlash from the mining community,” EIP 1559 and the London upgrade was now a “non-issue” for most miners.      “All of us accepted it,” Lee said during a phone interview with CoinDesk. “I’m pretty confident that they’re going to get it done. It’s just a matter of time, July or August.”    ‘What options do we have?’    After a successful activation on Ethereum test network Ropsten this past week, EIP 1559 is scheduled for release on the Ethereum test network Goerli on Wednesday. Assuming all goes well on Goerli, Ethereum Foundation’s Tim Beiko estimated that protocol developers could pick a block number – and subsequently a date – for the main network activation shortly thereafter.      Any disgruntled miners who do not choose to upgrade their software to the latest version would effectively be mining a different Ethereum blockchain. For most miners, that would be the least-profitable option for them to take, according to Igor Stadnyk, the CEO of Ethereum mining pool Minerall.      “What options do we have?” said Stadnyk in a phone interview with CoinDesk. “[If] we tell the world we are not happy with this proposal and we will run on non-updated software, we will run old Ethereum. This means one more Ethereum Classic will be created … It will be like a network split, and then the question is, will other big market players support this network split? I don’t think so.”      Stadnyk and his team, like Lee and Karpenko, will be supporting the London upgrade come July. Stadnyk said he remains confident in the long-term success of Ethereum as a result of the network’s constant evolution and iterative development, which is why he is also now exploring options to continue participating in the network even when mining is no longer an option.      Some time early next year, Ethereum is expected to transition fully to a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol, meaning that validators instead of miners will take over the responsibilities of transaction validation and block production. That upgrade to PoS is nicknamed “the Merge.”      While Stadnyk has started to run “a few [Eth 2.0] validators already” in preparation for the Merge, other miners such as Lee and Karpenko are not as eager to support Ethereum’s PoS transition.      “At the cost right now … I would probably have to sell some of my bitcoin into ether to become a validator and I feel like putting my wealth into bitcoin for me is a better long-term play,” Lee said.      In next week’s Valid Points, I’ll uncover the reasons why Ethereum miners like Lee are not as supportive of Ethereum’s Merge upgrade as they are of the London hard fork, and discuss the differing plans miners have to remain profitable in their operations post-Merge.    Validated takes  The first London hard fork block has been produced on the Ropsten test network. TAKEAWAY: Ethereum developers are moving forward with the development of EIP 1559 and other code changes bundled into London by testing the upgrade in more realistic network environments. London is scheduled for activation on the Goerli and Rinkeby test networks over the next two weeks, before going live on mainnet. (Article, Yahoo Finance)  In order to remain compliant to the Ethereum network after EIP 1559 is activated, developers behind layer 2 scaling solution Polygon have proposed their own implementation of EIP 1559 to the Polygon network. TAKEAWAY: The proposed implementation of EIP 1559 on Polygon differs from how the code change is expected to work on Ethereum. Instead of burning the minimum fee payment, also called the “base fee,” Polygon developers are considering transferring these payments to the network’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to help fund protocol development over the long term. (Post, Polygon Governance Forum)  A rogue developer withdrew $500,000 worth of governance token SGT from decentralized Eth 2.0 staking service SharedStake. TAKEAWAY: A vulnerability in the timelock code that was meant to release SGT tokens gradually over time was exploited by one of the developers of SharedStake. The SGT tokens were subsequently dumped on the market, and the price of the tokens fell 96% from $1.60 to under $0.03. Furthermore, users have been advised to stop using and to exit the platform’s staking services because it remains unclear if the withdrawal keys for some 16,000 ETH, worth roughly $32 million, have also been compromised in the process. This is a developing story. (Article, The Defiant)  Anthony Sassano suggests decentralized finance (DeFi) on Ethereum is “greatly” flattening the cost of offering financial products and services to individuals and businesses. TAKEAWAY: Traditional asset managers such as BlackRock generate significantly more revenue than DeFi protocols such as crypto asset robo-adviser Yearn. However, these DeFi protocols are magnitudes more efficient than traditional companies in terms of dollars generated per employee, which suggests smart contract technology is a powerful tool in cutting down the operational costs of financial services. (Newsletter post, The Daily Gwei)  Gas fees on Ethereum reached their lowest point in 2021, with average transactions costing around 5 gwei, or $0.15, this past weekend. TAKEAWAY: Decentralized application activity has slowed on Ethereum, with the recent price drop of ether. Less on-chain activity and lower ETH prices have pushed gas fees down to levels not seen in several months. (Article, Yahoo Finance)  The number of accounts, excluding smart contract accounts, holding at least 32 ETH is at its lowest point since August 2019. TAKEAWAY: Data from Glassnode shows the number of user-owned accounts holding a minimum of 32 ETH has been on the decline since last November, when staking on Ethereum with a balance of 32 ETH first launched.

42434679,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsdXh,1625049879,Bitcoin Set for Record Second-Quarter Price Drop,"Bitcoin prices are on track for a record second-quarter percentage decline, weighed down by China's crackdown, concerns the U.S. Federal Reserve will start tapering its stimulus program and persistent demand for downside hedges.      The leading cryptocurrency was trading near $34,824 at 10:39 UTC on Wednesday (6:39 a.m. Eastern time), down almost 41% for the April to June period. The drop snaps a four-quarter winning streak that saw prices chart a sixfold rise to almost $60,000, according to Bitstamp data.      The historically strong quarter began on a positive note, with bitcoin rallying to a record $64,801 in the run-up to the Nasdaq debut of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase on April 14. However, momentum stalled in subsequent weeks as retail investors struggled to do the heavy lifting in the wake of selling by large investors.      The market, therefore, looked weak and took a beating in mid-May after U.S. electric-car maker Tesla delisted bitcoin as a payments alternative, citing environmental concerns and dashing hopes for widespread corporate adoption. China's reiteration of the crypto-mining ban and concerns of an early unwinding of stimulus by the Fed amplified the bearish move, pushing prices down to a then four-month low of $30,000.      Since then, bitcoin has traded mainly in the range of $30,000 to $40,000, barring a brief drop to $28,600 on June 22. Sentiment has turned quite bearish, as evidenced by directionless trading in the wake of El Salvador's decision to adopt the cryptocurrency as a legal tender.      Moreover, fears of a deeper sell-off persist, according to the so-called options smile – a chart created by plotting implied volatilities against options at various strike prices expiring on the same date. Implied volatility refers to investors' expectations of price turbulence over a specific period. It is influenced by demand for call and put options.      The option smile for short-date and near-dated expiries carries a steep slope at strikes lower than bitcoin's current price. That's a sign of relatively higher implied volatility or demand for options at lower strikes than those at higher strikes. In other words, investors are continuing to buy protective puts – contracts that give purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset, in this case bitcoin, at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.      Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, doesn't foresee bulls making a strong comeback anytime soon.      ""Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase, and we think this can stretch through September,"" he said. ""Since its peak in April, the institutional interest has waned, and there is lack of liquidity from both corporations and retail buyers.""      According to Balani, the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to any weakness on the macro front and could drop to the former hurdle-turned-support of $19,666 (December 2017) in case of a broad-based risk aversion.      Currently, traditional markets are showing no signs of weakness. Despite the Fed's recent hawkish talk, the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, is on track to end the second quarter 8% higher, a fifth consecutive quarterly gain. Meanwhile, gold, a safe haven, has erased most of its gains to trade just 2% higher for the quarter, according to TradingView data.      The situation, however, could change if the U.S. economy continues to accelerate, reviving fears of an early Fed tightening.      That said, some observers remain optimistic and are drawing parallels with the price action seen in 2013 when bitcoin crashed from $250 to $45 in April, bringing the bull run to a screeching halt, only to surge to four figures by November.      ""While I don't think the bottom is in, the market looks like 2013, and bitcoin could see a mega pump,"" John Lilic, ConsenSys alum, Polygon adviser and Dfinity whale, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.      Matthew Dibb, Stack Funds' chief operating officer and co-founder, doesn't subscribe to the 2013 scenario, saying the current market structure is entirely different. He remains, however, a cautious long-term bull.      ""From a technical analysis perspective, the second-quarter drop is a pullback,"" Dibb said on a WhatsApp chat. ""Bitcoin is still in the stage of a parabolic advance.""      A breakout of the current range could bring a rally toward $85,000 by March 2022, Dibb said.

The list includes the largest credit organizations of Russia, including Sberbank, VTB, Alfa Bank, Gazprombank and Tinkoff.      Previously, the Bank of Russia said it was planning to develop a prototype of the digital ruble by December and start piloting it next year. It's not clear yet if the project will be built on a blockchain, and, if so, on which one. The initial concept of the digital ruble, published in October 2020, did not mention specific technological solutions and provided a list of options of how the project should be implemented.      The project rattled Russia's banking community because the banks were worried about the potential centralized design of the CBDC, which would mean direct competition between them and the central bank for Russian accounts.      Bank of Russia Chair Elvira Nabiullina brushed off those concerns last year, saying the digital ruble would not be not a threat for commercial banks.

The platform exchanges data between financial institutions for KYC purposes, an announcement on Sunday said.  Data is shared over the platform's blockchain, enabling potential customers to be swiftly approved by member institutions using the credentials provided to others.  Institutions save time and money because they can use shared data about new customers rather than having to obtain it themselves.  The platform is powered by Swedish firm norbloc's Fides blockchain.  Members of the consortium – launched in February 2020 by Dubai's Department of Economic Development, which is known as ""Dubai Economy"" – include Emirates Islamic, Emirates NBD, Commercial Bank of Dubai, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Rakbank and Mashreq Bank.

Bill Foster (D-Ill.), who also co-chairs the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, believes a trusted third party, such as the courts, should have access to a crypto backdoor.      In an interview with Axios on Tuesday, the congressman said that until the industry could grapple with crypto-ransomware attacks, total anonymity would be ""very hard to sustain.""      Foster said new legislation and rules could establish a type of pseudo-anonymity where only judicial powers would have access to certain information. The congressman suggested allowing the court to use its access to a ""very heavily guarded key,"" a ""cryptographic backdoor in essence,"" allowing it to reverse transactions on the blockchain.      ""You (authorities) have to be able to go to court to unmask participants under some circumstances,"" said Foster. ""It does not have to be visible to the whole world.""      The congressman also drew a distinction between digital and physical assets in the context of ransomware attacks, providing an example of unmarked dollar bills being put in a trash can versus total anonymity afforded to hackers.    See also: NYC Mayoral Front Runner Eric Adams Says City Will Become ‘Center of Bitcoins’    Asked whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation's retrieval of bitcoin from the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attackers last month afforded a solution to the problem, the congressman said recouping funds would eventually become ""more difficult.""      The fundamental decision one has to make when it comes to crypto is between retaining true anonymity versus being able to unmask participants and reverse fraudulent or mistaken transactions, the congressman noted.      ""There's not a technological alternative that I am aware of,"" said Foster.

In a consultation paper from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), the regulator is reaching out to market participants for feedback on whether crypto underlying products can meet existing ETP expectations.      ASIC said it is attempting to evaluate whether cryptos are appropriate underlying assets, whether they could be reliably priced, and how they should be classified with respect to underlying asset rules, according to the paper.      The paper seeks feedback in two main areas on how an ETP may affect the market including compliance costs and effects on competition. ASIC's request for feedback comes as the Australian Securities Exchange, one of the country's major bourses, is considering applications for the launch of a domestic ETP by year's end.      ""At this point in time, in our view, the only crypto-assets that are likely to satisfy these factors are bitcoin and ether,"" the regulator said.      How product issuers can ensure these products are compliant with the existing regulatory framework, including with respect to custody, risk management and disclosure were also mentioned for consideration.      In Australia, there are three types of categories that fall under an ETP including exchange-traded funds, managed funds and structured products – a security or derivative which gives financial exposure to the performance of underlying instruments.      See also: ASX Boss Says His DLT Settlement System Will Be Bigger Than All of Crypto Market      ""We are aware of interest in, and demand for, domestic crypto-asset ETPs,"" said the regulator.

42434666,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPsd7h,1625015284,Security Tokens Are Back and This Time It's Real,"A multi-trillion dollar universe of illiquid, privately held assets stands ready to be securitized on the blockchain. Millions in venture capital are riding on the premise. So why haven’t security tokens caught on yet?      Tokens can be divided into two types: utility tokens and security tokens. Most people are more familiar with utility tokens than security tokens because they are much more common. (Ethereum and litecoin are examples of utility tokens.) A security token, on the other hand, represents an ownership stake in an asset, typically a company, and entitles its holder to a share of profits in the asset. Security tokens are much less common.    Janine Yorio is Managing Director, Republic Crypto - Strategic Assets & Initiatives.    Utility tokens are like chips in a casino. They can be used as currency within the casino for playing games and tipping dealers, and converted back to fiat/cash when it’s time to cash out. Holders of a casino’s chips do not own a stake in the casino, nor are they entitled to any of the casino’s winnings or profits.      Security tokens, on the other hand, are like owning stock in the casino, shares in the company itself. When the house wins, you win. Security token holders own something that might pay off through profits or distributions. Utility tokens are used in an ecosystem. Security tokens give you ownership in that ecosystem.      In 2018, when many notable utility tokens nosedived in value, the crypto community rallied around security tokens. Venture capital poured into security token projects, lured by the prospect of bringing liquidity to private markets, especially real estate.      That year, high-profile VC firms Founders Fund and Andreesen Horowitz led an unusually large ($28 million) seed round into Harbor, a crypto startup promising to put ownership of real-world assets on the blockchain. The company’s founder declared that Harbor would do to the real estate market what email did to snail mail. Three years later, the real estate market has escaped any noticeable change. Harbor’s slow attempt to mainstream security tokens reflects what has happened across the entire security token industry: big promises, disappointing results. It’s easy to see why people might (wrongfully) conclude that security tokens are a bust.      So why have security tokens been so slow to catch on?      Security tokens are subject to greater regulatory scrutiny than utility tokens (like bitcoin or ethereum) from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and require full SEC approval to be sold in public offerings to non-accredited investors or traded on secondary exchanges. Regulatory hurdles are one of the reasons their growth and adoption have been more modest.    Read more: Here Comes the Virtual Real Estate Boom | Janine Yorio    However, that’s all starting to change; the SEC is starting to qualify security token offerings. Nothing pours fuel on a financial product’s fire quite like transparency and regulatory clarity.      In July 2019, the SEC qualified the first Regulation A token offering (a $23 million offering for Blockstack) setting precedent for the sale of tokens that are immediately tradable to both accredited and non-accredited investors. They also provided clarity around secondary sales.      In July 2020, Arca Labs began trading its digital security token, the ArCoin, which is registered with the SEC and represents shares in Arca’s U.S. Treasury Fund.      In September 2020, the SEC finally registered an $85 million security token offering from INX, a foreign crypto trading company. This became the first-ever security token initial public offering qualified by the SEC.      In April 2021, the SEC qualified a Reg A+ token offering for Exodus, marking the first digital asset security that conferred equity in a U.S.-based issuing company. Exodus subsequently raised $75 million from 6,800 individual investors.      Security tokens aren’t strictly a U.S. phenomenon. In May a Singapore-based bank issued its first security token offering, a $11.3 million digital bond that pays a 0.6% annual coupon.      These movements may appear relatively small but they mark an important transition for the crypto industry because it evolves from the Wild West to complete regulatory compliance. These changes herald massive mainstream adoption.      Given all these positive developments, I have become very bullish on security tokens, but not because security tokens provide stable returns.    Read more: What NFT Sales Mean for Digital Real Estate | Janine Yorio    Instead, let’s be brutally honest about what people love about crypto: its insane volatility – so volatile that 20%+ intraday swings are not atypical. Previous attempts to tokenize stable, income-generating assets have failed to acknowledge this fundamental truth. If the carrot of fractionalization alone were seductive enough to encourage people to invest, then real estate investment trusts would be as popular as the shiba inu coin. But they’re not.      The problem with early security tokens like aspen coin or the realT coins is they offer no prospect of meteoric returns, the kind that Dogecoin fans love. Security token advocates point to steady returns as a core value proposition, but stability contradicts the very ethos of crypto.      The perfectly irresistible security token is truly compliant and backed by quantifiable and verifiable assets with potential moonshot returns. Why?      Combining SEC legitimacy with the catnip of crypto-style returns would create the gateway drug for all the crypto-curious conservative investors who have dabbled in bitcoin but are too timid to invest in the kinds of highly speculative utility tokens that might turn out to be worthless.      Are there any such coins in the works?      Everybody loves a cliffhanger.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | SHIB | TOKEN SALE,Janine Yorio,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/30/security-tokens-are-back-and-this-time-its-real,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/162dae4b938706dcef74a3c6876618b8fb468e07-1400x815.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
