About $235 million worth of positions (5,329 contracts) were open on the CME on Jan. 17 compared to $110 million seen in early December. Open interest is the sum of all contracts that have not expired, been exercised or physically delivered.      Open interest has spiked alongside price, confirming an upward trend. Bitcoin bottomed out near $6,430 in mid-December and rose to a 2.5-month high of $9,188 on Sunday. At press time, the cryptocurrency changed hands at $8,600, representing a 20 percent gain on a year-to-date basis.     Increased activity ahead of options launch    The bitcoin futures market witnessed increased activity in the runup to the launch of options trading. Open interest rose to more than 5,000 contracts in the first four trading days of the week.       Further, more than 17,000 contracts (equivalent to over 85,000 bitcoin) traded on Jan. 8 – five days before the options product went live and registered a first-day volume of $2.3 million, or 55 options contracts.       Options trading volume more than doubled to 122 contracts on Friday, amounting to a notional volume of 610 BTC, or $5.3 million, as each contract represents five bitcoins.       Institutional participation    “BTC has seen remarkable growth in volume and customer interest with nearly 2.5M contracts traded to date and 4.9K+ contracts traded daily, “ the CME tweeted on Dec. 17.       Further, nearly 6,400 futures contracts traded each day (equal to 31,850 bitcoin) at the exchange in 2019.       The ever-increasing numbers at the CME may reflect rising institutional interest in the cryptocurrency and could accelerate bitcoin’s evolution as a mature asset class.       “CME’s product has evolved over the last two years and is now one of the most liquid, listed bitcoin derivatives globally. We have seen strong participation from institutional investors, physical bitcoin traders and other clients who value the transparency, price discovery and risk transfer that only a regulated marketplace like CME Group can offer,” Tim McCourt, managing director at CME Group, wrote in a LinkedIn post in December.

42403829,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpvN,1579534991,South Korea Considers 20% Crypto Income Tax,"The South Korean government is said to be considering imposing a 20 percent tax on income generated from cryptocurrency transactions.      South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Monday officials from the Ministry of Economy and Finance's income tax office had been reviewing a new proposal that could see the country adopt a clearer regime for how it taxes cryptocurrencies.      An anonymous official speaking to Yonhap suggested South Korea is considering re-classifying returns made on cryptocurrencies as a type of ""other income,"" placing it in the same category as money earned from lotteries rather than as a form of capital gains, as it is currently treated.      Under existing South Korea legislation, a 20 percent rate is levied on 40 percent of total other income; the remaining 60 percent can be tax-deductible. Currently, virtual currencies can be taxed under different schedules, with rates of up to 42 percent under capital gains.      South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance has pushed for a new cryptocurrency tax regime for over a month now. A ministry spokesperson confirmed to The Korea Times in December a ""revised bill"" for enhancing the government's ability to tax cryptocurrencies would be drawn up in the first half of 2020.      The official added that no plans had yet been finalized, suggesting the tax plan could be amended or even thrown out by the ministry.      Although cryptocurrency taxation is still a very nascent field, the approach taken by the governments in many developed economies has been to treat returns made on cryptocurrencies as a form of capital gains – a tax that is levied on the difference when a sale price exceeds that of the purchase price.      The U.S. internal revenue service (IRS), for example, issued guidance in October that reconfirmed the status of cryptocurrencies as a form of property, even when received as a form of income. Depending on a person's income bracket, taxes liable can exceed 39 percent if the cryptocurrency is held for less than a year. In the U.K., cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are classified as commodities and holders can be liable to a 20 percent tax on disposals that altogether exceed £12,000 (~$15,600) in the tax year.      But the move by South Korea would bring it closer into line with Japan, which treats cryptocurrencies as a form of miscellaneous income with tax brackets as high as 55 percent, compared to just 20 percent for trading equity. Last summer, the Japanese government said it would take action against traders that it said had not declared cryptocurrency income worth a total of over 10 billion yen ($90.7 million).

42403824,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgprR,1579530627,CoinDesk at WEF 2020: Crypto Themes to Watch as Davos Gets Underway,"CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Below is the first edition of our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos. Subscribe below.      Get your Fourth Industrial Revolution hardhats on – it’s time to ponder the slew of problems ailing today’s global economy!      Hello, it’s Monday, Jan. 20, 2020, the preamble to the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum begins today. I’m Zack Seward, managing editor of CoinDesk, and I’ll be your guide to all things blockchain and crypto at this yearly confab of global leaders and their many hangers-on.      Weather Forecast: Fresh snowfall on Saturday and Sunday has the skiers happy. ⛷      For Monday, a high of 25°F (-3°C), low of 13°F (-10°C). Chance of precipitation: 10 percent.    Setting the stage    Blockchain is more prominent on the WEF agenda than in years past but that’s not to say the technology will have a starring role in the Congress Centre itself. The thing to remember about Davos is that there’s the WEF’s main stage (there are 53 heads of state this year, according to the WEF) and dozens of side events.      Sustainability is a major theme of this year’s event, with climate change activist Greta Thunberg arguably being the top speaker (U.S. President Donald Trump is also speaking). And while the WEF programming on Monday is only opening ceremonies, other events will already be in full swing.    Don’t miss…    The Global Blockchain Business Council is a partner of CoinDesk Confidential: Davos. Visit us at the GBBC Lounge at Hotel Europe on the Promenade.      Here are the three crypto-related events on Monday worth knowing about:      1️⃣ Cryptocurrency exchange LATOKEN is hosting the Blockchain Economic Forum at Guggerbach Hall. It kicks off at 15:30 CET with a keynote from Chris Giancarlo, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Hot on the heels of his newly organized efforts to push for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), this session will be one to watch.      2️⃣ Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys chief Joe Lubin is headlining CryptoMountain Rocks at Hotel Morosani Schweizerhof. Kicking off at 14:00 CET, this event promises ample discussion of decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and what to expect in 2020. It’s going to be deeper in the weeds for ethereum fans on the slopes.      3️⃣ The other event is clearly a can’t-miss about which I am not biased at all: the CoinDesk Confidential: Davos Kick-Off Reception. This party starts at 19:00 CET at the GBBC lounge at the Hotel Europe. We’re booked solid but make sure you click Tuesday’s newsletter for tidbits on any notable happenings. We have quite a guest list already including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, ex-CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo and many more.    Sound smart    If you find yourself on a ski lift with a world leader, here are a few conversation starters. WEF insiders know these things to be true:    The specter of Libra has been a catalytic event among the world’s central bankers.  Expedited efforts from the People’s Bank of China to develop the digital yuan have raised geopolitical eyebrows.  As such, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) will dominate the conversation this year.    CBDCs are government-administered, digital versions of sovereign currencies (but don’t have to be decentralized like real cryptocurrencies) and are a necessarily reactive development. The way central bankers see it, a widely used supranational stablecoin (be it Libra or something else) would undermine their ability to influence the economy through monetary policy.      “CBDC” should be a busy square on the WEF 2020 bingo card. Watch this space.    🥇🥈🥉Thought leaderboard 🥇🥈🥉    We’re handing out gongs to the brainiest crypto thought-leaders at Davos this year. We’ll be tracking the usual suspects’ panel appearances, briefings and media spots, so email me at zack@coindesk.com if you’ve noticed someone’s overwhelming brilliance...

We took a stroll Sunday night as work crews were putting the finishing touches on signage and screen displays. A few notes:      Crypto liquidity provider XBTO was the only crypto brand with signage: Last year, a number of crypto companies had “activations” on the Promenade. 2019’s big fish, ethereum venture studio ConsenSys, which had its own Ethereal Lounge on the main drag, is nowhere to be seen in 2020.      The cryptography killer is here: A quantum computer was being set up at the IBM lounge on the Promenade. With “quantum supremacy” being declared by Google late last year, the computing power behind these machines may one day pose an existential threat to cryptographically secured systems.

42403815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpkY,1579528800,Blockstream Co-Founder Joins Bitcoin-Only Startup Rupiver Financial,"Industry veteran Jonathan Wilkins, a co-founder of bitcoin tech startup Blockstream, is joining up-and-coming bitcoin brokerage River Financial as chief security officer (CSO).      River is a bitcoin-only financial institution for buying and selling the digital currency (emphatically not an exchange; it says it's ""for the long-term investor""). Currently available only to testers who have received invites, the San Francisco-based outfit is working on an interface it hopes will be as slick as Jack Dorsey's Square Cash, equipped with automatic recurring buys.      Wilkins brings C-level gravitas and cypherpunk bona fides to River. He was the CSO at Blockstream, an outfit dedicated to improving bitcoin technology with projects such as Liquid, for faster payments between exchanges and a system of satellites used to broadcast bitcoin block data from space.      Early in his career he worked at Zero Knowledge Systems, which built a forerunner to the anonymizing Tor network. (His title there was ""adversary,"" according to his LinkedIn profile.) Later he was a security architect at Microsoft, Zynga and Yelp.      Compared to other Blockstream co-founders who are outspoken on Twitter or often appear in the media, Wilkins has laid low. He's joined River to shepherd the company's security model, a particularly important part of the business, since it is custodial, taking care of users' private keys.      ""By focusing on simplicity and what is best for users in the long term (dollar-cost averaging and holding) instead of pushing altcoins and encouraging more active trading in order to increase fees, River is closer to the historical ideal of a bank,"" said Wilkins. ""I wanted to be part of a company concerned with helping its community grow its wealth and providing an alternative to today's more predatory financial institutions""      River Financial has built its infrastructure from ""the ground up,"" founder and CEO Alexander Leishman said.      ""We're in this in the long term,"" Leishman said, adding that River has already made a couple of big decisions based on Wilkins' ""guidance,"" such as not relying on third-party cloud computing services.      ""It's a lot of work to not do that but we can build a system that we fully control,"" Leishman said.    Laser-like focus    River Financial differs from many services used to buy and sell cryptocurrency in that it's focused solely on bitcoin.      ""We believe bitcoin is going to be the most dominant cryptocurrency. If anything becomes a world money, it's going to be bitcoin,"" Leishman said.      Even adding one cryptocurrency significantly increases the complexity of engineering a system, he said. Other companies managing many tokens are constantly ""putting out fires.""      Plus, working on bitcoin exclusively has allowed River to adopt some cutting-edge technology that other companies don't have the time and energy to look into, Leishman said. ""Bitcoin-only lets us take it to another level no one has ever taken things before.""      River Financial is one of the earliest companies to adopt the lightning network, a speedier payment system that's widely considered a key part of bitcoin's future.      In addition, Leishman said River relies ""heavily"" on Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) so that each user in a multi-signature transaction can sign it from a different hardware device.  For those interested in the nitty-gritty, River Financial software engineer Philip Glazman tweeted a thread outlining many of the technologies it's using and the decisions it made.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/20/blockstream-co-founder-joins-bitcoin-only-startup-rupiver-financial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd28149c578d0b557b8ab3e9160b9ec57cb3b349-1500x942.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403828,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpuO,1579525223,"Palestinian Militant Group Has Received 3,370 Bitcoins in Donations Since 2015: Report","A Palestinian militant group took millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin donations to finance its operations, according to a new report.      Obtained by the Jerusalem Post and reported Sunday, the report from the Israeli International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) found the al-Nasser Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), used bitcoin sent from overseas as a means of funding operations in and out of the Gaza Strip.      ICT researchers linked the group to the bitcoin wallet address, ""1LaNXgq2ctDEa4fTha6PTo8sucqzieQctq,"" which showed ""an irregular increase in the scope of activity"" with more than 4,500 transactions over the past four years.      The report claims the group – which the Jerusalem Post says has links to Hamas – used bitcoin to avoid sanctions, offer a degree of anonymity to donors from overseas and enable cross-border money transfers.      The wallet, which had received a total of nearly 3,370 BTC (almost $29 million at current prices) between October 2015 and July 2019, was also linked to financial website ""cash4ps."" Digging a little deeper, researchers found cash4ps had a bank account with the Islamic National Bank, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization in 2010 for its connection to Hamas.      The Bitcoin Abuse Database linked the wallet to Hamas in February 2019, saying it had been used for ""collecting donations to a terrorist organization.""      The PRC is a coalition of various armed groups, affiliated with Hamas, that has fought for the total reclamation of a state of Palestine from Israel since 2000. Through the al-Nasser Brigades, it is generally considered to be one of the strongest factions in Gaza, with close links to Hamas and Hezbollah. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by both Israel and the U.S.      The al-Nasser Brigades has been active in numerous conflicts with Israel. It was part of a broader group, including Hamas, responsible for the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Shalit was released in 2011 following a prisoner exchange deal.    Funding cut    This isn't the first time Palestinian militant groups have been found to be using cryptocurrencies. One Israeli blockchain analytics firm reported in February 2019 that Hamas may be using a Coinbase wallet address to help with fundraising. The New York Times previously said bitcoin had been used for “tens of thousands of dollars” worth of illicit transactions.      Iran has historically been one of the primary backers for many armed groups in Palestine. The country reportedly donated as much as $23 million every month to Hamas following the group's 2006 victory in the Palestinian legislative elections. But much of this funding was cut in 2013 after Hamas continued supporting the revolution against the Iranian-backed Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.      The ICT researchers connected the bitcoin wallet to various Facebook posts from the al-Nasser-affiliated al-Baraq media, which appealed for support ""due to lack of resources and Iran’s rejection to their request for support.""      As opposition efforts in Syria have faded, Iranian relations with Palestinian armed groups have begun to warm over the past year. Just over a month after the last transaction on the identified bitcoin wallet, Iran increased its monthly payments to Hamas to $30 million in return for assistance gathering intelligence on the missile stockpiles of their ""common enemy"" Israel.      It's unclear if Palestinian militants are continuing to focus on bitcoin as a fundraising mechanism now that many have re-developed stronger ties with Iran.      Economic isolation has also forced many Palestinian businesses to use cryptocurrency to send and receive international payments. CoinDesk previously highlighted that there were up to 20 bitcoin dealers operating in Gaza, each processing as much as $5 million to $6 million per month for clients including charities based overseas as well as domestic businesses or entrepreneurs.      One source at the time said that Hamas' use of bitcoin may very well have helped raise awareness of bitcoin among Palestinians.

42403830,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpxL,1579518368,"After Sudden 8% Drop, Bitcoin Bulls Must Defend Price Support at $8,460","View      Bitcoin's dramatic overnight fall from $9,200 is telling a tale of buyer exhaustion.  A break below Sunday's low of $8,461 would invalidate the recent bullish trend and could yield a drop to $8,200-$8,000. Dips could be short-lived as the longer duration charts are still reporting bullish conditions.  Bitcoin may make another attempt to pass the 200-day average at $9,027 if support at $8,461 continues to holds ground.    Bitcoin’s price rally is looking tired following Sunday’s sudden drop from above $9,000. Even so, the bias remains bullish with support near $8,460 still intact.      The top cryptocurrency by market value ran past the 200-day average at $9,040 during Sunday’s Asian trading hours, raising prospects of a rise to the next major resistance at $9,400.      The ascent, however, was cut short near $9,200 and prices fell sharply by 8 percent to $8,461, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. The majority of the drop occurred around 23:00 UTC.      Since then, the cryptocurrency has been largely confined to a trading range of $8,460 to $8,750.      With the sharp pullback from near $9,200, bitcoin engulfed the price action seen in the previous four trading days. This type of market action after a notable rally or at multi-month highs is indicative of temporary bullish exhaustion.      What matters now is the survival of $8,461 – the level at which the pullback looks to have halted in the last 20 hours. The same level saw bitcoin turn lower on Jan. 8.      Acceptance under that key support would confirm bullish exhaustion and terminate the short-term uptrend.      At press time, bitcoin is trading near $8,640, representing a 4 percent slide on a 24-hour basis.    Daily chart    Bitcoin charted a big bearish outside day candle on Sunday. These occur when the day begins with optimism but ends on a negative note, engulfing preceding day’s price action.      While the pattern is considered a bearish signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of follow-through, preferably a move below the low of the candle.      Should Sunday’s low of $8,461 be breached, chart-driven selling could gather pace, yielding a deeper drop to last Tuesday’s low of $8,104.      However, if the support holds ground, the bulls will likely have scope to inch back toward the 200-day average, currently at $9,027.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin has dived out of the ascending trendline rising from Jan. 3 and Jan. 10 lows in favor of the bears.      The pullback looks to have legs as the breakdown was backed by the highest selling volume (red bar) since Dec. 16.      So, a drop through the support at $8,461 can't be ruled out. That would expose the next support located at $8,200 (horizontal line) and the psychological level of $8,000.    Weekly chart    Bitcoin jumped 6 percent last week, cementing the breakout from the long-term descending channel kicked off by the preceding week’s 11 percent gain.      Further, the 5- and 10-week averages have produced a bullish crossover and the MACD histogram is about to cross over to bullish territory above zero.      With the longer duration chart reporting bullish conditions, any dip to $8,200 or lower, may be short-lived.      The cryptocurrency will remain on track to test October’s high of $10,350, as long as the channel breakout is valid.

In a press release posted on the London Stock Exchange website on Monday, Argo said for its first full year of operation, it generated £8.5 million (just over US$11 million) in revenue, compared with £760,000 ($985,720) in 2018.      The firm listed on the main Market of the London Stock Exchange in August 2018. The figures are unaudited, with the firm expecting to file audited earnings in April.      According to the announcement, in Q4 2019, Argo mined 432 BTC compared with 426 BTC in Q3. The last quarter saw a drop in revenue to £2.66 million, from Q3's £3.63 million, however.      ""The lower quarterly revenue is attributable to a drop in cryptocurrency prices, increased mining difficulty, and unfavourable foreign exchange rates towards the end of the year,"" the company said.      Peter Wall, Argo CEO, said:    ""Our mining operations continued to generate industry-best mining margin in the last quarter despite a softening in market conditions from the previous quarter. Our state-of-the-art mining platform is performing as expected and with the expansion of our mining network on pace, along with the recent rise with the price of Bitcoin, Argo is well-placed for a strong year ahead.""    The firm has been ramping up its mining capacity ahead of the reward halving event due in May, and currently has 13,364 devices. That includes 6,375 Bitmain Antminer T17s installed since Jan. 1. Argo said it is ""on track"" to have another 3,625 T17s up and running by the end of this quarter.      By the firm's estimates, the full expected capacity of 17,000 miners will see the power it contributes to the bitcoin network rise from 380 petahashes to over 650 petahashes.

The startup, founded by well-known Chinese over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong, who's also an investor in Bitfinex and Binance, published an unaudited income statement on Monday as part of its commitment to revealing financial data when it raised $21 million in a token sale last year.      In addition, the 35-member team posted an unaudited balance sheet that shows, as of Dec. 31, it was holding about $168 million of customer assets in its wallets, which accounted for 70 percent of its liability.      While the earning numbers may not appear to be significant, RenrenBit's quarter-by-quarter growth rate is in line with the overall improved crypto market condition in 2019.      The firm reported revenue of $1.4 million in Q4 2019, which is more than four times that seen in Q1. Similarly, it brought home more than $640,000 in profit in the last quarter, after making a net loss of around $175,000 for the first three months of last year.      Founded by Zhao in November 2018, RenrenBit essentially brokers between lenders and borrowers seeking to borrow either Chinese yuan or crypto assets with other digital assets pledged as collateral. The firm makes money by charging around 15 percent of the profits on each loan.      Besides facilitating peer-to-peer lending, RenrenBit lends from its own capital. As of Dec. 31, the company had about $64 million in outstanding loans on its books.      The startup also offers crypto-to-crypto and yuan-to-crypto spot trading in its mobile app. It emerged as part of the growing landscape of crypto lending businesses in China and worldwide.      In July, Renrenbit conducted a sale of its ERC20-based RRB token, raising $21 million in the U.S. dollar-linked tether (USDT) stablecoin. RRB functions much like Binance's BNB token, being tradable and also utilized to offset transaction fees on RenrenBit.

42403807,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgpee,1579503600,How Was It Possible for Bitmain to Oust Its Largest Shareholder Overnight?,"Co-founder Ketuan “Micree” Zhan was stripped of his director role at not only Beijing Bitmain Technology but the cryptocurrency miner maker's parent entity, BitMain Technologies Holding Company, corporate records show.      A filing of the Cayman Islands–incorporated holding company, submitted Dec. 10, reveals Zhan’s role as a board director was “ceased” on Oct. 30. That was one day after rival co-founder Jihan Wu returned to the company’s Beijing office and announced the seeming conclusion to a long-running power struggle.      The takeover may have lasting effects on the world’s largest bitcoin miner maker, which is reportedly filing for an initial public offering in the U.S.      What was known at the time was that Wu took over Zhan’s roles at the Beijing operating subsidiary as a director and legal representative as of Oct. 28. Wu later appeared on stage at a customer event as Bitmain's CEO and chairman.      A second corporate filing, submitted Dec. 19, indicates the holding company still had four directors as of Oct. 29 – including Zhan. But the cessation of Zhan’s role on Oct. 30 would leave the Holding firm’s board with three members: Jihan Wu, Yuesheng Ge (head of Bitmain-tied Matrixport) and Luyao Liu (Bitmain’s CFO).      In fact, Liu is now the Holding firm’s Company Secretary and took over the role from Wu as a legal representative of the Beijing subsidiary on Jan. 2, according to the documents. And it appears this may not be a nominal move: A person close to the company told CoinDesk Liu has indeed taken on a bigger role recently.      Many questions remain about the sudden removal of Bitmain’s largest shareholder. But a third document CoinDesk reviewed – the Holding firm’s Fifth Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (AoA) – sheds some light on the role in the affair of internal rules governing voting dynamics and board meetings.      The AoA also reveals Bitmain’s commitment to external investors to achieve a “Qualified IPO” at designated stock exchanges with an ambitious valuation and offering target.    Director removal    According to Bitmain’s AoA, the company can “appoint and remove a director or directors” via what’s called an Ordinary Resolution – one of the two types of resolutions board meetings can decide to act on. The other type is called a Special Resolution.      By the AoA’s definition, an Ordinary Resolution is a resolution “passed by a simple majority of not less than half of the votes cast by such Members as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy.”      A Special Resolution – while functioning in a similar fashion – should be passed by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the votes cast by those voting, “of which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been duly given,” the AoA said.      The AoA stated that each share of Bitmain – whether it’s ordinary or preferred – gives a holder “the right to receive notice of, attend at and vote” at any general meeting, and “at least five clear days’ notice shall be given.""      More importantly, the Fifth Amended AoA said each Class A ordinary share is entitled to one vote at general meetings while each Class B ordinary share is entitled to 10 votes.      The Holding firm’s (ultimately unsuccessful) Hong Kong IPO filing in 2018 showed only Wu and Zhan hold Class B ordinary shares, with 2.24 billion and 3.98 billion shares, respectively. Other founding members’ ownership was converted to Class A after a 2017 restructuring.      From 2017 to 2018, Bitmain issued Preferred A, B and B+ shares to raise in total more than $700 million from external investors including big-name venture capital firms Sequoia, IDG and Sinovation. The chart below shows Bitmain’s share and voting power structure – at least as of October 2019.    Sixth amendment?    But a major twist allegedly unfolded in November 2019.      Zhan initiated a legal case on Dec. 13 in the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, asking the court to void a decision passed at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) in November.      The decision allegedly reduced Class B ordinary shares’ voting rights from 10 votes per share to just one vote per share, effectively curtailing the co-founders’ voting power. The case was first reported by Bloomberg earlier this month.      But what was not mentioned in the Bloomberg article is a nuance in the originating summons Zhan filed via his controlling company, Great Simplicity Investment Corporation. CoinDesk obtained a copy of the document.      The November meeting passed a special resolution to amend parts of the Fifth Amended AoA to decrease Class B ordinary shares’ voting power, Zhan’s claim said.      That would mean the alleged extraordinary general meeting had to obtain two-thirds of the votes cast by those who were voting to begin with, in order to pass the alleged special resolution.      The Fifth Amended AoA stated the firm “may from time to time by Special Resolution alter or amend the Memorandum or these Articles in whole or part; provided that no such amendment shall affect the special rights attaching to any class of Share without the consent or sanction provided for in these Articles.”      But there’s a catch about the concept of quorum – generally, a minimum number of members are required to be present by person or proxy at a meeting before it can proceed.      While any Bitmain director can convene a general meeting, “No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum of Members is present,” the AoA stated, and defined a quorum as follows:    “Save as otherwise provided in these Articles, one or more Members holding in the aggregate not less than one third of the issued Class B Ordinary Shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum.”    As shown in the chart above, Wu’s 2.2 billion class B shares already counts for 36 percent of the total – just over the “one third” threshold. So even though Zhan's 3.98 billion shares gave him the other 64 percent of the total issued class B, only Wu needed to show up to have a quorum, provided Zhan was at least given notice.      When asked if Zhan was notified, aware of or attended to vote at the alleged EGM, Conyers Dill & Pearman, the law firm representing Zhan, said its client “was not aware of the EGM.”      The law firm added that the shareholding is confidential but its client ""remains a major shareholder.”      The Cayman Islands court has not yet decided on a date for hearing the case but the “hearing might potentially take place after Easter,” Conyers Dill & Pearman said.      Bitmain said it has no comment on this story.    ‘Qualified IPO’    Late last year, it was reported Bitmain filed an IPO application in the U.S., months after its first attempt to list in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell through.      The continued effort to go public is unsurprising given that Bitmain’s AoA contains what’s called Redemption Rights for external shareholders.      The Redemption Rights stated that external investors in the Series A, B and B+ rounds have the right to require Bitmain to “redeem or repurchase all or any part of the Preferred Shares” upon either one of two events.      The first is that a “Qualified IPO” doesn’t occur within five years after the issuance of the B+ Preferred shares, which was around August 2018.      The AoA further defines a “Qualified IPO” as one that, in a nutshell, would give Bitmain a pre-offering market capitalization of not less than $18 billion with proceeds of at least $500 million. And the listing venue should be either the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.      That said, the requirements about the offering size, listing venues and market cap can be revised with consent from “Majority Shareholders and the Majority Preferred Holders,” according to the AoA’s terms.      To put that into perspective, Bitmain’s major rival Canaan Creative, which claims to have about 20 percent of the crypto miner market, successfully listed on the NASDAQ exchange in November. It raised $90 million at a market capitalization of over $1 billion.      The second event listed in the AoA is what’s called a “Material Adverse Effect” resulting from “the occurrence of a breach by any group Company or Founder Parties.” The document defines Founder Parties as, collectively, Wu, Zhan and two corporations that are fully owned by each.      It also sets out the definition of “Material Adverse Effect” as “any event, occurrence, fact, condition, change or development that has had, has or could be reasonably expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, properties assets, operations, results of operations, financial condition, or liabilities of the group company taken as a whole.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/01/20/how-was-it-possible-for-bitmain-to-oust-its-largest-shareholder-overnight,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c63939f0772576e117fc29709aa51d266b5d90d-1400x932.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421791,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXs5G9,1579492800,Why the World Economic Forum Is Creating a Blockchain 'Bill of Rights',"Sheila Warren is the Head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the World Economic Forum. Sumedha Deshmukh is a Project Specialist on the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology team at the World Economic Forum. The opinions expressed here are their own.      If the last few years have taught us one thing, it’s this: Users are not magically protected as technology evolves. Rather, user protection is something that occurs as the result of intention, commitment and deliberate design. Without this dedication from the outset, the trajectory of a technology’s development can, and often does, carry significant and far-reaching consequences.      As blockchain pursuits move from buzzword to business case, the technology is fast approaching an inflection point. With $12.4 billion in projected spending by 2022 and high-profile announcements from actors like Facebook, central banks and global mining and metals companies, the decisions made by builders today will have ripple effects on significant swaths of the population for years to come.      In fact, blockchain has already experienced the consequences of not designing with the rights of users in mind.      In 2017 and 2018, the sudden rise and subsequent fall of initial coin offerings (ICO) provided a case study of what can go wrong with instances of fraud, unsustainable business models and significant losses to non-savvy consumers. For example, one 2018 study identified more than 80 percent of ICOs conducted in 2017 as scams.      This potential for misuse caught the attention of legislators and policymakers, but in many instances it was too late. If blockchain is truly looking to scale in its next phase, repeating these mistakes is not an option.    What’s at stake?    This new wave of development offers an opportunity to correct course. However, if organizations in a rush to act first don’t learn from the past, the technology faces several existential threats:      Risks to users. The world has learned the hard way that bottom-line protections for users need to be considered at the outset of product design, especially when it comes to data. Blockchain’s properties as a foundational technology make these considerations particularly important, given the harm and follow-on effects that can come from potential breaches.      Potential for transformational change can be undermined. Those with sophisticated knowledge may have the opportunity to exploit their advantages – whether to intentionally harm consumers or to suppress the market through anti-competitive actions. This behavior weakens the very premise of decentralization, which was initiated to provide censorship-resistance, privacy and a level playing field for entrants.      Widening existing gaps. Transformation is most likely to happen in places that can leapfrog, like high-growth economies. Despite talk of the potential for financial inclusion, if not designed carefully, blockchain can lead to the further exclusion and exploitation of vulnerable populations.    What can be done?    As with any technology, the ultimate promises and perils of blockchain technology will come down to individual decisions made across its strategy, development and implementation. It’s impossible to control all these design choices but there is still room for alignment among key players on what the minimum standards for the technology should be.    That’s why the World Economic Forum’s Global Blockchain Councilhttps://www.weforum.org/centre-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/global_councils is creating a “Blockchain Bill of Rights: Design Principles for a Decentralized Future.”    The document has been co-designed by some of the foremost leaders in the space.      The goal is to align private-sector leaders, policymakers and consumers in a fundamental vision of how users can and should be protected as blockchain technology develops, particularly around the following pillars:    Agency and interoperability: The right to own and manage data.  Privacy and security: The right to data protection.  Transparency and accessibility: The right to information about the system.  Accountability and governance: The right to understand available recourse.    Acting now, we hope to enable citizens, policymakers and technology users to leverage these principles as they seek to bring greater accountability to the systems that power our societies.      An initial draft of the Blockchain Bill of Rights will be tested at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, from Jan. 21-24, 2020. Over the course of the year, the Council will solicit input into the document via roundtables and interviews.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET | TOKEN SALE,"Sheila Warren, Sumedha Deshmukh",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/20/why-the-world-economic-forum-is-creating-a-blockchain-bill-of-rights,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9d46421236202d7545e8b7574820f1392050f7ee-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
