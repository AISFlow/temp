42377519,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71gaj,1407535826,BitHalo: Smart Contracts Without the Block Chain Bloat,"Bitcoin transactions have been called a “trustless” process, in that the nature of the network removes the need for a middleman to act as a central point of trust between the two exchanging parties. Yet outside of pure peer-to-peer transactions, bitcoin usage requires a great deal of trust in platforms and services that are vulnerable to intrusion, sabotage and failure.  The solution, many agree, is the use of decentralized platforms that mitigate or eliminate points of failure that can cause crippling losses for users and dampen perception of what is still an emerging technology. Next-generation platforms built using digital currency technology concepts are in development, yet several months ago, the first decentralized two-party smart contract quietly entered public beta and has been pushing the boundaries of its original design.  BitHalo  allows two parties to engage in a broad variety of smart contracts without having to pay any fees or overhead costs. In terms of usage, it can be utilized by two companies that want to establish a business contract over a predetermined period or by individuals who want to trade bitcoin or blackcoin, the digital currencies currently supported by the platform.  CoinDesk spoke with developer David Zimbeck, who said that the open-source BitHalo works around several problems that keep smart contracts from being built on top of the bitcoin block chain. The drive to solve these issues has lead to the creation of smart contract platforms like Counterparty and ClearingHouse, as well as the next-generation block chain project Ethereum.  The solution, Zimbeck explained, is maintaining the integrity of the block chain by avoiding bloat, or excess information that can prove problematic for the network and results in a situation where network users have to download and constantly update a massive amount of data.  “Bitcoin actually has a limit on the number of transactions it can send [per block]. The reason for that limit is that they don’t want to send more than you can use on your bandwidth.”  BitHalo avoids this through a peer-to-peer client that connects users directly, using bitcoin and blackcoin has means for value exchange and encrypted email as a means of distributing contract data. Among the potential applications include joint banking accounts, sales escrow, employee contracting and payroll and anonymous transactions.  Simple approach to secure wallets  BitHalo and its sister-client, BlackHalo, allow for the creation of secure multisig wallets that then form the basis for the platform’s extensive smart contract applications. CoinDesk demoed the platform, which can be used to create individual, joint or group wallets.  Once created, the wallets can be used to conduct multi-signature transactions, escrow or other forms of programmed exchange made possible by BitHalo. This type of functionality can also be seen in services like Armory’s Lockbox multi-signature wallet.  With BitHalo, the activation of two private keys is required for any transaction to be allowed and broadcast by the party or parties in control of the wallet. This lets a wallet owner, for example, keep one of the private keys on a secure offline flash drive, enabling a significant degree of security for the user.  Multi-party access to a wallet is also made simple with BitHalo. Wallets created using the client can only be open when the necessary keys are available. If the parties involved want to keep the wallet closed and secure when not in use, these keys can be distributed and stored safely in the meantime. This makes joint accounts – and safeguarding access keys – easy to accomplish.  Decentralized contracting  BitHalo’s design carries implications for both peer-to-peer and marketplace-style e-commerce, enabling buyers and sellers to exchange goods and services using secure, unbreakable contracts. As well, BitHalo gives parties who may not trust or even know each other the ability to engage in fair exchange without the risk of financial loss or fraud.  In order to enforce accountability between two parties that want to establish a contract, BitHalo requires proportional escrow deposits that act as a form of personal insurance.  As shown below, the user interface allows those drafting the contract to set the amount they want to put in escrow and the length of the contract duration. Each party puts in an equal amount, making one side just accountable for the success as the other.  Once established, this connection – with the underlying bitcoin or blackcoin deposit – enables both parties to exchange coins, conduct business or buy and sell goods and services to one another. Parties that receive contract offers can choose to accept or offer a counter-proposal.  As Zimbeck explained:  “Lets say you wanted to employ somebody at $30 an hour. Employees have been known to not work hard and have been known to flake and conversely in many cases, employers don't pay and hold power over employees. So to solve this both employee and employer put up $60 in escrow (a joint account with two keys). Then the employer can pay on the hour or on the milestone for work completed. If either party tries to cheat the deal then they actually lose money.”  Looking ahead  BitHalo is set for an expansive period that will see the completion of BlackHalo’s public beta and the completed development of the BitHalo program. Once finished, the application of smart contracts will be available to both bitcoin and blackcoin users.  Another aspect of the overall project is NightTrader. Currently under active development and part of the BlackHalo beta, the decentralized exchange and trading platform gives users a marketplace for conducting contracts and doing business with new and existing parties. NightTrader also includes an encrypted messaging system that enables parties to securely communicate and do business.  According to Zimbeck, NightTrader is being developed to function as a type of internal search engine for potential contracts. Once integrated, the BitHalo client will support in-house communication for users looking to hire individuals, barter goods or lend money.  As Zimbeck explained, BitHalo is a step toward the type of functionality promised by so-called bitcoin 2.0. He told CoinDesk:  “[BitHalo] is like the ladder or the hammer. It's so simple and without it, there is no way to enforce code or build a house. This program effectively is the foundation of bitcoin 2.0 and best of all, it can be used right now for free.”  The next few months will see the launch of the BitHalo client with a streamlined, easy-to-use interface, as well as the full integration of NightTrader. With a full launch set for the near future, BitHalo will no doubt play a role in the spread of decentralized exchange platforms within the broader bitcoin community.

Hungary-based bitcoin enthusiast and CoinTerra vice president of Software Enterprise Tamas Blummer lauded the news as a significant development for the local bitcoin market and for local digital currency consumers.  Blummer, whose Hungarian bitcoin startup Bits of Proof was acquired by CoinTerra earlier this year, told CoinDesk:  ""220volt is a well-known electronics retailer in the country. I congratulate BitPay for opening up the market.""  The blog post went on to instruct customers on how to make bitcoin payments, while easing concerns about possible overpayment on purchases and directing interested readers to Hungarian-language digital currency resources.  $50 million merchant  In addition to its online presence, 220volt also has five physical retail locations in prominent Hungarian cities, including three in its capital and largest city, Budapest.  One of the country's largest e-commerce electronics stores, it is also one of the most well-reviewed, according to analysis from WebShopExperts.hu.  The website assessed 220volt on a host of factors including its web layout, mobile website and delivery and payment methods, giving it an overall rating of 6.6 out of 10, or third among the five e-commerce offerings it analyzed.  The company is privately held, and earns revenue of roughly $50m annually, according to Blummer.  BitPay in Europe  The news is also notable for BitPay, which in recent months has aimed to capture a larger share of the European market.  The Georgia-based merchant processor opened a new headquarters in Amsterdam in April, and then-CEO and current executive chairman Tony Gallippi made Europe a focal point of his comments following the company's $20m funding round in May.  At the time, Gallippi told CoinDesk:  “We’ve got a head of business development in Europe, and we’re going to be looking to add more resources to North America, South America and Europe to build our business and acquire more merchants.”  Hat tip to r/bitcoin  Tablet image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/08/hungarys-220volt-now-accepts-bitcoin-for-laptops-tablets-tvs-and-more,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e49a8f8175d294e4456c510c413a2741b73b71aa-1711x751.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377514,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71gWx,1407511196,"ChangeTip Brings Bitcoin Micropayments to YouTube, Google+ and Tumblr","Bitcoin tipping platform ChangeTip has announced that it is expanding its service to YouTube, Tumblr and Google+.  The platform already supports bitcoin micropayments on social media sites like Twitter, Reddit and StockTwits – a popular network for traders and investors.  Dubbed a 'love button for the Internet', ChangeTip lets users gift friends and content providers with small amounts of bitcoin as a more tangible alternative to the usual ‘like’ or ‘+1’.  The ChangeTip team is hoping to leverage the low cost of bitcoin transactions and enable the use of micro-tips for all sorts of content distributed online, so, as well as tipping appealing content, the service can be used for gifting or even fundraising via social media. Content monetisation for blogs and other media is also an option.  “We believe people are basically good and we let them show their appreciation directly in everyday social media interactions,” said Nick Sullivan, ChangeTip’s founder and CEO.  The platform says it wants to change the concept of a ""share"" or ""like"" into financial appreciation which, incrementally, can add up to substantial amounts of money.  How ChangeTip works  In order to send a tip, users must simply connect one or more of their social media accounts to ChangeTip, then top up their wallet balance using the QR code provided.  Once their account is set up, users can send a bitcoin tip by including '@changetip' and the relevant amount in a comment on their Google+, YouTube or Tumblr post.  The ChangeTip robots then complete the transaction and notify the 'tippee' with an automated comment:  Flexible tip amounts  As well as specific fiat amounts, tips are also denominated in everyday itemshttps://www.changetip.com/tip-amounts, including a 'coffee' ($1.50), a 'hamburger' ($2.50) and – bizarrely – a 'kitten' ($3.00).  Users can also create their own custom denominations, such as ‘3 beers' or ‘2 coffees'. More elaborate denominations, like 'a trip to Paris' are also possible, within limits. The default maximum tip is $25, but this can be adjusted in the user's account settings.  If multiple values are specified in the tip, ChangeTip will send the smallest one. In other words something like 'beer, beer, beer, kebab' would not work as intended, although it could sound like a tempting proposition.  The lowest amount that can be withdrawn from a user's ChangeTip account is 10,000 satoshis (or about $0.05 at the current exchange rate) and withdrawals occur within 24 hours. The company explains that all tips are refunded if they are not claimed within seven days.  While the service is currently free, ChangeTip says that from 15th September there will be a 1% fee to withdraw bitcoin from wallets.

42377502,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71gJ7,1407502835,Huobi Bets Big on Multisig With Quickwallet Acquisition,"Bitcoin-litecoin exchange Huobi has acquired multi-signature wallet Quickwallet and China's leading BTC/LTC block explorer Qukuai.com.  The company said the acquisition puts it on track to not only become the number one secure bitcoin storage option for the Chinese market, but to gain a significant share of the international market as well.  Quickwallet  CEO Zhang Jian will become Huobi's vice president of technology and will have overall responsibility for the company's new business development.  Significance of the deal  Huobi's  Robert Kuhne told CoinDesk the acquisitions served a dual purpose:  ""This is just the start of Huobi implementing a comprehensive strategy, not only to expand its own business, but to promote the development of the whole industry in China.""  The exact price Huobi paid remains undisclosed, but the company invoked the name of BitGo as an example of its potential reach. BitGo, the ""world's first multi-signature wallet"" made headlines in June with some high-profile hires and investment totalling $12m.  Huobi's rapid expansion plans  Quickwallet was launched on 15th July, but such is the intensity of competition and speed of growth in China that Huobi CEO Leon Li decided to bring it immediately into Huobi's family of services.  As well as Huobi's primary exchange business, that family also includes Hong Kong-based margin trading platform BitVC and its interest-bearing wallet 'Yubibao', which opened to the public just this week after a six-week beta phase.  Huobi will keep the Quickwallet brand separate to its other offerings, but will adjust it to integrate more closely with the other services. Block explorer Qukuai (Mandarin for 'block') was created by the same team as Quickwallet, and was included in the deal.  As soon as the acquisition was finalized, Huobi's team set about translating the new services into English for users outside China.  Kuhne said:  ""The strategy is to have a family of products/services with unique brand identities (Huobi, BitVC, Quickwallet, and more soon to come), but that are mutually-reinforcing and reach the same high standard of convenience, security and aesthetic quality that users want.""  Already users can make instant deposits from Quickwallet to Huobi exchange accounts, and clicking on a transaction link takes them automatically to Qukuai to see the block chain.  The system supports both bitcoin and litecoin, even allowing users to receive both kinds of coin to the same address.  The benefits of a multi-signature wallet  All multi-signature (or 'multisig') wallet addresses start with the number three and neither the user nor wallet company may access or spend the funds without the other's approval/private key.  The concept of multisig wallets has been around for a while, but very few companies have actually implemented it in consumer products.  Quickwallet employs a 'two-of-two' multisig system, meaning one private key is retained by the user locally, while the other is stored on Quickwallet's servers. This means a user cannot double-spend and, as a result, they can get instant confirmation of transfers to other Quickwallet users and deposits to Huobi exchange accounts.  This also makes Huobi the first bitcoin exchange to offer instantaneous deposits from an on-blockchain wallet.  Even if a user's private key is hacked and/or stolen, the thief cannot gain control of the funds. Also, this means no one at Huobi or BitVC has the power to take the coins.  Kuhne added:  ""When the user makes a transaction, his private key is encrypted in the browser just like Blockchain.info, so Quickwallet never sees it.""  Some multisig implementations have a third key, which is also retained by the user or a third-party for extra security. In this instance, two of the three keys are required to spend or transfer funds.

42377499,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71gFL,1407498506,Hackers Reroute ISP Traffic to Steal $83k in Bitcoins,"Hackers have managed to reroute raw internet traffic from numerous internet service providers (ISPs) in an attempt to steal bitcoins.  Dell SecureWorks  says it has identified a total of 19 ISPs affected. Data used by Amazon, DigitalOcean and OVH was compromised in the attack.  Each incident lasted just 30 seconds, but the hacker managed to carry out the attack 22 times over the course of four months. The ultimate goal was to seize control of bitcoin miners, organised in mining pools.  Stealing up to $9,000 a day  The attacks appear to have been successful. Dell SecureWorks reports that up to $9,000 in bitcoin and altcoins such as dogecoin was stolen per day.  During the attack, miners believed they were still mining for their pool, while the flow of cryptocurrency generated by their mining operations redirected elsewhere. Researchers believe the culprits employed BGP hijacking to redirect the traffic, using spoofed commands to redirect traffic from ISPs.  The hackers used a staff user account belonging to a Canadian ISP, but the researchers do not know whether the hack was orchestrated by an ISP employee or someone from outside the company. A detailed description of the attack is available on the SecureWorks blog.  Researcher Pat Litke said this sort of attack can easily grab a ""large collection of clients"" in next to no time.  “It takes less than a minute, and you end up with a lot of mining traffic under your control,” he told Wired.  Six-figure damages?  The researchers concluded that around $83,000 worth of cryptocurrency was stolen in the attacks, though this is not the final tally.  According to the research team, this particular type of attack is difficult to replicate as the attacker must have access to an ISP. Therefore, Dell SecureWorks does not expect such attacks to be widespread.  This is not the first time Dell SecureWorks has tackled security threats related to bitcoin. Earlier this year the firm published a report identifying 146 strains of bitcoin malware. It also issued a number of warnings involving vulnerable browser extensions and other software.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | DOGE | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/08/hackers-reroute-isp-traffic-to-steal-83k-in-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bf0f547cbb38f19389ecad92875b018080350d4-1250x823.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377505,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX71gLd,1407494206,Andorran Digital Currency Summit Will 'Unite World's Financial Elite',"A new cryptocurrency conference is set to take place this autumn in the Principality of Andorra, a 'microstate' that lies in the eastern Pyrenees mountains between France and Spain.  Although the population of Andorra is under 90,000, organiser Alex Puig says the location is suited to a high-level summit as ""banking and financials are at the heart of [this] small but rich country"".  Titled the Digital Currency Summit, the event is aimed to be a coming together of the world's ""financial elite"" – investors, lawyers, politicians and bankers – to discuss the ground-breaking technology behind digital currencies.  Notably, the event's organisers says it will be one of the first crypto conferences to focus on regulation, finance and investment.  Headline speakers at the summit include Jan Kees de Jager, former Dutch Finance Minister, and David Andolfatto of the United States Federal Reserve Bank. The pair will give talks on the 'Global Impact of Cryptocurrencies' and 'Digital Currrencies : Threat or Opportunity?', respectively.  Knowledge and networking  According to the organisers, one of the main reasons for scheduling another digital currency event, in what is becoming an increasingly packed industry calendar, was to ""answer all the questions that have arisen from the increase of cryptocurrency exchanges"".  The summit will try to demystify digital currencies with talks, workshops and debates on bitcoin, as well as other cryptocurrencies like litecoin and ripple. Furthermore, the DCS will also give attendees a chance to network with others with an interest in digital currencies.  ""We will teach everything you need to know about cryptocurrencies from scratch,"" said Puig, adding that the event will target big companies who can benefit most from digital currency technology.  The lectures will focus on four main areas: introduction, investment opportunities, regulation and finance, alongside keynotes and panel discussions lead by international specialists in the fields of finance, law and investment.  Andorra's Digital Currency Summit will take place from the 17th-19th September at the Palace of Congresses in Andorra la Vella.  Early bird tickets are now sold out, but regular tickets are available via the summit's website.
