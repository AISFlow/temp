42428626,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Srh,1519855220,Germany Won't Tax You for Buying Coffee With Bitcoin,"Germany won't tax bitcoin users for using the cryptocurrency as a means of payment, the Ministry of Finance has said.  The guidance, published Tuesday, sets Germany apart from the U.S., where the Internal Revenue Service treats bitcoin as property for tax purposes – which means that if an American buys a cup of coffee with bitcoin, it's technically considered a sale of property and potentially subject to capital gains tax.  Instead, Germany will regard bitcoin as the equivalent to legal tender for tax purposes when used as a means of payment, according to a new document.  The Bundesministerium der Finanzen based its guidance on a 2015 European Union Court of Justice ruling on value added taxes (VAT).  The court ruling creates a precedent for European Union nations to tax bitcoin while providing exemptions for certain types of transactions.  Notably, the new German document justified its tax decisions by regarding cryptocurrencies a legal method for payment, stating:  “Virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies, e.g., Bitcoin) become the equivalent to legal means of payment, insofar as these so-called virtual currencies of those involved in the transaction as an alternative contractual and immediate means of payment have been accepted.”  For tax purposes, this means that converting bitcoin into a fiat currency or vice versa is “a taxable miscellaneous benefit.” When a buyer of goods pays with bitcoin, an article of the EU's VAT Directive will be applied to the price of bitcoin at the time of the transaction, as documented by the seller, according to the document.  However, as per the EU ruling, the actual act of converting a cryptocurrency to fiat or vice versa is classified as a ""supply of services,"" and therefore a party acting as an intermediary for the exchange will not be taxed.  Payment fees sent to digital wallet providers or other services can likewise also be taxed, according to the document.  Other aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem will not be taxed. Miners who receive block rewards will not be taxed, as their services are considered to be voluntary, according to the document.  Similarly, exchange operators that buy or sell bitcoin in their own name as an intermediary will receive a tax exemption, though an exchange operating as a technical marketplace will not receive any such exemption.    2018 02 27 Umsatzsteuerliche Behandlung Von Bitcoin Und Anderen Sog Virtuellen Waehrungen by CoinDesk on Scribd    Editor’s note: Statements in this article were translated from German.

Loans will be issued in bitcoin, ether, ether classic, XRP, bitcoin cash and zcash among others.  ""We believe now is a great time to offer an institutional-focused lending service because it will increase general liquidity in the marketplace, encourage new financial institutions to participate in a two-sided market and increase the working capital that companies use to scale their digital currency-centric businesses,"" Genesis Capital said in a press release.  The company suggests that investors could use its lending capacity to ""hedge total portfolio risk or take speculative short positions,"" but it also envisions other use cases for the service.  One such example, the company explained in the statement, could be remittance companies that ""need to make immediate settlements to their customers, but don't want to buy a large balance of bitcoin and hold that risk on their books.""  Genesis Capital has already attracted notable clients such as BlockTower Capital, an existing client of the parent trading company, and DV Chain, a crypto trading firm.  ""The majority of trading volume in several cryptocurrencies is denominated in bitcoin, which has created a need for a bitcoin lending market,"" DV Chain CEO Garrett SEE told CNBC.  Genesis' move into crypto lending is the latest addition of institutional services in a market that has also recently seen the launch of bitcoin futures trading and increased interest in bitcoin exchange-traded funds.

In its most recent annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the digital payments company wrote that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the U.S. accounting standard for public companies, offers no specific guidance for cryptocurrencies. This makes it difficult for Square to know how to report its profits or losses from cryptocurrency transactions.  Moreover, the document suggested that auditors or regulators could disagree with how Square accounted for cryptocurrencies. The filing continued:  “The accounting can be complex and subject to challenge or scrutiny. The final conclusions on the accounting treatment for our cryptocurrency transactions could affect the presentation of our results of operations.”  In other words, if Square gets it wrong, then the company may have to restate its financials, which could hurt its stock price or operations.  Last month, the payment platform introduced bitcoin buying and selling to most states through the Cash App, allowing users to send payments in the cryptocurrency to friends and family, as previously reported.  Other risks  Additionally, Square also noted other regulatory difficulties that could arise from its bitcoin buy/sell feature.  In its filing, Square said that it does not think its bitcoin service qualifies as offering securities to its customers, meaning it should not fall under state or federal securities regulations.  Similarly, the company does not see itself as a broker-dealer or investment advisor as defined by U.S. securities laws, or as a commodities dealer.  While Square believes these conclusions are accurate, “the regulation of cryptocurrency and crypto platforms is still an evolving area and it is possible that a court or a federal or state regulator could disagree with one or more of these conclusions,” the company wrote.  “If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences,"" the company went on. ""Further, we might not be able to continue operating the feature, at least in current form, and to the extent that the feature is viewed by the market as a valuable asset to Square, the price of our Class A common stock could decrease.""  Square is one of several prominent financial services companies that have added discussions of crypto, blockchain or distributed ledger technology to the ""risk factors"" sections of their annual filings this month. Others include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.  Companies often take a ""kitchen sink"" approach to these passages, including a variety risks that they may consider remote – but material enough to warrant investors' attention.

The process was successful, Kroeker said, continuing on to say:  “Going from that PoC in 2016, we’re at the tipping point of getting our customers involved in live transactions in the coming weeks and months. The technology has come a long way, we’re much more comfortable with its security and scalability.”  Many of HSBC's clients have begun the process of digitizing their operations, but letters of credit is one area where most have difficulty, he said.  ""This product is one of the first we’re going to pilot, which is going to be exciting,"" he said.  The bank is currently integrating customers into its pilot programs. Should they prove successful, the projects will be fully implemented into live production environments, though this step will require additional work on both the blockchain application and the network, Kroeker said.  Currently, the plan is to launch a live network in early 2019, according to GTR.

42428623,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Slh,1519840839,Meet the 'Sovereign': Marshall Islands Government to Issue Crypto Token,"Another country is planning to create its own cryptocurrency.  The Republic of the Marshall Islands intends to issue the Sovereign, or SOV, to supplement the U.S. dollar as its legal tender.  Legislators for the Pacific island nation (2011 population: 53,158) passed the Declaration and Issuance of the Sovereign Currency Act 2018 on February 26th.  ""The purpose of this Act is to declare and issue a digital decentralized currency based on blockchain technology as legal tender of the Republic of Marshall Islands,"" reads the bill, posted in the Sovereign's official Telegram channel. The bill goes on to say that the currency will be issued by the nation's Ministry of Finance and introduced via an initial coin offering (ICO).  Hilda C. Heine, the country's president, was quoted in Finance Magnates as saying:  ""This is a historic moment for our people, finally issuing and using our own currency, alongside the USD. It is another step of manifesting our national liberty.""  Neema  , an Israeli startup that facilitates international money transfers via an app, will develop the underlying technology of the new cryptocurrency using a public protocol called ""Yokwe.""  The protocol is designed to mitigate know-your-customer and financial crime concerns by linking accounts to real, government-verified identities, according to an article CTech, an Israeli technology news site.  ""We all dreamt of this day, when the first country goes crypto,"" Barak Ben-Ezer, CEO and founder of Neema, and Roye Rahav, another individual involved in the project, wrote in a post in the Telegram channel.  ""Once we achieve success, the SOV will bring us several steps closer to a free, more liberated world. In which money flows peer to peer, instantly and cost effectively, and no ruler can arbitrarily print more of it,"" Ben-Ezer and Rahav added.  The government reportedly intends to use its ICO proceeds to bolster its coffers ahead of the termination of U.S. reparations payments, which amount to $30 million a year, meant to compensate islanders for the United States using site as a nuclear weapons testing ground in the 1940s and 1950s.  According to CTech, 70 percent of the funds raised will be used to offset gaps in the budget expected post-reparations. Ten percent will be devoted to sustainability projects related to climate change and green energy, and the remainder of the proceeds will be distributed to Marshallese citizens.  But the Republic of the Marshall Islands is not the first nation to turn to cryptocurrencies to supplement its funds, though it maintains that it's different from the rest.  The Venezuelan government launched the pre-sale of its controversial petro coin earlier in February, a move that U.S. legislators say was designed to evade international sanctions.  A Marshall Islands press release emphasized, however, that the Sovereign is different from the Petro because the Republic is a ""close ally of the U.S,"" and the currency's price will be determined by the market while the Petro's price is pegged to oil.  Iran  is also exploring a possible state-issued cryptocurrency, while Russia has entertained the notion of a ""crypto-ruble.""

In its annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank noted the potential impact that cryptocurrencies could have on payment processing under its “risk factors” section, saying the institution could be disrupted by the still nascent technology.  The bank wrote:  “Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies.”  The comment echoes those made in the Bank of America (BoA) and Goldman Sachs annual filings. Both financial giants also included cryptocurrencies under their risk factors sections, though for various reasons.  Like JPMorgan Chase, BoA noted that clients could choose to use digital currencies instead of traditional banking services and crypto competition could force it to adopt new technologies.  Goldman Sachs  took a similar tack, saying in its filing that the company could become “exposed to risks related to distributed ledger technology” due to how clients are turning to new financial products.  However, BoA also included concerns about following anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations, given the lack of regulatory oversight on cryptocurrencies.  This is the first time JPMorgan has included cryptocurrencies in its annual filing – the term did not appear in prior years. The declaration is notable both because of its timing, and because not so long ago, the bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud,"" saying that cryptocurrency markets were in a bubble that would eventually collapse.  While he later said he regretted the comments, he has not retracted his view of a possible impending collapse.

Bloomberg reports today that the CFTC’s general counsel, Daniel Davis, gave the go-ahead in a memo earlier this month, apparently in response to “numerous inquiries” from employees about whether they could do so.  While members of the agency can now invest in cryptocurrencies, they are still prohibited from crypto futures or margin trading, and from using insider information gleaned through their jobs, the news source says.  A spokesperson for CFTC chair J. Christopher Giancarlo also told the news organization that employees cannot investigate or participate in regulatory actions involving cryptocurrencies they own due to the “conflict of interest.”  Cryptocurrencies are to be traded like any other commodity, according to Bloomberg. Davis' memo also emphasizes the need for employees to act ethically, stating:  “In this environment, the situation is ripe for the public to question the personal ethics of employees engaging in cryptocurrency transactions. Please keep in mind that you must endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that you are violating the law or government and commission ethical standards.”  However, some legal experts are questioning the decision, Bloomberg notes. Angela Walch, an associate law professor with a specialization in digital money and financial stability at St. Mary’s University, called the decision “mind-boggling,” saying the decision “could absolutely skew their regulatory decisions.”  Similarly, Richard Painter, a securities lawyer and former White House ethics lawyer, said cryptocurrencies are functionally more similar to futures than commodities. The CFTC should not be allowing its employees to invest in them, he said, arguing the move “just looks terrible.”  Still, a law professor at Washington University, Kathleen Clark, said the move makes sense. Because cryptocurrencies are currently classified as commodities, current “ethics standards seem to be general enough to cover it.”  CFTC sign image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/02/28/cftc-gives-green-light-for-employees-to-trade-cryptocurrencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5aabdb0710d218ab04ecd4e070855f9f5f681f5b-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421807,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXtyJx,1519826449,No Blockchain Is an Island,"Primavera De Filippi is a permanent researcher at the CERSA/CNRS/Université Paris II, a faculty associate at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School, the ""alchemist"" for DAOstack and a co-author of “Blockchain and the Law.”     Much discussion is currently taking place concerning the nature and specificities of blockchain governance, but when we say ""blockchain governance"" we’re really talking about multiple things.  While people often use the term to describe the mechanism by which the underlying protocol of a blockchain-based network can be modified or updated – in terms of both on-chain and off-chain governance – we focus here on a much broader question:  What are the various elements or forces that influence the governance of blockchain-based networks or applications?  Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig identifies four different forces that influence behavior: law, social norms, markets, and architecture (i.e., technical infrastructure or code). In doing so, he underlines the fact that we cannot focus solely on the rules specifically designed to govern or regulate one particular individual.  Rather, we need to take a larger ecosystemic approach, looking at various forces that influence that individual. Accordingly, when it comes to promoting or precluding certain behaviors, we might choose to directly regulate individuals via the legal system or indirectly regulate them through one of the other three forces (markets, social norms, and architecture).  We propose such an ecosystemic approach to identify the different levers that could influence the operations of a blockchain-based system and the extent to which these levers contribute to the broader notion of “blockchain governance.”  Blockchain-based applications do not exist in a vacuum. They subsist within a larger ecosystem of internet applications, each operating according to its own protocols and rules.  The internet layer  In particular, the operations of a blockchain-based system – whether it is a blockchain-based network, platform, or application – are defined by the rules that govern these systems but also respond to the different layers of the internet infrastructure, which to a different extent contribute to shaping the systems' overall governance.  Specifically, blockchain-based networks like bitcoin and ethereum operate on top of the internet and ultimately depend on protocols like the TCP/IP, which is responsible for routing and transferring packets of information between different nodes on the network. These blockchain-based networks thus cannot operate without internet connectivity.  Most critically, because internet service providers (ISPs) ultimately control the transportation layer of the internet, they could discriminate against packets coming from or directed toward a blockchain-based network, effectively tampering with its operations.  Internet governance can therefore have a significant impact on the operations of a blockchain-based network. Particularly relevant in this context is the “net neutrality” debate. The practice of packet discrimination makes it possible for ISPs to favor certain blockchain-based networks, at the expense of others.  More radically, if a government were to ban a particular blockchain-based network, it could require all ISPs operating within its national boundaries to block or filter traffic coming from or directed to that network – e.g., through mechanisms such as deep packet inspection (DPI) or other traffic detection techniques.  Accordingly, while internet governance is external to the blockchain ecosystem (in that its scope is much broader), regulating the internet infrastructure could indirectly affect the operations of a blockchain-based system.  The blockchain layer  Similar problems emerge within a singular blockchain-based network.  While ISPs are responsible for routing packets through the internet, according to specific protocols (e.g., TCP/IP and BGP), miners on a blockchain-based network are responsible for validating and recording transactions into the underlying blockchain, according to a particular protocol (e.g., the bitcoin protocol), consensus algorithm and fork-choice (e.g, bitcoin’s proof-of-work protocol stipulates that miners should always add to the “longest chain” as defined by the amount of hashing power required to compute the chain).  Today, this task of processing transactions is driven mostly by an economic incentive system, whereby the higher the transaction fees paid to the network, the greater the chance for these transactions to be included into the next block.  But transaction fees and mining rewards – albeit a fundamental incentive for miners – are not the only factors that might influence the behavior of miners. Other levers might come into play, stemming from the outside of the blockchain infrastructure.  For instance:  Markets: What would prevent a large mining pool from entering into an (off-chain) agreement with third parties, in order to speed up the inclusion of certain transactions at the expense of others?  Social norms: Could miners collectively agree that specific transactions coming from or directed towards a criminal dapp [decentralized application] will not be processed into a block?  Laws: Could regulators stipulate that all miners located in particular jurisdictions are prohibited from validating transactions pertaining to a specific dapp or account?  Architecture: Might the Great Firewall of China be constructed to limit the ability of miners in China to handle larger blocks?  These external forces, existing beyond the control of any given blockchain-based application, could force radical consequences over the operations of that particular dapp.  The application layer  It becomes clear that the governance of a particular blockchain-based network could directly or indirectly affect the operations of a particular blockchain-based application running on top of that network.  Even if dapps can be designed to be completely autonomous—in the sense that no single party has the power to control or influence their operations—they remain affected by the operations of the underlying blockchain network and the specific set of protocols that establish its modus operandi.  The governance of a blockchain-based network could be leveraged toward censoring some of the transactions directed to these dapps, or even altering their operations by modifying their code through a hard fork.  This is precisely what happened after The DAO hack, when 3.6 million ether were drained from The DAO’s account due to a code vulnerability. The ethereum community responded by intervening with a coordinated action to modify the ethereum blockchain protocol. By transferring funds from The DAO to another smart contract, a mechanism was provided for returning the siphoned funds back to the original owners.  This extreme remedy has been heavily criticized. Some saw it as a betrayal of the “immutability” and “incorruptibility” of the ethereum blockchain (i.e., the “code is law” paradigm).  Going deeper into the stack, there are the various blockchain-based platforms on top of which people can deploy their own dapps.  Some dapps sit directly on top of a blockchain-based network. For example, Gnosis is implemented as smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain. Others are deployed on top of a dapps framework such as DAOstack, which implements its own protocol for creating and maintaining dapps.  While most decentralized blockchain-based applications come with their own sets of rules, they also depend and therefore must follow the rules of the platform on which they operate. This may give rise to two distinct types of problems.  One is that if there is a flaw in one of these smart contract platforms, the flaw will affect all blockchain-based applications that rely on the platform. Recall the bug in Parity's multisignature smart contracts, which led to the theft of over $30 million worth of ether, followed by a subsequent attack on Parity’s revised multisignature smart contract code, which had been brought to “selfdestruct,” thereby freezing the funds in all multisig wallets that depended on this shared code.  Another problem emerges by construction, when platforms implement “proxy” contracts that delegate calls to other smart contracts, which can be updated by the platform developers. While such practices are still uncommon, some platforms (e.g. Zeppelin Solutions) are starting to experiment with proxy libraries so that, whenever one of the underlying functions is changed, all dapps relying on these libraries will automatically inherit those changes.  While this provides many benefits in terms of flexibility and upgradability, such a design can be problematic to the extent that it relies on a trusted authority (i.e., the smart contract platform operator) that could arbitrarily influence the operations of these so-called decentralized applications.  (Note that the DAOstack framework does not actually provide such a feature. The set of smart contracts provided by the framework, once deployed, cannot be arbitrarily changed by the platform operators. While DAOstack might, over time, offer a series of upgrades to some of the platform’s smart contracts, these upgrades cannot be automatically implemented without the consent of the platform’s users.)  With this in mind, we might reframe our understanding of “blockchain governance” to include not only the rules specifically meant to regulate the operations of a particular blockchain-based network or application, but also the rules that contribute to regulating the underlying infrastructure on which these blockchain-based systems operate – which themselves operate on top of another infrastructure, and so on.  As the saying goes, it is turtles all the way down.

In an announcement Tuesday, SBI said that, while the new platform – called SBI Virtual Currencies – has already started offering account registrations to certain priority investors, it will postpone applications from ordinary customers and thus push forward the date for the start of trading.  In a brief explanation of the reasons for its delay, the platform said it will need more time to ""further strengthen security measures,"" as well as determine how to manage asset custody, and finalize its customer management system.  The announcement marks the latest update in what has been a rather lengthy move toward the launch of Japan's first bank-backed cryptocurrency exchange.

Yet, in December of last year, the firm postponed its schedule for accepting account registrations from the general public.  While the stated security concerns may not be related, the latest delay also comes soon after the FSA increased its scrutiny over Japan's cryptocurrency exchanges – especially regarding security issues – as a result of a recent hack in the country.  On Jan. 26, the Coincheck exchange announced that some $530 million-worth of NEM tokens had been stolen, an event that led to an FSA investigation and demands for improved security across all crypto exchanges.

According to Japanese media outlet Sankei, an additional 132 investors have joined a class action suit filed with the Tokyo District Court on Feb. 27 that seeks a refund of about 228 million yen (around $2.1 million) in cryptocurrency.  The new case again puts Coincheck in the spotlight once more, as the exchange has yet to disclose details of how it plans to compensate victims who saw some $530 million-worth of NEM tokens stolen from the exchange on Jan. 26.  As reported, following the heist, Coincheck said it would refund victims with its existing capital. Yet, the claim has drawn attention from Japan's financial watchdog, which said it will conduct an on-site inspection to determine the firm's capability of repaying such a large amount.  Seven Coincheck customers previously filed a class action – the first against the platform – on Feb. 15, according a Reuters report.  That case sought damages of $183,000 in cryptocurrency assets, and also demanded that Coincheck pay 5 percent annualized interest on the amount until a refund is possible.  Currently, Coincheck has only reinstated the withdrawal of Japanese yen on its platform, prompting an immediate outflow equivalent to $373 million on the first day of resumption on Feb. 14.  Meanwhile, the platform's plan for cryptocurrency withdrawals and compensation are still unclear.

Mayor Jesse Arreguin and councilman Ben Bartlett have teamed up with San-Francisco-based investment startup Neighborly to advance an initiative that would divide municipal bonds into micro-bonds and then sell them as tokens in what they call an ""initial community offering.""  ""Essentially, we would like to explore some new ways of financing because we have terrific needs, and we're concerned about our ability to fulfill our moral and legal obligations for our residents here,"" Bartlett said, according to CityLab, adding:  ""The resistance requires a coin.""  Bartlett and Arreguin said that breaking up the bonds would allow people to invest in projects of their choosing in low denominations. Meanwhile, transferring the buying and selling process to a blockchain would mean reduced transaction costs and transparent city finances.  Because the tokens would be backed by the underlying bond, Bartlett says the initial community offering would be less risky than a typical ICO.  Likewise, Neighborly CEO Jase Wilson said, ""Berkeley is an extremely strong and fiscally disciplined borrower.""  The project's backers hope that by selling the micro-bond tokens, they will eventually be able to fund affordable housing projects, but they plan to start with smaller ventures, such as purchasing an ambulance for a fire station. They hope to hold their ICO in May.  ""This municipal coin, this token, whatever you want to call it, it's meant to...hopefully produce a really demonstrable new paradigm of shared prosperity,"" Bartlett said.

42428638,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9TJh,1519812624,Bitcoin Brushes $11K as Bull Case Strengthens,"Having tested $11,000 this morning, bitcoin (BTC) is now trading roughly sideways for the month, but could still enter March on a positive note.  CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) clocked a seven-day high of $11,044 at 06:30 UTC and was last seen around $10,610. Due to the retreat from the intra-day high, the cryptocurrency is now trading largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, according to data source CoinMarketCap.  With BTC closing last month at $10,221, the cryptocurrency is on track to close the current month with only marginal gains, unless the bulls make progress.  In context, though, the performance is impressive if we take into account the fact that bitcoin had dropped to three-month lows below $6,000 on Feb. 6. However, the ""V""-shaped recovery looks to have run out of steam around the $11,000 mark for the second time in seven days.  Further, daily trading volume has averaged around $7.73 billion from Feb. 7 to date, compared to a January average of $13.42 billion, as per CoinMarketCap. The drop in the daily average trading volume during the recovery period could be an indication of a lack of confidence among investors about the sustainability of the corrective rally.  That said, volumes will likely rise if BTC sees longer-term bullish reversal via a break above the confluence of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline and the descending trendline resistance.  Daily chart  Meanwhile, the odds of the pair completing the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern would drop if bitcoin closes (as per UTC) below the downward sloping (bearish biased) 50-day MA, currently seen at $10,512.  Moreover, the pullback from the intra-day highs above $11,000 could be attributed to the bearish price-relative strength index (RSI) divergence seen on the hourly chart below.  1-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) also shows a bullish 50-hour MA, 100-hour MA crossover and a bullish 50-hour MA and 200-hour MA crossover. So, despite the bearish price RSI divergence, the downside will likely be capped around the upward sloping 50-hour MA.  View  A rebound from the 50-hour MA and a break above $11,065 (intra-day high) could yield a rally to the 10-week MA of $11,366. A violation there would expose the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and the trendline resistance seen today around $11,675 and $11,825, respectively.  A close today below the downward sloping 50-day MA of $10,512 would allow a re-test of the Feb. 25 low of $9,280.  Meanwhile, a break below $9,280.4 would signal the corrective rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $6,000 has ended and would open up downside towards the $6,000 mark.

42428629,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Szh,1519808431,What is Circle X? Crypto Exchange to Challenge More Than Coinbase,"In the not-so-distant future, VC-backed startup Circle has plans to create a type of crypto cantina.  The news comes following Circle's buyout of cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, announced Feb. 26. Notably, the acquisition is one of, if not the largest, acquisitions in the industry to date.  Circle president Sean Neville told CoinDesk:  ""Rather than seeing a single Star Wars-type token that is good for everything across the galaxy, we'll see a proliferation of tokens that have different functions.""  To that end, Neville believes the new service, formally called Circle Poloniex for now, will offer an entirely new kind of exchange, one that gives users access to a whole host of cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens.  According to Circle executives, the acquisition is a win-win for both companies.  Circle customers will once again have the ability to buy and sell bitcoin (a service the company shut down in December 2016) and many other cryptocurrencies. And Poloniex's customers will get access to Circle's well-oiled and licensed business machinery, which has been developed over the past five years with $140 million in venture capital.  The benefits for Poloniex will likely be huge since the exchange's fast-paced business has slowed somewhat in the past several months in the face of an onslaught of complaints about its service.  While some reports put the acquisition price tag at $400 million, Circle execs did not confirm that number to CoinDesk, explaining that the deal started last spring.  According to Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, the startup now employs more than 200 people and expects to hire 100 more to fulfill its vision of monetary pluralism.  Allaire said:  ""It's a turning point in that we're really right on the cusp of major consumer products being able to be built on top of these markets and this infrastructure.""  What is Circle X?  At the core of this transformation is what Circle refers to as ""Circle X"" – the concept that, in the future, exchanges will not be broken down into types at all.  Instead, Neville anticipates, exchanges will be less specialized than they are today and will host a vast array of tokens that represent everything from traditional equities to new assets (as cryptocurrencies already do today).  ""We see the future of Poloniex as a full marketplace where tokens can represent all kinds of assets and all kinds of contractual agreements,” Neville said. ""We'll see things that are really meant for settlement or for utility value that may be somewhat less volatile from a markets perspective. And we'll see some tokens that really are equities, and that is okay.""  Instead of cryptocurrency exchanges being different than stock exchanges being different than cash markets, Circle believes all that trading will happen in one place – in a seamless backend that connects the digital world to the real world.  Allaire told CoinDesk:  ""From our perspective, pulling this all together, pulling this under one roof, allows us to realize those broader ideas for consumer products.""  As such, this new type of exchange could not only give traditional cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase a run for their money, but could also compete with alternative trading systems (ATS) like tZero and Templum, which focus on listing crypto tokens that are regulated as securities.  As part of this ""evolution,"" as Neville calls it, he envisions integrating fiat currencies into Poloniex's current product.  While Poloniex allows trades of roughly 100 different cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens, exchange users have had to move those funds to platforms like Circle's to convert into fiat. But Circle will be able to leverage its existing regulatory compliance work to accelerate the addition of a number of fiat currencies into the exchange service.  “We have the licenses and the relationships in order to make that happen across U.S. dollars, but also euros and [British] pounds,"" he said.  While there are currently no plans to de-list any of Poloniex’s existing tokens, Neville said Circle is are currently building a “legal framework” that will accelerate the rate at which desirable tokens could be added to that platform.  Solving problems  And not only is Circle looking to add to Poloniex's service, it also wants to take care of some of the issues the exchange was facing as well.  Complaints have been coming in about delayed transactions and ignored requests on public channels for some time. In an effort to confront the problems head-on, Neville said Circle will make available several of its custom tools.  For instance, an internally developed tool dubbed ""Diameter"" was highlighted as a means to solve Poloniex's issues handling the amount of customer service requests it receives.  Diameter connects directly to the backend processes of a platform and acts as a filter before human customer service agents get involved. By automatically surfacing solutions based on specific problems, the human teams are able to deal with more traffic through the use of the tool.  Currently, Diameter is used by Circle's global support team in Europe and the U.S.  ""It's a natural match for what Poloniex needs, particularly in the short-term,"" said Neville.  In the long-term, however, perhaps a more crucial benefit of the acquisition relates to dealing with financial regulations. In the press release announcing the acquisition, Circle specifically named compliance as one of the key areas it could help Poloniex.  In interview, though, Neville downplayed the issue a bit, saying that Poloniex has ""done a good job adhering to the laws they need to adhere to in order to support their customers.""  Yet, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper tweeted a link to an image that appears to indicate that the SEC agreed to stand down in pursuing enforcement actions against Poloniex if Circle registered the exchange as an alternative trading system.  While Allaire did not confirm whether the information was accurate, to questions about the tweet, he said:  ""We believe the technology developed by firms like Circle is complementary to this mission, and look forward to working closely with all our regulatory stakeholders, both domestic and abroad.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Circle and Coinbase.

Last week, it emerged that fraudsters had moved to create accounts that mimic the Tron Foundation and its founder, Justin Sun, according to a report from BuzzFeed. The publication discovered that one of the fake verified accounts in question, @TronFoundationl, copied the real Tron Foundation's Twitter content and even went as far as duplicating its pinned tweet, which warned users to beware of imposter accounts.  The account defrauded users by posting a link to a cryptocurrency wallet and soliciting donations in ether, promising to send 4 to 10 ether back to the first 200 users that make ""contributions."" Indeed, the move appears to be an escalation of previous attempts to defraud Twitter users, wherein scammers simply created their own fraudulent accounts in an attempt to copy developers and other well-known people in the cryptocurrency space.  And while Twitter rules mandate that accounts lose their verified status when they change their names, several fraudulent accounts have managed to maintain their verification badges, which are signified by a blue check mark next to the account's handle.

42428620,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL9Shh,1519794066,$35 Million Refund? Developer Appeals to Ethereum for Hack Reversal,"On November 24, 2015, James Levy received 40,000 ether from the Ethereum Foundation.  Worth roughly $35,000 at the time (and nearly $35 million today), the grant was an award for Levy's efforts to create an early smart contracting tool, and one of many meant to encourage work on what was then another nascent cryptocurrency in a sea of alternatives.  But three weeks later, the grant was gone, drained from his wallet in what might be the largest hack of a single wallet in the history of the ethereum platform.  The result of a weak passphrase, Levy has been silent on the matter ever since. But now, in order to fund a new venture called TapTrust, Levy is appealing to the hacker to return the funds, and failing that, he's turning to the community to implement what would entail a system-wide software upgrade, or hard fork, to do so.  Such an upgrade would rely on EIP 867, a proposal to standardize the process of recovering funds on the platform, one that has been a point of conflict for ethereum developers.  At times heated, the discussion around the proposal is tilting toward blocking all attempts for the EIP to proceed. Former EIP editor Yoichi Hirai even stepped down from his post as a result, citing legal concerns that could ensue from allowing the proposal to develop. And with the developer community in an uproar, the proposal has been frozen in place as the process for accepting code changes gets considered more intently.  As a co-author of EIP 867, Levy has found himself in the eye of the storm as developers expose concerns about the proposal - everything from lamenting ethereum's governance structure as it relates to system-wide catastrophes to predicting that stakeholders could collude with such proposals ratified.  Levy's move is indeed controversial, but he feels that going public with his story might sway the current debate.  “Particularly in light of something like a hack, it’s a very important issue for the community, and it’s one that, I think, the network and the platform of ethereum and the community, we need to figure out,” Levy told CoinDesk in an exclusive interview.  As adoption continues to rise, and ethereum is increasingly adapted for use in enterprise organizations, Levy continued:  “Ultimately, I think it comes down to, are we an economic system that lives outside the rest of society and the legal system? Are we totally separate from that? Or, are we somehow going to interface with these things?”  The theft  To step back, the hack happened because of a weak passphrase, which could lead some to put the blame of Levy himself. Yet Levy defends his security efforts, saying that he suspected his private key would still be needed to access the wallet.  But the wallet generation tool Levy used, developed by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, had a critical flaw in that others could access the wallet just with the passphrase.  “I assumed that the passphrase was going to be used in addition to some other criteria,” Levy explained.  Later, when the wallet was drained, Levy found his private keys were still secure, and initially, he didn’t believe he had been the victim of a hack.  “At first I thought was due to an upgrade or something,” he said.  Shortly before the wallet had been emptied, new softwares, such as Brainflayer (for brute-forcing passwords) were released, and so Levy tested the software on his own wallet, cracked the passphrase and learned the bitter truth about his grant money – it was gone.  Yet, he traced the funds to another wallet, and in watching the wallet ever since, hasn't noticed any movement.  They’ve stayed at the same address, without “a single outgoing transaction in the entire history of the blockchain,” Levy said.  And while Levy first accepted the funds as permanently lost, it was the eerie silence of the hacker's address (typically you would think a hacker would try and cash out or use the funds) that made him think a fund recovery might be possible.  Initially, Levy will just try some friendly communication.  ""One of the things I am eager to do is to try to get in touch to whoever may have access to that new wallet, and to try to come up with something that we can agree to in terms of how to remedy the situation,” Levy explained.  But should that not work, Levy will submit another fund recovery proposal that builds on his former efforts with EIP 867.  Undoing finality  According to Levy, the new proposal requires ""a very, very limited and well-defined and well-structured support for undoing finality,"" such as the format offered by EIP 876.  With that, Levy could recover his funds and use a significant portion to build something that would benefit the blockchain's community, including his new venture TapTrust, a Wikipedia-style forum for displaying objective information about tokens launched on ethereum.  “We’re trying to improve the quality of information available and improve the ability for average people to participate in this new crypto economy without compromising their safety,” Levy said.  It's perhaps an especially notable statement since much of the controversy surrounding the fund recovery proposal was stoked because of poor communication, Buterin said during a recent developer meeting.  Levy knows his appeals might not do any good, but still believes they will start a broader conversation about a pain point the community needs to tease out.  While the latest discussion around fund recovery stemmed from a code vulnerability that allowed a newbie coder to freeze, at the time, $160 million worth of ether in Parity Technologies ethereum client, Levy said hacks should be looked at categorically differently.  “I think that if we want to encourage organizations and businesses and financial institutions to adopt ethereum, that this is, I think for a lot of them, going to be a requirement, that in the event of a catastrophic situation, there is at least something that they can try to do,” he said.  And it’s a question that touches on a deeper, more philosophical rift in the ethereum community - the concept of blockchain finality.  The concept was first excited in the community after The DAO hack, when the ethereum community voted in favor of hard forking the code to return funds to its original holders. Valuing immutability under the adage ""code is law,"" a dissenting group forked off the main ethereum chain, creating ethereum classic.  Such tensions are still active in the community today, as witnessed through the more recent funds recovery debates, that Levy wouldn't be surprised if there was another split down the line.  Levy told CoinDesk:  “I wouldn’t be surprised if the network splits a some point over, not necessarily the issue of ETH recovery, but more generally, the issue of are we going to have a network that is technically pure, or are we going to have a network that we’re making some accommodations so that we can integrate with society.”  Money stack via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/02/28/35-million-refund-developer-appeals-to-ethereum-for-hack-reversal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf37bf16a6b89d608019ce97069caa60a2373f7f-1500x1137.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move follows months of public consultation on the issue. In December, officials from the central bank published draft rules which were then opened up for input to industry stakeholders. Officials began speaking publicly about the framework as far back as November, as reported at the time.  At its heart, the policy requires that exchanges be more diligent about checking and collecting information about the customers who are using their trading platforms, according to the text released Tuesday.  ""Reporting institutions are required to conduct customer due diligence on all customers and the persons conducting the transaction when the reporting institution establishes business relationship with customer and when the reporting institutions have any suspicion of money laundering or terrorism financing,"" the policy document states.  Specific pieces of data required include the customer's full name, their address and date of birth, as well as information about the purpose of their transactions.  Still, the central bank stressed that Tuesday's release doesn't represent any kind of endorsement from them – nor does it mean that officials are moving to consider cryptocurrencies a form of legal tender in Malaysia.

The moves also come at a time when an increasing number of companies in China are seeking ways to patent blockchain-related inventions, an effort that is in line with the Chinese government's agenda to push forward with FinTech applications.  As reported by CoinDesk previously, major financial institutions, namely Bank of China, have already weighed in on issues such as blockchain scaling.  According to records published by SIPO, Zhejiang University wants to patent a cloud-based blockchain system that facilitates cross-border payment transactions. The institution further claims in its filings that, instead of transactions passing through a third party as a kind of trustee, the system will record a sender's transaction request on a decentralized blockchain ledger that is formed by distributed cloud servers.  Meanwhile, the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Sciences is eyeing a blockchain system that can ""simultaneously support public, private and consortium blockchains,"" records show.  Shenzhen University, by contrast, is pursuing a patent related to a specific use case – intellectual property rights for artists – which uses the technology as a means to tag and trace works.
