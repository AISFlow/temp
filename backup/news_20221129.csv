DOT’s network released its newest update, highlighting some core developments that could pave a path for its foundational roadmap for 2023. Polkadot has plans to delve deeper into smart contract development through its project Substrate. This focuses on the network’s intention to bring more utility. DOT has also expressed interest in wanting to enter the NFT section. Looking at the technical outlook, the coin has picked up on some positive price action. Over the last 24 hours, DOT moved upward, albeit slowly. This slow price movement could be attributed to broader market weakness. The buyers seemed to pick up the pace, indicating increased demand for the asset. To correspond with the same sentiment, DOT registered a significant increase in its market cap. Related Reading: What’s Next As Algorand Price Remains Congested Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was trading at $5.31 at press time. The altcoin has been sandwiched between the $5 and the $5.6 zone for weeks. The increase in accumulation, however, makes it seem as though Polkadot might be able to breach the overhead resistance of $5.70. In the event of breaching the immediate resistance, DOT might also reach $6.21, giving investors significant gains. On the flip side, if DOT remains stuck under the $5.60 mark for too long, demand will wane, resulting in depreciation. Polkadot’s next stop would be $4.50 in that case. Technical Analysis DOT has registered a slow uptick in buying strength in the last few weeks. At press time, the chart witnessed a surge in buyers. The Relative Strength Index showed a rise as the indicator moved past the 40-mark and closer to the neutral zone. This was a sign of increased demand and incoming positive price action. On the same note, Polkadot was attempting to move above the 20-Simple Moving Average line due to an increase in buying strength. However, the reading reflected that sellers were still in control and driving the price momentum. In correspondence to the Simple Moving Average, DOT received sell signal on the 24-hour chart. The Awesome Oscillator indicates its price momentum and strength. The indicator formed red signal bars underneath the neutral line, which were sell signals, but those were declining. This meant that there was a chance that the price action would change during the next trading session. Parabolic SAR, however, remained negative with dotted lines above the candlesticks. DOT must push past the $5.70 price ceiling with the support of the broader market.

42411683,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfF5k,1669761364,Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Crypto Exchanges: What You Need to Know,"When FTX abruptly collapsed, users around the globe found they could no longer withdraw assets from the crypto exchange. Bankruptcy filings revealed FTX had up to $50 billion in liabilities and it’s unclear just what assets remain. Because crypto has no equivalent to something like federal deposit insurance from the FDIC to cover these losses, customers must wait for the bankruptcy courts to claw back what remains of their money – if any remains after investors have taken their cut.  FTX’s downfall is a symptom of a problem inherent to custodial exchanges. These platforms only let customers trade funds they have parked on the exchange. While customers are trading on custodial exchanges and leave their tokens there, they are exposed to the risk the exchange could go bust. When exchanges become insolvent, one of the first moves tends to be slowing or stopping withdrawals entirely.  See also: Centralized vs Decentralized Exchanges  Unfortunately, this happens all too often in crypto. Exchanges get hacked (Binance and Coinbase, now the leading crypto exchanges by volume, have both been hacked), and founders like Sam Bankman-Fried may turn out to be less invested in their customers than social media makes them appear.  Another scenario that customers of custodial exchanges face is that bad security practices might mean that when a key founder goes missing, the founder takes their private keys and the access to the funds with them. That’s what happened when the founder of QuadrigaCX died suddenly, locking users out of their accounts (it later emerged that he had been squandering customer funds and the cold wallets were largely empty).  Self-custody solutions  One alternative is to use a non-custodial exchange, also known as a decentralized exchange, or DEX. Examples include Uniswap, SushiSwap and dYdX. These are decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols that users connect to without forsaking access to their cryptocurrencies. Traders instead spend money directly from non-custodial wallets, like MetaMask or Ledger, and do not add their money to a wallet owned by the exchange.  This, on the surface, sounds like a far neater solution. Funds are in the hands of customers, preventing a founder from charming his or her way into the control of user funds, then investing them in riskier assets.  There are disadvantages, however. One drawback is that decentralized exchanges are, at least for now, often a lot slower because all trades take place on the blockchain. Another issue is trades can be more expensive. Finally, due to the transparency of the blockchain, transactions are less private than on a centralized custodial exchange.  Another thing to consider with a DEX is you can also only trade crypto for other crypto within the Dex, while centralized cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase allow for the conversion of fiat and crypto currencies (for example, the U.S. dollar and bitcoin).  Plus, for all the commotion about “not your keys, not your coins” – the mantra of non-custodial solutions – it is easy to lose the keys or seed phrase to a non-custodial wallet or to accidentally ruin your hardware wallet in the laundry. The responsibility for holding onto your crypto is squarely your own, meaning there’s no customer support to help you if you lose control over your coins. On the other hand, for some the responsibility and sole ownership of your crypto keys is an advantage of non-custodial exchange.  By contrast, custodial exchanges, also known as centralized platforms, are very convenient (when they do not steal your money), highly liquid (when solvent) and very popular (when they work). They are also very cheap because trades take place not on the blockchain but on proprietary matching engines. Consequently, people flock to these exchanges in droves, hoping to profit from the advantages while avoiding the pitfalls.  Aware that people prefer not to have their funds stolen by dodgy exchanges, centralized exchanges are moving – slowly – in the direction of safety and transparency.  Several major exchanges, notably Binance and Kraken, have chosen to publish cryptographically verifiable proof of reserves, which shows how much money they have on hand at any time. This allows customers to check whether the exchange is solvent or if the books look dodgy. That said, critics have pointed out the omission of an exchange like Binance’s other liabilities – those to whom it owes money, such as customers and lenders – could undermine the transparency initiative.  Other exchanges, including Coinbase, promise 1-to-1 backing. Coinbase claims all customer funds are fully backed at all times and are never invested or lent out without permission. Coinbase can afford to do this by charging fees for withdrawals and trading. But there’s still a risk Coinbase customers could be treated as “general unsecured creditors” in the event of a bankruptcy, meaning they’d have to wait for other investors to claim their share.  See Also: What Are Fully Backed Reserves?  In sum, nothing is perfect and danger can come from any directions. Both custodial and non-custodial exchanges can contain security vulnerabilities that can put your money at risk. There’s no perfect solution, but some people find a blended strategy of keeping a portion of crypto in non-custodial accounts and another in more liquid centralized exchange diversifies those risks while allowing them to both trade and HODL their coins.  No matter what, make sure to keep all passwords and keys in private, safe places and make sure to research each place where you’re considering putting your crypto before you make a deposit.

Despite the general market slump, the coin has been one of the top performers. It currently ranks at the number four position on CoinMarketCap. The coin has a 24-hour low of 289.76 and a 24-hour high of $304.82. The price change in 24 hours is increase of 2.36%. However, this price change does not truly convey the strength of the token in the market. Related Reading: Genesis Bankruptcy by EOY Now At 59% – Sentiment Of Bitcoin Investors Pivots BNB’s trading volume increased by 3.51% in the last 24 hours. There is growing optimism among investors on the short; and long-term value of the coin. Its market dominance is currently at 5.755. Recent highs and lows; and open and close indicate that the token is likely going on the bullish run. Binance’s coin traded at $307.16 (low) and $316.22(high). This slight change is viewed by many as a false bearish breakout. The market sentiment for BNB is optimistic, and fear levels have dropped. What Is Pushing The BNB Rally? BNB’s current rally; is supported by a combination of different economic factors. At a macroeconomic level, the Feds, in the meeting held on November 1-2, 2022 – decided on the rates. They concluded that the interest rates hike would eventually be relaxed in the recently released minutes of the event. Also, in the wake of disastrous events like the collapse of Celsius and FTX, Binance’s commitment to transparency is paying off. According to a Reuters report: Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, stated that rather than fighting crypto: it should be regulated. After the losses suffered by FTX investors, Binance offered users assurances of their reliability. Some experts also attribute this to a growing belief that the crypto winter has reached its endpoint. The Bulls Gain Control Of BNB BNB price is presently showing bullish sentiments as crypto investors prepare for a potential revival. The price has been on a recovery path this week, with bullish pressure pushing for up to 14% gains. The 50-day SMA is now above the 200-day SMA. The bulls will likely target the $320 resistance before the bear might act on the price significantly. Generally, the cryptocurrency market is slowly coming back to life. Market interest is also high for BNB, meaning demand is higher than supply, and prices will increase. The MACD is currently showing signs of attempting a bullish divergence. Both the MACD and its signal line are pointing upwards. BNB will have to stay above $300 for the next few days to avoid a possible price correction. BNB is most likely to continue its bullish run since it has wide adoption by users. Also, there is a possibility that the whales or individual traders will likely stockpile the coin. Experts predict the price of BNB to keep increasing before the end of the year.

42413540,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9noU,1669758755,Sam Bankman-Fried Called to FTX Hearing by Texas Securities Regulator,"Ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has been called to a Feb. 2 hearing to answer to claims from a Texas regulator that FTX US offered unregistered securities products through its yield-bearing service.  The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) scheduled the administrative hearing, accusing Bankman-Fried’s company of securities violations in Texas, although the disgraced CEO is no longer running the company he founded, which is now mired in bankruptcy proceedings. The board, which sent a registered letter to Bankman-Fried’s address in the Bahamas informing him of the hearing, suggested the proceedings could be conducted over Zoom.  FTX Capital Markets LLC is registered as a dealer with the board, and “Texans were able to buy and sell publicly traded stock through the firm,” according to the hearing notice that was dated Nov. 22. The state regulator is seeking a cease-and-desist order for FTX to halt securities fraud in the state, to return money to affected investors and to target Bankman-Fried with fines.  The TSSB’s investigation into FTX US became public in October, when Director of Enforcement Joe Rotunda claimed in a filing in the Voyager Digital bankruptcy case that FTX US may have been violating state law governing the registration and sale of securities products because it was offering a yield-bearing product to U.S. customers.  Speaking at a panel discussion with FTX General Counsel Ryne Miller in New York in October, Rotunda said he considered filing an enforcement action as a last resort. He added that the TSSB preferred to work through issues with companies before an enforcement action became necessary, and FTX had, up until that point, been cooperative.  Rotunda did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment by the time of publication.  The state matter may have to stand in line behind a long list of federal and international investigations over what went on inside FTX.  The collapse of the Bahamas-based exchange is currently being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Bahamian police, and Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).

Huobi said the new “Dominica coin,” or DMC, will be issued “in due time” on Huobi Prime, the exchange’s exclusive token offering platform. Users can complete their identity verification on Huobi with Dominica digital identification documents, according to a statement.  The HT token was up 15% over the last 24 hours to $7.12 at the time of publication. It’s up 40% over the past seven days.  The deal is noteworthy partly because of its connections to crypto billionaire Justin Sun. The Dominica tokens are set to be launched on Sun’s Tron blockchain, and Sun recently acknowledged holding “tens of millions” of HT.  Last month, Huobi named Sun as the first member of a new global advisory board that is responsible for guiding the exchange’s strategic layout and development.  Other News  Coinbase Wallet will end support of the native tokens associated with Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRP) and Stellar (XLM), effective Dec. 5, citing ""low usage"" as a reason for the delisting, according to an update on the crypto exchange's website.  Solana-focused crypto wallet Phantom said Tuesday it will add support for assets on the Ethereum and Polygon blockchains, with the rollout beginning in about three months, according to a representative. Phantom’s likely bet is that its slick user interface will power it forward on the system, just as it did for Solana, where it says it has three million active users.  Crypto prices rise: Bitcoin (BTC) was recently trading up 1.5% to $16,400, while ether (ETH) gained 4.3% to $1,220. Despite major assets rebounding from Monday’s fall, traders are trying to find out “which parts of the cryptoverse are about to break,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note. Moya noted that it is not a “friendly environment to buy the crypto dip” because the risks to downside are elevated, “given pricing disparities for other crypto derivatives, fears of a potential run on some exchanges and concerns [that] risk appetite is in for a rough period as the economy appears headed for a recession.""  Equity markets were mixed as investors eyed the protests against COVID-19 lockdowns in China and awaited remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy on Wednesday about the economy and labor markets. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.1% and 0.5%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for the U.S. benchmark rose 1.5%.  Altcoin Roundup  Decentralized lending protocol Compound Finance passed a proposal to impose loan limits and introduce new borrowing caps to lower risk on its platform. The community voted overwhelmingly in favor of introducing or lowering the maximum borrowing amount for 10 cryptocurrencies, including WBTC, LINK and UNI.

42411684,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfF93,1669758541,Dogechain: Dogecoin’s Tag-Along Sidechain,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the silly and popular meme coin often associated with Elon Musk, has experienced much volatility in its price. The popularity of the coin has led to a remarkable increase in adoption, replacing Cardano’s ADA as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency in the world. It has also garnered attention from other projects, including one called Dogechain.  But buyer beware: Although the two may sound similar, they are not as closely related as their names would suggest.  What is Dogechain?  Dogechain is a sidechain that uses Polygon Edge, which is a separate network that allows developers to work in a customizable environment on Polygon, itself a sidechain to Ethereum.  Sidechains are separate blockchain networks that run parallel to a main blockchain and connect to each other through bridges. Sidechains allow for smoother exchanges between blockchains but use their own separate consensus mechanisms.  Read More: Elon Musk Tweet Sparks Flurry of Twitter-Themed Dogecoin Tokens  Layer 2s, on the other hand, are built directly on top of layer 1 blockchains to help them process transactions faster, and with lower fees. Layer 2s do this by bundling transactions and passing them back down to the main chain, where they can be finalized – or written officially to the chain – in bulk. Before they’re made official, a special sort of security apparatus on the base chain vets the bundles of transactions to make sure nothing looks awry.  Dogechain is a sidechain, not a layer 2. Dogechain bundles transactions and passes them back to a layer 1 network, just as a layer 2 network does, but there’s no security system on the layer 1 network that vets Dogechain transactions to make sure they haven’t been spoofed or tampered with.  Because it does not inherit the security of the base blockchain, Dogechain is generally not considered a true “layer 2,” although it is usually marketed as one.  Dogechain can process transactions cheaply and quickly, but as a sidechain its transactions are not subject to the same rigorous security standards as a real layer 2 network.  Read More: Want to Buy Dogecoin? Read This First  How are Dogechain and Dogecoin connected?  The Dogechain sidechain was launched in August. While it uses part of the name of Dogecoin, the technology does not have a direct connection to the developers or the foundation that built the meme coin. It's a totally separate entity.  At the time of Dogechain's launch, Jens Wiechers, executive board member of the Dogecoin Foundation, tweeted that the Foundation had no affiliation with the Dogechain project. The founders of Dogecoin do not have any ties to Dogechain either.  Because Dogechain is a sidechain based on Polygon, Dogechain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which is Ethereum’s software that is able to run smart contracts and other decentralized applications (dapps) that are built with Ethereum.  Dogechain users can use their DOGE to receive wrapped DOGE (wDOGE), which allows them to interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) on the blockchain, as well as future dapps and non-fungible token (NFT) projects that may want to join the Dogechain ecosystem (for now, there do not seem to be many projects involved with Dogechain).  “Some of the values that it [Dogechain] brings to the DOGE community and why they would want to build here is because everything built on those chains benefits DOGE in one way or another or many ways,” Dogechain founder Roc Zacharias told CoinDesk.  Dogechain has seen a surge of its native DC token in the past, given that users may mistake it for the actual meme coin.

Pageler had helmed the Nevada-based crypto services company since January 2021, according to his Linkedin profile. He was previously its president and chief operating officer. It was not immediately clear why Pageler was replaced; in a statement Prime Trust said he had ""transitioned"" but did not share his new role.  Jor Law is the firm's interim CEO, the statement said.  ""We have marquee clients, a suite of products that is unparalleled in the marketplace, and a strong core group of people.

Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried held tens of millions of dollars with Prime Trust that he later sent to political campaigns, according to a series of contribution disclosures that erroneously stated Prime Trust as the donor but were later corrected. One of his top deputies, Nishad Singh, also sent donations through Prime Trust.  Spokespeople for Prime Trust could not immediately be reached. Pageler did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Prime Trust raised $107 million in June during a Series B round, looking to expand its services.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who received at least $16,600 from Bankman-Fried, are rushing to wash their hands of the association with the suspect donations, promising to give the money to charity.  While O’Rourke returned Bankman-Fried’s October donation, the now-disgraced crypto mogul was the Texas Democrat’s biggest campaign donor during the previous fundraising cycle, from July 1 to Sept. 29, during which Bankman-Fried gave O'Rourke a total of $1 million.  O’Rourke’s reluctance to accept the more recent large donation could also have been influenced by the political divisiveness over cryptocurrency in Texas. O’Rourke’s opponent, Republican incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott (who won the election), is a vocal supporter of the crypto industry – particularly crypto mining – in the state.  Texas’ unique and fragile power grid has struggled to support the state’s growing energy requirements in recent years, leading to an increase in blackouts.  Abbott’s open invitation to bitcoin miners to set up shop in Texas has been criticized, particularly by Democrats, who are concerned the growing presence of crypto miners could further strain the state’s grid.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/29/beto-orourke-returned-a-1m-campaign-donation-from-sam-bankman-fried-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/50407f7f3d6b473b5c0334ef4ee96335aad14324-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This status quo supports the price action, and it could operate as the dominant trend for the remaining of the year. Related Reading: What’s Next As Algorand Price Remains Congested As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,400. The cryptocurrency has been stuck at these levels for today’s trading session after re-testing its yearly lows yesterday. In the wake of FTX’s collapse, crypto users have lost confidence. This could have a long-lasting impact on the nascent asset class. Bitcoin Holders Flee From Exchanges Data from crypto exchange Bitfinex indicates that users are withdrawing their Bitcoin from exchanges en masse. The FTX’s collapse triggered a massive BTC outflow from trading venues; investors fear losing their funds in the contagion. The chart below shows that exchanges’ BTC supply has decreased since mid-2021. This trend steeped in 2022 as the crypto market crashed, and Bitcoin lost over 80% of its value from its all-time high of $69,000. Less Bitcoin on trading venues is a good thing in a different market. Market participants perceived this as a bullish sign as people and institutions can’t sell their BTC. Thus, bullish price momentum has fewer chances of meeting resistance. However, the current market conditions are different. The decline of Bitcoin supply on exchanges might indicate troubles for the crypto market. As Bitfinex noted, crypto exchange Gemini has seen the most significant decline in its BTC supply. The exchange saw its Bitcoin reserves drop from 210,000 BTC to 163,000 in one week. Overall, trading venues lost over 1 million BTC in the past month. The report claims: This data suggests that a mass exodus of retail off centralised exchanges is underway. Every development that suggests that a particular exchange is in trouble is a catalyst for depleting balances on exchanges. This trend has been in place since FTX insolvency rumours first emerged. Throwing In The Towel In addition, to the decline in the BTC supply, the report noted discouragement among retail investors. These users might leave the crypto space for good after taking a blow on FTX.

42388571,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRIUUV,1669752269,New York Man Pleads Guilty to $2M Crypto Mining Fraud,"A New York man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to defrauding more than a dozen victims out of a collective $2 million as part of a long-running crypto mining scam.  Chester “Chet” Stojanovich, 38, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in April and charged with one count of wire fraud.  From March 2019 to September 2021, Stojanovich posed as a dealer of crypto mining equipment, convincing customers to purchase mining machines through him and then taking payments to arrange hosting services at a facility in Goose Bay, Canada.  However, those facilities were a fiction and Stojanovich instead spent customers’ money on lavish purchases for himself, including private jet flights, limousine rides, parties, gifts for his wife and even paying off $80,000 of his personal credit card debt.  Stojanovich went to great lengths to convince his customers that his scheme was legitimate, purchasing approximately 75 miners from Amazon and Ebay and using them as props, sending pictures of himself with them to customers when they grew suspicious.  Stojanovich even took one customer, who demanded to see the hosting facility for himself, on a 31-hour road trip from New York to Goose Bay, only to drop him off at the Buffalo airport before they reached the Canadian border and inform him that he would be able to see the facility or receive any sort of refund.  In September 2019, Stojanovich’s communications with customers went dark, only for him to resurface two months later and inform customers that the purported owner of the fictional Goose Bay facility had gone bankrupt and run away with their equipment.  Six of Stojanovich’s victims filed suit against him in June 2020, alleging “civil RICO violations, breach of contract, fraud, conversion and unjust enrichment” but the threat of a lawsuit did not stop Stojanovich from trying his hand at a second fraudulent scheme.  Between August and September 2021, Stojanovich persuaded three mining brokers to purchase $200,000 worth of equipment through him. Though they paid for a combined 127 mining machines, the brokers only received three miners between them.  When they demanded refunds, Stojanovich wrote a series of bad checks before eventually refunding only $61,000, keeping the rest for himself. According to the complaint in the case, he spent the money on Apple products, hotels and restaurants, payments to his wife and more than $33,000 to an online casino.  Stojanovich faces up to 20 years in prison.

4935132,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510527,1669751570,What’s Next As Algorand Price Remains Congested,"Algorand price continues to pack negative price action throughout the month of November. The altcoin has depreciated by more than 40% since the beginning of this month. Over the last 24 hours, ALGO has just risen by 0.6% on its chart, emphasizing continued lateral price movement. Currently, the coin has been stuck at a crucial resistance level. The technical outlook points in a direction where ALGO might not make a price comeback soon enough. The buying pressure has dropped considerably, which has reflected the fact that the coin has been undergoing a massive sell-off. If Algorand is to come under bullish influence, buyers have to immediately re-enter the market. The asset’s price action is expected to become even more congested at the $0.20 level if the bears halt movement above the $0.23 mark again. It remains to be seen if Algorand reclaims the $0.24 price level. Related Reading: Celo Sees 20% Gains In Last Week As The Broader Crypto Market Retreats Algorand Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ALGO was auctioned at $0.23 at the time of writing. The overhead price ceiling was $0.24, and the altcoin faced rejection every time it inched toward that zone. With the massive sell-off, Algorand can lose the $0.23 price level and pierce through the $0.22 mark to sit on $0.20 for some time. The altcoin can be expected to trade at $0.22 for some time before it targets $0.20, and if buyers return, ALGO can trace upwards from the $0.22 price mark. The amount of Algorand traded in the past session decreased, highlighting the sell-off. Technical Analysis For most of this month, Algorand’s price has witnessed the pull of the sellers. Algorand was overvalued at the beginning of the month, although the bulls could not hold onto the price momentum. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40 mark, which signifies that the asset was even below the neutral zone, indicating that buying strength was weak. Corresponding to the same reading, ALGO remained under the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA). If the price of the coin moves above the 20-SMA, then the bearish thesis could be invalidated. According to the 20-SMA reading, sellers were driving the price momentum. On the 24-hour chart, ALGO’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows the price trend and the chance of a momentum reversal. MACD continued to form red signal bars, which were signs for investors to sell the asset. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) indicates the strength of the price direction. DMI was negative as the -DI line (orange) was above the +DI line (blue). The Average Directional Index (red) was also above the 20-mark, meaning that the current price momentum was gathering strength.

Huobi said the new “Dominica coin,” or DMC, will be issued “in due time” on Huobi Prime, the exchange’s exclusive token offering platform.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent letters to six CEOs of prominent cryptocurrency firms – including Bitfinex, Gemini, Kraken and KuCoin – asking them to explain their structures, whether they separate customers’ assets from their own and how they guard against market manipulation and internal conflicts of interest.  “As Congress considers much-needed regulations for the crypto industry, I will focus on the clear need for consumer protections along the lines of the assurances that have long existed for customers of banks, credit unions and securities brokers,” Wyden said in the letters. “If these protections had been in place before the failure of FTX, far fewer retail investors would be facing precipitous financial harm today.”  The letters – dated Nov. 28 – request balance-sheet information and explanations for the companies’ reserves, including whether they’re audited. While it’s unlikely the companies – most of them private and a couple of them based overseas – will provide detailed financial data, the requests underline Democratic lawmakers’ possible approach to the industry as the next session of Congress gets rolling in about a month.  Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) have begun probing FTX, calling for those responsible to be held accountable for their roles in the crypto exchange’s collapse.  Wyden’s committee isn’t core to some of the central regulatory questions facing the industry in the U.S., but his authority over tax issues could play an important part.

42394103,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXX9V,1669748400,BlockFi Joins the Bankruptcy Parade,"Crypto lender BlockFi became the latest industry heavyweight to file for bankruptcy, joining Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and FTX. FTX’s collapse directly contributed to BlockFi’s filing, but the lender presented an optimistic view nevertheless in its first day pleadings.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Domino effect  The narrative  BlockFi announced it was filing for bankruptcy protection on Monday morning, announcing it has around $257 million in cash on hand but claiming between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets (as well as between $1 billion and $10 billion in liabilities).  Why it matters  BlockFi is only the latest major crypto lender to file for bankruptcy protection this year, joining Celsius Network and Voyager Digital. BlockFi followed a well-worn path – it suspended withdrawals earlier this month and (we know now) hired a consultant to sort through its processes.  Breaking it down  Like (so far) every other crypto company, BlockFi has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, indicating it believes it can continue onwards after a restructuring process. Like other companies, BlockFi claims it faced “a severe liquidity crunch,” directly citing the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange as a main cause. Despite this, BlockFi is in a better position than FTX due, at least in part, to governance and risk management processes, the filing claims.  “The Debtors’ planning has left them well positioned to move forward despite the fact that 2022 has been a uniquely terrible year for the cryptocurrency industry, given the collapse of the UST/LUNA stablecoin ecosystem and the bankruptcies of Singapore-based cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and several major cryptocurrency brokerages and exchanges such as Celsius Network Ltd. and Voyager Digital – all before the FTX debacle unfolded over a period of several days earlier this month,” the first-day filing said.  The filing also went through BlockFi’s history, its fundraises, what kind of shares it issued and how the market collapse of 2022 affected the lender.  Three Arrows Capital, which collapsed into ignominy earlier this year (despite its founders’ attempts at a comeback) “was one of BlockFi’s largest borrower clients,” Monday’s filing said. The Terra collapse likewise hurt the company.  BlockFi does hope to continue operating, although it reportedly plans to lay off staff.  Also, the company is suing Sam Bankman-Fried to secure control over Robinhood shares the former FTX CEO apparently pledged as collateral to the lender on Nov. 9.  This week  There’s a number of events we’re watching this week tied to the general meltdown of the last month:  Tuesday, Nov. 29, at 16:30 UTC (11:30 a.m. ET): The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court will hold its first-day hearing for BlockFi.  Wednesday, Nov. 30, at 9:00 UTC (4:00 a.m. ET): The European Parliament’s Econ Committee will host a hearing on the FTX collapse.  Wednesday, Nov. 30, at 14:30 UTC (9:30 a.m. ET): The New York Times Dealbook is hosting its regular summit. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is still scheduled to speak, likely virtually.  Thursday, Dec. 1, at 15:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. ET): The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee is hosting a hearing on FTX’s collapse. As of the time of writing, the only confirmed speaker is Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam. Attorneys for new FTX CEO John Ray III implied he may also have been asked to speak.  Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard  Key: (nom.) = nominee, (rum.) = rumored, (act.) = acting, (inc.) = incumbent (no replacement anticipated)  N/A  Outside CoinDesk:  (The Washington Post) Sen.

It is currently ranked number 97 on CoinMarketCap. The trading volume has decreased by over 73% in the last 24 hours. CELO shocked many market observers with a 33.51% price jump on Sunday and had a trading volume of $227,794,699.69. Although the token is still way off its all-time high of $10.68, it has shown signs of recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Loses Demand Zone Again As Bears Dominate – Is $700 Realistic For Investors? 2022 has been an eventful year in crypto circles, from XRP’s lawsuit with the SEC to the collapse of Celius and FTX. Pessimism has also driven the prices of crypto assets down as the fear factor increases. CELO coin has defied the odds to go on a rally that has holders hopeful of potential gains. From its historical price movement, it remains to see how far this momentum can hold. What Is Behind CELO’s Recent Price Upsurge? CELO’s innovative cryptocurrency system gives the project an edge in the prevailing bearish cryptocurrency market. CELO targets increasing crypto use among smartphone users. With the number of smartphone users rising daily, it is easy to understand why it is gaining in the market. The proof of stake mechanism adopted by the project developers also makes it more energy efficient and future-inclined. The current value of the CELO network is directly proportional to efforts from network builders, the fanbase, and investors. Also, Bitcoin has recently seen a slow and steady increase in its valuation. Judging from history and Bitcoin’s dominance, it affects the prices of other coins. Macroeconomic factors also have a role to play since investors are more careful with their portfolios. The current economic meltdown in some regions of the world has also lengthened the crypto bear market. CELO supports rave-of-the-moment projects that include NFTs and Web3 services. Experts insist that these projects will eventually launch CELO to importance. CELO Possibly Going On A Bullish Run CELO’s price has rebounded remarkably in the past few days. The price will likely continue on its bullish run for the short term. CELO is trading slightly below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), showing a sell signal. It is also below the 50-day SMA and is still a sell signal from the indicator. The RSI value is currently 56.45. It indicates that the price is more likely to go bullish since it is above 40. The MACD shows a tentative buy signal, with both the MACD and a signal line pointing upwards. The price has moved in a sideways trend, as observed in the candlestick pattern on the chart. It means that while a bullish run is possible, it will likely remain neutral for the time being.

42388557,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRITjj,1669744623,"Sam Bankman-Fried Addresses Withdrawals, FTX Collapse in Newly Released Audio Interview","Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire blew up in spectacular fashion at the beginning of this month, and questions continue to swirl around the motives and mechanics that caused crypto exchange FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, to collapse.  Among the more unprecedented elements of the FTX saga has been the fact that Bankman-Fried, who was raised by two lawyers, can’t seem to keep his mouth shut despite mounting legal threats.  After cryptic tweet threads and a viral DM exchange with a Vox reporter in which he said “f**k regulators” and admitted that his philanthropic identity was largely manufactured for PR reasons, Bankman-Fried’s actual voice is being heard for the first time post-FTX collapse with newly released audio from Tiffany Fong – a crypto investor-turned-whistleblower who initially gained attention for leaking audio that showed Celsius Network, the now-bankrupt crypto lending platform, planned to use a cynical “crypto-based solution” to repay users of its Earn Lending platform.  In a phone call with Fong on Nov. 16 – several days after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection – Bankman-Fried rehashed many of the same defenses and rationalizations for his behavior that he had shared previously in other places to explain what went wrong. In general, Bankman-Fried’s defense was (and continues to be) that he greatly mistook how leveraged he was.  Read more: The FTX Downfall: Full Coverage  This explanation is wholly unsatisfying given that it fails to address precisely how FTX and Alameda misappropriated billions of dollars in FTX user deposits.  “You don’t get into a situation like I got in if you make all the right decisions,” Bankman-Fried admitted once again.  Unhappy lawyers  Unsurprisingly, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers were unhappy with his decision to speak out in the early days of the FTX fiasco.  “You have to promise that you never, ever, ever say you f**ked up again,” Bankman-Fried said his lawyers told him. “I told them to go f**k themselves.”  On the call, Bankman-Fried provided some context around why he – for a brief time after pausing the FTX platform – reopened withdrawals just for residents of the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried and FTX are based.  Initially, FTX claimed that this was to comply with requests from Bahamian regulators. The Bahamian government disputed that, and, on his call with Fong, so did Bankman-Fried.  “I gave [the Bahamian government] a one-day heads up that we were going to do it. They didn't say, yes or no. They didn't respond, and then we did it. The reason I did it was it was critical to the exchange being able to have a future,” Bankman-Fried said.  “You do not want to be in a country with a lot of angry people in it and you do not want your company to be incorporated in a country with a lot of angry people in it,” he continued. “This was us trying to create a regulatory pathway forward for the exchange just to like kind of appease the citizens of the country that we’re currently in.”  As for whether Bankman-Fried created a “back door” to discreetly move user funds to Alameda without attracting attention, as reported by Reuters, Bankman-Fried suggested that “I certainly didn't build the back door in there and I don't know exactly what they're referring to.”  Bankman-Fried said that he couldn’t have built a back door because “I don’t even know how to code,” though this defense doesn’t really address Reuters’ core claim – which is that he used a back door, not that he built one.  Lobbying under scrutiny  Bankman-Fried was one of the largest donors in this month's U.S. midterm elections, and his once-cozy relationship with politicians and regulators has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks as it’s become clear that his business empire might have been a fraud.  His sizable donations to Democrats in particular have invited a wave of controversy and conspiracy theories, but Bankman-Fried told Fong that he also made “dark” donations to Republicans that weren't as publicly known.  To explain why he attempted to make these donations without attracting attention, the FTX founder said that most journalists are ""secretly liberal,"" and he just ""didn't want to have that fight.""  As for why Bankman-Fried continued to speak out rather than remain silent after his house of cards came toppling down, he said that “at the end of the day, I’m starting to trust my gut on things like this,” he said.  Two weeks later, Bankman-Fried is still trusting his gut. Although the Nov. 16 call with Fong is the first time Bankman-Fried's voice has been heard since the start of the FTX/Alameda collapse, he plans to speak with the New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday.  What went wrong, and Binance's role in the collapse  In a second interview with SBF that Fong conducted on Nov. 20 and released later on Tuesday, Bankman-Fried blamed FTX's meltdown on a perfect storm of events that he nonetheless should have been more prepared for.  ""It was a combination of the crash in the spring that took 50% out of asset values, combined with a hyper-correlated crash scenario this month in which simultaneously we saw a 50% decline in relevant asset prices over a two-day period, combined with a complete run on the bank on FTX, combined with the fact that there’s a margin position on FTX that was substantially larger than it appeared to be,"" Bankman-Fried said.  He continued that ""the combination of all of those put together meant that what appeared to be an extremely well-capitalized position on the exchange, over the last six months, became effectively unable to meet its liquidity obligations, and then those were demanded at the same time.""  When asked whether he thought FTX would be OK now if Binance's CZ hadn't expressed doubts in the company following CoinDesk's scoop about the instability of Alameda's balance sheet, Bankman-Fried said ""it was a good question.""  ""I think things would certainly be a lot more stable and a lot more ability to generate liquidity, [but] there’d still be too much margin in the system,"" Bankman-Fried responded. ""I think [it's] kind of 50-50.""  Regrets  Bankman-Fried noted that in retrospect he wished there was someone else at the company who was specifically in charge of risk management and liquidity, and that another issue was the company had spread itself too thin. In particular, he said FTX spent an enormous amount of energy on trying to get regulatory licenses, ""while we could probably have been more selective on that front and spent less of our time on that.""  SBF also said he felt particularly bad for the people who believed in him and trusted him. Asfor himself, he said “I don’t know what the future holds for me; it’s pretty unclear and it’s certainly not the future I once thought it once was.""  CORRECTION (Nov 29, 23:53 UTC): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the interview with SBF was conducted on Nov. 13. It was, in fact, Nov. 16.

42388555,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRITf3,1669743824,"BlockFi Has $355M in Crypto Frozen on FTX, Attorney Confirms","Crypto lender BlockFi has about $355 million in cryptocurrencies currently frozen on crypto exchange FTX, attorney Joshua Sussberg told a U.S. bankruptcy court on Tuesday.  The $355 million is on top of another $671 million in loan to FTX sister company Alameda Research. Alameda has defaulted on the loan as well.  BlockFi filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey on Monday after weeks of speculation about the company’s solvency after it paused withdrawals earlier in November. The lender had been relying on a $400 million line of credit from crypto exchange FTX, which itself filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month after doubts emerged about its own solvency following a CoinDesk report revealing Alameda held a large amount of FTX’s exchange token, FTT.  In its first-day filing, BlockFi indicated that it had somewhere between $1 billion and $10 billion in total assets, as well as between $1 billion and $10 billion in liabilities. The lender has north of 100,000 creditors, and about $257 million in cash on hand, some of which it generated by liquidating crypto holdings.  BlockFi does hope to let customers holding their own assets in the BlockFi Wallet product to withdraw their funds, said Sussberg, a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis.  “We intend, Your Honor, as we noted in the pleadings, to quickly file a motion to allow customers to withdraw from their personal wallet to the extent they so wish, because we do not believe that is property of the estate,” he said.  This plan is subject to the formation of a creditor’s committee, he said.  Sussberg told Judge Michael Kaplan that he anticipates the process of recovering BlockFi’s funds from FTX will “play out over a long period of time.”  Whether those funds will be recoverable is another question entirely.  Sussberg told the judge that FTX has over 1 million creditors, and it suffered a reported hack the day of its bankruptcy filing on Nov. 11 that drained hundreds of millions of dollars worth of crypto out of FTX-controlled wallets.  BlockFi’s lawyers emphasized that, though both BlockFi and FTX have filed for bankruptcy protection during the market downturn, that’s where the similarities end.  “This is the antithesis of FTX,” Sussberg said of BlockFi’s liquidity crisis. “This is a complete 180-degree different story.”  Sussberg referenced current FTX CEO John Jay Ray III’s statement that he had never seen “such a complete failure” of FTX’s executive leadership in his career – which included cleaning up after Enron’s collapse.  BlockFi’s co-founders, Zac Prince and Flori Marquez, Sussberg told the court, were the opposite of Bankman-Fried.  “These are self-made individuals … [who] built the company with their own hands,” Sussberg said. “This company was on a rocket ship.”  Both Prince and Marquez were in attendance during the first hearing.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,"Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/29/blockfi-has-355m-in-crypto-frozen-on-ftx-attorney-confirms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61f549b108e280b4300a15807ae3fd2d1a3c2c45-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394086,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXVuZ,1669742024,Why Do Crypto Lenders Keep Blowing Up?,"What is happening with crypto lenders? The bear market has strained every corner of the crypto industry, but perhaps none more than businesses involved in crypto lending. You know the names already: BlockFi, Celsius Network and Genesis Global Trading.  There are more, but these once-highly respected firms represent some of the most embarrassing upsets of this year. They all have something in common: loans against digital assets. What went wrong? And can centralized crypto lenders ever regain market share and trust?  Crypto lending is the process of linking people who have excess crypto and want to earn yield on their money by depositing it on a platform, which lends those funds out to people who want to borrow crypto and are willing to leave collateral and pay interest to take out a loan.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In other words? “Crypto lending is essentially banking – for the crypto world,” as Reuters put it early this year. And as Lisa of “The Simpsons” once said, most comparisons are problematic.  Before the market downturn, lending was big business for the crypto industry. Celsius, sometimes called a “neobank,” accrued over $11 billion assets on its platform. BlockFi, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, had been valued at $3 billion just last year. Genesis, a Wall Street-facing firm owned by CoinDesk’s parent company, Digital Currency Group, had $2.8 billion in active loans at the end of the third quarter of this year (down from $11.1 billion the same quarter a year earlier).  See also: Bankrupt Crypto Lender BlockFi Sues Bankman-Fried  Crypto lenders grew so large, in part, by offering high yields to depositors. While a bank account may earn less than 1% in interest, some crypto lenders offered returns as high as 20%. Even at the frothiest moment of the bull run, people were curious about where those returns came from.  Like banks, crypto lenders were supposed to generate profits from deposits by loaning that money out. Borrowers would pay typically between 5%-10% in fees, and crypto lenders like Celsius were supposed to make profit on the spread between interest payments paid to depositors and fees earned by borrowers.  As we learned this year, even when things go well for crypto lenders they can quickly turn south. Volatility in the markets put pressure on crypto lenders’ normal businesses – including shrinking the number of depositors and borrowers. Faced with increasing withdrawals, many were found to have been illiquid or insolvent.  But we also learned that lenders were engaging in potentially illegal behavior by re-loaning (or rehypothicating) funds they shouldn’t have, or making generally ill-advised bets. In a filing, Vermont’s securities regulator said Celsius at times resembled a Ponzi scheme in that it relied on attracting new investors to pay out old ones. It did that by offering rewards programs tied to its CEL token and using its marketing budget to pay yields well above standard. (The latter practice also happened at FTX’s “earn” program and the Anchor protocol, a decentralized lender built on Terra, another of 2022’s big failures.)  Of course, not all crypto lenders are created equal and not all of these firms went broke for the same reasons. Nor is there any reason to suspect other crypto lenders necessarily abused client funds. Because these are private companies by and large, it’s also not totally clear as to what went wrong.  There are increasing calls to regulate crypto, which could be a good thing for the industry. Although Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance (which guarantees up to $250,000 in bank deposits) is unlikely to be approved for crypto lenders, there could be increased regulatory supervision to make sure these companies better manage deposits to stay solvent.  It’s worth also noting that the crypto lenders grouped under the decentralized finance (DeFi) sub-economy fared better. These platforms generally require users to overcollateralize their loans, and they prevent human actors from taking possession of deposits because they’re non-custodial. While crypto lenders can make sweetheart deals with supposedly trustworthy individuals, in DeFi everyone plays by the same rules.

42388561,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRITxl,1669741200,A16z Leads $15M Round for Game Studio Roboto Games,"Roboto Games, a new game studio aiming to bridge Web2 experience and accessible Web3 in-game elements, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which launched its first game-focused fund in May with a $600 million commitment. The round shows that funding continues to trickle into crypto sectors despite the global bear market and the recent implosion of crypto exchange FTX and its continuing aftermath.  The funding will go toward building out the company’s second game and hiring across a variety of roles, including artists and marketers, Roboto Games founders Curt Bererton and Mathilde Pignol told CoinDesk in an interview. Other participants in the round included Ancient8, Animoca Brands, Gumi Cryptos Capital, Harrison Metal Capital, Makers Fund, Merit Circle, Transcend and a number of angel investors. Total funding now stands at $19.5 million to date, including a 2019 seed round.  Headquartered in San Mateo, Calif., Roboto Games aims to make free-to-play games that are playable across web, mobile and PC and can be played with or without Web3 elements such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) – or in-game elements coded to prove their uniqueness – or regular tokens. There are also plans for a user-generated content (UGC) platform.  Roboto Games has already released the fast-moving battle game Last Mage Standing, which has a few million players, according to Bererton. However, the team is primarily focused on the development of a survival/crafting massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that’s codenamed Foragers and Fighters, with plans to launch an initial playable version of the game in the first quarter of 2023. The game – described as Minecraft meets Genshin Impact – will feature character collection and asset crafting aspects but will initially lack Web3 elements by design.  “We want to make sure that we have the game core solidified and it's working well and it's really fun first before we launch any sort of NFTs or tokens associated with the project,” explained Bererton. “Because, for example, if we change a big aspect of the game, we don't want those NFTs to be invalidated by some design change that we make.”  In 2007, the team behind Roboto Games created ZipZapPlay, which made 20 social Facebook games including Baking Life and a UGC platform with over 200,000 games on it. They sold the company to PopCap a few months before Electronic Arts acquired PopCap in July 2011.  The free-to-play games made by ZipZapPlay require actively managed servers, which eventually went offline and made the games unplayable. Roboto Games therefore sees blockchain technology as a way to prevent future game deaths. If a Roboto game one day shuts down, the team could simply turn the code over to the players to continue on, noted Pignol.  “Something that I think is not covered a lot in Web3 media is the permanence of the data behind the blockchain, and what that can allow you to do,” said Bererton.

DeFi utilizes the nature of blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate crypto trading without centralized intermediaries like exchanges. One of the exemplars of the DeFi argument is “automated market making” (“AMM”) of crypto. Does this mechanism provide price discovery? The meltdown of FTX ( FTT-USD ) continues to spark controversy and commentary. A recent theme in this commentary is that the FTX disaster represents a failure of centralization that decentralized finance - “DeFi” - could correct. Examples include contributions by the very smart and knowledgeable Campbell Harvey of Duke , and an OpEd in WSJ . I agree that the failure of FTX demonstrates that the crypto business as it is, as opposed to how it is often portrayed, is highly centralized. But the FTX implosion does not demonstrate that centralization of crypto trading per se is fundamentally flawed: FTX is an example of centralization done the worst way, without any of the institutional and regulatory safeguards employed by exchanges like CME, Eurex, and ICE. Indeed, for reasons I have laid out going back to 2018 at the latest, the crypto market was centralized for fundamental economic reasons, and it makes sense that centralization done right will prevail in crypto going forward. The competitor for centralization advocated by Harvey and the WSJ OpEd and many others is DeFi. This utilizes the nature of blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate crypto trading without centralized intermediaries like exchanges. One of the exemplars of the DeFi argument is “automated market making” (“AMM”) of crypto. This article provides details , but the basic contours are easily described. Market participants contribute crypto to pools consisting of pairs of assets. For example, a pool may consist of Ether ( ETH-USD ) and the stablecoin Tether ( USDT-USD ). The relative price of the assets in the pool is determined by a formula, e.g., XETH*XUSDT=K, where K is a constant, XETH is the amount of ETH in the pool and XUSDT is the amount of Tether. If I contribute 1 unit of ETH to the pool, I am given K units of USDT, so the relative price of ETH (in terms of Tether) is K: the price of Tether (in terms of Ether) is 1/K. Automated Market Maker Equation (CoinDesk) Fine. But does this mechanism provide price discovery? Not directly, and not in the same way a centralized exchange like CME does for something like corn futures. DeFi/AMM essentially relies on an arbitrage mechanism to keep prices aligned across exchanges (like, FTX once upon a time and Binance now) and other DeFi AMMs. If the price of Ether on one platform is K but the price on another is, say, .95K, I buy ETH on the latter platform and sell Ether on the former platform. (Just like Sam and Caroline supposedly did on Alameda!) This tends to drive prices across platforms towards equality. But where does the price discovery take place? To what price do all the platforms converge? This mechanism equalizes prices across platforms, but in traditional financial markets (TradFi, for the cognoscenti!), price discovery tends to be a natural monopoly, or at least has strong natural monopoly tendencies. For example, in the days prior to Reg NMS, virtually all price discovery in NYSE stocks occurred on the NYSE, even though it accounted only for about 75-80 percent of volume. Satellite markets used NYSE prices to set their own prices. (In the Reg NMS market, the interconnected exchanges are the locus of price discovery.) Why is this? - The centripetal forces of trading with private information. Something that Admati-Pfleiderer analyzed 30+ years ago, and I have shown in my research. Basically, informed traders profit most by trading where most uninformed traders trade, and the uninformed mitigate their losses to the informed by trading in the same place. These factors reinforce one another, leading to a consolidation of informed trading in a single market, and the consolidation of uninformed trading on the same market except to the extent that the uninformed can segment themselves by trading on platforms with mechanisms that make it costly for the informed to exploit their information, such as trade-at-settlement, dark pools, and block trading. (What constitutes “informed” in crypto is a whole other subject for another time.) It is likely that the same mechanism is at work in crypto. Although trading consolidation is not as pronounced there as it is in other asset classes, crypto has become very concentrated, with Binance ( BNB-USD ) capturing around 75-80 percent of trading even before the FTX bankruptcy. So theory and some evidence suggests that price discovery takes place on exchanges, and that DeFi platforms are satellite markets that rely on arbitrage directly or indirectly with exchanges to determine price. (This raises the question of whether the AMM mechanism is sufficiently costly for informed traders to insure that their users are effectively noise traders.) The implication of this is that DeFi is not a close substitute for centralized trading of crypto. (I note that DeFi trading of stocks and currencies is essentially parasitical on price discovery performed elsewhere.) So just because SBF centralized crypto trading in the worst way doesn’t mean that decentralization is the answer - or will prevail in equilibrium as anything more than an ancillary trading mechanism suited for a specific clientele, and not be the primary locus of price discovery. The future of crypto will therefore almost certainly involve a high degree of centralization - performed by adults, operating in a rigorous legal environment, unlike SBF/FTX. That’s where price discovery will occur. In my opinion, DeFi will play an ancillary role, just as off-exchange venues do today in equities and did prior to Reg NMS. One last remark. One thing that many in the financial markets deplore is the fragmentation of trading in equities. It is allegedly highly inefficient. Dark pools, etc., have been heavily criticized. Fragmentation and decentralization is also a criticism leveled against OTC derivatives markets - here, it has been fingered as a source of systemic risk, and this criticism resulted in things like OTC clearing mandates and swap execution facility mandates. It’s fair to say, therefore, that in financial market conventional wisdom, decentralization = bad. But now, a failure of a particular centralized entity is leading people to tout the virtues of decentralization. Talk about strange new respect! All of these criticisms are largely misguided. As I’ve written extensively in the past, fragmentation in TradFi is a way of accommodating the diverse needs of diverse market participants. If crypto trading is to survive, well-operated centralized platforms will play an outsized role, supplemented by decentralized ones. Crypto is not so unique that the economic forces that have shaped market structure in stocks and derivatives will not operate there. So don’t overgeneralize from a likely (and hopefully!) extreme case driven by the madness of woke crowds.

The community voted overwhelmingly in favor of introducing or lowering the maximum borrowing amount for 10 cryptocurrencies, including wBTC, LINK and UNI.  “Setting borrow caps helps avoid high-risk attack vectors while sacrificing little capital efficiency and allowing for a threshold of organic borrow demand,” the proposal read.  The voting concluded on Monday and it is in the queue for execution at press time.  Compound’s action comes after an alleged exploit attempt on Aave – a rival lending platform – brought scrutiny to any potential vulnerabilities in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols’ lending mechanism.  The exploiter, who appeared to be infamous DeFi trader Avi Eisenberg, borrowed large sums of illiquid CRV tokens on Aave in an attempt to create bad debt on the protocol. Aave froze borrowing in 17 crypto assets Monday to mitigate risk from potential attacks before its network upgrade.

4926717,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510500,1669733951,"Not The 2018 Bear Market, Bitcoin Price Could Hit $20,000 In December","The Bitcoin price rebounded off the low of its current range and retraced its weekend losses. The cryptocurrency might climb back to the previously lost territory, but uncertainty is king in the current market conditions. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Up 10% After Cronje Article – Is $0.31 Possible? As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $16,400. In the last 24 hours and last week, the price recorded a 2% and 4% profit, respectively. Other cryptocurrencies in the crypto top 10 are following, but Binance Coin (BNB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are leading the bounce. The High And Lows, Is There Hope For The Bitcoin Price? Investment firm Cumberland posted a market update highlighting the uncertainty in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The nascent asset class is trading in a range after experiencing massive sell pressure amid the collapse of FTX. In this uncertain and low liquidity environment, with FTX and its market maker Alameda Research out of the picture, the Bitcoin price will likely trade sideways. During the holiday season, the crypto market will see another decline in liquidity, leading to volatility and crab-like price action. However, Cumberland believes there are catalysts to see a move into fresh lows. The FTX collapse triggered a contagion effect across the industry. Many companies and projects relied on the crypto exchange and its venture arm. Thus, these companies are vulnerable and might be unable to continue operations. The market is already seeing this effect with BlockFi’s chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Many wonder how many companies will take a similar measure in the coming weeks. If many more crypto projects halt operations, the crypto market might see fresh lows before 2022 ends. Cumberland said the following on the state of “crypto lending 1.0”: Version 1.0 of the centralized lending industry is effectively finished, and as a result there will be widespread collateral liquidations administered by bankruptcy attorneys over the coming months and years. Max Pain Price Might Play In Favor Of Bitcoin? On the other hand, the bullish case for the Bitcoin price is seeing some momentum on the back of adoption. Ironically, the collapse of FTX is driving many users to take custody of their assets and become less dependent on third-party services. In addition, Cumberland sees an enduring bullish trend for stablecoin-based use cases, non-fungible token (NFT) technology, and Ethereum/Polygon as the foundation for Web2 businesses. The firm added: Against this backdrop, volumes remain explosive; this is not the bear market of 2018 when activity evaporated altogether. Instead, it is evident from our perspective as liquidity providers that the number of entities who care (and transact) is steadily on the rise. Cumberland believes regulations might drive momentum to either side. If the regulatory landscape for 2023 seems favorable, Bitcoin and others might enjoy sustainable relief into previously lost territory.

Despite this, over 60% of Dogecoin holders are profitable, per CoinMarketCap data, in the midst of the current dip. The market has recovered in some aspects, albeit not fully, and investors are feeling confident about Dogecoin now than in recent days. An overbought relative strength index (RSI) suggests a possible market drop. Despite this, in the following few days, we should see a price that is above $0.1090. In addition to being bullish on shorter timeframes, the memecoin is also quite robust on longer ones. CoinGecko reports that the coin has been rising in value significantly over the past week or two. The Launch of SpaceX’s DOGE-1 mission, scheduled on December 22 this year according to NASA’s website, is one event that could alter the pricing even more. To add more, there are reports on Twitter that Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk will work together to enhance the DOGE network. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Clings To $5 Level Despite Unforgiving Bear Market Bullish On The Memecoin, But Proceed With Caution Image: TradingView What will happen to DOGE when the number of positive indicators increase? Will it continue to rise or fall with the rest of the market? As of the time of writing, all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies are rising, with DOGE marking an incredible 37% weekly increase. How does this compare in the graph? Well, DOGE is currently trading in a range between $0.1034 and $0.1090, with a likely breakout at the 50 Fibonacci level, which sits at $0.1090. As the RSI readings are in overbought zone, a correction phase may follow the breach in the intermediate term. On a 4-hour timeframe, this is more evident as recent candles have longer wicks, a hint of an approaching corrective phase. If the pullback occurs, the existing support at $0.0931 is likely to resist bearish sentiment. With the Bollinger Band supporting the present price action, however, this correction may be unlikely. Dogecoin: A Solid Buying Opportunity Nonetheless, RSI levels should continue to be examined because they can prolong DOGE’s position above the 61.80 Fib level. We anticipate the $0.1090 resistance to be broken during the coming few days. Speculators and investors should strongly consider DOGE as a purchase opportunity. As the launch date of the DOGE-1 satellite approaches and reports concerning Buterin and Musk’s upgrading plan for DOGE continue to circulate, we should expect positive sentiment to increase daily. In the coming weeks, we can anticipate a further rally as the market recovers.

4923279,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510471,1669726834,Fantom (FTM) Up 10% After Cronje Article – Is $0.31 Possible?,"The 69th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Fantom (FTM), has shown relative strength over the past seven days, rising 29%. Over the past 24 hours, it even stands at a gain of 10%. Today’s surge comes after DeFi star programmer Andre Cronje published a Medium post about the “crypto company” Fantom, detailing its financial history. In the article, Cronje describes that Fantom started with $40 million, mostly in ETH with an average price of $450 to $700. Due to the crypto winter at the time, Fantom shad to sell its ETH for less than $5 million. After that, Fantom decided to go on a tough austerity drive, with a complete marketing freeze and only the most necessary staff. Among other things, listing fees for exchanges and sponsorship fees for influencers were never to be paid again. Instead, the project pursued an aggressive strategy in decentralized financial solutions (DeFi). And success is proving Fantom right. As of November 2022, the company has grown from a $5 million budget to $1.5 billion. Related Reading: Historic Bitcoin Miner Capitulation In Full Effect – How Long Will It Last? Fantom’s Solid Coffers Currently, Fantom has $100 million in stablecoins, $100 million in cryptocurrencies, and $50 million in non-crypto assets, among other assets. With current salary consumption, they have a 30-year runway. The solid financial base has also allowed the project around Cronje to reject “further cooperation from Alameda.” Profits from DeFi strategies have also been used repeatedly to buy FTM. In terms of competition, Cronje criticizes that selling its own tokens is a finite business model. This is another reason why Fantom’s foundation owns relatively few FTM: Most comparable L1’s own between 50% – 80% of their token supply. At launch, Fantom owned less than 3%, today we own more than 14%. We prefer buying our tokens, we don’t ‘sell’ our tokens for ‘partnerships’. The crypto community has been extremely supportive of the article in light of FTX’s handling of customer funds and token distribution in other projects.

To initiate a bullish breakout, FTM needs to recapture the crucial horizontal level at $0.22. Technical analysis shows the importance of this area. The price action on the 1-day chart shows that FTM price has fallen sharply since reaching its three-month high at $0.3138 on November 5. Subsequently, FTM reached a low of $0.1645 on November 22. Only if FTM can overcome the $0.22 mark, a new attempt at the November high of $0.31 could be on the cards.

The central bank has discussed its vision for an electronic iteration of the country's sovereign currency, the hryvnia, with representatives of banks, non-banking financial institutions and the crypto market, according to an official press release on Monday. The bank is exploring retail non-cash payments, virtual asset circulation and cross-border transactions as possible applications for a CBDC.  ""E-hryvnia can become one of the key elements of qualitative infrastructure development for the virtual-assets market in Ukraine,"" the report said.  Ukraine has been looking into a CBDC since 2017, and is one of more than 100 jurisdictions around the world exploring a national digital currency. In July 2021, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill to allow the central bank to issue a CBDC that can be grouped in the same category as cash or electronic money.  Last December, Tascombank, one of the country's oldest commercial banks, revealed plans to test an electronic hryvnia built on the Stellar network.  Crypto came to play a role in collecting donations and facilitating the purchase of critical supplies after Russia's invasion of the country in February.  The central bank said it ""continues to develop"" the ""e-hryvnia"" project with market participants and state bodies.  ""At the same time, the National Bank, like most central banks of the world, will approach the issue of issuing its own digital currency carefully and taking into account, in particular, the potential impact of its introduction on the financial system of the state,"" the report said.

At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency was changing hands at $0.3060 and has gone down by almost 3% during the last 24 hours according to data from Coingecko. This comes as a surprise as the project’s blockchain is in the midst of celebrating the accomplishment of having more than 7 million native assets that have been created on it. Basing from the information shared by pool.pm, by leveraging 65,652 varying minting policies, the Cardano network is now home to 7,055,456 native tokens. What makes this achievement extra special is the fact is that just last September the blockchain hit the 6 million count. Nonetheless, ADA seems to have ignored this development as it hasn’t responded positively in terms of spot trading price and market capitalization. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Clings To $5 Level Despite Unforgiving Bear Market Smart Contracts In Cardano Network Continue To Grow From a 2022 opening tally of 2,844 smart contracts, there are now 3,791 SCs running on Cardano’s Plutus platform, representing an increase of 300%. This comes at a time when the network is working on an additional development that mainly focuses on improving the smart contract functionality of the blockchain. Particularly, the team responsible for this network activity is paying attention to increasing script capacity and the Plutus Debugger MVP for the full implementation of the Babbage support. Back in September 2022, when the Vasil hard fork upgrade was launched by Cardano in hopes of increasing the scalability of the DeFi network, there was a significant increase in smart contracts running on the blockchain. Elsewhere, the project is also witnessing impressive growth in terms of on-chain activity as evidenced by the daily address activity which has jumped over 90% at the time of this writing. Moreover, the number of delegated wallet addresses for Cardano has now reached 1.23 million, although some experts believe that this surge might have been instigated by the massive sell-off prompted by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange. December Not Looking Good For ADA? According to Coincodex, over the next five days, ADA will post a slight increase in its trading price which the online crypto info aggregator predicts to be at $0.3065. That however, will be followed by a more bearish forecast which sees the asset experiencing severe price dump towards the end of the year. By using its technical indicators and historical price movements, Coincodex was able to arrive at the prediction that 30 days from now, the altcoin will fall all the way down to $0.2742. Still, just like its fellow crypto assets, Cardano is subject to high volatility levels which means that in just a matter of a blink on an eye, it can surpass all predictions made related to its price trajectory.

4913360,https://newsbtc.com/?p=510430,1669708135,Historic Bitcoin Miner Capitulation In Full Effect – How Long Will It Last?,"The collapse of the crypto exchange FTX is causing a historic event in the Bitcoin market. Yesterday, on-chain data signaled the second wave of a Bitcoin miner capitulation in one cycle. Historically, miners have had a massive impact on the BTC price. The now heralded miner capitulation will put further selling pressure on the Bitcoin price, which is experiencing a historically bad November, down 21%. On-chain data shows that the second wave of miner capitulation has now begun, suggesting further pain for the BTC price. As analyst Dylan LeClair wrote, the Bitcoin hash rate is starting to tilt here. Bitcoin Miners Under Water The 7-day moving average hash rate is now 13.7% away from its all-time high. Mining difficulty is expected to adjust by about -9% in a week, which will take some pressure off miners, at least in the short term. Nevertheless, miner margins have been and continue to be massively squeezed since June, the first capitulation event in this cycle. Despite this, the hash rate still rose to an all-time high until recently. This, the increased mining difficulty, and the FTX-related price crash have pushed the hash price to its lowest level since late 2020. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Key Indicators Point Firming Case For Recovery Above $1,250 As Capriole Investments’ Charles Edwards noted yesterday, hash ribbons have confirmed the start of capitulation. “Triggered by the $10 billion FTX scam and subsequent collapse, bitcoin miners are now going broke and the hash rate is trending down,” Edwards stated. In the “Bitcoin miner net position change” chart, it can be seen that miners have been selling aggressively over the past month. “Combined with the decline in the hash rate and today’s hash band bear cross, this suggests that we are indeed in a phase of miner capitulation,” said Will Clemente of Reflexivity Research. How Long Will Miner Capitulation Last? Something to keep in mind is that miner capitulation is usually the last stage of a Bitcoin bear market. In the 2018 cycle, the BTC hashrate continued to rise as the price reached the $6,000 mark until the final miner capitulation came at $3,000. In the current cycle, miners have already undergone a capitulation in June. They reduced their holdings by 4,000 BTC, equivalent to about $68 million, in the last two weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $1,000: Looking Back At Nine Years Of Bull Run Prior to that, they had only begun a net accumulation trend in September 2022, betting that the bottom had been reached. However, they bet on the wrong horse and are now being severely punished. Historically, miner capitulation has lasted an average of 48 days, which would put an end to miner selling pressure in sight by mid-January 2023. However, the most recent capitulation ended only after two months, on August 18. The end marked the third longest capitulation in history. Bitcoin bulls should therefore be cautious in December and January, and watch the behavior of Bitcoin miners.

On November 8, despite the negative effects of the collapse of the FTX exchange platform, the digital asset managed to briefly surpass the psychological $7 marker, peaking at $7.38. DOT wasn’t able to sustain this gain and quickly abandoned the territory, hovering around the $6 region before eventually falling to the $5 range which it continues to maintain despite the ongoing bear market. According to latest tracking from Coingecko, Polkadot is trading at $5.13 at the time of this writing, being down by only 1.3% over the last seven days. Despite painting its chart in red, the digital asset has so far parried all the heavy blows of this bear cycle responsible for making the crypto market cap go down by almost 2% during the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Ethereum Tries To Keep Luster As ETH Moves To Narrower Trading Range Polkadot Focuses Energy On Areas It Can Win As its trading price and total market capitalization continues to be at the mercy of the winter season for crypto space, Polkadot has turned its focus on aspects where it can emerge victorious and enjoy positive developments. For example, the nomination pools for the project successfully achieved a milestone when the current number of DOT bonded by members of its pool surpassed the 500,000 marker. Last week, at the time when industry leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum failed to make any kind of move to turn the tides on their favor, social mentions and engagements for Polkadot both increased. According to social analytics platform LunarCrush, during that time, the project tallied a 68.9% jump on its social mention numbers and an equally impressive 71.4% increase on its social engagements. It proved that despite all the FUD that have been ravaging the space for quite some time now, interest for Polkadot network and its DOT crypto asset remained high. What Awaits DOT Towards End Of 2022? Owing to the fluctuating price of DOT at the start of the current year, crypto experts have forecasted that the asset will exit the month of November with an average price of $5.70. However, as it is currently changing hands at $5.13, the altcoin might need to perform a bit of a surge during the next few hours to end November with a value that is close to the forecast. Meanwhile, the predictions for the month of December for Polkadot is almost the same as its average price next month is expected to be at $5.86, with the digital coin going as high as $6.08 in terms of trading price.

BNB’s price had a weekly close below a crucial area of $350 after showing so much strength rallying from a weekly low of $260 to a high of $310 as the price was unable to break above $350. After BNB’s price declined from a high of $390 to a region of $260, the price has struggled to regain such strength with more speculation of price retesting the region of $200. Weekly resistance for the price of BNB – $350. Weekly support for the price of BNB – $260. Price Analysis Of BNB On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BNB remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe after closing below $290. With BNB’s price unable to break and close above $350, there are growing chances of price retesting the regions of $200 if the market persists in this state. BNB’s price currently trades at $293 below 200 EMA, acting as resistance for the price of BNB from trading higher. The price of BNB needs to break above $350 for the price of BNB to kickstart the price recovery plan. Daily resistance for the BNB price – $350. Daily support for the BNB price – $290.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Rallies Late Despite BlockFi Bankruptcy Protection Filing, China Protests  By James Rubin  Crypto markets spent much of Monday in the red before a late-day rally sent most major tokens into positive territory, even as the industry continued to process the dual body blows of crypto lender BlockFi's Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing and widespread protests in China over severe COVID-19 restrictions.  Bitcoin was recently trading at about $16,250, up the better part of a percentage point over the previous 24 hours but still below its weekend perch of $16,500. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization's resilience dovetailed with a wider slowdown in asset activity of all stripes as the U.S. celebrated its annual Thanksgiving holiday and a lull in bad news related to crypto exchange FTX's implosion. The latter pause ended with BlockFi's petition.  ""We need to see if there's going to be more contagion coming,"" Marco Sampaio, co-founder and CEO of Hashdex, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program. ""We know the macro is also playing a role in this. The pressure coming from China is also putting pressure on crypto or risky assets in general.""  But Sampaio added cautiously: ""We need to see what's going to happen. We have many chapters to follow [in] the coming weeks.""  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,175, also up 1.3% from Sunday, same time. Ether's price fell roughly 3% earlier in the day after a ""whale"" address moved 73,224 ETH, worth $85.7 million, to Binance during Asia trading hours, according to an analysis by on-chain researcher Lookonchain. Investors typically transfer coins to centralized exchanges when they intend to sell or use the coins as a margin in derivatives trading.  Most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market capitalization were recently trading in the green, with popular meme coin DOGE up more than 5%, continuing an almost week-long surge whose spark remains unclear. DOGE alternative SHIB was up about 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, was roughly flat.  News of continued demonstrations in China, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and hawkish remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Monday sent equity markets tumbling with the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closing off about 1.5%.  Hashdex's Sampaio noted that institutional investors focused on crypto's long-term potential have been less affected by the industry's recent debacles than companies that have been trading and are ""dis-allocating"" their assets. ""We know that markets come and go,"" he said. ""I would say 'give it time.' It's hurting now but we don't think that's going to be the scenario forever.""

Insights  What's the Price of Irreverence on Crypto Twitter  By Sam Reynolds  Over the weekend, an inside joke that wrapped ether (wETH) was on the verge of insolvency spooked crypto Twitter.  Crypto Twitter is understandably twitchy these days, given the rapid market-moving news cycle of the last month. With so many institutions in the crypto economy on the verge of insolvency, the failure of another wouldn’t be surprising. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), protocols and everything in between seem to have been drained or hacked in the last few months.  So when a joke popped up suggesting wETH might be next, the gallows humor was apparently real-sounding enough to be taken seriously by some readers without their guards up.  Ether sank 4.8% in the ensuing 24 hours, outpacing bitcoin’s drop, although there’s no proof that the decline stemmed from the gag. Token price drops often stem from different factors.  More to the point: The idea of wETH failing is really not something that would happen, at least in any traditional sense.  What is wETH?  First, we need to understand what wETH is. The ""w"" in wETH stands for ""wrapped,"" which means a token representing a fixed amount of another token, usually on a one-to-one basis. ""Wrapping"" is often used to describe representing assets on a different blockchain, as when ""wrapped"" BTC (wBTC) is created to represent bitcoin (BTC) on Ethereum (though wBTC and wETH are very, very different creatures). Wrapping an ether token on the Ethereum network might seem strange then.  To summarize a long, technical problem: Ether, the token, doesn’t support the ERC-20 standard that virtually every decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol uses. Ether came before ERC-20; it’s Windows 3.1 in the era of apps and smartphones. So instead of fixing ether, it’s faster to just wrap it in a modern ERC-20 token.  But it still is, in essence, another form of ether on the Ethereum blockchain.  Why can’t wETH go insolvent?  Unlike staked ether (stETH), or bridge protocols that allow you to “transport” tokens to different protocols (i.e., sending Solana-based tokens to Ethereum via Wormhole), wETH doesn’t have a centralized entity. Immutable, open-source smart contracts govern how wETH and ETH interact, and it’s simple to confirm that the wETH contract is fully backed at any given moment. There’s a risk that the smart contracts behind wETH could be hacked. WETH is pegged 1:1, and thanks to block explorers you can easily validate this.  It’s transparent, decentralized and all on the same chain. So there’s basically near-zero risk and a depeg is really an issue, even if wETH might trade at a slight discount to ETH from time to time in digital-asset markets.  Provided that it’s always possible to unwrap ether, which the smart contracts will do without a centralized authority, wETH will continue to properly function.  Data from Dune Analytics shows there was a spike in unwraps over the weekend as the joke went viral.  To be sure, this isn’t a bank run. Given that wETH currently trades at a slight discount to ETH, this might have generated more revenue for the protocol. For traders, the annoyance would primarily be from the gas fees. People might have lost $100, not their entire life savings.  Sometimes jokes go too far  WETH is a confusing topic. In theory there shouldn’t be a need for it, and eventually Ethereum will evolve to the point where it won’t be needed.  But this is less to do with wETH and more to do with how a news cycle based on flashy tweets can cause panic. This joke was a complicated one that required a reader to have the technical context to properly understand it, and to find it funny. In the twitchy world of Crypto Twitter, it’s easy to misfire.
