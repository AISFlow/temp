42427987,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL50xh,1508797212,Bitcoin Gold: What to Know About the Blockchain's Next Split,"Anyone who owns bitcoin will soon be able to receive a new cryptocurrency.  As of block 491,407 on the bitcoin blockchain, another alternative version of the protocol will be launched, resulting in a variant that's being branded bitcoin gold (BTG).  The project, which seeks to improve bitcoin's technology by changing how its competition for rewards is conducted, is the second to launch since August via an increasingly common process called a ""hard fork.""  Readers may remember the term from the launch of bitcoin cash, the alternative version of the bitcoin protocol that spurred global headlines for unexpectedly creating billions of dollars in value, seemingly out of thin air.  Looking ahead, many industry observers are expecting the same results this time around, though there may be reasons for enthusiasm to be tempered.  What is bitcoin gold?  In short, bitcoin gold aims to achieve two goals:  First, bitcoin gold wants to change how mining works by making it so the most powerful mining machines (called ASICs) can no longer be used.  Second, by attracting more people to this system over time, it hopes to free the bitcoin network from the large companies that offer these products, and it argues, command undue influence on the network.  Instead of scaling bitcoin to support more users, bitcoin gold tweaks bitcoin in an effort to ""make bitcoin decentralized again."" This, proponents argue, will make the network, designed to offer an egalitarian way to send payments digitally around the globe, more accessible to users.  And while created via the same mechanism, bitcoin gold differs from bitcoin cash in a few ways, most notably in its distribution.  Differences include:  The bitcoin gold cryptocurrency is set to be created in advance (prior to the code being open-sourced to the public).  About 1 percent of the total cryptocurrency tokens mined before the blockchain goes public will be used to pay the bitcoin gold development team.  Once this distribution is over, the team claims it will launch the cryptocurrency so that users can redeem their coins.  Of course, while it aims to become the de-facto version of bitcoin, others might consider bitcoin gold an ""altcoin"" – the term has long been used to denote any cryptocurrency launched using bitcoin’s existing code, but that has an alternative market or use case.  Do I have bitcoin gold?  All bitcoin owners will receive the cryptocurrency at a rate of 1 BTC to 1 BTG, setting the stage for possible market activity.  But, that's not to say it's totally intuitive to retrieve.  One quirk is that it'll be easier to redeem the funds from wallets or exchanges that recognize the cryptocurrency. The easiest way, then, to retrieve the bitcoin gold is to move bitcoin to a wallet or exchange that supports bitcoin gold, or to hold bitcoin in a wallet where you own your private keys (rather than holding them with an exchange).  To date, 20 exchanges and wallets promise to support bitcoin gold once it launches, according to the project's website.  Although one of the most popular U.S.-based exchanges, Coinbase stated on October 20 that it does not support bitcoin gold due to skepticism about how developers have made project information available to others.  ""At this time, Coinbase cannot support bitcoin gold because its developers have not made the code available to the public for review. This is a major security risk,” the post reads.  This is perhaps something to keep an eye on as the project progresses. Although the project will officially fork on Monday night, it's not yet open to anyone and everyone, and there’s still plenty left on the developers' to-do list.  Who is behind bitcoin gold?  The team behind the hard fork appears to be a relatively small group.  Hong Kong-based LightningAsic CEO Jack Liao, who's an outspoken critic of the state of bitcoin mining, first broached the idea of bitcoin gold back in July.  His company LightningAsic sells mining equipment, including GPUs, the type of computing hardware bitcoin gold is supposed to rely on.  Since first introduced earlier this summer, the team has expanded to include pseudonymous lead developer h4x3rotab, as well as a team of five other volunteers who are now working on developing and promoting the cryptocurrency in their spare time.  The project can be tracked on Github and on the community Slack group.  How do people feel about bitcoin gold?  All that said, for those interested in exploring or using bitcoin gold, it's worth noting that it has generated its share of controversy.  Satoshi Labs CEO Marek Palatinus, who launched bitcoin's first ever mining pool, is skeptical the project will actually work to decentralize mining as planned.  And he's not the only one to throw shade at the new project.  Bitcoin developer Rhett Creighton is working on alternative bitcoin gold ""protest fork"" software that seeks to pursue the same idea but without setting aside some of the new cryptocurrency for development.  If more than 51% of miners choose to use his software, the so-called pre-distribution to developers will be erased, he told CoinDesk. ""It's up to the miners to decide what they want,"" he added.  All in all, it's unclear if business and mining groups will ultimately support the project, and if they do, how much value the alternative blockchain could create.  For example, while a list of roughly 50 businesses and miners support the so-called Segwit2x fork, similar support hasn't been seen for bitcoin gold. Likewise, though bitcoin cash began with support from vocal miners and exchanges, bitcoin gold has arguably yet to benefit from such early activity.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.

""I just don't believe in this bitcoin thing,"" Al-Waleed said, according to a transcript published by CNBC. ""I think it's just going to implode one day. It's Enron in the making.""  When asked about the specific comparison between bitcoin and the infamous American energy company that fell apart in the early 2000s amid revelations of massive accounting fraud, Al-Waleed reiterated his position that he ""just [doesn't] believe in bitcoin completely.""  Al-Waleed went on to say:  ""It doesn't make sense. This thing is not regulated. It's not under control. It's not under the supervision [of] any federal – elect – United States Federal Reserve or any other central bank. I don't believe in this whole thing at all. I think it's going to implode.""  It was then that Al-Waleed – a Saudi royal family member who, as head of the Kingdom Holding Company, has an estimated net worth of more than $17 billion – said he agreed with Dimon, who issued the now-infamous remark last month that he believes that bitcoin ""is a fraud.""

The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), Quebec's financial regulator, published a statement on October 20 announcing that Dominic Lacroix and a related company, DL Innov inc., had allegedly ignored previous court orders aimed at preventing them from soliciting investors for ""PlexCoin."" PlexCoin, according to its official website, is a cryptocurrency based on ethereum.  The dispute between AMF and PlexCoin's backers dates back to earlier this year, when Canadian regulators issued prohibition orders to Lacroix, DLT Innov and several related businesses, restricting them from promoting a planned token sale for PlexCoin. The AMF said at the time that the parties were ordered to close any related websites and pull back any advertisements related to the cryptocurrency release.  Within days, however, the AMF would go on to issue a warning to investors about PlexCoin, stating that ""the persons involved have apparently not complied with these orders"" and that a planned ICO was still being organized.  In September, Canadian regulators issued further restrictions, including an order to the cryptocurrency's backers to not ""dispose of any funds, securities or other property in their possession or entrusted to them.""  According to the latest release, Quebec Supreme Court Justice Marc Lesage sided with the government in ruling that Lacroix and DL Innov continue to violate the past orders.  ""In his decision, Lesage...emphasized that the evidence filed by the AMF demonstrates beyond any doubt that Dominic Lacroix and DL Innov Inc., representatives and alter ego of PlexCorps and PlexCoin, continued to solicit and propose to investors, directly and indirectly, to invest in the purchase of PlexCoin, a virtual currency, after orders issued by the Administrative Court of Financial Markets preventing them from July 20, 2017,"" the AMF wrote.  A hearing is reportedly set to take place next month regarding a penalty for the court contempt finding, according to the agency.  The dispute was ongoing when regulators in Canada published guidance on the blockchain funding use case in late August. At the time, the Canada Securities Administrators – an umbrella group for the country's regional markets watchdogs – said that it had found ""many"" ICO-derived tokens constitute securities.

The firm collected 112,720 ethers – an amount worth approximately $31.4 million at press time – in a token sale that took place in two phases, including 56,000 ETH (roughly $15.6 million) in a presale backed by celebrity investor Mark Cuban. In an email, Rahul Sood, chief executive of Unikrn, said that the company had sourced contributions from 112 countries, characterizing them as ""mostly small purchasers.""  The ICO's completion also follows Unikrn's receipt of a gambling license in Malta, a significant boon for a company looking to apply the tech to the electronic sports betting space.  The idea is that Unikoin Gold, the token that was up for sale, will act as a common medium of exchange for bettors to use on the platform, which allows for placing wages on games like League of Legends, Defense Against the Ancients (Dota) and CounterStrike, among others.  Unikoin Gold is actually replacing a previous in-house virtual currency, dubbed Unikoins, that was used in conjunction with government-issued currencies on the site. The startup was founded in 2014 with backing from investors like Elisabeth Murdoch and Ashton Kutcher.  According to Sood, the coming months will see the release of additional applications to build on the Unikoin framework, including tools that allow users to garner more tokens.  ""We have plenty of applications that allow users to use and earn tokens --- we will start to release them in November through February,"" he said.

After rising to $0.05 last week, the value of the native token that runs the Stellar protocol is down 36 percent from that recent high today. At press time, the stellar-US dollar (XLM/USD) exchange rate is $0.033. Week-on-week, XLM is down 8.33 percent, while on a monthly basis, it is up 177 percent.  The decline follows XLN's rally of more than 100 percent on Oct. 16 after news hit the wires that IBM and Stellar were testing the cryptocurrency for cross-border payments.  Currently, the project is designed to handle South Pacific currencies – Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and the Tonga pa'anga. Through Stellar's lumen, consumers will be able to trade fiat currencies without even touching the cryptocurrency.  Still, while the market euphoria in response to the news is calming at press time, the price of lumens is holding above the key support level of $0.02755.  What does this mean for traders ahead? Price action analysis suggests the decline from $0.05 could be a bear trap, and that there is a potential for another boost if support holds.

The relative strength index (RSI) and the money flow index (MFI) favor price rally.  View  A rebound from the support offered by Aug. 5 high of $0.02755 followed by a move above $0.04 would open doors for $0.05 (Oct. 16 high).

According to a Reuters report, Florida-based software engineer Yuri Lebedev had been found guilty of helping run the unlicensed bitcoin exchange. His sentencing – handed down by U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan – came more than two years after he was initially arrested and charged with violating U.S. money laundering statutes.  Along with Lebedev, Pastor Trevon Gross was convicted in March, though in the case of Gross, he was charged with bribery in connection with a now-shuttered New Jersey credit union that was allegedly used to channel funds from Coin.mx overseas.  According to the prosecutors in the case, Lebedev helped arrange bribes to Gross, including $150,000 in donations to his church. Gross is expected to be sentenced later this month.  Bloomberg reports that Judge Nathan said Lebedev used his ""impressive technology skills"" in order to avoid detection. Lebedev's attorney, Eric Creizman, described him in court as an ""unlikely criminal defendant.""  The Florida-based bitcoin exchange Coin.mx was operated as a so-called ""Collectibles Club"" in order to obscure its exchange activities. Prosecutors had previously tied the exchange to a broader cybercrime enterprise, arguing that Coin.mx served as as a clearing house for funds derived from various criminal activities including a hack on JPMorgan Chase.  Another Coin.mx operator, Anthony Murgio, was arrested and charged, along with Lebedev, in 2015. Murgio pled guilty earlier this year on three charges, including one count of wilfull failure to file a suspicious activity report, and was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison in June.

42427954,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vhh,1508763606,Foxconn Backs $16 Million Series B for Bitcoin Startup Abra,"Bitcoin startup Abra has completed a $16 million Series B led by manufacturing giant Foxconn.  Announced today at the Money2020 conference in Las Vegas, the new capital brings Abra's total funding to more than $30 million. Other participants in the round include new investors Silver8 Capital and Ignia, as well as previous Abra backers Arbor Ventures, American Express, Jungle Ventures, Lehrer Hippeau and RRE.  However, just as notable is that the round marks Foxconn's first investment in a bitcoin-focused firm.  While, previously, Foxconn has tested blockchain technology for supply chain management, its investment in Abra shows a new willingness for the company – best known as the manufacturer of Apple's iPhone – to embrace other potential use cases. Since Abra is a purveyor of a bitcoin remittance app, the investment could be read as a business-to-consumer and financial inclusion play.  Still, Abra founder and CEO Bill Barhydt was quick to note that he envisions his company's technology as having broader implications, including those that might be of interest to large manufacturing firms.  Armed with a platform that enables bitcoin micropayments and smart contracts, Barhydt went so far as to project that Abra's technology can underpin a new type of consumer credit product. In this vision, makers of refrigerators, televisions and more could lease appliances to people who may not want to pay the full value upfront – with blockchain technology giving consumers an incentive to make installment payments.  Barhydt told CoinDesk:  ""We foresee a whole new market growing in this area of consumer asset finance.""  To be sure, the idea of smart contract-connected IoT appliances has been talked about for years, with little to show for it so far. Further, Foxconn's investment is just that, and no manufacturer has yet committed to testing out Barhydt's idea.  But Foxconn finds it compelling. Jack Lee, a founder and managing partner at HCM International, the manufacturer's venture capital arm, said he believes that Abra could usher in what he called a ""new era"" of financial inclusion via solutions like credit services.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Lee added that, from a business perspective, ""companies can make more money from delivering the [financial] service than just from making margins on the hardware.""  Also boding well for the leasing concept is the fact that, in addition to its contract work for companies like Apple, Foxconn also owns Sharp, the consumer home appliance brand.  ""I'd hope they'd be one of the first [to try it],"" Barhydt said.  Broader horizons  But while ambitious, the plans are not without precedent.  Barhydt's new vision was inspired by his travels in Africa, where he saw how solar companies were integrating products into mobile money systems like Kenya's M-Pesa by embedding cellular modems in hardware. If the consumers made weekly payments, solar lanterns worked; if not, they would be remotely shut off.  This pay-as-you-go ""jukebox model,"" as Barhydt calls it, has made solar more widely affordable.  Bitcoin, Barhydt contends, enables replication of that consumer financing model on a global scale, for a broader range of consumer asset purchases – particularly when used in the background the way Abra does. While consumers who use Abra's flagship payment app can hold balances in local fiat currencies (it's actually bitcoin, hedged with smart contracts), transfers between wallets ride on bitcoin's rails, which know no borders.  That global reach would enable manufacturers to offer this kind of digitized credit to consumers in more places, Barhydt said.  ""If I want to ship a device anywhere in the world without having to modify the device or create limitations on where the device can be shipped, I need a guaranteed payment vehicle that would work in any country,"" he said, adding:  ""I believe Abra and the way we use bitcoin solves that problem. The alternative is to figure out a country-by-country payment model.""  Tech uncertainty  Of course, this new consumer credit use case depends on bitcoin being able to resolve its longstanding scaling challenges and hold down network transaction fees so that regular, small payments become viable.  Barhydt readily acknowledged this big ""if.""  ""Everything I’m saying assumes that bitcoin scales correctly,"" he said.  In the short term, this means Barhydt believes bitcoin needs the capacity benefits from a block size increase, and that he favors the contentious Segwit2x hard fork expected in mid-November.  Still, despite the uncertainties surrounding bitcoin, Barhydt said he considers the protocol ""uniquely qualified"" to execute the kind of smart contracts Abra already uses for payments and investment products and that it now hopes to pioneer for consumer asset finance.  Even though ethereum, unlike bitcoin, was designed specifically for smart contracts, ""there's still a lot of security issues"" with that protocol, he said.  Moreover, Abra's smart contracts basically boil down to moving value from A to B under certain conditions, which is simple enough for bitcoin to handle, Barhydt said.  ""If I needed some Turing-complete smart contract to fill my vision, then bitcoin would probably be hard to do,"" he said. ""The reason we trust bitcoin in the scenario I described is that it doesn’t require bitcoin to do a lot, it just requires it to do it really well.""  Barhydt concluded:  ""Bitcoin is not hacked because it doesn't do much. And that's a good thing”  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra, and also helped organize the Segwit2x scaling agreement.

42427953,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vfh,1508761805,Blockchain for Inclusion? Gates Foundation Strikes Tepid Tone at Money2020,"Bitcoin and other blockchain applications may help expand access to financial services for the world's poor, but the technology is not the cure-all that some of the early rhetoric in the space made it out to be.  That’s the takeaway from a panel discussion Sunday at Money2020 in Las Vegas featuring representatives of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Omidyar Network, two of the most prominent philanthropic organizations focused on promoting financial inclusion.  While both executives said they see potential from distributed ledger technology to support their mission, their enthusiasm for the prospect was notably subdued.  Kosta Peric  , the deputy director for financial services for the poor at the Gates Foundation, went so far as to downplay the blockchain-like aspects of his organization's recently announced Mojaloop software. The open-source software is designed to make disparate financial networks interoperable, all in the service of helping the world's underbanked.  While Mojaloop makes use of Ripple's Interledger Protocol, ""it’s not exactly a blockchain,"" Peric said. ""Some pieces of that are inspired by blockchain.""  Slow and redundant  Peric was particularly lukewarm on the usefulness of bitcoin and other public blockchains for financial inclusion.  Specifically, they are not adequate for domestic payment systems, he said. One reason is performance: no public blockchain can match the 1,000 or more transactions per second of real-time domestic payment systems, Peric said.  Also, public blockchains do not make sense for this use case because ""payment data from one country ends up being spread across the planet.""  He tempered these comments by adding that public chains ""can totally make sense"" for international remittances. But moving money is not the only way blockchains can be useful for financial inclusion, said Arjuna Costa, a partner at Omidyar Network.  ""Beyond payments, there's a lot of potential we haven't tapped yet,"" he said, describing two use cases that would help poor people get access to capital, albeit indirectly.  One such use case Costa mentioned lies in land registries, which would help people secure title to properties that they could then borrow against. Another is using blockchains to analyze payment flows (including receipts and invoices) for small businesses, which would then help financial institutions to assess their creditworthiness and therefore lend to them.  ""The potential of distributed ledger technology is very high,"" Costa said.  Bitcoin supporter  The most enthusiastic voice about blockchain during the session was the moderator, Christine Duhaime, founder of the Digital Finance Institute, a fintech think tank based in Vancouver, Canada.  ""One of my favorite technologies of all time is bitcoin,"" said Duhaime, who is also a lawyer with a specialized anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist-financing law practice.  To illustrate why she likes the cryptocurrency, she pointed to the work of Code to Inspire, an organization that teaches Afghan women and girls how to code, how to find work online – and how to use bitcoin. It gives these women a measure of financial autonomy and privacy in a country where financial services are unavailable to them or unsafe to use.  Duhaime even went so far as to laud initial coin offerings, the process by which startups or open-source project raise funds by issuing a custom cryptocurrency.  While acknowledging that the controversial fundraising method has risks, she said it could go a long way toward expanding access to capital for underbanked entrepreneurs.  Duhaime concluded:  ""It allows access to capital for Joe Average on the street. It could be a farmer, it could be a billionaire – it doesn’t matter. You skip the markets, you skip the infrastructure, you get access to capital.""

42427969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4wBh,1508759120,"Prepping for a Pullback? Bitcoin Price Drops Below $6,000","After rallying to a new record high, bitcoin is once again trending down.  According to Coindesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin prices dipped below $5,800 this morning – prices first passed the $6,000 mark on Friday and set the new all-time high (of $6,148) at 15:00 UTC on Saturday. That figure takes the cumulative returns from the September low of $2,980 to more than 100 percent.  The record rally indicates that the regulatory crackdown in China, and subsequent fears of similar restrictions across the globe, have failed to dampen investor sentiment. Meanwhile, the potential benefits of holding bitcoin ahead of another hard fork (in November) – which promises the creation of a new cryptocurrency – have only boosted its appeal.  However, price action analysis suggests BTC could be setting up for a deeper pullback.  It's worth noting that bitcoin has rallied close to 500 percent since the start of 2017. In light of the stellar gains, a pullback of more than 20 percent will qualify as healthy correction and not a bear market as widely believed. (A drop of 20 percent or more is considered an entry into a bear market.)  Potential bearish divergence  The daily chart shows:  Prices stuck at channel resistance  Relative strength index (RSI) is overbought  Money flow index (MFI) has breached the rising trend line and has turned downwards from the overbought region  Lower highs on the RSI and MFI  The Money Flow Index (MFI), also known as volume-weighted RSI, is an oscillator that uses both price and volume to indicate overbought and oversold conditions.  View  Potential bearish reversal pattern: A negative close below $5,755 (Sunday's low) would confirm the bearish doji reversal and bearish RSI & MFI divergence. Prices could then witness a deeper pullback to $5,000–$4,800 levels. Bearish divergence occurs when price forms higher highs and indicators form lower highs.  Bullish Scenario: Consolidation around $6,000 for a couple of days, followed by an upside break of the channel later this week, would open doors for a sustained rally to $7,073 (Fibonacci extension level).

42427960,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4vvh,1508749203,R3 Files Patents for 'Dynamic' DLT Recordkeeping,"Consortium startup R3 has filed two patent applications detailing its work on applying distributed ledger tech to ""dynamic"" agreements between financial institutions.  The two applications – submitted last year and published by the the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Oct. 19 – detail the use of a system for tracking, maintaining and updating agreements via a shared ledger.  Using the system, only authorized parties can make changes to those agreements – provided the other involved parties sign off on them – while the platform's underlying tech records and maintains the status of those agreements.  Possible applications for the technology include financial transactions such as cash exchanges and derivatives contracts, as well as more office-focused uses like work rosters and supply schedules, according to the filings.  In describing the application, R3 writes that the developments in applied cryptography and distributed ledgers have presented ""the possibility of authoritative systems of record that are securely shared between firms.""  The company goes on to say:  ""This provides the opportunity to transform the economics of financial firms, for example in post-trade services, by implementing a new shared platform for the recording of financial events and processing of business logic: one where a single global logical ledger is authoritative for all agreements between firms recorded on it, even though the relationships and obligations recorded may remain between those firms.""  R3 announced in August 2016 that it was seeking patents related to its work, constituting what co-founder Todd McDonald described as a ""total reimagining of the back office.""  The filings themselves came weeks before the November 2016 public debut of the code behind Corda, R3's DLT platform. Version 1.0 of the Corda software was published on Oct. 3.

42427967,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4w7h,1508745632,Thinking Big? Bank Blockchains Will Advance By Doing Anything But,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.      While blockchain news may seem flooded these days with bank-sponsored projects either launching or hitting milestones, readers will be forgiven for feeling underwhelmed. There are many big names, true, but the projects themselves seem, in general, small.  This may be largely accurate, but it is misleading.  As everyone knows, finance is a huge field, comprised of a vast array of intersecting and intertwined activities. But it's difficult to appreciate just how complicated it is. The extent to which each step depends on several others, and the risks inherent in just about every one, highlight the fragility of the current system and point to how it will evolve.  Take, for example, the report from earlier this week that Spanish bank BBVA is working on a Corda-based pilot to improve foreign exchange (FX) matching.  FX is one of the largest asset groups traded on capital markets around the world. Matching (validating information and pairing buy and sell orders) is, however, just one step in FX trading, and it doesn't even touch the concept of settlement and payment.  However, a blockchain-based process could, in theory, enhance platform compatibility, reduce the amount of errors and make the process more transparent, lowering trading costs and supporting liquidity.  Start small, aim high  As another example, this past week, French bank BNP Paribas revealed it is working on a blockchain platform to improve corporate action announcements, such as dividend payments and stock splits.  Note that the actual payments and splits will not themselves be executed on the platform – it just aims to improve the verifiable and unhackable delivery of the information.  While this may not sound like a big deal, it is: corporate actions typically affect the value of a security, and errors (one recent study showed that almost 10 percent contain factual inaccuracies, and over 20 percent were incomplete) can produce material losses.  If you look at other bank-related news from the past few weeks, you’ll see a similar trend: big names in finance looking at potential blockchain impact on relatively small parts of their activities.  But the small parts generally have big impacts – they provide the ""plumbing"" that makes the flashier aspects of finance run smoothly. Making them more efficient will have a direct effect on other parts of the system, including the banks' bottom line.  Nevertheless, this may seem like a cautious ""dipping of the toe"" into blockchain waters. Where are the grand goals? Where is the more resilient financial structure that the new technology promised?  Building blocks  It is slowly emerging, through piecemeal trials and tentative implementations. This is how the ""blockchainization"" of finance will happen. Bit by little bit.  Banks are not going to ""think big"" with such a new and relatively untested concept. Nor should they, given their operations' systemic importance.  Modest trials, on the other hand, are not only an opportunity for financial institutions to test the technology within a manageable scope and budget. They are also the only process regulators will allow – a sweeping shift in how information and value is handled will no doubt frighten the overseers into taking preventive measures.  Small steps, each rigorously tested, are unlikely to set off alarms. Also, this approach is scalable.  If, for instance, BBVA finds that the blockchain platform for FX matching provides tangible positive results, the test can be opened up to other banks, and can be expanded to include other financial assets.  The small connections, when put together, will make up the big picture – by implementing improvements, step by step, and then scaling where possible. And the focused projects that today seem limited will one day coalesce to reveal the full potential of a new way of handling finance.  Meanwhile, we should pay attention to the baby steps – we will soon see that they’re not so baby after all.

The financial regulator, which runs a regulatory sandbox to allow new types of companies to test ""innovative products, services and business models in a live market environment,"" reportedly witnessed startups in its fintech testing framework being blocked from opening accounts.  The FCA did not name the startups involved or the banks that denied them services.  As the report stated:  ""We have witnessed the denial of banking services first-hand across a number of firms in the first two cohorts of the sandbox. Difficulties have been particularly pronounced for firms wishing to leverage DLT, become payment institutions, or become electronic money institutions.""  Startups working with the technology, including using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, have long had banking access issues. Yet, the fact that these troubles are now extending to blockchain and distributed ledger firms is notable given the role of the FCA in policing the U.K. financial sector, as well as the differences in open and permissioned blockchain systems.  Exacerbating problems, the report indicates that the standards by which the startups are being assessed are not consistent from bank to bank.  ""We are concerned by what appear to be blanket refusals for certain kinds of applicant firms. There are also apparent inconsistencies within individual banks regarding how they apply their assessment criteria in approving access to banking services,"" the FCA wrote.  The report went on to note that some banks are concerned about the appearance of money laundering and financing terrorist organizations, along with lending to potentially risky ventures.  Despite the banking issues, however, the report found that “the first year of the sandbox met a genuine demand,” and that the authority was “encouraged” by the results.
