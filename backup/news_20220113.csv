42396224,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1h98,1642116600,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Erases Prior Days' Gains; Altcoins Slide,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin's price slid in tandem with tech stocks.  Technician’s take: BTC downside could persist into the Asia trading day; support around $40K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,581 -3.2%  Ether (ETH): $3,250 -3.5%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,659 -1.4%  DJIA: $36,113 -0.4%  Nasdaq: $14,806 -2.5%  Gold: $1,822 -0.1%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) slid on Thursday, erasing the prior day's gains but staying within the past few weeks' trading range of roughly $40,000 to $44,000.  News in the market included a potential ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan along with signs that bitcoin miners are increasing their accumulation of the cryptocurrency, apparently refusing to sell at current prices.  A prominent Wall Street commodities analyst said that bitcoin is likely to outperform the raw materials staples oil and copper over the coming decade.  Tether said it froze $160 million of its dollar-linked stablecoins USDT on the Ethereum blockchain, while CoinDesk columnist David Morris weighed in on bitcoin, inflation and the expectations game.  But the likely culprit of bitcoin's slide on Thursday was that it traded in tandem with tech stocks, with the Nasdaq 100 suddenly swooning on investor fears that the Federal Reserve will move within the next few months to start raising interest rates for the first time since 2018.  Mary Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Reuters in an interview that it ""seems a quite reasonable thing"" to start raising interest rates in March.  A tightening of monetary conditions by the Federal Reserve could put downward pressure on prices for risky assets, from stocks to cryptocurrencies, while also curbing inflation – potentially reducing the appeal of bitcoin, which has been bought by many investors as a hedge against inflation, which is rising at its fastest pace in nearly four decades.  Is that a bullish sign, or bearish? Time may tell.  ""It does feel like markets are at peak fear on U.S. monetary policy which could make relief rallies more likely,"" Craig Erlam, an analyst for the foreign-exchange brokerage Oanda, wrote Thursday in a market update. ""But there is also underlying anxiety in the markets that could make for some volatile price action for the foreseeable future.""  Erlam predicts that if bitcoin could break above $45,500, ""we could see another sharp move higher as belief starts to grow that the worst of the rout is behind it.""  Technician's take  Bitcoin Stalls Near Resistance; Support Around $40K-$42K  Bitcoin pulled back after buyers took some profits near the $44,000-$45,000 resistance zone.  The cryptocurrency remains in a short-term downtrend, although support at around $40,000 could stabilize the pullback.  BTC is down about 2% over the past 24 hours and is roughly flat over the past week. A decisive break above $45,000 is needed to reverse the short-term downtrend, but slowing momentum suggests price weakness could persist into the Asia trading day.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the four-hour chart declined near overbought levels, similar to what occurred in late December, which preceded a pullback in price. Buyers will likely remain on the sidelines until oversold conditions materialize, most likely over the next few days.

El Salvador is a case in point for a country that has committed fully to the bitcoin mission, putting millions of dollars into the digital asset as a national reserve. While bitcoin is still a long way from being the de facto reserve currency of all countries, its growth points to countries not being able to ignore it for much longer. That&apos;s why it is expected that more nation-states will purchase the cryptocurrency in the next year. Fidelity On Why Countries Will Purchase Bitcoin In a recent report published by Fidelity, it goes into depth about bitcoin and the role it may play in deciding which countries are the economic leaders of the world.

42396222,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1hA7,1642112638,FDIC Still Unclear if USDF Stablecoin Is FDIC-Insurable,"Several FDIC-insured banks uniting to put out a stablecoin may seem to address lingering worries about this critical part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, the details – including whether the agency can insure the stablecoin’s owners’ deposits – remain to be fleshed out.  On Wednesday, a group of U.S. banks, including FirstBank of Nashville, Synovus, New York Community Bank (NYCB), and Sterling National Bank, announced plans to offer its own stablecoin, called USDF, in an effort to bring stablecoins to the everyday banking client.  All the banks are institutions backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), a key regulator in the industry, which is why the stablecoin is promoted as “a more secure option for transacting on blockchain,” according to the press release.  FDIC-insured banks qualify for pass-through insurance, which protects bank depositors against losses of up to $250,000 in case of a bank failure.  “We are designing the network to allow for FDIC insurance to apply to the deposits underlying USDF, up to the $250K limit,” Andrew Kaplan, NYCB chief digital and banking as a service officer, told CoinDesk.  Figure co-founder Mike Cagney tweeted that “USDF is a fungible claim to fiat to any member bank. USDF can only be delivered to a KYC’d wallet, and such movement is visible on the public chain. This combination satisfies the primary regulatory objectives.”  Yet, neither Synovus, one of the banks that is part of the consortium, nor the FDIC could confirm whether the actual token holder in this case would be subject to the pass-through insurance and therefore, protected against losses of up to $250,000.  In October, sources told CoinDesk that the FDIC has been considering whether stablecoin reserves would qualify for such insurance, but the matter still seems to be unsolved.  “With respect to the insurability of funds and all of the future use cases, I don’t want to speculate on that right now,” Synovus Head of Innovation and USDF Consortium board member Matt Maxey said Thursday.  Similarly, a spokesperson for the FDIC told CoinDesk Thursday that it is “too early to be answering questions about whether or not stablecoins are FDIC insurable.”  The consortium has been in dialogue with several regulatory bodies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC, since before the announcement, Wade Peery, chief administration officer at FirstBank said on CoinDesk TV. He said that the “underlying deposit account is subject to FDIC insurance.”  The announcement was released on the same day that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified in front of Congress as part of his renomination hearing. He addressed stablecoin policy, saying that he had no intention of banning private stablecoins even if the U.S. created a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  “I would say the timing is more based on the fact that with the dialogue we’ve had with regulators … and the functionality of this and the plan to work within boundaries as we gained acceptance from those folks, we felt comfortable going forward,” Peery said.

Taking a look at oil, McGlone pointed out that prices for the benchmark U.S. crude variety West Texas Intermediate are down about 20% over the past year because of shifts in the supply-demand balance. In 2012, demand exceeded supply by 6 million barrels a day in North America, but there's now a supply surplus of 3 million barrels a day, according to his report. A driving force is that more oil can be extracted for less money.  Then there's copper. McGlone predicts copper prices have peaked and are facing headwinds because Chinese demand has slowed.  What's different about bitcoin, according to McGlone, is the top cryptocurrency by market cap comes with a ""lack of supply elasticity."" Because the pace of new bitcoin production is already set by the underlying blockchain's programming, a higher price won't automatically lead to more supply.  According to the analyst's calculations, one bitcoin is now worth more than 500 barrels of oil, up from ""a mere fraction"" of what a barrel of oil was worth in 2012.  “Supply, demand, adoption and advancing technology point to the crypto continuing to outperform fossil fuel in the next 10 years,” McGlone wrote.  Similarly, one bitcoin is now worth about 4.4 tons of copper, compared with a mere fraction a decade ago.  ""Copper may be a good example of the low potential for a commodity supercycle, notably versus an advancing bitcoin,"" McGlone wrote. ""It's not that profound to expect one of the best-performing assets of the past decade to keep outpacing the old-guard industrial metal, and we see bitcoin's upper hand gaining endurance, and maturity, versus copper.""  One caveat is how challenging it can be to predict the future trajectory of the blockchain industry – not to mention cryptocurrency prices.  It bears mentioning that McGlone in mid-2021 was forecasting a bullish bitcoin market, with a price target of $100,000. He reiterated that confidence in December.  But bitcoin is currently changing hands around $43,000, well off the all-time high price near $69,000 reached in November.

The complaint comes two weeks after Gupta filed a complaint in New York state court saying the firm owes her money for her work in starting ConsenSys Ventures.  In its complaint filed in a Delaware court on Monday, ConsenSys alleged that Gupta induced the company to hire her ""by claiming to have stellar qualifications"" that turned out to be fraudulent. The suit claims credentials from Harvard Business School, MIT and The World Bank were fabricated.  ConsensSys alleged in the complaint that Gupta lacked the skills to manage a venture fund and that ""her toxic and abusive personality"" caused the firm to lose employees and business opportunities.  Business Insider first reported on the escalating feud.  In a phone interview with CoinDesk, Gupta said that she will be filing an expanded version of her Dec. 31 complaint, in which she asked for damages of at least $30 million.  Gupta described ConsenSys's efforts as an attempt to ""just really take away my reputation"" and ""a public mockery."" She disputed ConsenSys's characterizations, saying she had been mistreated and that investors in her current fund had been founders in ConsenSys Ventures. ""I'm disputing everything,"" she said.  In its Jan. 10 complaint, ConsenSys said that when the firm pressed her, Gupta could not verify her credentials and ""resorted to lying – even going so far as to forge documents – to conceal her fraud.""  In the suit, ConsenSys said that it allowed Gupta to resign instead of firing her and ""offered to allow Gupta to keep the compensation paid and accrued during her short tenure,"" but that Gupta had rejected the offer – instead demanding that ConsenSys ""pay her millions of dollars"" to buy out a ""purported equity interest"" in the firm.  ConsenSys has asked the court to declare that Gupta ""is not entitled to any equity or other compensation"" and that she disgorge the $600,000 in salary and bonuses the firm paid her.  Gupta's lawyer, Peter Cane, said that ConsenSys would rather ""destroy Kavita's reputation than pay her for making them more than $300 million.""  Said Cane in a phone interview: ""Why would they be making these allegations for the first time in 2022?""

42396225,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1hC5,1642110313,"Bitcoin Miners Are Starting to ‘Hodl’ Again, but for How Long?","Crypto miners are starting the new year by increasing their accumulation of bitcoin, according to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode’s data. Amid the recent sharp drop in bitcoin prices, however, some miners might be forced to monetize their mined bitcoins.  The “miner net position change,” which tracks the 30-day change in the net buying and selling activity in the miners’ addresses, has seen a large positive change since Jan. 6 and has been carried over well into the second week of January, while at the same time the bitcoin price tumbled to nearly $40,000.  After the large spike in supplies held in miners’ wallets, the balance held in miner wallets has increased by about 6,474 bitcoins to about 1.826 million, as of Tuesday, versus 1.82 million in Dec. 31, Glassnode's data shows. Miners’ wallets may include other sources of bitcoin inflow, rather than just mined coins per day.  “We anticipate this trend of miners holding on to their bitcoin rewards is likely a result of them being prudent with their finances by holding their crypto until prices rise,” said Danni Zheng, vice president at BIT Mining. “We imagine other miners like us will wait to strategically sell our bitcoin holdings in order to lock in optimal returns.”  Furthermore, another metric that points to similar holding patterns by the miners has also reached an all-time high. The “miner unspent supply,” or the total number of coins that are rewarded to miners for solving a block but have never been moved on-chain, reached a record 1.779 million on Tuesday, according to Glassnode data.  “As the price of bitcoin falls further, the miner unspent supply is increasing and the miner net position change is becoming more positive,” said Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock. This indicates that bitcoin as an asset is becoming more scarce as miners are choosing to hold onto their mined coins rather than sell them, Sotiriou added.  Proxy for bitcoin  In 2021, when bitcoin rallied to hit all-time highs and the total network hashrate was relatively low, holding onto the mined digital currency on their balance sheet paid off for miners. The heavy leverage to bitcoin helped the shares of the publicly traded miners to ride the upswing in bitcoin prices and provided access to the capital markets for miners big and small.  “The hodl strategy paid off in 2021 as miners were rewarded for a heavy allocation to bitcoin in their treasury management,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of Seattle-based mining company Luxor. And the trend is continuing this year as many miners are still being seen as a proxy for bitcoin in public markets, given there is a delay in a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund getting regulatory approval in the U.S., he added.  With ample access to funding and investors pouring in money, miners didn’t have to sell their bitcoin to fund operational costs, said Compass Mining’s CEO Whit Gibbs. “And since miners are incredibly bullish on bitcoin, this allows them to do what they want to do naturally, which is to speculate on bitcoin’s positive price appreciation,” he added.  Bitcoin spending  To be sure, not all miners have similar strategies, and while some held onto all or most of their mined bitcoins last year, others were using some of theirs to reinvest in their businesses. In fact, bitcoin miner CleanSpark said on Jan. 6 that the company sold 414 bitcoins in December at an average price of $49,791 to support the company's growth and operations.  However, holding onto the mined bitcoin may not work for some miners anymore, as bitcoin price has fallen more than 30% since reaching its all-time high in November, and competition is expected to rise as the network's hashrate picks up this year.  “Many miners are holding onto mined BTC with the expectation that the price will recover,” said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at Foundry. However, “given the recent dip in price and sluggish start to 2022, some will now have to sell more mined BTC than previously to cover their monthly costs,” he added.  Avoid dilution  However, using some of the mined cryptocurrency to reinvest in the company’s business could ultimately end up helping the miners as it might enable them to fund their growth without offering more shares or increasing debt load. “The downside of 100% hodling is that operating expenses must then be financed through debt or dilution,” said Matthew Schultz, executive chairman of CleanSpark.  “We continue to see the value in using BTC to support operating expenses and growth, as well as a preferred store of value compared to USD,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/13/bitcoin-miners-are-starting-to-hodl-again-but-for-how-long,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6acdb887e5dc28fdf174742bbb78aa8d8328a4fc-5037x3319.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396213,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1h0H,1642109066,Coinbase Tries to Catch Up to Foreign-Based Rivals With Move Into Derivatives,"For Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, offering derivatives trading for customers is a necessary step as it seeks to catch up to rival exchanges in the huge and lucrative market.  On Wednesday, Coinbase announced the acquisition of FairX, a derivatives exchange that's regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Coinbase said that “deep and liquid derivatives markets are essential to the functioning of traditional capital markets” and noted how “these products are in high demand from investors who seek to effectively manage risk, execute complex trading strategies and gain exposure to crypto outside of existing spot markets.”  Coinbase rivals such as Binance, FTX and OKEx have benefitted from their early starts in offering derivatives trading and from the fact that they are based outside the U.S., because regulations are often less stringent and taxes lower outside the country.  “Coinbase has kind of been left out, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they’re U.S.-based,” Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital assets group at Canada's Ninepoint Partners, told CoinDesk in an interview. “All of these other exchanges have reaped huge financial rewards” from derivative-related products, he said.  Binance, which isn't based in the U.S., had about $54 billion in derivatives trading volume over the most recent 24-hour period, versus about $16.8 billion in spot trading, according to CoinMarketCap. Seychelles-based OKEx posted roughly $15.5 billion in derivatives trading volume and $5.5 billion in spot trading, and Bahamas-based FTX posted about $5.4 billion in derivatives trading and $2 billion in spot trading. Coinbase had about $3.3 billion in spot trading over the same period, CoinMarketCap’s data shows.  In October, FTX.US bought regulated futures exchange LedgerX, which is now known as FTX US Derivatives, as it moves to offer derivatives trading to its American customers. Last month, parent company FTX became a member of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).  Derivatives marketplace CME Group could end up being a competitor in the U.S. for Coinbase’s crypto derivatives business, according to Owen Lau, a research analyst at Oppenheimer. CME told Oppenheimer on an earnings call that it has an edge in bitcoin derivatives given its offerings across many asset classes, its risk management experience and its highly regulated platform. Still, Coinbase’s customer base can help the exchange “draw trading volume and create [a] deep liquidity pool,” noted Lau, who has an outperform rating on Coinbase’s stock.  Meanwhile, Cboe Global Markets could also represent competition: It acquired crypto spot and derivatives marketplace ErisX in October. That deal gave Cboe a new set of crypto derivatives offerings through ErisX’s bitcoin and ether futures products, in addition to spot crypto trading.  Coinbase can become the dominant U.S. player for retail derivatives trading, though its success hinges on favorable regulation being passed, Tapscott said. Still, as a public company, Coinbase needs new growth areas and purchasing FairX is a “very good place to start,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/13/coinbase-tries-to-catch-up-to-foreign-based-rivals-with-move-into-derivatives,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/471b4029661f8a9ccd9ca77700b88a19b691e302-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Pitched as a “$5 grad school,” it has featured conversations with artists, curators and researchers at the bleeding edge of blockchain technology, along with critiques of the so-called “platform internet,” or the state of the web as it exists today.  Acolytes of the podcast are everywhere, in crypto. And Herndon and Dryhurst aren’t the only game in town – other art-centric communities and content creators are beginning to flirt with crypto, too, and tackling many of the same issues as “Interdependence.”  Read more: Nas Selling Rights to Two Songs via Crypto Music Startup Royal  The result is competition; creators with similar interests end up fighting for similar audiences.  Enter Channel, a three-pronged media collective from Interdependence, the artist and researcher Joshua Citarella and an amorphous online community-cum-publisher-cum-editorial platform called New Models.  All three currently monetize their work on Patreon, with a subscription model. With Channel, they’re hoping to bundle their businesses with a digital membership card that’s distinctly Web 3: an NFT, or non-fungible token.  “We're a decentralized media organization with aims of opening it up into a general protocol that other people can use,” said Daniel Keller, one of the founders of New Models.  Eventually, it will become a “stack for creators” looking to “squad up.”  For now, that just means putting these three content businesses under one roof.  The initial offer is a limited edition membership NFT for early adopters, priced relatively high – 0.3 ETH, or around $1,000. It offers access to an RSS feed with the combined content of all three podcasts as well as a Discord server for communicating directly with the developers behind the project.  A “month or two” after the first NFT drop, Channel will launch an uncapped series of programmable NFT memberships “at a much lower price,” said Keller. They also plan to airdrop these NFTs to existing Patreon subscribers.  Friends With Benefits, or FWB, the prominent crypto social club and DAO, recently announced plans for a similar sort of programmable NFT. It’s essentially a digital ID badge that can be updated with stickers, rewards and certifications as its owner interacts with different corners of the Web 3 ecosystem.  But Channel’s vision is for other content creators to use this same framework for their businesses. And, at some point, they plan to release a set of tools allowing for just that.  Duncan Wilson, one of the developers on the project (he comes from a machine learning background), drew a distinction between Channel the media organization – that is, Interdependence, Joshua Citarella and New Models – and Channel the toolkit, or protocol.  “Let's say you are a podcast creator, and you are coordinating with two or three other podcasts,” he said. “I think instead of trying to make sure you don't schedule the same guests, and do all of this stuff that a lot of people are doing anyway with competitors in the same ideological spaces, [you] should see this as an opportunity to create this more ‘squad’ dynamic – like, [a] pseudo-organization that can just spring up around the protocol that's eventually released.”  Read more: Will Gottsegen - What’s Next for Friends With Benefits?  It’s a problem all three creators say they’ve faced in the past.  “Holly and I, we kind of tiptoe around,” said Dryhurst. “Like, there's a book that comes out, and I know we're gonna be interested in it [for 'Interdependence']. And then it happens on New Models and I'm like, I'm not going to touch that, because they did a really good job.”  Mirror, a crypto-backed publishing platform that launched in late 2020, offers similar tools for creators to join forces and monetize their work, like revenue splits and mechanisms for joint NFT drops. It’s already built a solid reputation as a platform for monetizing creative work.  But the Channel team says it hopes to complement those systems, rather than compete.  “The whole point of this endeavor is anti-competition,” Dryhurst said. “That was the original motivation for why we all came together. [We were] looking to build interdependent media stuff.”  There’s a common culture in these Ethereum-based projects, and Channel is looking to capitalize on it, helping creators monetize their work together.  “Something in between Mirror and FWB, is where I would place us in the ecosystem,” Keller said. “There's a huge overlap in the communities already, and this is going to be building synergies, as opposed to redundancies.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | SPONSORED | AIRDROP,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/13/channel-wants-content-creators-to-squad-up-via-web-3,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5d3f4120217e2474c4563eec0d63711b91723296-960x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

We’re working on a stablecoin. We’re working on a corporate registry,” Whipps told CoinDesk.  Also on the agenda for citizens of Palau are digital wallets for every resident. Whipps said he has already signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with crypto payments firm Ripple to make it happen.  “One of the challenges that we have in Palau is, it's hard to get pennies, it's hard to get quarters,” Whipps said. “Cash shortages are a real thing here, so what digital wallets would really provide is freedom, freedom from having to go to the bank.”  Read more: Republic of Palau Joins Hands With Ripple to Develop Digital Currency Strategy  If the ambitious agenda comes to fruition, Palau would join the Marshall Islands in the region as crypto-forward countries looking to carve out an edge in the global economy.

42396216,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT1h4D,1642103294,OCC Chief Hsu Says Regulation Could Boost Stablecoin Innovation,"Regulating stablecoin issuers like banks could encourage innovation in the crypto industry, according to top U.S. banking regulator Michael Hsu.  Speaking at an event on Thursday, Hsu – the acting comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) – told attendees that increased regulations for the stablecoin industry could also make innovations longer-lasting.  “While innovation thrives in uncertain environments, solid foundations can help,” Hsu said. “Especially when it comes to money and trust.”  As the stablecoin market continues to grow, surpassing $150 billion last year, lawmakers and regulators are becoming more concerned about the ability to regulate the booming industry and the contagion risks from a potential run on stablecoin issuers in the event of a market collapse.  “The growth and mainstreaming of crypto means that a stablecoin run would not just impact those directly invested in it,” Hsu said. “There would be collateral damage. And the potential scope of that damage will continue to grow as long as crypto expands.”  Hsu continued, adding:  “Fortunately, we have an effective tool to mitigate run risk: bank regulation.”  Hsu’s call to impose bank-like regulations on stablecoin issuers echoes similar recommendations made by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) in its stablecoin report published in November. The PWG’s report urged Congress to enact a law that would treat stablecoin issuers like banks – though the report didn't go into detail about how that would be done – a recommendation that has been met with bipartisan pushback on Capitol Hill.  Hsu’s sudden fondness for crypto innovation is a departure from comments he made on CoinDesk TV last November, when he said that constant innovation in the stablecoin sector was “not what you want.”  “You want your money to be stable and reliable, you want it to be there in good times and bad times and not have to think about it,” Hsu said on CoinDesk TV. “If you innovate too much in that space, you’re going to get a wide range of outcomes that some of which are not going to be good.”  Hsu’s tenure as acting comptroller of the OCC has been marked by a more ambivalent attitude toward cryptocurrencies than that of his predecessor, Brian Brooks, under whose leadership the bank regulator issued guidance aimed at bringing the crypto industry into the fold of the greater financial system.  When Hsu took office last May, he ordered a review of all the crypto-related guidance issued by the OCC under Brooks.",POSITIVE,없음,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/13/occ-chief-hsu-says-regulation-could-boost-stablecoin-innovation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/424160406add4cbf3d976d51febfdc71c2c4d189-2000x1334.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

For the first half of January, OpenSea has generated nearly $2.7 billion in volume, which is on track to surpass the $3.4 billion high it notched in August, according to data from Dune Analytics.  On Jan. 9, OpenSea recorded its largest single-day volume of $261 million dollars, according to Dune Analytics. For each day so far in January, OpenSea has broken $150 million in trading volume.  The resurgence in NFT volume appears to be driven by the price surge in NFT collection Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and its sister collections, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC). The BAYC collections alone account for approximately 10% of the volume on OpenSea, according to calculations by CoinDesk.  New developments in NFT trading are also bringing significant market structure changes to crypto’s hottest growing segment.  OpenSea is facing competition from newly launched decentralized NFT marketplace LooksRare, which generated nearly $400 million in sales volume in three days, rivaling numbers recorded by OpenSea.  As new entrants battle incumbent OpenSea for NFT market share, OpenSea volumes may be underestimating the pace of NFT adoption.  Another possible explanation for the boom in volumes was the launch of NFT marketplace aggregator Genie in November, which allowed deep-pocketed speculators to batch buy and sell NFTs in a single transaction, saving time and transaction costs.  The boom in NFT trading comes as broader cryptocurrency markets experienced bloodshed in the new year.  The price of bitcoin – the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – briefly plummeted below $40,000 on Monday, a loss of over 17% since the start of the year. Bitcoin has since rebounded and is trading at approximately $42,800 per coin at the time of publication.  Ether, the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum blockchain that has so far dominated NFT volume, lost 9.8% for the year to date.  OpenSea, founded in 2017, is the leading NFT marketplace. It recently raised $300 million in fresh capital in a Series C round led by venture capital firms Paradigm and Coatue. The fundraise puts OpenSea at a $13.3 billion valuation, up nearly tenfold from the startup’s $1.5 billion valuation in July.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/opensea-on-track-for-record-month-as-nft-sales-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2233b9db181d7bee4aabcedb8b771a185519ba8-2122x1413.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411549,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoAg,1642101286,ERC-4626: DeFi's Newest Money Lego,"ERC-4626 is a newly proposed Ethereum token standard that might resolve a sore issue in decentralized finance (DeFi): the mishmash of design types for tokens that print money.  Proposed Jan. 4, ERC-4626 co-creator Joey Santoro said Wednesday the token’s documentation is ready for “final review.” He called on the “giga chad brains” of Crypto Twitter to offer feedback on this novel Ethereum Improvement Proposal.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  If adopted, ERC-4626, the ""tokenized vault standard,"" will offer a general way for platforms like Aave or Yearn to build assets that reward users. The original scope of the proposal was to standardize just yield-bearing tokens to make them easier to build with, but now it covers a wider set of use cases. At the risk of overstatement: This could simplify parts of the entwined DeFi “stack” by creating a shared interface for tokens held in vaults and therefore save developers time and money.  “It's just an interface for depositing and withdrawing the token from any kind of strategy that handles a single token,” Santoro explained in a recent Solidity Friday podcast. ""Standardizing tokenized vault strategies will allow DeFi composability to explode. Better experience for developers AND users,"" he said on Twitter.  Decentralized finance is a nascent economy where people lend, borrow and steal tokens – all the basic financial services you can expect – without a middleman. It has grown from a sliver of the cryptocurrency market to its economic engine. There are some $95.2 billion worth of tokens “locked” into various Ethereum protocols alone, not counting other chains like Solana or Near.  One of the primary benefits of DeFi is the ability to generate yield, often at rates much higher than you could expect from traditional bonds or savings accounts. DeFi tools incentivize use and attract liquidity by paying out tokens. Take Sushi, a decentralized exchange, where users can stake their SUSHI tokens to receive xSUSHI, an instrument that pays returns.  Much of DeFi is “interoperable,” meaning that tokens can be plugged in on different platforms to perform different economic tasks. Santoro, who also co-founded the stablecoin platform Fei protocol, teamed up with two Rari devs, Jet Jadeja and the pseudonymous transmissions11, to make it easier to plug and play with yield tokens.  See also: Rari Capital, Fei Protocol Token Holders Approve Multibillion-Dollar DeFi Merger  There are essentially three ways to earn yield in DeFi: earning yield by lending (like on Compound), aggregating yield from different sources (like on Rari) and holding an “intrinsically yield-bearing” instrument that rebases the underlying asset (like xSushi), Santoro said.  “You can already see that those are like some pretty diverse use cases,” Santoro said. “And there is no standard interface for a token which generates yield.” He noted this is a problem not just for yield aggregators but across DeFi, which so far requires “custom connectors all over the place.”  It’s a small change that could have a profound impact, CoinDesk’s DeFi reporter Andrew Thurman said. It’s “very similar to wrapped ETH in my mind: an incremental change that most people don't even notice (wrapping/unwrapping ETH happens on the backend of lots of swaps, deposits, etc., now and users don't even know it's happening) but actually has huge impact on usability, liquidity and utility.”  Question remain about how this will propagate throughout DeFi and Ethereum broadly. The Defiant reports it won’t require a hard fork to implement. Like any other open-source development, the code is posted to Github and teams across the industry could implement it as they see fit.  “Please read the proposed spec, and give us your feedback. Let's make this work,” Alberto Cuesta Cañada, who is a co-author of the latest ERC-4626 documentation, said on Twitter. Some technically minded people have already raised concerns on GitHub.  Unlike some novel DeFi mechanisms, Santoro told CoinDesk in an email the proposal will undergo an audit by ""multiple firms before merging."" This overview will be paid for by Fei Labs on behalf of Tribe DAO, he said.  ""It's the beauty of open source development,"" CoinDesk's Thurman said. ""We can do jack all and some big brane dev [sic] just makes the whole thing better and more usable for everyone.""

On-chain data suggests that an uptick in exchange outflows may be behind the move. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Observe A Spike In The Past Couple Of Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC exchange outflows have showed raised values recently. The &apos;all exchanges outflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin exiting wallets of all exchanges. When the value of the metric goes up, it means more BTC is currently exiting exchanges. Such a trend has usually been bullish as holders usually withdraw their coins to personal wallets for hodling purposes. Prolonged large outflows can be a sign of whale accumulation. On the other hand, when the indicator&apos;s value stays low, it implies not many investors are moving their Bitcoin off exchanges at the moment. This trend can be bearish if the opposite metric, the inflow, spikes up. This is because holders usually deposit to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or for purchasing altcoins.

42411553,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOoDz,1642099397,The Urgent Need for Regulatory Clarity on Stablecoins,"Recently, leaders from six cryptocurrency companies testified before Congress about the opportunity and promise of digital currencies and also answered lawmakers' questions about the risks that come with their use. Stablecoins were at the center of much of the discussion as these fast-growing crypto assets are at the center of a debate around the regulation of cryptocurrency.  Tether – the largest stablecoin issuer – agreeing in October to pay the Commodity Futures Trading Commission $41 million for misrepresenting the dollar reserves behind its digital tokens provides glaring evidence that regulators and policymakers need to come together and quickly align on how to regulate this quickly expanding market before it impacts the broader financial world.  Max Baucus served as a U.S. senator from Montana (1978-2014) and ambassador to China (2014-17). He is now an adviser and government liaison at Binance.  Stablecoins, a type of digital currency whose value is backed by traditional fiat currencies, have quickly become a cornerstone of the crypto economy. Recently, the total supply of stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar surpassed the $113 billion mark, making it one of the fastest-growing asset classes in history.  As Ambassador to China in 2016, I would often hear about the blockchain and crypto currencies. In numerous meetings with world leaders, I would learn of the role they could play in creating a decentralized financial system, empowering communities, sparking innovation and financial inclusion.  When I left government service in 2017, stablecoins specifically caught my attention as they are intended to be stable in price and designed to hold their value over time.  Stablecoins have also caught the attention of regulators and policymakers around the world, including U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. All three have made their voices heard.  Yellen has urged policymakers to “act quickly” to establish a U.S. regulatory framework. Powell called for stricter regulation, speculating that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could present a suitable alternative to stablecoins.  Regulatory attitudes around stablecoins center around three main points of debate. Each of their outcomes will shape the future of stablecoins for good:  1. Should stablecoins be treated like securities?  There’s a long-standing debate around whether stablecoins – and crypto – should be treated as securities. However, there is no single litmus test to determine whether an asset class is a security, just as there is no single type of stablecoin. Recently, Gensler hinted that some stablecoins “may be securities and investment companies,” but stopped short of making a more decisive statement. While the debate around stablecoin classification is ongoing, the asset class – along with users from around the world – will surely benefit from greater regulatory clarity.  2. Are stablecoins truly 100% backed by fiat currencies?  Asset-backed stablecoins are digital currencies that are issued against traditional fiat currencies held on a 1:1 peg. In theory, one U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoin should be equal to one U.S. dollar. However, as we’ve seen in the case of tether, this is not always the case. In fact, many popular stablecoins are backed by a similar combination of cash and commercial paper, which is unsecured, short-term debt issued by companies to meet their financial obligations.  This is misleading to potential investors who may expect to be able to redeem their stablecoins in exchange for the backed currency at any time. And it likely represents a contagion threat given the use of commercial paper. Greater regulatory clarity is needed to ensure stablecoin offerings remain transparent and compliant.  3. Can stablecoins be used to sidestep public policy goals?  Some regulators believe that cryptocurrencies may be used to circumvent investor protection mechanisms and public policy initiatives. From what I’ve seen in the industry, stablecoin transactions are rather visible nowadays, thanks to blockchain analysis.  In one recent case, hackers stole and then subsequently returned nearly $600 million in funds from a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, thanks in part to stablecoin issuers who froze a portion of the stolen funds – something that can’t easily be done with traditional fiat currencies.  Many of the largest crypto trading platforms often employ robust anti-money laundering and tax compliance initiatives in addition to instituting mandatory know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to identify users on their platform. Many of these initiatives consist of proactive efforts on the part of responsible industry participants to stay on top of the shifting regulatory landscape and to prevent users from abusing the platforms for nefarious purposes.  A wake-up call for investors  Though there are many reputable stablecoins on the market, not all of them live up to their name. In the meantime, investors should do careful research when selecting a stablecoin. There are a few features to look for in a trustworthy option, including whether it’s 1) regulated by one of the main global regulatory bodies, specifically for AML & KYC 2) subject to regular third-party audits 3) insured and 4) backed by a physical currency.  What’s next?  Many regulators recognize the potential for digital currencies like stablecoins to become a regular part of our day-to-day lives, powering transactions, purchases and more. Today, there’s an unprecedented opportunity for stablecoin providers to work alongside policymakers to define the regulatory landscape going forward.  In my opinion, the next stage of growth for the crypto industry will be powered not by rapid-fire innovation and overnight trends, but by responsible and mature industry players convening with policymakers and regulators to offer users compliant and safe products and services.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Max Baucus,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/01/13/the-urgent-need-for-regulatory-clarity-on-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a21eaf41c6bad527bcef48883327b921f7f6e2d3-3000x2000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Because of this, influencer marketing has turned into a lucrative business, with the industry said to become a $15 billion industry by the end of 2022. As per the latest calculations, 43% of all social media influencers make an average of $50,000 a year and the influencer economy is estimated to be more than $100 billion.

To back this claim, we can easily point to tech giants who are obviously in a race to be the first to market for the Metaverse industry.

42411533,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOnaJ,1642092892,NFTs Are Finance as an Aesthetic Medium,"The explosive, ten-figure growth of the NFT market over the past year will be remembered as a sea-change moment. And while it is difficult to imagine the market for new non-fungible tokens heating up forever, the rise and fall of individual objects should not damp the long-term outlook.  The speed at which this new, digital art market is taking shape is astonishing. You feel like an astronomer watching the formation of a galaxy in fast forward. The “modern” art market took centuries to develop, and it was only within the last 40 years that innovators (or depending on your view, greedy bad actors) introduced financial instruments such as credit lines to the sale of paintings and sculptures. By contrast, the financialization of NFTs is occurring moment to moment.  Michael Maizels is a technology researcher with Pilot44, a boutique innovation consulting firm in San Francisco, and is also affiliated with the metaLAB, a think tank and creative design studio at Harvard University.  NFTs are a perfect alignment between art and finance. They are two halves of a strange love-finance-aesthetics union hanging together with a precision that has never been achieved in any previous chapter of the interrelationship of art and money. Because NFTs themselves are a kind of currency, the creative possibilities they open (making, borrowing, sharing, rarity distributions, permissioned access, etc.) have direct analogs on the right side of the balance sheet (issuing, lending, pooling, risk curves, investor control, the beat goes on).  Call it finance as an aesthetic medium.  The world got a crash course in the emergent field of “creative economics,” or “token economics,” through the boom year of 2021. Though it began with the sale of a multimillion-dollar one of one, the story has been the rise of massive, community-driven projects epitomized by the Bored Apes (whose sales now top $1 billion). Just as one would rue the idea of building physical infrastructure with no consideration of physics, so, too, it has become difficult to imagine orchestrating the behavior of 10,000+ individuals – many of whom have come suddenly into wealth – without recourse to social psychology and elementary economics.  Read more: Joon Ian Wong - The Future of NFTs Is Fungible  Seen from the perspective of creators and storytellers, this constitutes a paradigm shift with momentous consequences.  While poets, playwrights, concert musicians and conceptual artists have all worked through the aesthetics of co-created narrative art, no such figures could have wielded the medium of finance as a storytelling device until now.  And yet, this lens of the hybrid aesthetic/financial object has thus far been understood exclusively to apply within a single project: creative micro-economics. Beyond this lies a whole meta-universe of possibilities that might be referred to as “creative macro.”  As Defiance ETF’s co-founder Sylvia Jablonski recently explained, “The next generation of traders are not like traditional asset allocators. These people are interested in things that allow them to connect and create and be a part of something.""  The desire for investors and collectors to play across the boundary between financial value and aesthetic expression will be unleashed to massive effect. But the shift from blockchain as a store of value to a creative substrate will require a fundamental recalibration of decentralized finance (DeFi) itself.  NFT lending has already begun to heat up. Startups, including NIFTEX, Ark.Gallery, Charged Particles and Upshot, have introduced functions such as fractionalization, blind bidding for off-market works, community-owned index funds and crowdsourced appraisals into the NFT market. Standard math suggests that, with a loan-to-value ratio of 80%, the NFT market would expand by five times if collectors were easily able to access leverage. When this happened in the analog art world during the 1980s, it was more like an order of magnitude increase.  Read more: Jarrod Dicker et al. - NFTs, DAOs and the New Creator Economy  We believe that attaining such lofty heights for the marketplace layer will depend upon finding ways to map financial value onto expressive power. How might a seemingly simple transaction, such as a collateralized loan, be reconsidered not only as an economic exchange but also an artistic act? Indeed, artists have been figuratively “borrowing” one another’s work for a very long time through the act of simple copying.  NFT exchange holds the promise to make this borrowing literally as well as computationally interesting. Artists who wish to use each others’ ideas can now seamlessly buy, sell and trade, as well lend against, underwrite, securitize or any number of exotic derivations one another’s work.  As often the case in the metaverse, the key to transformation lies in meta-data. Permissions could be written into NFT contracts that grant rights to modify purchased or borrowed pieces in either temporary or permanent ways. What if each collector, as in the tradition of ancient Chinese manuscript holders, stamped works that came into their portfolios?  Other contracts could specify how exchanged pieces might be divvied up into non-fungible parts. What if Ape collectors could leave their simian friends safely in wallet, but then sell (or even rent) the NFT’s rarest attribute, say, his shiny diamond grill, out to the market?  The fractionalized liquidity of creative attributes may be extended to the intellectual property rights attached to NFT ownership. What if the diamond grill, only available for a limited time, could be editioned onto virtual merch that might disappear at a fixed date? Or merch that would revert royalty payments once the smile went home? The possibilities seem endless.  And NFT derivatives promise to create still stranger monsters. One could assemble hybrid pieces or form collages out of extant works. Untouched originals would become rarer, and new offerings would undergo a period of profound adaptive radiation as collectors find themselves able to gene splice across a whole metaverse of secondary marketplaces and tertiary securities.  Just as financial transactions can be fractionally resold through derivative “strips” or “tranches” that cut across entire asset classes, large groups of NFT artworks and permissions could be similarly securitized and recirculated, creating something akin to the shadow banking for creativity.  Perhaps the most important role for digital re-composition will be to preserve the work of the Web 3 world by continuously revitalizing it. Importantly, the way that hardware and software formats come and go has caused artifacts of digital culture to fare very badly through institutional preservation. A large part of the value of oil painting derives from its durability, by contrast.  Velazquez’s “Las Meninas” looks basically the same as it did in the 17th century, if not a little cleaner. The NFT will not win this game – oil painting has a head start of hundreds of years, marble sculpture several thousand. But if the odds are stacked against them becoming ancient, the artists of today are much better positioned to stay in front of modernity.  Read more: Michael Casey - The Value of NFTs Is Belonging  This moment is not entirely without precedent. In the 15th century, after a global pandemic rewired the social order and trust in public institutions had thoroughly rotted, there emerged a period of innovation. The achievements of Renaissance painting and Renaissance thinking are deeply inter-related. In the century that followed, the discoveries of mobile money (paper money/deposit slips), movable art (paint on canvas rather than fresco wall) and cross-ocean exploitation all fed into one another.  The joint stock company, the movable printing press, representative democracy and the editioned artist’s print all spun out of the next turn of the screw. Another two hundred years would see the telegraph, the railroad and the photograph follow the same well-worn grooves. What we are calling the metaverse is just the latest in a series of worlds that abstracted away from its predecessor by playing across the lines of telecommunications, finance and art.

The new funding will help double the Allbridge team in engineering and business roles over the coming months, as well as invest in platform scalability, Allbridge co-founder Andriy Velykyy told CoinDesk in an email.  “We’re also conducting extensive security audits to ensure user and asset safety as we continue to scale and connect more chains and protocols,"" said Velykyy. “Our goal has always been to bridge the Web 3 ecosystems together and this funding will help us move even faster in achieving this mission.”  Network congestion and high transaction costs or gas fees on Ethereum have driven the growth of layer 2 blockchains and sidechains that operate parallel to the Ethereum mainnet. There are also a number of separate blockchains that can run smart contracts, including Solana and Avalanche.  Launched seven months ago, San Francisco-based Allbridge serves as a bridge for transferring assets between Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM compatible blockchains. Supported chains include Solana, Avalanche, Fantom, Celo, Polygon, Ethereum, BSC and Terra.  There are currently $474.7 million in tokens locked in contracts on the Allbridge protocol, according to DeFiLama data.  Allbridge is working on APIs that would allow developers to build decentralized applications (dapps) on the protocol.  “Cross-chain swaps built on Allbridge are the easiest way to exchange any asset between any networks, enabling new functionality like cross-chain lending where users can leverage collateral on one chain in order to receive an asset on another chain,” said Velykyy in a press release.  “Allbridge has already bridged over $1.7 billion to the Solana ecosystem five months after launch, helping extend the advantages of Solana DeFi to holders of more tokens.

42411834,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glga4a,1642085631,Dogecoin Mining 2022: Everything You Need to Know,"Dogecoin has come a long way since its modest beginnings as a joke cryptocurrency centered around a viral internet meme of a Shiba Inu “doge.” What was once a parody project purposefully created by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus to be “as ridiculous as possible,” is now a top fifteen crypto asset boasting a $22 billion market capitalization and a global fanbase.  Dogecoin’s spectacular rise over the first half of 2021, driven largely by internet pop culture and relentless promotion from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, unsurprisingly reignited significant interest in dogecoin mining and sent mining profitability to a new six-year high.  Even with its recent success, mining dogecoin is still significantly less competitive than mining bitcoin (but still difficult). New blocks are also discovered much faster and coin rewards are substantially higher – 10,000 DOGE per block reward vs 6.25 BTC.  How does dogecoin mining work?  Dogecoin’s blockchain network employs the same system for adding new blocks to its decentralized ledger and reaching agreement among its network participants as bitcoin, litecoin and many other cryptocurrencies.  Known as a “Proof-of-Work” (PoW) mechanism, this process involves “mining” where individuals or organizations compete for the right to add new blocks containing pending transactions to the blockchain ledger using specialized computer equipment.  More specifically, miners use their machines to try and create a fixed length code known as a “hash” with a value that is equal to or lower than the target value of the new block, known as the “target hash.” Whoever creates the winning code earns the exclusive right to add new transaction data to the next block in the chain and is rewarded with newly minted coins for doing so.  Each hash generated is completely random so it’s simply a process of trial and error until one miner wins.  Here is how dogecoin mining compares to bitcoin and litecoin mining (as of January 2022):  As a rule, PoW blockchains such as bitcoin and litecoin usually have a predetermined total supply of coins that have to be mined in order for them to be added to the circulating supply (21 million and 84 million, respectively). Think of it as being like actual mining and how precious gems or gold have to be physically mined before they can enter the market.  Unlike a vast majority of cryptocurrencies, however, dogecoin doesn’t have a maximum supply cap. Its circulating supply will continue to increase indefinitely over time as new coins are created through mining.  New blocks are discovered approximately once every minute on the Dogecoin network. For comparison, Bitcoin blocks are discovered approximately once every 10 minutes.  Despite using the same Proof-of-Work system, dogecoin mining operates slightly differently than bitcoin.  Bitcoin, which is the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, uses a hashing algorithm called SHA-256. This might sound complicated but a hashing algorithm is simply a function that generates a fixed-length code using a certain technique. Think of it as random code generators, where each hashing algorithm creates random codes in a unique way.  Dogecoin and litecoin use a hashing algorithm called Scrypt, which is less complex than SHA-256. This makes mining litecoin and dogecoin much faster and less energy intensive than bitcoin.  The use of a common algorithm enabled Dogecoin and Litecoin mining to be “merged mined”, meaning both coins can be mined simultaneously without impacting operational efficiency. The two share a common algorithm because dogecoin’s design is based on luckycoin, which in turn was derived from litecoin.  How to mine dogecoin  In its early years, mining dogecoin was much easier because very few people participated in the network. This meant anyone could mine the coin individually. However, as the popularity of DOGE increased, the mining process became more difficult, prompting miners to come together and form “mining pools.”  A mining pool is a group of individual miners who mine the cryptocurrency as a single entity, or node, by merging their computing power. The rewards are then distributed among pool participants proportionally by the amount of computer power committed by each miner.  Today, there are three main approaches to mining dogecoin:  Individual mining/solo mining  Dogecoin mining pools  Cloud mining  Solo mining vs. dogecoin mining pools  For anyone looking to mine DOGE for fun or simply to understand the process, it can be done independently using a GPU (graphics processing unit) through a software like EasyMiner, for example. The GPU is a specialized processor that renders all images on a computer's screen, and many laptops and desktop computers use it to improve image processing.  However, mining alone can be a difficult process and is rarely profitable unless one is willing to shell out significant sums of money on top-spec equipment and electrical bills.  For crypto enthusiasts interested in trying to make a profit from doge mining, joining a dogecoin mining pool is recommended and provides a much better chance of becoming a block validator due to the collective hashing power of the pool. But before jumping into a mining pool, be ready to pay 1%-3% in fees for the privilege to participate and always check in advance how each pool calculates payouts for its members.  Popular dogecoin mining pools in 2022 include:  Prohashing  Litecoinpool  AikaPool  Dogecoin cloud mining  Dogecoin can also be earned through cloud mining, which is not really mining per se. Cloud mining basically involves renting computing power from a data center and paying a monthly or annual fee based on an agreed-upon contract. The chosen coin is then mined at the center via a mining pool and then shared with you based on how much computing power you pay for.  The main drawback of cloud mining is that most contracts are time-locked, meaning you can lose money if DOGE prices drop below the operational and electrical costs associated with mining it.  Nevertheless, this can also be just as effective as joining a mining pool and does not require the user to own any specialist equipment. Anyone opting for the cloud mining route simply needs a dogecoin wallet.  Popular cloud mining pools that support DOGE include:  Genesis Mining  Nicehash  Dogecoin mining must-haves  For individuals interested in mining dogecoin solo or via a dogecoin mining pool, there’s a range of equipment needed in order to get started.  Dogecoin Mining Hardware  There are three types of hardware equipment you can use for DOGE mining:  CPU – your PC’s central processing unit might be an option even today, but it is not really recommended because it can cause damage to your computer by overheating it.  GPU – a graphics processing unit is more powerful than a CPU and can be used to mine dogecoin.  ASIC – an application-specific integrated circuit is a computing machine built specifically to generate hashes. ASICs are far more powerful than GPUs and, unsurprisingly, more expensive. Anyone planning to buy an ASIC should look specifically for a Scrypt-based ASIC miner.  Dogecoin Mining Software  Once you’ve decided which type of hardware to use, you’ll also need to download software to accompany it. Here are some of the leading software options available at the moment:  CPU – CPU miner by Pooler.  GPU – EasyMiner is great for beginners, CudaMiner works best with Nvidia GPUs, while CGminer does well with all types of GPUs.  ASIC – CGminer and EasyMiner can be used with ASICs as well, but most ASIC miners use MultiMiner.  Dogecoin Wallet  A dogecoin wallet is essential for mining and provides a secure place to receive any dogecoin rewards generated from mining. A crypto wallet consists of a public key address for sending and receiving DOGE and a private key to access it. The latter has to be kept secure and not shared with anyone. There are several types of wallets, such as:  Online: Anyone mining dogecoin for fun can opt to use an online wallet such as Coinbase or Binance. These aren’t as secure as other wallet options but are much more convenient to use.  Software: Software wallets reside on your PC or mobile device rather than online, which makes them more secure. You can download the original dogecoin wallet or use third-party software wallets.  Hardware: Hardware wallets are regarded as the most secure solution for storing crypto assets. These are physical devices similar to a USB stick that store crypto offline. Leading hardware wallets include the Ledger Nano S and Trezor Model T.  It’s worth noting, good access to electricity and an internet connection are essential for mining any cryptocurrency. If you opt for ASIC mining, it’s recommended that rigs be kept in a cool and isolated place to prevent overheating and disturbing neighbors with the noise.  Is dogecoin mining profitable?  Well, dogecoin mining can still be profitable. However, don’t expect to become a millionaire. Having powerful hardware and joining a dogecoin mining pool will give you the best possible chance of making a profit from dogecoin mining. If you’re interested in finding out how much you could make (approximately) per month, there’s a dogecoin mining calculator you can use.

42411843,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaRj,1642084387,What Is Ether?,"Ether (ETH) is the main token of the Ethereum blockchain and the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Just like the largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, ether can be used to send payments directly to another person without the need for an intermediary such as a bank.  The long-term vision for Ethereum is to power more than just financial transactions. Software developers are able to build applications on Ethereum, ranging from decentralized platforms for lending money to social media networks.  For any Ethereum-based app, ether acts as the primary ""fuel.” Any activity on the blockchain requires an amount of ether to power it, also known as ""gas.""  In Ethereum, ether can be used for the following things:  Payments: Like bitcoin, ether can be used for payments. Users can send ether to another user and, just like cash, the payment doesn’t require a third party to process or approve it.  Powering decentralized applications: Ether is required in order to use decentralized apps (dapps) built on Ethereum, from staking ERC-20 tokens for yield farming to completing functions such as governance voting.  Transactions fees: Every Ethereum action – from payments to using dapps – requires a fee.  Ethereum FAQs  How do I use ether?  First, users need to decide on which ether wallet they plan to store their funds in. Ether can be bought with fiat currencies like the U.S dollar or other cryptocurrency base pairs on a range of different exchanges.  Our guide on how to use Ethereum dives into this in much more detail.  Why are there ether fees?  Every time users send funds to and from a dapp or transfer any ERC20 coin between wallets they must pay a fee to do so. This is because Ethereum currently uses miners to validate transactions on the network. These miners use their specialized hardware to add new transactions to the blockchain.  Prior to the London hard fork (a non-backward compatible upgrade that introduced new features), an auction-style system was used to determine how miners chose which transactions to process first. The higher the fee attached to a transaction, the higher up on the miner’s list it went to be added. However, this meant fees were incredibly unpredictable and could surge dramatically during times of high congestion.  A new base fee was introduced as part of EIP 1559 in 2021 to create a more predictable fee structure for Ethereum users. Instead of an auction-style system, fees are now established algorithmically based on how many users are active on the network at the time. Tips can be added should a user wish to have their transaction processed faster, but this is entirely optional.  What is Ethereum gas?  Ethereum transaction fees are calculated based on how much ""gas"" the action requires.  Each action costs an amount of gas based on the computational power required and how long it takes to run. A transaction costs whatever your gas limit is multiplied by the base fee plus any tip you wish to add.  It can be expressed as, Gas unit (limits) * (Base fee + Tip).  In this way, ether has sometimes been called ""digital oil"" because it's used to pay for a certain amount of mileage, so to speak.  How is ether used to power a dapp?  Ether works like fuel for dapps on the network. Say you’re using an Ethereum-based notebook dapp that allows you to write immutable to-do lists that are saved on the blockchain. To post a note, a user might need to pay a transaction fee in ether to add a new list to the notebook.  Dapps each enable this in a different way. When a user goes to post a note, for instance, the notebook app might prompt the user to send the fee. Metamask, an ERC20 wallet built into browsers, can be helpful for this because it sits in the corner of the browser and can automatically understand when to help with sending transactions.  What is the difference between ether and Ethereum?  Ethereum is the entire network. Ether is the main token that runs on it, making it a crucial part of Ethereum.  How many ether are there?  There are currently more than 119,120,909 ether, according to data provider Messari.  Five ether are created roughly every 12 seconds. But beyond that, the rules for ether’s economy are open-ended and frequently change as new improvement proposals are agreed upon by the Ethereum developer community. While bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, Ethereum's main token does not have a set max supply limit.  How many Ethereum tokens were created initially?  Sixty million tokens were purchased by users in Ethereum's initial 2014 crowdfunding campaign. Another 12 million went to the Ethereum Foundation, which is a group of researchers and developers that works on improving the underlying technology.

Alliance said it will “start to take shape” in the months ahead with governance documents and explanations of “what services it will provide.” Membership details are also forthcoming.  Originally launched as the Chicago DeFi Alliance in March 2020, the consortium of high-powered Windy City trading firms sought to foster projects servicing the then-nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) scene, which at the time held a paltry $500 million or so, according to DeFi Llama.  At press time, decentralized trading platform Sushi, a member of DeFi Alliance’s fourth accelerator cohort, held $5.46 billion across all its multi-chain integrations.

42411844,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glgaex,1642083481,What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?,"There is no such thing as a free lunch and there’s certainly no such thing as a free transaction. If spending $5 to receive $20 at an ATM can be frustrating, imagine spending $100 to send $500 or receive a PNG of a penguin.  While it might seem a steep example, that can sometimes be the case in order to send a transaction or perform a function on Ethereum’s network. And unlike the case with ATM fees, there’s no way the Ethereum network will refund you for your gas fees at the end of the month.  What is Gas?  Gas is the term for the amount of ether (ETH) – the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum – required by the network for a user to interact with the network. These fees are used to compensate Ethereum miners for the energy required to verify a transaction and for providing a layer of security to the Ethereum network by making it too expensive for malicious users to spam the network.  Even though they are an effective means of incentivizing miners to keep verifying transactions and maintain network security, gas fees are nonetheless every user’s most hated part about Ethereum. People hate gas fees not only for a general disdain toward fees, but because they can be absurdly expensive when the network is congested.  So, let’s dive into what can make gas fees so expensive and what simple steps you can take to save money when interacting with Ethereum’s ecosystem.  How are Gas Fees Calculated?  In order to get an understanding of why gas fees cost so much and how you can save on them, it’s important to understand how they are calculated.  Because fees on Ethereum are usually much less than 1 ETH (although sometimes it doesn’t feel like it), Ethereum employs a metric system of denominated units called “wei,” where 1 ETH is equal to 1 quintillion wei. (A quintillion is a number with 18 zeros after it.) One of the most common wei denominations, and the one used to represent gas fees, is gigawei (gwei), or 1 billion wei. Therefore, when you check on a gas tracker and see that the average gas for a transaction is 100 gwei, that means you should expect to pay a base fee of 0.0000001 ETH for a given transaction ($0.00031 at press time)/  If you have ever minted a non-fungible token or purchased one on a secondary market like OpenSea, then you might be thinking that 100 gwei sounds like a steal for an NFT transfer. That is because the base fees are just one part of the total fee structure. Following the readjusted gas fee structures brought in by Ethereum’s London upgrade, the total fee is now calculated as:  Total Fee = Gas unit (limits) * (Base fee + Tip)  Gas units (limits): This refers to the maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend on a transaction. While you are able to adjust how much gas your transaction will cost, it’s important to do so carefully. That is because different types of interactions with the Ethereum blockchain will require different amounts of gas to complete.  Base fee: This refers to the minimum amount of gas required to include a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The amount of gas required for a base fee is determined by the demand for a transaction to be included, regardless of what type of transaction it is. Because base fees are a factor of demand, they are dynamically adjusted based on the number of users interacting with the network at any given time.  Tips: Also known as a priority fee, tips are an additional fee made to have your transaction completed faster. This fee is better known as a tip because it provides an economic incentive for Ethereum miners to confirm your transaction before others. When a miner verifies a transaction with a priority fee attached, they receive that fee as a tip for doing so. Because miners are able to see what transactions include tips, they will prioritize completing a transaction with the highest tips attached to make the most money they can.  It’s important to note that if you set your gas unit limit below the amount of gas needed to complete your interaction, your transaction will be reverted but you wouldn’t receive your gas fee back. That is because the miner has already done the equivalent amount of work to process your transaction and they receive the fees for doing so even if the transaction doesn’t go through.  To illustrate the total fee formula, let’s say that I am looking to send you 1 ETH and the average amount of gas required to transfer ETH on the Ethereum network is 23,000 gwei. I would set that as my gas limit. The minimum amount of gas required to send the transaction at the time (base fee) is 150 gwei, but I want it to get to you faster so I add a tip of 20 gwei to the transaction. In this case, our formula for a total fee would look like this:  Total Fee to send you 1 ETH = 23,000 gwei * (150 gwei + 20 gwei)  Following, the total fee would be equal to 3910000 gwei, or 0.00391 ETH (about $13, at press time). This means that I would send 1.00231 ETH to the Ethereum blockchain and you would receive 1 ETH to go buy some cool JPGs.  Why gas fees cost so much  With an understanding of how total gas fees are calculated, we can get a better idea on why gas fees cost so much. Mainly, the two biggest factors that have caused gas fees to soar recently are:  Gas fees denomination in gwei.  Ethereum’s variable total fee formula.  Gas fees cost more because ETH costs more  The first major reason why gas fees are costing more is simply that ETH costs more. Recall that gas fees are denominated in gwei, which is a different way to represent an amount of ETH. The main catalyst for this rising demand is the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors, which continue to attract new users to Ethereum’s ecosystem.  Gas fees cost more because base fees cost more  Also, gas fees cost so much now because Ethereum’s total fee formula is dynamic. Remember, base fees are the minimum amount of gas required to include a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain and are adjusted by the demand for transaction inclusion. As a result, base fees have consistently increased as a result of increasing demand for the Ethereum blockchain.  There are more than 3,000 decentralized applications (also known as “dapps”) running on the Ethereum blockchain, all of which are looking to have their transactions included alongside other Ethereum network users. Dapps alone account for more than 100,000 daily active users on Ethereum, executing a total of around 250,000 transactions a day.  The widespread adoption of Ethereum has not only led to higher base fees but also has made the gas for base fees much more volatile. In an effort to try to make gas fees more consistent, Ethereum’s EIP 1559 upgrade adjusted the calculation of base fees to be determined by the transaction before it. While the real impacts of EIP 1559 are debated, base fees continue to drive the total cost of gas fees up due to the increased demand for Ethereum.  Read more: 4 Common Misperceptions About Ethereum’s EIP 1559 Upgrade  Ethereum 2.0 is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network that will see the transition of Ethereum’s consensus algorithm go from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS). Among the many benefits this will bring to the network, the upgrade promises to reduce Ethereum fees in line with other market competitors by significantly improving transaction-processing capabilities and doing away with miners.  How to spend less on gas  While it is impossible to avoid paying for gas when using the Ethereum blockchain, there are at least some ways to make them less burdensome.  Pick the right time and be patient  Unfortunately, there is no way for you to directly reduce the impact of the gas unit, but there are ways that you can reduce your total fee by lowering the base fee and tip.  To reduce the cost of your total gas fee through a lower base fee, you could make your transaction on the network at a time when fewer people are using the blockchain. This is because, in a way, base fees are a representation of demand for using Ethereum. Gas fees are higher when more work is required to interact with the Ethereum network. More work is required when there are more people trying to interact with the network. Therefore, if you can find a time where there is less demand to interact with the Ethereum network, you could spend less on gas by reducing the base fee of your transaction. Weekends are usually the best time for that.  Another method of reducing your total gas fee cost is by reducing your tip. Remember that our tip, or priority fee, is an additional cost that we can give to miners in exchange for a faster transaction time. If your transaction isn’t time-sensitive and you are willing to be patient, reducing your tip can be an additional way to spend less on gas.  Set a max fee limit on your transaction  Another way to spend less on gas fees is to set a maximum gas fee limit on your transaction. Setting a max fee for gas is a way of telling the Ethereum blockchain that X gwei is the most you are willing to spend by sending X gwei as your total gas fee. Once the transaction is completed, the Ethereum network will refund the remainder of the max fee that wasn’t used as part of your total gas fee.  Setting max fees can not only help you spend less on gas, but it can also provide you with peace of mind that you will not be paying more than you need to on a particular transaction. It’s important to remember, however, that like with setting your gas limits, a max fee below the amount of the total gas needed to make your transaction will result in you losing your gas fee and having the transaction reverted.  Layer 2 scaling solutions  Finally, you can spend less on gas by interacting with the Ethereum blockchain with an Ethereum “layer 2 scaling solution.” Scaling tools are extensions of the Ethereum network that aim to increase the speed of transactions and the number of transactions that can be processed per second. Some popular examples include Arbitrum, Loopring and dYdX.  Layer 2 scaling solutions are off-chain, meaning they handle transactions separately from the Ethereum blockchain. Though there are different implementations of layer 2 scaling solutions, they all act in a similar way. Layer 2 transactions occur off-chain and then are verified by the Ethereum network and recorded on-chain.  Referring back to our total fee formula one more time, layer 2 scaling solutions offer a way to save on gas by reducing the number of gas units required to complete a transaction. Because this method interacts with Ethereum only when the transaction is being validated, less gas is needed by Ethereum miners to handle the interaction. Layer 2 solutions also ease Ethereum network congestion, leading to an overall lower base fee for all users. In doing so, layer 2 scaling solutions can help you spend significantly less on gas.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | ARB,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-ethereum-gas-fees,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5400363d45144a137d134e22ea8d666334f64969-1909x1432.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Seattle-based Seashell bills its offering as an “inflation-resistant” savings app. The U.S. consumer price index, an inflation metric measuring costs across dozens of products and services, rose 7% in December compared to the prior year, the largest increase since 1982.  The national average interest rate for savings accounts is just 0.06%, according to Bankrate data. Seashell hopes to close that gap by offering up to 10% interest to Seashell Save users, with the exact interest rate determined by the amount deposited and the length of time a user has had the account.  “The way banks work is that they take your deposits and loan them out; we loan [funds] to people who are willing to pay more for it,” said Seashell founder and CEO Daryl Hok in an interview with CoinDesk.  The borrowers include crypto holders wanting fiat currency, who are willing to pay fees and a higher interest rate to access the money. Seashell overcollaterizes cryptocurrency-backed loans to offset the potential market volatility. Crypto borrowers using staked assets as collateral would also provide the staking rewards.  Read more: US Inflation Rose to Nearly Four-Decade High of 7% in December  The funding round also included Coinbase Ventures, Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev, “Shark Tank’s” Mark Cuban, unicorn investor Elad Gil, former CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and the founders of a number of Web 3 projects, including Terra, Polygon, Avalanche and Solana.  Seashell Save, available on Android and iOS devices, allows users to open a verified account and immediately transfer money from their bank to start earning interest. The app is free to set up and users can withdraw money at any time with no fees or penalties. The app’s waitlist is currently open and the accounts are expected to launch at the end of the first quarter on a rolling basis to allow for stress testing, said Hok, who previously served as COO at blockchain security firm CertiK.  Seashell competes with the likes of Eco, a high-yield USDC savings app, but says it differs from alternative solutions due to its U.S. compliance-first approach. Hok said the company worked with its lawyers from the start under the assumption that everything is a security, ensuring the company can meet the highest regulatory standards.

Dot plots, forward expectations, tapering and rate changes – when a group of people, like those at the U.S. Federal Reserve, is trying to guide the economy, the result is often mistake after mistake. The truth is that no one knows for certain, and everyone is making a guess about the future.  In the U.S., for instance, the creation of new money, as measured by the Fed’s M2, has gone from 5% annualized in the early 2000s to 18% annualized since 2020. The impact has been the highest inflation we’ve seen since the early 1980s.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Home prices have surged, increasing 19.3% in the 12 months ended Nov. 30, according to Zillow. (That comes after a record-setting 2020, with the highest price increase since 2005.) Car prices were up 13.2% in 2021, and inventory levels are hovering at all-time lows. Beef, pork and chicken prices rose roughly 26%, 19% and 15%, respectively, in 2021. So regardless of where you look and what you consume, life is getting more expensive.  But what if there was a better way to know with precision and confidence the future supply of money, and it could not be changed? Individuals and businesses could better make projections for the future and plan, because price signals in the economy wouldn't be distorted. This is where bitcoin enters the picture.  In previous articles for this newsletter, I’ve written about bitcoin as a savings tool using a dollar-cost averaging strategy and the ways bitcoin can play a role in a portfolio. Here, I’ll detail how bitcoin can be a store of value that avoids the negative effect inflation has on fiat money like the U.S. dollar.  Why bitcoin’s fixed supply is beneficial  Bitcoin is in a class of its own in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ninety percent of all the bitcoin ever to exist has been mined. Ninety-five percent is expected to be mined by March/April 2026, and the entire amount – the maximum of 21 million bitcoins – by February 2140. When math and code are at the core of a monetary system and not people, it allows for better confidence for the future and the long-term implications. Math and code are not influenced by a political party, agendas or other factors. The rules are the rules, executed day in and day out.  The current inflation of the Bitcoin network is 1.77%, and it is dropping. A person can know that if they buy bitcoin, they’ll store wealth into the future with certainty, as there’s no way for anyone to devalue or create a new bitcoin. The reason why is the incentive structure that has been built around for miners, holders of bitcoin and the network itself. Bitcoin, with its 21 million coin supply cap, has the benefits of trust in a fixed-rule system that can be upgraded but remains foundationally unadjusted.  Bitcoin and purchasing power  The goal of money is to allow for economic output to be saved for future consumption. Holding cash today in the inflationary environment for a client is a guaranteed recipe to lose purchasing power – while the exact opposite has been true over the years for bitcoin. Money needs to have demand for it to have value. According to a recent report from Grayscale, 25% of investors with $10,000 or more in investable assets own bitcoin. (Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.) The demand for bitcoin is increasing, according to Glassnode, as are on-chain analytics as more and more entities begin to own bitcoin.  So, in a world with convoluted and confusing financial markets, a base monetary system as transparent and open as the Bitcoin network is a game-changer. In my view, those adopters who move wealth to bitcoin today will be rewarded. They’ll be able to secure the value they created today into the future, allowing their consumption to remain consistent or grow. Those who lag behind, by comparison, will need to save more and store more wealth to accomplish the same goal.  There’s a term called liability matching in asset allocation. Liability matching is an investment strategy that matches future asset sales and income streams against the timing of expected future expenses. Bitcoin takes this concept and flips it on its head, allowing for goal matching. The longer a goal is out into the future, the better bitcoin is for saving for that goal, as I’ve previously explained about bitcoin and dollar cost averaging.  You don’t know how many dollars will be created between now and five years from now, but I can with confidence tell you how many new bitcoin will be issued. Which would be more reliable, in your view? The asset that costs $0 to produce, with an unlimited supply, or the asset with known rules, a network of fierce advocates and a cost associated with the creation of new units? We live in a world where dollars and bitcoin coexist, and it’s not an all-or-nothing decision.  How bitcoin can help clients in the long run  As a financial advisor, I believe the role and goal of asset allocation is to help mitigate risks and ensure client outcomes and objectives are accomplished. Today, the word on almost all clients’ minds is “inflation,” and what to do about it.  In my opinion, bitcoin is the remedy that helps ease these client concerns by allowing their savings to gain in value. In a world of plenty of uncertainty, money that costs nothing to create is a problem. Saving for goals is as challenging as ever, and inflation makes life cost more.  But bitcoin is ushering in a deflationary future, where an individual can create value, be paid and store that into the future for when needed, allowing savers to better enjoy the fruits of their labor. That change enables clients to achieve those lifelong goals sooner - and that’s all thanks to bitcoin’s open monetary network.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Isaiah Douglass,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/what-advisors-should-know-about-bitcoin-and-inflation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4877ca078da66eff1cbebb13fc845655f3a7348d-4032x3024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411577,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOshj,1642081800,Could These Products Tame Crypto’s Volatility Beast?,"Now that advisors have several methods for accessing cryptocurrencies and other digital assets alongside and on behalf of their clients, asset managers are launching innovations to offer differentiated access to crypto.  So it is with recently launched crypto products that not only provide access to the token’s price movement in a U.S.-domiciled product wrapper, but also claim to offer built-in risk mitigation. Two such products – one from CBOE Vest, the other from THOR Financial Technologies in partnership with separately managed account (SMA) provider Eaglebrook Advisors –use technical signals to trade in and out of crypto or crypto futures on behalf of their investors.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  “Thus far the biggest story has been just accessing this space, but one of the challenges, especially for professionals committing assets to the space, has been extreme volatility,” said Karan Sood, the CEO of CBOE Vest. “Bitcoin’s long-term average volatility is just short of 100%.”  The mutual fund solution  In October, CBOE Vest launched the Bitcoin Strategy Managed Volatility Fund (ticker: BCTVX), a mutual fund that invests in bitcoin futures, eliminating the need for a bitcoin wallet.  CBOE Vest’s strategy purports to offer some bitcoin-linked returns while controlling for the volatility by allocating to something with a cash-like return during drawdowns.  “Our strategy, at its simplest, will seek to vary the exposure to bitcoin futures in response to the volatility experienced by bitcoin futures,” said Sood. “If volatility is high, then the fund will decrease its exposure to bitcoin futures. If volatility is low, the fund will increase its allocation. So it’s a dynamic allocation to bitcoin futures adjusted on a daily basis.”  CBOE Vest has several products that provide similar risk-adjusted exposure in different product wrappers and asset classes.  An SMA answer  THOR’s partnership with Eaglebrook has integrated its trading algorithms into SMAs offering advisors direct access to bitcoin and other digital assets held offline in cold storage at Gemini Trust. THOR’s algorithms control volatility and its technology enables streamlined client onboarding, trading execution, rebalancing, portfolio and tax reporting.  The strategy, which launched in November 2021, moved out of bitcoin at $62,000 to a 100% cash position, sparing its investors much of the token’s price decline, said Brad Roth, founder of THOR Financial Technologies.  “We use our technology just like we do in equities, as of right now when we get a volatility signal we’ll convert to a cash-like position,” said Roth. “Right now, our client is doing what it meant to do. During the recent drawdown we were just sitting there flat.”  THOR launched last year and has grown to over $1 billion in assets under administration (AUA) across its model portfolios.  While CBOE Vest builds products targeted towards financial professionals, Sood said that thus far most of the interest in plain-vanilla bitcoin futures products has been from self-directed investors.  Financial professionals have greater demand – and appreciation – for regulated investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETF) and mutual funds, said Sood, because they are more likely to suit the best-interest requirements by which they are often bound.  “There are other challenges for intermediaries because they are managing these assets in a multi-asset portfolio, and nothing comes close to delivering the kind of volatility – or, historically, the kind of returns – that bitcoin has delivered,” said Sood. “You would think that most want to offer clients enough access to bitcoin to have the returns move the needle as a portfolio, but that often will result in accepting a certain amount of volatility as well.”  But skepticism abounds  Some practitioners in the crypto-for-advisors business are wary of such risk mitigation strategies.  “I wouldn’t say they’re a bad idea,” said Dan Eyre, the CEO of BITRIA, a firm providing advisors access to cryptocurrencies on behalf of their clients. (BITRIA was rebranded from BlockChange late last year.) “The way most investors are looking at digital assets are as an investment they can make that offers a very strong upside, but also a lot of volatility risk.”  Eyre suggests that investors just hold cryptocurrencies directly instead.  “If you look at any two years since the digital asset ecosystem emerged, there’s no period where if you held the investment you would have lost money on it,” he said. “Most actively traded risk-mitigation strategies don’t actually outperform just holding an investment. Yes, we see a lot of volatility, but that’s okay because most of it is upside volatility. If you try to call tops and bottoms, even through an algorithm, you could miss out on some things while generating a sizable tax bill.”  Sarson Funds, a crypto asset manager and education provider for advisors, has launched its own risk mitigation products.  John Sarson, the firm’s CEO, leveled criticism at the risk-mitigation trading strategies as overly complex.  “Wall Street wouldn’t be Wall Street if it didn’t take a straightforward investment and attempt to wrap it in many different packages ‘to meet investor needs,’” said Sarson. “While some of these products will make sense, others will make more sense for the issuer than they end up making for the client. Algorithmically derived investment programs may work sometimes, and other times will almost certainly let their users down. At Sarson Funds, we believe that using call writing programs with volatility-adverse investors in bitcoin makes a lot of sense.”  Sarson’s call writing program, most prominently featured in its Crypto & Income strategy, uses the volatility of crypto to create monthly income using covered calls. That income stream helps buffer against down or sideways markets.  Eyre also advocates for fundamental analysis in digital assets for investors seeking additional alpha.  “There’s a good chance that fundamental analysis will perform technical active trading in most cases, but if you do want to do active trading, there are hedge funds you can go to that do that better than anyone else,” he said. “If you were really trying to limit the risk of volatility, if the client is very concerned, then maybe digital assets aren’t for them. There’s nothing wrong with that.”  While Sarson favors a covered-call strategy, he acknowledged that there’s room for several different risk mitigation strategies in the space.  “For investors that otherwise view cryptocurrency as ‘too risky,’ these products add great value by managing risk and bringing a client into this emerging asset class,” said Sarson.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/13/could-these-products-tame-cryptos-volatility-beast,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b54f0595ffa4bd5d3ba772bdedcc88a9bd4046c5-5184x3456.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Goldman expects total crypto-trading revenue at Coinbase and Robinhood to rise 62% and 18%, respectively, from the previous quarter.  Here’s what the Wall Street giant said:  Coinbase (buy rated, price target (PT) cut to $352 from $387)  Large volumes in shiba inu during the quarter are indicative of strong retail-trading volumes.

Remains cautious on fundamentals and says recent performance sets a relatively low bar. If the company can return to positive account growth, says the shares may be poised for a relief rally.

The shopkeeper puts this address on a poster behind the shop in the form of a QR code. Now, customers can scan that code with their bitcoin wallet application to pay for their bought items. The problem is anyone can look for that address in the bitcoin blockchain and can see every incoming or outgoing transaction of that address and the total bitcoin balance of the address. Anyone with that information can get an idea of how rich the shopkeeper is and how successful the shop has been in the past. This information can be exploited by bad actors such as robbers for their personal gains. Also, if we are sitting next to someone while they pay for their bought items, then we can get the idea of how rich the customer sitting next to us is, by seeing the most recent incoming transaction to the shopkeeper&apos;s address and then looking up the balance of the sending address i.e the customer address. So, Bitcoin does not provide full financial privacy, and your average innocent user gets no privacy whatsoever.

The price rose over 8% to $152 during the European morning hours on Thursday after a bounce from the $130 support level.  The move came after Bank of America said in a research note the Solana protocol’s low fees and high transaction speeds made it the “Visa of the digital asset ecosystem.” It could even usurp Ethereum’s current position as a leader among smart contract-enabled blockchains, the bank's analysts said.  “Solana prioritizes scalability, but a relatively less decentralized and secure blockchain has trade-offs, illustrated by several network performance issues since inception,” analyst Alkesh Shah noted, adding that the network was primed for consumer use cases such as micropayments and gaming.  Price-charts show that some resistance exists at current levels, which if broken could see SOL moving to the $170 level.  A relative strength index (RSI) readings of 53 suggests Thursday’s surge could have further upside in the days ahead. RSI is a price-chart indicator that measures the magnitude of price changes, with readings above 70 suggesting an asset is overbought and could be primed for a correction.  However, SOL remains in a broader downtrend and is down nearly 40% from November 2021’s highs of $260, according to data from CoinGecko.  High speeds, cheap fees and NFTs  Unlike other blockchains like Bitcoin, which rely on complex computing rigs operated by miners, Solana works on a proof-of-history mechanism that powers its cheap and speedy blockchain. Network stakers validate transactions by verifying them against several network cores and considering the time which has lapsed between two transactions.  Such design helps create a faster network, which Solana developers claim can reach speeds of up to 65,000 transactions per second (tps). Technical documents suggest that the network could theoretically reach speeds as high as 28.4 million tps under optimum conditions.  Cheaper fees – as low as $0.00025 per transaction – have resulted in massive retail interest for products built on Solana, especially those involving non-fungible tokens (NFT). NFTs are blockchain-based representations of tangible or intangible objects.  The value of daily NFT activity on the network averages at around $1.8 million, data from analytics tool DeFiLlama shows. The figure peaked to $9.2 million on Jan. 6, 2021, the data shows.  Some investors say the quick adoption of NFTs on Solana, compared to other blockchains, showcases how a low-cost, fast network helps retail onboarding.  “Interesting how the NFT ecosystem on Solana is thriving now although it's built with features that are optimized for finance use cases (quick block time, low cost, fast finality),” said Arthur Cheong, founder of Defiance Capital in a tweet on Wednesday. “In fact, I think most user growth lately actually come from NFT side instead of [decentralized finance].""  Ryan Wilkinson, head of product of Blockasset.co, stated that the retail popularity of the network has attracted even more developers to build on Solana instead.  “The code for artists/creators to build their own NFT platforms and drops on Solana, such as Candy Machine, is open-sourced, and community events such as Metaplex office hours also help onboard many creative developers to try their hands at creating customized collections and innovate,” he told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  “Projects such as GenesysGo and the Shadowy Super Coder NFTs show how NFTs on Solana provides key infrastructural benefits for the network which the whole ecosystem gets behind,” Wilkinson added.

The deposits, valued at almost $30 billion at current ETH values, represent the first phase of Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity. More than 280,000 validators on Beacon Chain contributed to the 9 million ETH deposited. A user must deposit a minimum of 32 ETH, which is presently worth roughly $108,000, to become a validator. Ethereum&apos;s Imminent Roadmap Ethereum, the world&apos;s largest public blockchain, plans to convert to Proof-of-Stake consensus, which forces validators to stake their cash on the network in order to confirm new transactions.

42387526,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG62m,1642072961,Pakistan Plans to Ban Cryptocurrencies as Stance Hardens: Reports,"The government of Pakistan and its central bank want to ban the use of cryptocurrencies, local media reported, citing a document submitted to a provincial court.  The document was compiled by a committee headed by Sima Kamil, a deputy governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Other members included representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan (FIA).  The submission is the first time a clear position has been taken by the central bank, according to the media reports. The inclusion of government and regulatory representatives on the committee gives the report additional authority as a reflection of possible policy initiatives. In 2018, the SBP issued a circular prohibiting banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges.  ""This indicates that, unlike in the past, this is a policy move which has greater consensus and coordination,"" said Ali Farid Khwaja, a partner at Oxford Frontier Capital and chairman of KTrade KASB Securities, a stock brokerage in the capital, Karachi. ""The SBP-led report has been accompanied with a coordinated crackdown on peer-to-peer network and illegal crypto operators by FIA and also warning letters issued by SECP.""  Earlier this week, the FIA said it wants to talk to Binance as part of an investigation into a suspected scam it said has cost several thousand investors more than $100 million.  The committee submitted the report to the Sindh High Court, which was hearing a case about digital currencies and ordered its formation. It cited concerns on the use of crypto for money laundering and financing terrorism.  The case was brought by Waqar Zaka, a television host and crypto entrepreneur who wanted the court to rule that cryptocurrencies be declared legal as a large number of Pakistanis are interested in them. The country has the third-highest crypto adoption rate in the world, according to the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.  The court referred the 38-page report to the finance and law ministries for consideration. It also ordered them to determine if a ban against cryptocurrencies is constitutional, according to a news report.  ""The mindset if something is going wrong is to simply ban it,"" said Majyd Aziz, the former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ""Rather than trying to figure out the background, more often than not they go for a ban before going through the process. You can't ban digital currencies.""  The government has set up a separate committee to consider a regulatory approach following a call from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global money laundering watchdog. Pakistan has been on the organization's gray list of countries since 2018, hurting its ability to get international financial aid.  “I don’t think this means Pakistan has decided to ban it,"" said Faisal Aftab, a co-founder of Zayn Capital. ""I think they are still exploring regulation. The ambiguity is about whether Pakistan will consider cryptocurrencies as an asset. But it’s almost clear that it will not be considered a legal tender.""

42387527,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG640,1642071586,"DeFi Protocol Tranchess Becomes Binance Smart Chain Validator Node, Launches Fund","Tranchess, an asset tracking decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that prioritizes risk-managed solutions, has launched a BNB token fund as a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) validator. The move is intended to shift the protocol away from purely generating revenue from the creation and sale of new tokens.  This BNB fund complements the existing bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) tracker funds, which offers moderate leverage for yield farming.  Danny Chong, the co-founder of Tranchess, told CoinDesk the BNB fund marks version 2 of Tranchess because of the new income streams available. Acting as a validator means rewards from the network for processing and verifying transactions on a Proof-of-Stake network.  In an interview, Chong cited the stringent validator requirements of BSC as a reason why Tranchess picked it over over PoS protocols for its expansion. One example is the higher threshold of staking to validate: While the Ethereum network requires a minimum of 32 staked ether, BSC requires nearly 10,000 staked BNB (worth $4.6 million) though many have upwards of 800,000 staked BNB (worth approximately $384 million). Using BSC also brings the possibility of opening up cross-chain compatibility, he said.  “The complexities involved in being a validator currently excludes many protocols from transforming their pure token emission model into a more diverse revenue model that generates consistent alpha returns for users,” he said, noting that inactive validators or ones the community deems aren't pulling their weight are banned from BSC.  Tranchess acting as a validator helps BSC become more decentralized. With a relatively small number of validators, BSC has been criticized for its centralization.  Another example of a similar model can be found with Band Protocol, a data oracle. It runs a validator protocol on the Fantom network. Band Protocol earns income from being a validator, which in turn adds to the token's value.  In a tweet from April 2021, Messari's Wilson Withiam pointed out that many of the existing validators on BSC have close ties to Binance.  In August, Tranchess closed a $1.5 million round led by Three Arrows Capital and Spartan Group.  Tranchess’ Chess token is up 8.6% on the day according to CoinGecko, and is set to open the US session at $1.86. BNB was up 4.5% during the Asia business day.

While the value lost climbed 160%, the amount was a smaller proportion of the total than in 2020 due to growth of the DeFi market, the security firm said in the report released on Wednesday. As a proportion of the crypto market's capitalization, losses dropped by 17%, according to the report.  The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols at the end of 2021 was $243.88 billion, up from $18.29 billion the year before, according to DefiLlama data. That means the lost funds shrank to 0.5% of TVL last year from 2.78% in 2020.  Centralization was the most common vulnerability ""by far,"" the security firm said. Certik found 286 discrete centralization risks through the 1,737 projects it audited, including privileged ownership. For example, some projects were drained when hackers obtained private keys that gave them complete control of smart contracts. This likely would have been avoided using multi-signature wallets or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) instead of one or a set of private keys.  The second-most common vulnerability was missing event emissions, followed by use of an unlocked compiler version, code lacking proper input validation and reliance on third parties. An event emission is information produced by a smart contract when it is executed.  The report also found that Ethereum surpassed the Bitcoin network on fee revenue. It now generates more than 64 times Bitcoin's revenue and four times the number of daily transactions. But Ethereum also suffered from its success because high transaction fees sent users to other platforms.  Certik noted the rise of Ethereum alternatives such as Binance Smart Chain. Binance's layer 1 protocol had TVL rise 31,000% to $21 billion, Certik said.  The security firm raised $80 million in a Series B2 fundraising in December 2021, bringing its valuation to $1 billion.

42387530,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG66S,1642068000,"BIS, Swiss National Bank, SIX Exchange Complete Wholesale CBDC Trial","Switzerland is practically ready to launch a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Working in concert, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the country’s stock exchange, SIX, have test-driven the integration of wholesale CBDC settlement.  Also included in the prototype were five commercial banks: Citi, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Hypothekarbank Lenzburg and UBS.  Wholesale CBDC is not to be confused with a digital currency issued by a central bank that would find its way into retail bank accounts, something Switzerland has already ruled out.  “Wholesale” in this context is all about connecting financial market infrastructures and streamlining transactions so that a digital cash token can be instantly swapped with a token representing another financial asset, for instance, and done in such a way that any credit risk is removed from the system.  When CBDC?  So far, no one at the SNB or SIX has said the launch of a wholesale CBDC in Switzerland is imminent, despite seeming to have stolen a march on most of the world. That said, most countries have begun at least kicking the tires on CBDCs in some form.  A report issued earlier today by the U.K.’s House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee concluded that a retail-facing CBDC might be “a solution in search of a problem.” However, the Lords report was more optimistic about the introduction of a wholesale CBDC, which could “enhance efficiency in securities trading and settlement,” adding that “further exploration and experimentation are necessary.”  Back in Switzerland, stalwarts of traditional finance are giving their stamp of approval.  “We have demonstrated that innovation can be harnessed to preserve the best elements of the current financial system, including settlement in central bank money, while also potentially unlocking new benefits,” BIS Innovation Hub head Benoît Cœuré said in a statement. “As [distributed ledger technology] goes mainstream, this will become more relevant than ever.”  Still, it’s unclear whether Switzerland will begin a third phase of its wholesale CBDC prototype, dubbed “Project Helvetia.”  The testing, which took place over three days at the start of December 2021, proved that issuing a wholesale CBDC on a DLT platform operated and owned by a private-sector company (Swiss stock exchange owner SIX, in this case) was both operationally possible and feasible under Swiss law, according to a press release.  Pending decision?  In previous interviews with CoinDesk, executives from the Swiss National Bank and SIX had hinted that testing of a wholesale CBDC was close to completion and really just required a policy decision to give it the green light.  Read more: Swiss Central Bank Ready to Run With wCBDC in January: ‘Just Takes a Policy Decision’  “Project Helvetia [...] allowed the SNB to deepen its understanding of how the safety of central bank money could be extended to tokenized asset markets,” Andréa M. Maechler, a member of the governing board of the Swiss National Bank, said in a Thursday statement.  The second phase of Helvetia explored the settlement of domestic interbank transactions, plus monetary policy transactions between the central bank and commercial banks. Cross-border transactions were also tackled, involving a transaction from a Swiss bank to Citigroup in London.  This involved connecting the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) distributed ledger (built using the R3 Corda blockchain) with the existing Swiss real-time gross settlement system – SIX Interbank Clearing, which has been operated on behalf of the Swiss National Bank since 1987 – as well as the respective core banking systems.  “To continue fulfilling their mandates of ensuring monetary and financial stability, central banks need to stay on top of technological change,” Maechler said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | SPONSORED,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/01/13/bis-swiss-national-bank-six-exchange-complete-wholesale-cbdc-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a17385c06f8ee00723ecc8952383de82eeb01ede-4172x2754.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, many internet service providers (ISPs) offer 1TB+ monthly data allowances or unlimited data plans. Many internet users waste hundreds of millions of gigabytes worth of unused bandwidth every month. Now there is an innovative technology called PKT, which enables internet-connected customers to earn passive income from a home or office internet connection worldwide. PKT is not a company and has no investors or CEO. It is a common good network that is being built by the people who connect, with the goal of providing low-cost access and helping connect the next 1 billion people to the internet. Since many internet users rely on their computers for their jobs or general internet access, PKT Pal has created a dedicated hardware solution called the PKT Cube to help anyone easily participate and get paid. The PKT Cube enables the average person to easily maximize the income from their unused internet bandwidth, without relying on their personal computer or laptop. Over the last decade, ISPs have steadily increased bandwidth prices by about 4 percent annually. So now it is more important than ever to maximize the income from the bandwidth that is already paid for in a service plan.

ADA rose 7% soon after Coinbase restarted withdrawals on Wednesday. Traders started facing withdrawal issues last week.  Sentiment in Asia was further buoyed after Hong Kong’s central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), seemed to provide an open ear to crypto stakeholders in a new discussion paper.  The token was trading at $1.30 by mid-day Hong Kong time, up 6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.  Other layer 1 tokens, such as solana (SOL), also posted gains of up to 10% in the past 24 hours.  Layer 1 refers to individual blockchains, such as Ethereum or Solana, over which developers can build applications and services.  Reports of cardano traders facing difficulties withdrawing their tokens from Coinbase spooked the market last week, pushing cardano down to $1.11 from a late December high of $1.60.  Traders were also relieved that HKMA appears to have an open mind to crypto after its chief executive solicited stakeholder feedback to build a “risk-based, pragmatic and agile regulatory regime."" Hong Kong’s regulators were seen as hostile to crypto in the past  March Zheng, a Shanghai-based partner at Bizantine Capital, pointed to a continued correlation between a bullish stock market and rising crypto prices in a comment to CoinDesk.

Shiba inu prices reached as high as $0.00003 during early Asian hours on Thursday before a sell-off. Shiba inu is the thirteenth-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $17 billion.  Price charts suggest the move followed a bounce from resistance-turned-support levels of $0.000027. However, the token remains in a broader downtrend as prices have dropped 62% since reaching an all-time high of $0.00008 in October 2021.  The price bump came shortly after rumors of a listing on Robinhood did the rounds on Twitter.  “Shiba Inu Robinhood listing said to come as early as [February],” a tweet by business news handle ZeroHedge read. Robinhood did not return requests for comment.  Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev previously denied plans for listing shiba inu on the influential stock trading application in October 2021. “It goes back to safety first, right. So we’re not generally going to be the first to add any new asset. We want to make sure that it goes through a stringent set of criteria,” he said in an interview with CNBC.  Additionally, shiba inu was listed on Bitso, one of Mexico’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volumes. However, the announcement did little to affect prices, trading data shows.  The bump in shiba inu saw other meme coins, such as dogecoin (DOGE), gaining as much as 14% in the past 24 hours. Baby doge and floki inu, two meme tokens issued on the Binance Smart Chain, surged 10% in the same period.  The surge in shiba inu came on the back of a broader recovery in crypto markets after nearly a week of declines.

He Yifan, chief executive of Red Date Technology, which provides technical support to BSN, told the SCMP that non-fungible tokens “have no legal issue in China” as long as they have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies.  The infrastructure, BSN-Distributed Digital Certificate (BSN-DDC), provides application programming interfaces for businesses or individuals, enabling them to build their own user portals or apps to manage NFTs. Only the Chinese yuan may be used for purchases and service fees.  Red Date Technology, the firm behind the Blockchain Services Network, announced in October last year that it would launch the infrastructure in China by the end of this month.  The Red Date CEO said at the time that NFTs will be widely used in China in the next five years, but the government doesn’t want the technology to be associated with crypto or running on public, permissionless chains.

With everyone pulling in the same direction, but each bringing his own talents and theories to the table, the idea was that those most committed to a project were the ones best placed to influence its evolution. This principle eventually gave rise to decentralised autonomous organisations - or DAOs for short. Made up of developers, engineers, coders and regular community members, these open-source organisations were intended to automate decisions without the need for a traditional management structure or board of directions. Since Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin touted DAOs as the holy grail of organisation types in a 2013 article, there have been dozens of DAOs deployed on the blockchain, and though each had a decision-making mechanism at its core, the overall projects were highly varied. Alas, many DAOs have been hamstrung by low voter turnout while some have suffered reputational damage due to well-publicised hacks. Reimagining the DAO Model Now, a brand-new kind of DAO is being developed by the Bribe defi protocol.

42387528,18tZcBceb7lzdS5vgOG64c,1642032060,House of Lords Committee Sees 'No Convincing Case' for UK CBDC,"There is ""no convincing case"" for the U.K. to have a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a House of Lords committee has concluded.  The Economic Affairs Committee of the U.K.'s upper house set up the enquiry in September to explore how a CBDC might affect the role of the Bank of England, monetary policy and the financial sector. The report published Thursday found that ""while a CBDC may provide some advantages, it could present significant challenges for financial stability and the protection of privacy.""  The Bank of England, in common with central banks of almost every other major economy across the world, is exploring a potential CBDC as a means of addressing the decline in the use of cash, expediting the implementation of monetary policy and future-proofing fiat currencies from the rise in use of privately issued digital currencies. It is set to begin a consultation alongside the Treasury later this year to explore design features, benefits and implications for users.  The House of Lords committee said it would be ""inevitable"" that consumers would transfer money from their bank accounts into CBDC wallets. Therefore safeguards would be required on the amount of CBDC individuals could hold to avoid financial instability being exacerbated during turbulent economic times by people replacing bank deposits with digital banknotes.

Where the Current State of Digital Currency Research Leads  The Bank of England would also risk being drawn into ""controversial debates on privacy"" were it to add design features to the CBDC to counter its use for criminal activity.  ""While there are design options that would provide some privacy safeguards, technical specifications alone may be insufficient to counter public concern over the risk of state surveillance,"" according to the committee.  The potential benefits of a CBDC are ""overstated or achievable through less risky alternatives,"" Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, chair of the committee, said.  The Bank of England established two forums last year to discuss some of the issues with representatives from companies such as Paypal, Spotify, Mastercard and Visa among the members.  Should the bank proceed with the development of a digital pound, it has said the earliest that one could be rolled out is the second half of the decade.",NEGATIVE,없음,FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/13/house-of-lords-committee-sees-no-convincing-case-for-uk-cbdc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c3c3f3e4b2b24423305cffd5e63512de13a32fb3-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
