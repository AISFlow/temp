U.S.-based firm Teneo Restructuring has been tapped to oversee the liquidations.

42374403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNJR,1656714057,"Cosmos-Builder Ignite Cuts Headcount by More Than 50%, Ex-Employees Say","Ignite, the company that originally founded the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, has parted with more than half its employees this week, two ex-employees and a source close to the company told CoinDesk.  The news came after Ignite CEO Peng Zhong announced on Friday he would be leaving the company. According to one of CoinDesk’s sources, Zhong was also joined by other top executives at the firm. Against the backdrop of a contentious re-organization, the high-profile exits at Ignite place the firm’s future in question.  Ignite laid off some employees, and others volunteered to leave the company in return for severance packages. The firm joins other crypto companies hit hard by the sector’s recent collapse, including BlockFi, Coinbase (COIN) and Crypto.com. But according to CoinDesk’s sources, Ignite’s workforce cuts stemmed not only from recent market conditions but internal factors.  According to the two ex-employees who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, the potential for cuts was first announced by former Ignite CEO Jae Kwon when he returned to the company in May.  Kwon, one of Cosmos’ original creators, founded Ignite (then called Tendermint) and its parent company, All In Bits, Inc., in 2014. Kwon stepped down as Tendermint’s CEO in 2020 after a widely publicized dispute with some of its employees, but he retained a seat on the All In Bits board. In May, CoinDesk reported that Kwon would be returning to the company as the CEO of New Tendermint, an Ignite spin-off focused on some of Kwon’s side projects.  According to CoinDesk’s sources, when Kwon announced his return at a company all-hands in May, he said severance packages would be offered to some employees.  According to one of the ex-Ignite employees, details about the new organizational structure between Ignite and New Tendermint remained vague for several weeks after they were announced.  Employees were invited to apply to work at New Tendermint, Kwon’s new venture, said the ex-employee. Those who did not apply were told they would be invited to join a reformulated version of Ignite, or a new initiative called Cosmos Cash. According to the ex-employee, Kwon clarified that not all Ignite employees would make the cut.  The crypto crash in June forced Kwon to slash numbers further than originally anticipated, the person said.  CoinDesk has reached out to Kwon for comment but has not heard back.  CoinDesk has reviewed a spreadsheet listing over 50 ex-Ignite employees from multiple departments who were laid off or voluntarily accepted severance packages. According to CoinDesk sources, the list was circulated to other Cosmos-based projects who might be looking for workers, and the number of people who have left or are leaving the company could total over 100.  Before these departures, Ignite’s headcount was around 140.  A Re-brand, a Re-org and a Re-structuring  In February, Ignite rebranded from its original name, Tendermint. Then-CEO Peng Zhong told CoinDesk at the time the rebranding was meant to signify a shift in strategy for the firm, which had historically focused on building backend infrastructure for the Cosmos ecosystem.  The Cosmos ecosystem is a community of inter-connected blockchains that can easily send assets back and forth. It made headlines this week with the announcement that dYdX, a leading crypto exchange platform, will be leaving Ethereum in favor of its own Cosmos-based blockchain.  Today, most of Cosmos’ core infrastructure is maintained by a broad community of teams and companies other than Ignite. With the rebrand from Tendermint, Zhong said Ignite would place the bulk of its focus on Emeris – the firm’s Cosmos-based crypto investment hub.  Ignite announced Friday that the development of Emeris was “On Hold.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/cosmos-builder-ignite-cuts-headcount-by-more-than-50-ex-employees-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/908f61ea826ed75a71ecbb991fcb7ce87167787c-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374374,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZN4L,1656713371,India's Day Of Reckoning With ‘Most Controversial Crypto Tax’ Is Here,"India's crypto community has been bracing for a highly controversial provision of India's next crypto tax regime – the 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) – to take effect for over three months. The tax will be levied any time an Indian buys or sells crypto.  The tax became effective Friday, July 1, setting the stage for a test – a predicted negative impact on crypto adoption and the market. Calculating the impact of the tax will be a wait-and-watch game at a time when the global investment community is facing a slowdown.  What's the tax?  The 1% TDS liability is the second major provision of India’s recently introduced crypto tax law. Another provision, which enforces a 30% capital gains tax on all transactions, took effect on April 1.  TDS is a liability imposed on the exchanges that deposit taxes on behalf of sellers on their platform. It will be calculated at 1% of a transaction's value. The seller would be able to offset the 1% TDS from his or her total tax liability of 30%.  The government must be notified of a transaction within 30 days from the end of the month in which the transaction is made and any sum deducted must be paid to the government within the same time frame.  Transactions of up to INR 50,000 ($640) in a year are exempted from the rule of 1% TDS for certain categories of taxpayers.  Other procedural specifications have been detailed here.  Latest clarification  In a notice issued on June 30, the government announced that there is no need to pay 30% tax and 1% TDS on some NFTs and digital assets.  The exemption includes digital gift cards or vouchers for the purchase of goods or services or those to avail discounts on goods and services.  Mileage points, reward points or loyalty cards, without direct monetary consideration under an award, benefit, loyalty, incentive, rebate or promotional program have also been excluded. The same applies for subscriptions to websites or platforms or applications.  Non-fungible tokens (NFT) of tangible assets, like land records, have also been excluded for all taxation purposes.  Why the 1% TDS is controversial  When the crypto tax rules were first announced as a proposal on Feb. 1, 2022, it created an uproar from India's crypto community. Their biggest bone of contention was the 1% TDS.  They argued – and continue to believe – that the 1% TDS is too high, and could kill trading volumes, increase an already high level of brain drain and make tax collection and understanding extremely cumbersome for both industry and retail traders, effectively scuttling the growth of an industry that was just taking off.  Over the next two months, representatives of the crypto industry met and pleaded with government representatives to at least take back this specific provision.  Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX, initially one of India's most known and largest exchanges but now a ""crypto investment app,"" tweeted to say this tax ""would do more harm than good."" He said developers and entrepreneurs might flee to friendlier jurisdictions, and said a 30% taxation rate coupled with 1% TDS is ""unfair.""  On the other hand, India's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, argued ""that the government is taxing crypto because people are profiting from it,"" and that the goal is to ""check the source and trail"" without legitimizing crypto.  ""Regulations are good for the crypto industry and a definite positive step. However, 30% taxation and 1% TDS is unfair. Would humbly urge the government to reconsider the % of TDS and tax. Onerous taxation and TDS is proving to be a major hindrance to the growth of this industry. The objective of tracking transactions and transparency can very easily be achieved in other ways too,"" tweeted Gupta.  Predicted impact  When the proposal became law on April 1, Nischal Shetty, CEO of one of India's biggest exchanges, WazirX told CoinDesk, ""we have entered a period of pain.""  ""The 1% TDS will kill liquidity, which means ultimately profitability goes down for everyone. It's a lose-lose,"" Shetty said.  Within days of the 30% tax taking effect in April, trading volumes collapsed, in some cases by more than 70%.  Hours before Friday's new tax became effective, exchanges announced system shutdowns due to TDS implementation, indicating how retailers and the industry both will have to streamline tax collection processes which they argue are tedious.  The days leading up to July 1 have seen ""1% TDS"" trending on Twitter. Crypto exchanges and influencers have been hosting educational forums and debates to shine a spotlight on the guidelines of the ""harmful"" tax.  Opposition vs. government/central bank  As 1% TDS trended, an old video of an opposition Minister of Parliament, Ritesh Pandey who called for ending the 1% TDS, gained traction.  “In our country, where so many unicorns are emerging, with this regulation, you (the government) are strangulating all the crypto transactions,” Pandey said.  “The people in the 18-25 years of age are invested heavily in this (crypto and other VDAs), and the TDS is effectively ending their ambitions and innovation. I request the government to remove the 1% TDS from all crypto transactions,” the young MP said, referring to virtual digital assets.  A few days ago, the Governor of India's Central Bank, Shaktikanta Das, said cryptocurrencies are a clear danger, arguing that anything that derives value based on make-believe, without any underlying, is just speculation.

FTX just announced on Friday that it had made a deal with crypto lender BlockFi to provide BlockFi with a $400 million credit facility and potentially acquire it for as much as $240 million.

42374405,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNIB,1656711473,"Meta to Shutter Novi Crypto Payments Wallet in September, Ending Libra Saga","Meta (FB) will shut down Novi, the social media company’s digital wallet payments pilot, on Sept. 1, all but ending the libra stablecoin experiment three years after the company then known as Facebook unveiled its ambitious but ultimately doomed crypto payments gamble.  Meta announced the news on the service’s website, texting users a link to the announcement that urged users to withdraw their money from the platform “as soon as possible.” Beginning July 21, users will lose the ability to add money to their accounts. Novi’s WhatsApp account and the Novi app will also become unavailable. Once the pilot ends, users will not have access to their transaction history and other data.  Novi, originally known as Calibra, had been Meta’s wallet for its libra stablecoin (later renamed diem) revealed in June 2019. Its role shifted as regulatory pressures forced the stablecoin project to change course. Novi became a money-transfer pilot for crypto-based remittances in 2020 – but it never got beyond the U.S. and Guatemala.  Although Meta decided to kill the Novi pilot, the company said it has plans to repurpose the technology for future products, including its metaverse initiative.  “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in an emailed statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the Web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”  In the interim, Meta has begun exploring efforts to support non-fungible tokens (NFT) on its sites.  Meta scrapped its original, stablecoin-oriented plans for Novi/Calibra after the company faced regulatory pushback over its ability to combat money laundering, protect consumers and monitor other security and financial risks. It scaled back and rebranded the effort along the way.  David Marcus, who spearheaded the Novi project, departed Meta last year. In January, three years after the company unveiled its libra stablecoin, the company sold the successor Diem project’s assets to crypto-oriented bank Silvergate Capital (SI) for $200 million.  The closing of Meta’s libra chapter comes amid a major downturn in cryptocurrency markets as the industry contends with layoffs and several prominent businesses, including Celsius and Voyager, facing solvency issues.

42374402,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZNEP,1656709559,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Suffers Its Worst Month Since 2011,"Hi, I'm Helene Braun, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  June was tough for crypto markets.  Bitcoin (BTC) saw its biggest monthly price drop since 2011, 37.3%. Ether (ETH) was down 45% last month.  The declines resulted largely from a range of macroeconomic problems that has made traders risk-averse.  “This was one of the worst quarters on record pretty much everywhere across the equity market, across the bond market, across a lot of different places,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset manager Arca Funds, told CoinDesk.  With inflation still running at a 40-year high, and because of uncertainty caused by supply-chain disruptions and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, investors across all markets are fearful, and rightfully so.  The GDPNow gauge, a popular tracker from the Atlanta Fed, showed Thursday that real gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 1% in the second quarter, which would be the second consecutive month that the U.S. economy saw negative growth, indicating that we already might be in a recession.  But it’s not all outside factors that affected the crypto market. Crypto itself suffered big shocks last month, causing declines that outpaced even major stock indexes, which continued to shed value.  Two weeks ago, Celsius’s CEL token fell in value by over 50% after announcing it was halting withdrawals, although it regained some ground by month's end to finish down only 24%.  CoinFLEX, a crypto exchange focused on derivatives trading, also paused withdrawals. Its FLEX token declined over 65% in 24 hours.  “The story should be about the [decentralized finance] platforms that have worked in service to their customers admirably and without issue, while their [centralized finance] counterparts like Celsius have blown up,” Dorman said.  A number of analysts believe bitcoin will break below the roughly $18,000-$21,000 support it held throughout June.  “A successful retest appears likely at this time and could set the base for a gradual recovery spread over a few months,” BitBull CEO Joe DiPasquale wrote to CoinDesk. “A breakdown from this range could see bitcoin trading between $13,000 to $15,000 and could send the market into a spiral that may require a longer period of time for recovery.”  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $19,340 +2.1%      ●Ether (ETH): $1,062 +4.2%      ●S&P 500 daily close: 3,828.11 +1.1%      ●Gold: $1,808 per troy ounce +0.2%      ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.89% −0.08       Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Grayscale 'GBTC Discount' Widens After SEC Bitcoin ETF Rejection  A key crypto market metric known as the ""Grayscale discount"" is widening after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected an application by the CoinDesk sister company to convert its bitcoin fund, the world's biggest, into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) are now trading at a 31% discount to the value of the underlying bitcoin, based on figures posted on the website for Grayscale Investments, the fund's manager. Prior to the SEC's decision, the GBTC discount was 28.4%.  The widening in the discount is seen as a sign of waning optimism for a conversion anytime soon – the opposite of what was happening last week, when some investors were buying GBTC, betting on the fund's chances, said Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a tech supplier for the crypto industry in Europe.  “Now, with the news that the SEC is not approving the ETF, it is having the opposite effect,” Jodar said.

42421498,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoW4b,1656709386,Web3 Needs In-Person Gatherings,"Enough talk about decentralized finance – the decentralization we’re all experiencing is the changing nature of work!  Remember when we used to wake up at an ungodly time, shower, get dressed and sit in traffic for two hours so we could perch at a desk and work among our colleagues? The COVID-19 pandemic fast tracked a trend we were already heading towards – a future where the workforce is distributed – alleviating congested cities, allowing workers to live where rent is cheaper and providing a people with real flexibility.  Jenn Sanasie is a content director at Windranger Labs and co-host of ""The Hash"" on CoinDesk TV. This article is part of ""Future of Work Week.""  Even now that offices are open and people are vaccinated, 61% of workers are choosing to remain at home. But the future of work isn’t only at home: It’s a hybrid model that sees decentralized organizations centralize for short sprints in Airbnbs and boutique hotels all over the world for creative collaboration, goal setting and team building.  See also: The Crypto CEO Who Doesn't Want the Job  The internet allows us to transcend physical boundaries, and blockchain technology provides a means for community building and accountability, but we should be wary of going too far. Real life experiences shouldn’t be phased out – not even in Web3.  The real thing  My first experience with this promising, new model of work was as a community contributor to BitDAO, when I joined Windranger Labs in March. Windranger Labs is a core contributor to the BitDAO ecosystem, and is committed to building, co-developing and accelerating autonomous entity infrastructure.  Like other decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), we've benefited greatly from having a global pool of self-motivated contributors. For instance, I joined the company from the comfort of my home, as did many of my colleagues based in 25 different countries.  We met for the first time last month during an off-site in San Francisco. Up until this moment my colleagues were a sea of voices and avatars online, some of whom worked opposite hours than me – making it difficult to understand their triggers, motivations and culture.  “With everyone remotely working from all corners of the Earth, finding the ideal time for team mates across multiple timezones can be really tricky,” Kalli Yong, head of social media, said. ""Decentralized work"" has a great number of benefits; however, it isn't always as ""efficient as compared to [in real life] collaboration,“ she added.  The mission behind our San Francisco off-site was to bring teams together to align on the company’s vision and foster a greater sense of interpersonal understanding. There were all your usual office amenities and needs: white boards, smart boards, lounge chairs and plenty of snacks.  Surprisingly, my team achieved more work over these eight days than would have probably taken weeks if we weren’t together IRL. That's to say nothing of the quality of bonding that seems to only happen face to face.  San Fran to New York and beyond  The Windranger team met again in New York City last month for NFT.NYC, the largest such industry event. Almost the entire company was in attendance, as BitDAO was a sponsor. As a decentralized organization with no headquarters that is contributing to a DAO, it was surreal to see the BitDAO logo on billboards in Times Square, and draped all over the conference.  We relished these moments of coming together in person, finally all in the same time zone, at dinners, brunches and quick coffee meetings. We even threw a rave.  While being in person was productive and helped establish our workplace culture, it might have had the opposite effect if we were going into an office everyday. Was it just me, or did company off-sites feel weird or forced, rather than celebratory?  See also: It Can't Be 'Decentralization or Bust'  “It was really nice to finally put names to faces, and meeting people in-person provides a clearer understanding of the way they work which is definitely helpful when we work remotely again,"" Yong said. ""Having offsites once in awhile has proven to be productive as the team gets to forge a stronger bond rather than just having to talk to a screen.”  The future of work is not completely decentralized, and authentic engagement is rooted in IRL community models. We’ve been organizing ourselves for millennia and the skills we’ve developed in that time don’t need to be displaced, but rather focused.

As per the formation in the daily chart, POLY crypto may float higher to retest $0.30 in the medium term. Past Performance of Polymath Polymath crypto is up 10 percent in the last trading day versus USDT. Technically, buyers appear to be in control, printing above the middle BB in a possible bullish formation. In the daily chart, a double bottom could form if POLY coin prices inch higher above the middle BB. Polymath Technical Analysis POLY token prices are printing higher at spot rates—a welcomed development. Even so, there is a long upper wick pointing to liquidation in smaller time frames, slowing down buyers. Despite this resistance, traders may find entries on dips above the middle BB at $0.18. The immediate target will be July 1 highs of $0.24 and later June 2022 highs at $0.30. Ideally, the expansion towards $0.24 should have high trading volumes to indicate demand. Conversely, if sellers flow back and force the coin below $0.24 at the back of rising trading volumes, POLY token prices may drop to retest 2022 lows at $0.15. What to Expect from POLY? Traders are upbeat after today&apos;s gains. Nonetheless, there must be a solid confirmation pushing Polymath coin prices away from the middle BB.

42421129,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXZWCz,1656704204,The Crypto CEO Who Doesn't Want the Job,"Four years after dropping out from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Suji Yan pinned a tweet to his profile in an unlikely moment of triumph.  The tweet was for the Web3 Drop Out Scholarship, an effort Yan founded that offers $50,000 to people who leave big companies or universities to enter Web3. If that sounds a little like the Thiel Fellowship created by billionaire Peter Thiel, which provides university dropouts with $100,000 over two years to pursue other work, that’s because it is.  In 2017, Yan thought he could offer more to the world by doing rather than learning and applied for Thiel’s scholarship. Although he didn't get it, he still dropped out. He has since started his own business, worked as an independent journalist and is now developing new tools to “decentralize” social media with figures like Jack Dorsey.  ""There is not a lot of what we have [that the Thiel Fellowship] can provide,"" Yan said, adding that famed opportunity for renegades and outsiders (including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin) now seems ""more traditional.”  Yan’s wager is that Web3 will fundamentally change the world – how we work, play and interact – over the next 20 to 50 years. The scholarship, which paid out tokens to three out of 40 candidates in its first year, is a path for similarly self-motivated people, who otherwise might be cut off from traditional financing, to start building.  See also: Balaji Srinivasan, HashKey Back $2M Round in Twitter Privacy Tool Mask Network  His own company, Mask Network, which uses open-source browser extensions to add privacy and Web3 tools to social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, has had its financial ups and downs, Yan said. It’s now part of Twitter’s secretive Bluesky project working to open source social media algorithms and is transitioning into Web3’s community ownership model as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  ""Our goal is to make sure in the next 10 years I will definitely not be a CEO. If I'm the CEO still running this business it's definitely bad,"" Yan said.  CoinDesk spoke with Yan as part of Future of Work Week to discuss why he thinks Binance and FTX are too big, the digitization of everything and at least one path to “making it” in crypto.  You were an independent reporter before getting into Web3 and crypto. Do you think journalists should learn how to code?  Coding is a tool. I think it’s definitely something really important for journalists to learn. It’s not saying they need to learn calculus or fancy machine learning. Coding is generally very important and helpful – like driving a car or being able to cook for yourself.  How did you get involved with Jack Dorsey's Bluesky project?  Bluesky was announced at the end of 2019 by Jack on Twitter. One and a half years later, Jay Graber, who had been involved in Bluesky since the very beginning, was appointed as CEO. I met her online because she was from the Zcash community. I was lucky that when I was in college, Andrew Miller was a young professor at the UIUC [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]. He is also co-founder of Zcash, the president of Zcash Foundation. That's how I know Zcash.  See also: Twitter Picks Crypto Developer Jay Graber to Run Bluesky  When [Mask Network] raised money we started to donate to other decentralized social networks, which also connected us to other Bluesky teams. It was a really small world in 2019. So we were all connected. Then Jay started this Discord group, which later became a much more serious group with different people from Twitter and the crypto community.  After Jack departed from Twitter in 2021, Bluesky became more independent and Jay became CEO – we're still figuring out what's the next thing we're going to do. But overall, I think, no matter what changes – like with Web5, Web6 – it doesn't matter. Whatever it is doing, we’d love to help. We’d love to be part of it. We have already been involved for two years.  How does Mask Network bring privacy and benefits from Web3 to social media like Facebook and Twitter with an open-sourced browser extension? How can you be sure that Facebook or other social media companies won't block access?  We don't use APIs (application programming interfaces). There's no server interaction or middleware. One common mistake is to believe [Facebook], you just can't believe in them. So we never use any APIs. Zero. We learn the technology, but we don't rely on any of them. There is no way to block us.  You dropped out from the University of Illinois. Why?  One thing I really care about is being pseudonymous, anonymous. I really enjoyed this community. So I just wanted to see what I could accomplish with a pure, online anonymous identity without saying, “Hey, I'm whoever from whatever college, this is my name, this is my application.”  Obviously, staying in a college is not up to most choices. So I decided to drop out. I bought ETH and bitcoin in earlier days, so I was lucky. And I did receive a lot of help back in 2017, but I didn't receive much support as a crypto founder. No one offered me a fellowship. But I dropped out and received funding from VCs to start my own business.  What do you want to achieve or encourage via the Web3 Drop Out Scholarship?  When I was in college, I didn't have this chance to receive this kind of donation. Unfortunately, the Thiel Fellowship is more traditional and there is not a lot they can provide [for Web3].  We think Web3 will provide a lot of opportunities in the next 20 or 50 years. We want kids to be able to help themselves. They say I have this dream; I just need some money to start it. No matter what dream you have, as long as it makes sense to us, we're going to help you. And if you need further funding or referrals we can provide for you. We have connections to everyone.  What was the common theme among those three successful applicants this year?  They all share a passion for the decentralized world. They all think that staying in college or large companies is not a necessary routine they have to follow. They all have enough knowledge or are willing to learn to achieve their dreams. Some of them do not have a tech background but want to learn stuff. One of the winners uploaded the proof of dropout.  You actively discuss Web3 and crypto in China, moderate panels and give speeches. What are your thoughts about the development of Web3 and crypto in China? More broadly, in Asia?  Asia is a huge market. We will not leave just because the Chinese government or whatever says it's not legal; it's like a gray area. I remember like in the early days of bitcoin, everything is a gray area. Whatever people want, that's actually what we want to build.  See also: 3 Takes About China's Crypto Ban That Are Wrong | Opinion (2021)  I'd say if it's something people want, you cannot ban it at all. If people think just because the local government doesn't like it, they just ban it. They’re completely wrong. The whole industry, bitcoin, emerged from a gray area, from a tiny piece of cyberspace.  Could Web3, truly built on open protocols, break the ""great firewalls"" of China’s internet?  They will not only break the “great firewalls.” It will break every nation-state border. That's what I believe. That is also one reason behind the Drop Out Fellowship logic: You don't need to have education from these colleges that are certified by governments. They will not, do not teach you how to do revolution. They're part of the system. But it will take years.  In your Twitter bio, you say you are “anti 996.” What do you think about the work culture in crypto?  We’re turning ourselves from a company to a foundation, and eventually, into a DAO. For now, we are still running a company, which means I'm CEO, and there are people I write checks to. The Ethereum model or Bitcoin model is working – it's like members become volunteers. That's something that really makes me excited everyday.  If I wake up in 10 years, and I realize that I’m still the CEO [that’d be] a terrible thing. I think founders of these large public companies have been CEOs for too long. 10 years ago, they're the CEO, and then after 10 years, they’re still CEOs. I think a lot of businesses are able to become communities, like decentralized exchanges.  We have a DAO to form an organization for the DAO members. The labor union is the first version of DAO. If our employees are in other DAOs, I'm really happy with that. But for now, we're still a company. Our goal is to make sure in the next 10 years I will definitely not be a CEO. If I'm the CEO still running this business it's definitely bad.  What advice would you give to someone trying to make it in crypto?  You will see a lot of big whales or big companies playing games, but try to remember the fundamentals of the industry is to evolve in a decentralized manner and cross nations’ borders. If you believe in that, if you follow that path, you're gonna be successful, you're gonna make it. But if you don't trust this logic and get lost in your marketing, you're not going to make it because you’re wasting your time.  That is what I learned in the past cycles: Don't believe in the large company and large organization. Yeah, talk to them, but believe in the fact that eventually it's the people who are going to create history. It's not the big CEO who will create history.  Large companies like Binance and FTX have become too large. The fundamental logic of this industry is we're pushing the human being into a digitalization being and forming new communities, staying together, with decentralized technology. We're realizing this.

Past Delta Cap Trend Shows Bitcoin May Still Face More Decline Before A Bottom As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC market cap is now below the realized cap, but still above the delta cap. Before taking a look at the data, it&apos;s best to first get a basic grasp of the three major capitalization models for Bitcoin. The normal market cap is calculated by just taking the total number of coins currently in circulation and multiplying it by the price of BTC right now. The &apos;realized cap&apos; works a bit differently; instead of multiplying all the coins by the same price, this model weighs each coin by the price it was last moved at. Related Reading | USDC Exchange Reserves Rise As Investors Escape From Bitcoin For example, if there are 2 BTC in circulation and the current price is $19k, then the normal market cap is simply $38k. However, if one of these coins was last transacted at, say, $15k, and the other at $19k, then the realized cap would be $34k instead. Now, the Bitcoin &apos;delta cap&apos; is defined as the difference between the realized cap and the average of the market cap. The average of the normal market cap here is taken over the entire history of the crypto (and it&apos;s naturally a moving average).

Read more: Grayscale Sues SEC Over Bitcoin ETF Application Rejection  In that situation, because of an imbalance between supply and demand, GBTC’s price traded far above bitcoin’s (BTC) market price, acting like a hedge fund that brought in significant amounts of leverage, Long said. Retail investors bought in, but only until the SEC approved competing products. Once competition creeped in, closed-in funds like GBTC reversed course and began to trade at a discount to their net asset value.  On Friday, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the SEC after the agency rejected Grayscale’s application to convert GBTC into an exchange-traded fund.  “My gut tells me that there are some folks at the SEC who wish that had never happened because it took them over six years to greenlight another product to compete,” Long said. “Therefore that premium sat out there and a lot of mom-and-pop investors got hurt by the whipsaw, as did the whole industry.”  While Long cannot pinpoint exactly what the SEC’s next move will be, she noted distortions in the market are caused by regulatory decisions. She cited cryptocurrency market maker and lending firm Genesis Global Trading, as it faces nine-figure losses because of its exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which now faces collapse. (Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group.)  And while questions remain surrounding companies that are still leveraging bitcoin, Long said that it could be good for the industry to “say good riddance to all of it.”  “I’d rather see it all go away,” she said, and instead, “rebuild it [the industry] based upon a non-leveraged business model.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/01/custodia-banks-ceo-says-bad-actors-and-regulators-caused-crypto-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1a81bf2f61f10c9e76094e864e72beebfc04b3b6-1021x766.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421245,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhsNx,1656700367,Future of Work: The Digital Fashionista,"When I meet Daniella Loftus at an Instagram-friendly coffee shop in New York City’s SoHo neighborhood during the middle of the massive NFT.NYC conference, she lets me know first that she’s not drinking this week. “I’m not here to party,” she says.  Instead, the digital fashion influencer, and founder/CEO of a Web3 digital fashion startup is in New York to network and grow her business, which sits at the intersection of fashion and crypto. It’s a niche world, and Loftus – who’s wearing an oversize leopard print jacket when we meet – knows this. That’s why she got in at ground level.  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  Speak with Loftus and you’ll find out that digital fashion can be broken down into three categories: IRL, ORL and URL. IRL comprises “everything from when a designer like Burberry uses a digital backend to produce physical goods, to [designers] who will say we're producing a physical good with an NFT [non-fungible token] attached,” she explains. ORL, or “On Real Life,” is what Loftus does via her brand/Instagram account, called This Outfit Does Not Exist, where she uses augmented reality (AR) filters to show off digital garments as she poses in physical spaces.  The last, “Un Real Life,” refers to the “direct avatar economy,” aka skins in video games or outfits avatars wear in metaverse programs like Decentraland. In games like Fortnite, Loftus says, “they don’t call it fashion, these gamers, but it’s a $40 billion market.”  Among all three of those categories, she adds, “blockchain-based digital fashion is a miniscule ecosystem.”  Loftus’s goal is to grow this ecosystem to the point where digital fashion is no longer an emerging trend or a buzzword but a mainstream part of how people express themselves, both online and off. To do this, she models digital wares on social media and is fundraising for her company, Draup, which she aims to grow into a marketplace where digitally native fashion designers can sell their work.  Read more: Megan Kaspar: Meta-a-Porter Fashion  “The dream is to be the CEO of a fashion marketplace, which will have, let's say, 100 digitally native brands on it [and] collectors who are fully monetizing their garments … aimed at transitioning fashion from a consumer good, which is aimed at a female audience, to an investment,” she says. “You start by buying an item because you like the way it looks, then you realize you can generate revenue and it becomes an on-ramp for women learning about financing in crypto.”  ***  Loftus talks about “stumbling into” blockchain, but her journey appears rather deliberate. Born in London, she graduated from New York University in 2018 while working at an impact fund in the city. One of the fund’s advisers was starting a company that lent money to “financially underserved populations in emerging markets using blockchain,” she says. Though she knew nothing about blockchain, she wanted in, thinking to herself, “I love a challenge … and I remember sitting on the train and just reading these blockchain books.”  Meanwhile, her love of fashion – something she’d held onto since growing up in London – never faded, but she couldn’t quite see herself working in the industry. “I didn't see it as ethos-driven in the way that I'd like it to be,” she explains, citing sustainability and exclusivity issues. She had many friends in the industry, but she was “always the weird one who was in business.”  Then, during the coronavirus pandemic, she spent time reading anything fashion-related she could get her hands on, from Vogue Business to TechCrunch. When she came across an article about the chief marketing officer of Gucci saying the brand would start designing clothes to be worn digitally, she figured that was her way to not just enter the fashion industry but to shape an important aspect of it firsthand. “I was, like, obviously this is the future,” she says.  Loftus took to Instagram to see what digital fashion brands and influencers were already strutting their stuff. “I thought I was going to see 100 accounts of people wearing digital fashion,” she says. “There was nothing.”  It was the middle of the pandemic and Loftus was spending a lot of time alone, so she figured she’d fill in the digital fashion void herself. She started her This Outfit Does Not Exist Instagram account from scratch and posted articles on digital design. She found the few digital fashion brands and marketplaces that existed and reached out to them to collaborate. Though she had a miniscule following at that point, it didn’t matter – they still wanted to work with her. “I made the bet that, because they're starting out and they need somebody, maybe they’ll work with me, and it worked out,” she says. “And I was on Clubhouse all the time.”  Then came a pivotal moment for blockchain-based goods – the recent NFT boom. The timing was perfect for This Outfit Does Not Exist to gain traction. But Loftus still held onto her day job. “I had 10 months where I was keeping my old job as a consultant and waking up at four o'clock in the morning and doing This Outfit Does Not Exist,” she says.  Meanwhile, she forged her way deeper into the ecosystem, joining Red DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization aimed at “supporting the growing digital fashion ecosystem.” Together, the group purchased a physical, bejeweled Dolce & Gabbana crown topped with a human-faced sun (the symbol of Venice), along with the corresponding NFT, for 423.5 ETH, or $1.27 million back in September. (Last NFT.NYC, some of the DAO’s members even got to wear the crown, which is normally held in Milan, but Loftus wasn’t there for the occasion.)  Fashion is just how you want to express yourself. That's it  By October, Loftus realized her digital fashion work was “maybe a real job.” Because she could perform her Web3 activities pretty much anywhere, she up and moved to Mexico City, a place where she’d always wanted to live. At that point “I basically had this epiphany about what I needed to build in the space,” she says.  That platform is Draup, named after the Norse god Odin’s magical ring, Draupnir, which would multiply for its owner every ninth night (detailed in Draup’s white paper). It’s also a nod to “drop culture,” where a brand like Nike (NKE) suddenly drops a new sneaker that fans wait for in lines that wind around SoHo blocks – a model adopted by NFT artists releasing new collections.  Becoming the founder and CEO of her own company, brought on some growing pains for Loftus. “You dictate your own schedule,” she says, diminishing the stress she felt when reporting to someone else and working on their deadlines, but exponentially multiplying her workload. “I was taking 15 meetings a day, especially during the fundraise. But because I enjoy this and this is genuinely my life's work, I didn't realize I was burning myself out.” Her whole persona had become wrapped up in her work, especially as she continued to act as a digital fashion influencer with This Outfit Does Not Exist.  “There’s a synergy where this is everything I am,” she adds. “Literally every element of me as a person kind of feels like it's encapsulated in digital fashion.”  ***  Making time to keep up This Outfit Does Not Exist around her demanding schedule hasn’t been easy, and Loftus admits she’s been slacking on that front. She “should do a post every two weeks,” she says, but when you’re running a business, it’s not exactly top of mind to “put on makeup and go pose on the street.”  Still, she manages to post when she can. The digital fashion she wears on her Instagram account and website comes from emerging virtual designers like Tribute Brand, Xtended Identity and Replicant, and it appears on her body in one of two ways. Either she sends a photo of her posing to the brand, who uses something along the lines of Photoshop to put the outfit on her in the photo, or an AR filter dresses her in the “clothes” while she poses in real time, via products by Snap and Zero10.  Both the Substack and Draup work towards Loftus’s ultimate goal, which is to make fashion less gatekept by both price and physical appearance. “It’s so snobby,” she says, “like if you’re not this size … we shouldn’t engage.”  Digital fashion has the potential to break down both of those boundaries. Many of her fellow Red DAO members, for instance, “don’t know anything about fashion” and never bought into it in the physical realm, she says, but they’re all about its digital counterpart. “I really love that because that’s what digital fashion is about,” she adds. “It's about tapping an entirely new type of consumer.”  Over the next several months, Loftus will travel all over the world to accomplish that goal, spreading the word by speaking in London, attending the Dolce & Gabbana show in Sicily and a “digital fashion dinner” in Milan, then heading to ETH CC in Paris, all while trying to find a chief technology officer to help realize Draup’s vision for the future of fashion.  “Fashion is just how you want to express yourself. That's it,” Loftus says. “And that's what's so fun about the digital world, because those [choices] can be so much more boundless.”  More from Future of Work Week  The Crypto Jobs Boom  It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.

42422806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0q23h,1656700293,Grayscale 'GBTC Discount' Widens After SEC Bitcoin ETF Rejection,"A key crypto market metric known as the ""Grayscale discount"" is widening after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected an application to convert the world's biggest bitcoin fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).  The shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) are now trading at a 31% discount to the value of the underlying bitcoin, based on figures posted on the website for Grayscale Investments, the fund's manager. Prior to the SEC's decision, the GBTC discount was 28.4%.  The widening in the discount is seen as a sign of waning optimism for a conversion anytime soon – the opposite of what was happening last week, when some investors were buying GBTC, betting on the fund's chances, said Pablo Jodar, financial products manager at Storm Partners, a tech supplier for the crypto industry in Europe.  “Now, with the news that the SEC is not approving the ETF, it is having the opposite effect,” Jodar said.  The GBTC fund's abysmal performance over the past year relative to bitcoin is at the heart of the recent meltdown of the once-highflying crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and of subsequent losses that have spread to crypto lenders, including Genesis Trading. (Both Grayscale and Genesis are owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which is often referred to by its stock trading symbol GBTC, is a type of investment vehicle that allows U.S. stock investors to gain exposure to price movements of BTC. One drawback of the trust's structure is that it has no clear mechanism for big investors to redeem the shares for the underlying bitcoin; if the vehicle worked like an ETF, the thinking goes, investors would quickly buy up the GBTC shares until they roughly approximated the value of the underlying bitcoin; the discount would evaporate.  Grayscale files suit  Immediately after the SEC rejected Grayscale’s application to convert its trust into an ETF, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the regulatory agency.  Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at FundStrat, said the SEC's rejection didn't come as a surprise.  “Our base case was an SEC denial, and based on the lack of a reaction in the spot market following the SEC's denial, I think that was the market's base case as well,” Farrell said.  He added that “while we certainly maintain it is appropriate to protect one's downside in the current environment, any incremental selling should not be attributed to the ETF denial specifically.”  He said he's not sure if there’s ample rationale for the discount to compress until the freshly filed litigation moves closer to a resolution – “or until there is regulatory clarity regarding oversight of spot exchanges, which might allow the SEC to change its tune.”  Ryan Selkis, CEO of the analysis firm Messari, said earlier this week that any court decision is probably years away.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/01/grayscale-gbtc-discount-widens-after-sec-bitcoin-etf-rejection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fb41a81942f75f838eb29454648e8c7e60fce173-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42393968,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwb4X,1656699391,So You Want to Be a Bitcoin Developer?,"Bill Gates was still in high school when Richard Stallman was busy hacking computers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971. Stallman went on to launch the free software movement, and Gates gladly assumed the role of corporate software antihero.  I was watching ""Revolution OS,"" a history of open-source computing, the other day and couldn’t help but chuckle when the narrator read Gates’ scathing “Open Letter to Hobbyists.” Microsoft had released software for the very early Altair 8800 and was accusing PC hobbyists of illegally copying and distributing that software. Gates wrote:  “Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who work on it get paid? Is this fair?”  Stallman was on a different trajectory. In 1984, he quit his job at MIT to focus on building a free and open operating system. The goal was to create an alternative to proprietary systems like Unix. His project was aptly named GNU, a recursive acronym for “Gnu’s not Unix.”  This article is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  Stallman was all too familiar with Gates’ assertion that developers couldn’t make money from free and open software. In 1985, he released his famous GNU Manifesto and countered Gates’ argument head-on. Under the section “Programmers need to make a living somehow,” Stallman wrote:  “People with new ideas could distribute programs as freeware, asking for donations from satisfied users.”  How to become a Bitcoin developer – pay it forward  Mike Schmidt, co-founder and executive director of Brink, an organization that funds Bitcoin development, explains that Bitcoin developers don’t just crank out code. They test, review and contribute in many other ways. In fact, a deep passion for contributing is pivotal if you want to join the Bitcoin family.  Schmidt compares the process of becoming a Bitcoin developer to a funnel. At the top, you have acclimatization. This is where one becomes intimately familiar with key areas current developers are working on. A great starting point is subscribing to the weekly Bitcoin Optech newsletter, which aggregates information from developer mailings lists, pull requests and key discussions.  Next, you have education. Schmidt recommends Bitcoin coding boot camps like Jimmy Song’s Programming Blockchain seminars, or Lisa Neigut’s Base58 course. There’s also something called the PR Review Club where budding developers can sharpen their pull request reviewing skills.  The bottom of the funnel is where developers become comfortable with the inner workings of the Bitcoin Core codebase. To be clear, there’s no magical line separating each stage, and this funnel concept is only an analogy. In fact, some developers like Larry Ruane entered the funnel at an intermediate stage. Ruane is a Bitcoin Core developer on a full-time Brink grant. He graduated with a master of science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois.  “When I first heard of Bitcoin in 2013, I was mostly fascinated by the trustless consensus mechanism. I didn't think such a thing was possible, especially so simply,"" Ruane said.  Ruane had already worked on consensus protocols like Paxos, but something about Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus was alluring to him. In fact, he went on a brief foray into hobbyist bitcoin mining before getting hired to work on Zcash.  “I got a job at the Electric Coin Company, creators of Zcash, which is a code fork of Bitcoin Core. I happened to find a minor bug in Zcash and discovered it also existed ‘upstream.’ So I opened my first Bitcoin Core pull request to fix the bug. It merged quickly, so I assumed it was pretty easy to get changes into Bitcoin Core. (This belief was naive.),” Ruane said.  That pull request triggered a flywheel effect. Ruane gradually increased his contributions until Brink awarded him a small grant to work on Bitcoin Core one 10-hour day a week.  “I proposed to help with pull request review because that's a critical need right now. It also helps to show your enthusiasm and dedication. You're much more likely to succeed if you've already put in the effort and built a reputation,"" he said.  After proving himself and paying it forward, he was awarded a full-time grant. I got the sense that Brink's grant application process is both challenging and competitive, so I asked Ruane what made his grant application stand out.  “I was lucky to have help from more experienced developers. I revised my application many times. I think it helps to be as specific as possible and to emphasize how your work will advance Bitcoin,"" he said.  Funding Bitcoin development  Brink’s fellowship and grant programs are 100% donor funded. Donors range from large crypto exchanges like Coinbase to smaller startups like BtcTurk. Brink isn’t the only player in the Bitcoin funding network, and Schmidt was quick to point out how diverse that network is.  “There's Chaincode [Labs] that employs a bunch of Bitcoin developers. They’re in New York, and they have a nice office up there. There's Blockstream that has a bunch of folks specializing in crypto. So ‘crypto’ meaning cryptography. They fund a lot of the cryptographers and mathematicians doing research and development in the space.”  Those funding efforts are global in scale. Schmidt gave the example of Qala, a Bitcoin funding program supporting the next wave of Bitcoin and Lightning developers in Africa. Qala is funded by some of the same organizations that donate to Brink. In fact, prior to the current bear market, many companies in the sector were increasing their funding activities.  “A lot of exchanges are trying to spin up or have spun up their own developer funding divisions, the first of which is BitMEX. They’ve funded different developers over the years, and they do all of that in-house. There’s someone there whose job is to vet applications and go through them to make sure the right people are getting funded,"" Schmidt said.  Back in 2020, Coinbase started its Crypto Community Fund with the initial goal of funding Bitcoin Core development. Gemini recently announced Superlunar, which provides grants and sponsorships to contributors in the market.  The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) has donated over $750,000 to more than 20 Bitcoin-related projects via its Bitcoin Development Fund. HRF’s vision is to promote the use of Bitcoin as a financial tool for human rights activists.  “It's a much richer landscape than it has been in years past, which is good, but there's still a lot to do,"" Schmidt said.  Read more: Human Rights Foundation Gives Out $210K in Bitcoin Development Grants  Career advice from a Bitcoin Core developer  Stallman famously said: “Free software is a matter of freedom, not price.” That’s my favorite Stallman quote. I bring up that quote because I sensed a similar ethos when I asked Ruane for his advice to aspiring developers.  “The most important piece of advice I have is to first look inward,” he said.

42422819,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0q2Vh,1656698400,"Good Time to Buy Crypto Mining Stocks, Says DA Davidson as It Slashes Hashrate Forecasts","D.A. Davidson sees a buying opportunity in the current crisis among crypto miners, according to a Friday research note from the investment bank.  Crypto mining stocks have lost about half of their value in the past month because a major fall in the price of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) has slashed their profit margins.  Access to capital is ""all but gone,"" such that Davidson senior research analyst Christopher Brendler slashed hashrate expectations to only include ""current, funded orders"" of mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), in his note. Most publicly listed miners cash is made up of ""hodled"" bitcoin, i.e., crypto they mine and hold on their balance sheets, such that many have seen their treasuries dwindle along with profitability, according to Davidson.  As a result, miners have started selling off their bitcoin holdings to keep their operations going and service their debt. Expansion plans have been put on hold and ""dozens of miners are already missing payments on previous rig orders and stand to lose huge deposits,"" Brendler wrote.  But markets have overpriced these risks, and mining stocks are ""actually super attractive,"" said the analyst, outlining several reasons for optimism in the upcoming quarter. ""Even after crushing earnings estimates, there is still more than 100% [upside potential] to our new (much lower) price targets (based on ~5x 2023 EBITDA),"" he wrote.  As smaller miners without economies of scale are unable to keep their operations going, competition on the network is dropping, which in turn lowers the cost of mining bitcoin and protects gross margins. A major drop in the price of ASICs could mean that manufacturers are more lenient with payments and that fears of ""broken orders"" turn out to be overblown.  Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest publicly listed miners, is the only firm analyzed by D.A. Davidson that could still struggle to pay for its orders. The investment bank had named the firm its top mining pick for 2022. Earlier this week, MARA said a June 11 storm left its facility in Hardin, Montana, without power, which is likely to be a blow to its monthly hashrate.  Compared to a June 6 note, D.A. Davidson increased its 2022 upside expectations for Core Scientific (CORZ) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) to 355% and 189%, respectively, and decreased its forecast for Marathon, Hut 8 (HUT), Argo Blockchain (ARBK) and Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) to 228%, 175%, 121% and 81%, respectively.

42394530,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAW0B,1656697797,How to Connect MetaMask to the Polygon Network,"If you’re just getting started with a MetaMask wallet, you may not realize that you can connect it with many other blockchains beyond Ethereum.  Read more: How to Set Up a MetaMask Wallet  MetaMask can be used with most decentralized applications (dapps) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), including the Polygon network, a layer 2 scaling product that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies with lower fees. To use Polygon with MetaMask, follow the quick and easy steps below.  One thing to note is that the Polygon network was formerly called the Matic network and matic is still the name of the network's native token.  Steps to connect MetaMask to Polygon  1. Open and log in to your MetaMask wallet  2. From the account options, which is a circle icon, go to “Settings.”  3. Once you are in settings, select “Networks.”  4. Press the “Add Network” button.  5. You will be taken to a new screen. This is the most important step because this is where you will add the information to connect to the Polygon network.  Input the following new information and press save:  Network Name: Polygon  New RPC URL (Choose one of the following):  https://polygon-rpc.com  https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network  https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com  https://rpc-mainnet.matic.quiknode.pro  ChainID: 137  Symbol: MATIC  Block Explorer URL: https://polygonscan.com  6. Upon adding that information, you will be brought back to the wallet screen. There are two signs that the Polygon network was added to your MetaMask wallet. The two red boxes shown in the screenshot below confirm it. The first box above shows the MATIC token standard, and the bottom right shows “Polygon was successfully added.""  7. To deposit MATIC into your wallet, you need to obtain your wallet address by clicking on it. You can then send MATIC to your wallet.

42421515,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWK5,1656697446,From One to Zero: BlockFi’s Fire Sale Shows the Uber Startup Model Is Disastrous for Finance,"Crypto-lender (read: unlicensed bank) BlockFi has announced a deal with Sam Bankman-Freid's FTX that could lead to a sale at a price of $240m or less. That would be a serious drawdown from the $1.3 billion in capital poured into the company since 2019, but far better than rumors and reports suggesting much lower bids.  BlockFi’s fate, while not great, still looks better than that of other centralized crypto lenders, including Celsius and Babel Finance, which also garnered hundreds of millions from investors. BlockFi depositors at least seem likely to get a lot of their money back, while Celsius and others seem truly insolvent. Though it’s not obvious, this group also includes Anchor, which masqueraded as a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on the Terra blockchain but was in reality clearly managed by a close group of backers, and has already wiped out depositors.  So where did all that investor money go?  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  One to zero: Notes on startups, or how to set VC money on fire  Investments in crypto lenders went into at least two gigantic holes in the ground.  On the one hand, these lenders all seem to have engaged in some degree of reckless investing in pursuit of the high yields they promised depositors. That led them to take big swings on garbage like LUNA, Terra’s native asset, and BadgerDAO, an Ethereum-based protocol to lend bitcoin (BTC).  Some also bet on stETH, a derivative of ETH that pays staking rewards, and the Grayscale BTC Trust, a massive institutional vehicle for BTC exposure (operated by CoinDesk’s sister company). Those are reputable assets, but they're currently illiquid and wound up leaving temporary but large holes in lenders’ balance sheets. (One reason BlockFi has survived is that, according to CEO and founder Zach Prince, it avoided most of these traps.)  But another tranche of investors’ capital went not to risky bets, but directly towards funding yields that were being paid to depositors. This was explained by investors themselves as a deficit-spending customer acquisition strategy that would, in the future, translate into real revenue.  See also: Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi Is Still Optimistic in the Crypto Bear Market | The Node  That’s a page ripped directly from the Silicon Valley playbook that gave rise to Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook, now Meta (FB). It was articulated as a philosophy by Peter Thiel in his book “Zero to One,” which broadly argues that startups should spend enough on early-stage growth to strangle the competition, essentially creating their own monopolies.  The success of Amazon and Facebook in particular turned the monopolistic playbook into Silicon Valley gospel. But after a first wave of genuine successes it began to falter, spawning eternally unprofitable zombie companies like Uber and more than a few absolute money-burning catastrophes like WeWork. For a time these amounted to a “millennial lifestyle subsidy” as consumers enjoyed rides or rentals at prices below their actual cost and VCs covered the difference out of (misguided) faith that it would all work out in the end.  But the infection of finance by the deficit-customer-acquisition mind virus may be its most dangerous and misguided iteration. It is a fundamentally nonsensical, and arguably fundamentally fraudulent, approach to growing a banking or lending business. The blowups we’re seeing now are far less a condemnation of crypto than of this outdated and misapplied Thiel growth playbook.  Fake friends get fake yields  How do we know investor funds were subsidizing depositor yields on Celsius and other platforms? In part, it’s simple math: Demand for deposit yield entirely outstripped demand for expensive institutional crypto loans, so the lenders in aggregate could not have actually been generating all the yield they were paying out to depositors from their loan books.  Further, while we don’t have direct visibility into Celsius or BlockFi’s spending, we do know the flows of the most elaborately obfuscated of the fake crypto banks: Anchor.  Some will immediately object that Anchor doesn’t belong in this category. But while it nominally ran on a public blockchain, it was in no sense a “real” DeFi protocol. This was obvious well before Terra’s collapse. While DeFi protocols like Aave adjust deposit returns based on real loan demand, entities in the Terra ecosystem had to repeatedly refill the “yield reserve” that was paying out artificially high depositor yields on Anchor. A backstop was necessary because Anchor wasn’t endogenously generating enough yield from loans to meet its obligations to depositors.  This was explicitly acknowledged to be a temporary fix, with the promise that “real” yields would eventually arrive – much as Uber has continued to promise real profits someday. Though not framed in these terms, it was the functional equivalent of Uber selling rides for less than they actually cost and making up the difference with investor money.  LUNA and the UST stablecoin grew so large almost entirely because of the ~20% interest being paid on deposits made to Anchor using the UST stablecoin. These subsidized returns meant Terra was, in practice, a technologically obfuscated Ponzi scheme.  Boiling frogs at 100 degrees Celsius  Whatever the legal niceties, the same argument could be made about the functional reality of Celsius and its ilk. These cases may even highlight certain “Ponzinomic” elements of venture investing as a whole, particularly the ability of early-stage investors to continue propping up the book value of their own positions in subsequent rounds. As with Anchor, as long as a VC can continue subsidizing money-losing customer acquisition, a company can trumpet growth and promise profitability down the road.  But even on its face this is simply a disastrous model for finance because unlike technology revenues and profits, investment yields don’t scale. In fact, they do the opposite of scale: The larger a hedge fund gets, for instance, the harder it is to continue delivering the same percentage returns it did with less money under management.  See also: The Case for Suing Celsius, Terraform Labs | The Node  Whether you’re investing in crypto or tech stocks, this often becomes a kind of risk trap. When people keep throwing cash at you, you have to search harder and harder for investment opportunities that will match your past performance. Those later bets, almost inevitably, either provide lower returns or present higher risks. This was the precise dynamic that played out with Celsius in particular: BadgerDAO is to Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky as Twist Bioscience (a speculative medical bet) is to ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood.  One to zero  Another reason the Thiel model simply makes no sense for retail finance is that it is structurally impossible to build the kind of “moat” that can, at the very least, keep a crappy business like Uber limping along. A huge element of finance, certainly for retail depositors but also more generally, is that you want your deposits to be as liquid as possible. To attract deposits in the first place, customers must be convinced it will be easy to withdraw … and potentially deposit their money elsewhere. This makes banking a fundamentally very, very tough business to monopolize in even a marginally free market.  Finally, loss-led customer acquisition is nonsensical in finance simply because there’s no such thing as free money. Yields that are artificially inflated to attract customers will inevitably be forced to align with macro trends over time, and the customers will simply leave. One part of what made Celsius and Anchor functionally scams (whatever the legal conclusions wind up being) is that their outsized returns were premised on the idea that crypto somehow magically generated more yield than normal money, and would indefinitely.  That was always absurd – the past few weeks have just made it painfully obvious.

42422820,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0q2Zh,1656694602,Brutal Month for Bitcoin as June Ends With Biggest Drop in 11 Years,"Bitcoin (BTC) slumped over 37.3% in June – the biggest monthly price drop since 2011, in an epic market sell-off that triggered job cuts across the crypto industry and forced many lenders, including Celsius, to halt withdrawals and scramble to line up financial lifelines.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ended the month at $19,925.  “This was one of the worst quarters on record pretty much everywhere across the equity market, across the bond market, across a lot of different places,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset manager Arca Funds.  Investor fears over steep U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes were a key catalyst in bitcoin’s price plunge as the Labor Department on June 10 released a report on the consumer price index (CPI), the most widely tracked benchmark for inflation. The CPI showed that inflation rose 8.6% on a year-over-year basis in May, the fastest in four decades.  On June 13, bitcoin saw its biggest single-day drop since March 2020, falling 16% to $21,910. Two days later, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 75 basis points, or three-quarters of a percentage point – three times the Fed's more typical increment in recent years.  Bitcoin mostly maintained a $20,000 price level through the remainder of the month but dipped this week to around $19,000 after the Fed renewed inflation warnings.  Bitcoin breakdown?  BitBull Capital, a crypto fund management company, anticipated a bitcoin breakdown in June with $17,000 to $19,000 as an important price range, noting that the cryptocurrency also struggled in June and July of 2021. The crypto fund expects the token’s stability to be retested in the coming weeks.  “A successful retest appears likely at this time and could set the base for a gradual recovery spread over a few months,” BitBull CEO Joe DiPasquale told CoinDesk in an email. “A breakdown from this range could see bitcoin trading between $13,000 to $15,000 and could send the market into a spiral that may require a longer period of time for recovery.”  According to data from CryptoCompare, total crypto fund assets under management (AUM) fell 37% during the month to $21.6 billion. Bitcoin funds' AUM fell 34% to $15.9 billion and saw average weekly net outflows reach an all-time high average of $188 million in June. (The data goes through June 23.)  “I think we're definitely closer to the end of that liquidation cycle,” Dorman said. “Those still left in this industry seem to have healthier balance sheets. The lending and borrowing and leverage is lower. Most funds you talk to are 50% cash, so I think the leveraged washout is probably coming to an end.”  Some analysts, such as Joe Orsini, chartered financial analyst and director of research at Eaglebrook Advisors, are optimistic that bitcoin will eventually rebound.  “These are growing pains,” Orsini said. “Ultimately, we look back at history and it's experienced a number of drawdowns, but each and every time it has resulted in new highs. So history doesn't often repeat itself, but it often rhymes, right?”  Most altcoins ended the month in the red despite occasional gains.  For example, Polygon’s MATIC token surged 25% in the 24 hours after its development team expanded private voting in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) with Polygon ID, but still saw over a 20% drop over the course of the month.  Crypto lender Celsius’s CEL token faced a steep decline in mid-June, falling over 50% within hours of announcing that it was halting withdrawals amid “extreme market conditions.” The token saw an intraday spike on June 21 in a supposed short squeeze that boosted its value eight-fold, but CEL is now trading closer to its early-June levels, ending the month down 24% from June 1.  CoinFLEX’s FLEX token saw a similar pattern after the crypto derivatives exchange paused withdrawals on June 23. FLEX dipped over 65% in 24 hours. As of June 30, CoinFLEX has yet to resume withdrawals, its token price down nearly 40% in June.  Dorman criticized centralized finance exchanges (CeFi) including Celsius and CoinFLEX and said that investor confidence should be gone from those institutions.  “The story should be about the DeFi platforms that have worked in service to their customers admirably and without issue, while their CeFi counterparts like Celsius have blown up,” Dorman said.

42421508,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWEv,1656691890,DAOs Are the New Way of Impact Work,"The Web3 community is, at heart, rooted in profound optimism. The increasing ubiquity of this technology makes it possible to envision a world where everyone is equipped to both survive and thrive.  Essentially, Web3 has become a Schelling Point for the hopeful.  This makes our corner of the internet especially important in a world where it’s easy to be rightfully cynical about failing institutions, crumbling infrastructure, privacy violations and climate disaster. At times it can even feel like we live in a divided world where it isn’t clear who the “good guys” are anymore.  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  While Web3 can’t solve these problems overnight, I truly believe we have more tools than ever before to address the most pressing coordination problems we face today. Collaborative, internet-native organizations like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) especially offer shared narratives (memes), economic incentives (money) and more flexible local governance structures (management) to move us in the right direction.  Impact DAOs are at the forefront of this trend towards a new culture of work that asks us to move towards aligning our values with our actions, and away from so-called bulls**t jobs (one that even the person doing it secretly believes need not, or should not, exist). In this sense, despite cries to the contrary, Web3 is an antidote to an increasingly abstract economy and, through a sense of play and absurdism, gives us a chance to more directly sign meaning into every block in which we take part.  Many of the DAOs driving these changes, like Gitcoin, are focused not just on their own mission but on forming polycentric “impact networks” – networks that collectively produce positive externalities for those around them. With this in mind, programs like Gitcoin Grants have been able to help seed everything from core infrastructure like ethers.js to scaling systems like Optimism, to widely used applications like Uniswap. And because of the composability of Web3, the success of these projects allows us all to build more shared infrastructure together.  Shared narratives and impact  To keep these networks alive, however, requires new ways of thinking about what it means to work together when we’re often so far apart, sometimes just relating as avatars on a screen. Specifically, it requires deep thought around how we can stay aligned with each other and construct non-standard ways of governing ourselves (self-organizing) at scale.  Alignment is fundamentally about our ability to connect deeply with each other in smaller groups, squads or as many now call them, pods. It’s our ability to find connection and belonging. And if social media has taught us anything, it’s that alignment is extremely hard to scale past Dunbar’s number (our natural cognitive limit on how many people we can get to know).  Everyone reading this has almost certainly been part of group chats that stick together by continuously sharing memes and building the empathy required to see each other as 3D humans. But as groups scale from 15 to 150 to even 15,000 members, the vibes may not as our ability to connect with each other diminishes. This has been a major challenge for the DAOs-as-social-clubs model popularized by Friends With Benefits (FWB).  Shared stories and lore, especially when built around making an impact, help us keep that alignment together over a longer period of time. Of course, this isn’t new to Web3 – every society has its own set of narratives to help us manage our collective memory; to stay on the same page, moving in the same direction. In Web3, we’re able to take this even further, creating incentives that allow us to keep working towards a common goal; to keep playing positive-sum, infinite games together without getting caught in endless bureaucracy. By using shared currencies that align to our values we’re much more likely to play these games over long periods of time just for the sake of playing – for the sake of making an impact.  Governing the generative commons  But DAOs, like any organization, still require structure – shared agreements that act as glue holding us together, even when we don’t align.  Crucially, structure is not hierarchy, but an often clumsy negotiation towards a formally inclusive way of holding space together. Movements like Occupy Wall Street are great examples of why this is so necessary. The simplicity of “We are the 99%” was a powerful cry that united people across differences, but couldn’t survive the pressure from incumbent powers without clear structure and accountabilities.  At Gitcoin, we think a lot about regenerative structures that start with looking after our own local shared needs. To do this effectively, we’ve based a lot of our thinking in the DAO off of Ostrom’s eight principles:  Set clear boundaries between community and resources.  Define rules locally, alongside immediate stakeholders.  Put forward clear participatory procedures for updating rules.  Create accountability once rules have been set.  Apply *graduated* social sanctions for conflict resolution.  Ensure conflict resolution is informal, accessible, and low cost.  If needed, ensure your rules are unimpeded by higher regional authorities.  Continue nesting rules this way until everyone is in alignment.  In short, Ostrom pushed back on the idea of the tragedy of the commons – that communities would naturally tend to over-consume and underinvest in scarce resources, eventually depleting their shared needs. By making lots of small agreements that work locally and scaling slowly, it would be possible to actually keep resources in check and keep an ecosystem sustainable.  In a DAO, the tragedy of the commons plays out in less intuitive ways, when leaders don’t share context for those that come after them, or when time gets eaten up by bikeshedding. But through shared principles, agreements, and creative constraints, DAOs can become fundamentally generative and set the initial conditions for sprawling, open environments. Unlike in traditional corporate structures these kinds of mycelial networks form without bureaucracy, leaving contributors open to reclaim their agency and self-organize. Notably, no DAO is perfect, and as in any organization documentation is critical. Investor Linda Xie, one of our most active stewards, has done a great job of outlining some of the evolving processes we’ve been thinking about.  The best part about this emerging future of work is that all of these questions are still open for anyone to answer. In Web3, there are no “experts.” No one knows where Web3 will go, but we all found our way here.  Find your squad, join a DAO and make an impact. Let’s make a future of work worth writing about.

42422817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0q2Rh,1656690946,Crypto World Is Cautious of Finer Details In EU's MiCA Law,"Crypto industry figures welcomed, for the most part, the European Union’s (EU) landmark crypto law, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, agreed upon late Thursday. But the picture is more complicated when looking at the details, such as how the legislation treats particular digital assets.  The framework dedicates sizable sections to rules restricting the issuance and proliferation of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies tethered to the value of real assets like the U.S. dollar or the euro.  The rules, intended to offer regulatory certainty to the growing industry, still have many scratching their heads over paradoxes – such as whether a non-fungible token (NFT) can become fungible and interchangeable with other identical assets in the same way as securities.  For some, the immediate reaction to the announcement of a deal was relief that the nearly two years of haggling was finally over. Lawmaker Aurore Lalucq celebrated the milestone with a tweet citing Disney’s song “Let It Go” (in French, known as “Freed! Released!”).  Others jumped straight to the substance of a law that represents a significant first for such a large jurisdiction.  “This landmark regulation will put an end to the crypto wild west and confirms the EU’s role as a standard setter for digital topics,” said France Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in an emailed statement. Le Maire was responsible for chairing intergovernmental talks on the law for the last six months.  On the map  In the crypto community, many appear to agree with at least the latter part of Le Maire’s sentiment.  “This framework has helped put the region on the map as an early and important leader in defining the regulatory environment. It will shape the digital asset ecosystem for years to come,” said Sheila Warren of the Crypto Council for Innovation in an emailed statement.  The analogy is often made with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), setting out what companies can do with personal information. It has not always been popular, and at least initially meant some U.S. websites had to block their content in Europe – but proponents argue it gave the EU big influence over how to protect online privacy worldwide.  Plus, Warren said, the new crypto law mostly avoids stifling innovation – and indeed may prove a net positive.  “Legal and regulatory certainty for the market will enable more crypto firms to invest and innovate across the region,” she said. “It is an encouraging development.”  Marina Markezic, a founder and executive director of lobby group the European Crypto Initiative, said the deal was an “achievement” that will make life easier for companies.  “This is very good for the whole EU market in general just to have a unified regulation,” she told CoinDesk. “Until now, every different [EU] member state has their own regulation, or they didn't have anything, so it was very hard for different companies and projects to be present and offer their services in the whole market.”  As to how the negotiations finally panned out, “the worst case scenario didn't happen,” she said. She points to an attempt to limit the energy-intensive proof-of-work mining that, in the end, never came to pass.  NFTs  Pending a final text, she also thinks she’s happy with the result on NFTs – previously a major area of concern.  “NFTs are excluded, and they are also defined in a way that more or less defines the actual facts of how NFTs do function in the industry,” Markezic said.  Lawmakers were keen to ensure the rapidly-evolving NFT market was included in the law, as regulation could offer guarantees for buyers and sellers who often get on the wrong end of manipulative pricing practices. Yet, not all are quite so happy with the final result.  Read more: Proposal Limiting Proof-of-Work Is Rejected in EU Parliament Committee Vote  Lobby group Blockchain for Europe shares the enthusiasm for the legal certainty the new law brings. CEO Robert Kopitsch said rules for crypto asset service providers such as exchanges and wallets are “savvy,” and that the law will let decentralized finance (DeFi) prosper.  But, he added, it’s “overall a mixed bag, and we are still out there to count the casualties.”  Meanwhile, conventional investment banks, a heavily regulated sector that doesn’t want to get undercut by more lightly overseen crypto firms, also seem to appreciate the balance struck.  Read more: EU Agrees on Landmark Crypto Authorization Law, MiCA  “AFME welcomes the pragmatic approach taken to include decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and non-fungible tokens (NFT),” James Kemp, managing director at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, said in an emailed statement.  Excluding NFTs altogether, or the DAOs that often underpin decentralized finance, could have harmed investors and financial stability, AFME argued.  Confusion  In part the mixed response is due to confusion over exactly what the law says: No text is yet available.  In principle, the law excludes NFTs – but in practice, a French finance ministry source told CoinDesk, only as long as they do what they promise.  “If a non-fungible token becomes fungible, then it will fall into” either MiCA, or other EU laws governing conventional financial instruments, said the source, who asked not to be named. In reality, another source has told CoinDesk, last-minute drafting changes may mean that the law may apply to any NFT that is part of a series and able to be divided up – or “fractionable,” in legal jargon.  That kind of NFT might be most concerning to policymakers because it most resembles regulated securities, but the wording has raised alarm.  “If this is the final draft, and the word ‘fractionable’ is used, that is a concern because from the technical point of view most of the NFTs are fractionable,” said Markeciz. “Maybe the word ‘fractionalized’ would be better.”  If it implies the law extends to cover all collectibles, that would be a “sheer joke,” Kopitsch said, with creators having to prepare multiple white papers informing buyers about their artworks.  Stablecoins  Another major focus of the bill is stablecoins – with rules intended to ensure good governance and financial stability that were originally a response to Facebook’s now-aborted Libra project, and gained still more momentum after the dramatic collapse of the terraUSD algorithmic stablecoin.  One of the most eye-catching measures would be a cap, which means stablecoins that aren’t tied to a single fiat currency would have to stop issuing if daily transactions exceed 200 million euros ($209 million) – intended to stop private companies usurping the role of the euro.  For some, like Kene Ezeji-Okoye, CEO of U.K.-based stablecoin issuer Millicent, that’s an “arbitrary restriction,” and an example of the law discriminating against a means of payment because of the technology it uses.  “Given that the top four stablecoins in the market currently significantly exceed this volume, this could be a barrier to stablecoins becoming widespread in the EU, which would be a shame given their many benefits of other means of transacting,” he said.  Markezic also noted that, in practice, it will be impossible for decentralized stablecoins – those that don’t have a single identifiable issuer – to comply with the rules that in practice oblige a central entity to take charge. Decentralized stablecoin DAI is the fourth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.  Other restrictions in the law, like ban on interest payments for users, and heavy restrictions on how reserves can be invested, have led some to ask if there will ever be an incentive for stablecoin issuers, and the DeFi ecosystem they bring with them, to set up in Europe at all.  U.S. companies are already taking advantage by issuing stablecoins in the EU’s own currency, the euro, French crypto lobbyists ADAN noted, in a likely reference to recent announcements by USD coin issuer Circle. The advocacy group warned that more complex and rigid legislation would only make that situation worse.  Read more: Biden Official Says US Government Could Pass Stablecoin Rules by End of Year  Heated  To strike the provisional deal, governments, grouped in the Council of the EU, had to agree on a text jointly with the European Parliament.  The final session talks where they did so ran on for nearly seven hours, culminating in head-to-head private discussions between lead negotiators Philippe Léglise-Costa, a French diplomat representing the Council, and Irene Tinagli, the Italian lawmaker who chairs the parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.  Talks concluded just a few hours before France would have had to cede control to the Czech Republic, which took over chairmanship of the Council as of July 1.  One of the most heated issues in those final talks appears to have been on whether national regulators, or EU agencies responsible for banking or securities markets should get to supervise crypto firms. The dispute over which agency gets supervisory authority is mirrored in the U.S. between the U.S. Securities and Exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commissions. But such squabbles over territory may not be such a big deal from the industry’s perspective, Markezic said.  “It's less substantive” than other issues on her radar, she said. “What matters to the European community is that there is going to be a unified way of how they're going to be reviewed by the regulators,” and that those regulators have the right crypto expertise.  Read more: No AML Checks For Most Transfers To Unhosted Crypto Wallets, EU Policymakers Decide  The agreement caps a big week for crypto in the EU, hot on the heels of a deal to impose anti-money laundering rules on the sector. The EU’s intent will be that, with the package of two laws in hand, it can set itself out as a natural home for sound crypto businesses.  Others may look at the many near misses during the talks – which at times came dangerously close to restricting bitcoin (BTC) mining, attempting to centralize DeFi, and imposing identity checks on self-hosted crypto wallets – and ask if that’s the kind of regulatory certainty the industry needs.

Hxro’s “alpha sandbox” won’t put traders’ real money at risk, co-founder Dan Gunsberg told CoinDesk. That’s because the contract collateral is UXDC (a play on USDC and Hxro), a valueless, simulated stablecoin Hxro minted to stress test the network before public launch.  The test phase moves Hxro one step closer to bringing its institutional-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives hub to full operation. Quant trading firm Susquehanna International Group, Alameda, Jump and the Chicago Trading Company are among Hxro’s funders and participants assisting with core functions, such as market making.  Gunsberg said Hxro aims to become a hub for derivatives trading atop the Solana blockchain. “What we as a network are really focusing on is bringing in applications to build on top of the network and all of the liquidity from each of those networks will bottom out into” Hxro.  Staging a derivatives platform atop Solana (or any blockchain, really) means full transparency into each trade and trader, Gunsberg said. That can benefit the entire market by making clear as code who is taking on inappropriate risks, he said.  “Likely one of the causes of the issues that we're dealing with now in the marketplace is a lot of risks ended up being managed almost by relationship, where you looked at a firm like Three Arrows Capital, and made assumptions about them without actually doing the level of due diligence that needed to be done,” Gunsberg noted.

42421519,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoWM9,1656686914,LTCM and Other History Lessons for Crypto,"As the dominoes fall (or wobble) in the wave of financial contagion sweeping the crypto industry, one of the starkest lessons is that no matter the potential of a new technology, you can’t beat the leverage cycle.  It’s a lesson investors in traditional finance have repeatedly had to learn and relearn over the past 25 years as digital tech and data science worked their way into Wall Street and periodically fueled moments of excessive debt-fueled speculation.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  One pattern seen in various blowups – from Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998, to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, to the financial crisis of 2008 – is that enthusiasm for the promises of new technologies can create a distorted mindset that unreasonably diminishes the investment risks.  In each case, the lesson was not that technologies offered zero benefits – ultimately, the related innovations invariably added tangible benefits to the economy and markets – but that they fed a delusional “this time is different” mindset to stoke unsustainable, debt-driven speculation. As credit bubbles grew, profiteers emerged and encouraged a “magical solution” narrative to entice late-arrival investors – both retail and institutions – into their projects, ultimately saddling them with the bill when the crash ensued.  One message here goes to policymakers: regulate human behavior, not technology. But my point is not to weigh in again on what regulators should or shouldn’t do. It’s to encourage historical awareness among crypto enthusiasts.  We need to recognize that, while we can devise clever ways to disintermediate gatekeepers and automate certain market functions, we remain vulnerable to the cycle of greed and fear. We should figure out how to mitigate those human elements while enabling the technology to safely and steadily advance.  The LTCM crisis and its descendents  Gen Z and Millennial investors who dominate the crypto community are too young to hold meaningful memories of events like the LTCM crisis.  But ask a Wall Street veteran, and they’ll take a big breath, utter an “Oh, boy,” and launch into a tale of great drama.  LTCM, which placed widespread highly leveraged bets on bond market arbitrage opportunities, was founded in 1994 by John Meriwether, the head of bond trading at legendary Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers. Its board of directors included Myron Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who in 1997 shared the Nobel prize in economics for having developed the Black-Scholes model for pricing financial options.  That scientific pedigree introduced a halo effect to LTCM. Investors became enamored with the sophisticated data analysis algorithm it employed to identify supposed price anomalies across assets that had a history of correlation. The fund would take opposing positions on either side of those identified situations, betting they would pay off when markets reverted to the mean.  Here’s just one famous LTCM strategy: The algorithm identified situations where the spread had widened between the yield on the most recently issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bond and that of an “off-the-run” bond, such as one issued a year earlier (essentially, a 29-year bond). Historically, investors pay a modest liquidity premium for “on-the-run” bonds (which means their yields are slightly lower than the off-the-runs) but, given that both investments represented the same “risk-free” exposure to the U.S. government, the idea was that the spread between the two shouldn’t deviate too far for too long. So, at times when the liquidity premium rose and the yield spread widened, the LTCM algorithm would place a short position (sell) against the on-the-run bond and a long position (buy) on the off-the-run. Historical mean reversion would do the rest.  For years it worked like a charm. LTCM returned 21%, 43% and 41% to its investors in its first three years, respectively, which encouraged even more investors, including the Street’s biggest institutions, to entrust their money with it. Supposedly validated, the fund doubled down, borrowing ever more money to widen the bets identified by its high-tech machine. Eventually LTCM had more than $140 billion in assets under management.  Then in 1998 the LTCM behemoth came crashing to earth, with widespread fallout across Wall Street. The cause: the Russian financial crisis, a byproduct of the preceding Asian financial crisis, when global panic led investors everywhere to sell everything and rush to all but the safest investments. This unique moment meant that, instead of narrowing, the yield spreads on which LTCM had bet went even wider.  All of sudden, tens of billions of leveraged trading strategies were way out of the money. As lenders came knocking, the fund was forced to unwind its positions, worsening market distortions and fueling systemic risk for all investors, even those without LTCM exposure.  In late September of that year, the Federal Reserve, worried that mass contagion would cripple financial markets and harm the wider economy, engineered a bailout in which 14 major institutions injected $3.6 billion of equity into LTCM, giving it a capital buffer to halt its forced selling. After markets calmed, the fund was later liquidated and unwound.  There were many lessons to take from this episode, but an important one was that even the most sophisticated technology and smartest data analysis can be destroyed in “Black Swan” moments when market-wide panic stalls the normal mean-reversion pattern. The strategies that LTCM employed are still used by many long-short hedge funds, but most now put limits on leverage and employ measures of systemic risk for early warning signs of when human fear or greed are getting out of whack.  But while LTCM offered a lesson on the relationship between innovation narratives and investor behavior, it turned out to be overly narrow. Around the time of the LTCM bailout, the dot-com boom took hold as stock market investors started betting that the “new economy” of the internet age would deliver much higher returns on capital. After peaking in late March 2000, gravity took over and the tech-heavy Nasdaq market collapsed. It would take 15 years for its composite index to return to those highs even though, by then, the rise of Amazon, Google, Facebook and others had fully validated the idea of the internet as a transformative technology.  It took less than a decade after the dot-com bubble’s bursting for another, even bigger blowup: the housing bubble. This one stemmed from the invention of credit default swaps (CDSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which unlocked bucket loads of cheap capital. The inflows were based on the false assumption that this combination of derivatives and structured finance had sufficiently spread the risk of individual defaults so ratings agencies would assign triple-A ratings to these top-tier portfolios of bundled mortgages.  Even Gen Zers and Millennials know what happened next. Underappreciated, though, is that the broad approach to bundling mortgages and spreading risk applied during the bubble continues to underpin the market for housing finance and enables broad home ownership in the U.S.  History as prologue  Each of these catastrophes contains parallels to the current crypto moment.  Though it’s not nearly on the same scale as LTCM, the widespread crypto institutional exposure to Three Arrows Capital’s collapse echoes that 1998 moment. The crypto hedge fund’s troubles have imposed big losses on firms such as Voyager Digital, BlockFi and now, Genesis, the latter of which is owned by the Digital Currency Group, also the parent of CoinDesk.  The hype that fueled the 1990s dot-com frenzy was every bit as feverish as the high-minded rhetoric of “decentralization” and “Web3” that helped fuel the speculative mindset among the broader crypto investor community and led to false promises of high yields by outfits such as failed lender/borrower Celsius.  The “quant” whizzes who created the CDSs and CDOs behind the 2008 financial crisis have been reincarnated as the inventors of decentralized finance (DeFi). The latter similarly generated misguided faith among investors in the risk-management powers of algorithmic projects such as Terraform Labs’ now defunct ecosystem of the UST stablecoin and LUNA investment token.  These antecedents are a reminder of how much harm can be done to mainstream investors swept up in the mania. But they also involve technologies that, despite the excesses they encouraged, proved valuable in the long run.  For crypto, we need to figure out how to mitigate the former but ensure the latter. There truly is promise in this industry’s technology. But it can’t magically put an end to risk.",NEUTRAL,LUNA,BUSINESS | LUNA | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Michael J.

Things aren’t looking good.  But those who have been in crypto for a while have seen it all before. Crypto’s extremely cyclical, characterized by bear and bull markets. In bull markets, like the one that started in late 2020 and ended in late 2021, prices can rise by double digits on a daily basis. During those times, it feels as if the market is destined to go only up. But in a bear market, prices may fall 90%, followed by another 90% and so on.  Although the previous crypto bear markets coincided with bullish sentiments in equities, now crypto is tightly correlated to a macro environment with a recession potentially on the horizon.  Opinion: Why This Crypto Crash Is Different  Should you panic? Should you double down on investments? As we enter the depths of the bear market, CoinDesk has asked survivors of the last bear market for tips on how to stay sane during downturns, decide and take the right courses of action and prepare for the next bull market. They were crypto newbies when they began, but today they are deeply embedded in crypto, participating as investors, developers and traders. Here’s what they had to say.  Take a profit  To HODL or not to HODL, that is the question.  In crypto, resistance to selling – holding or HODLing – despite a gloomy outlook is a widespread behavior. “Don’t risk your lifestyle because of a HODL meme. No one went broke taking a profit,” Tyler Reynolds, a Web3 investor, told CoinDesk. Taking a profit means selling a percentage of your gains. It doesn’t necessarily mean getting out of the market completely.  “For your sanity, you may be best off determining a portfolio-wide stop loss where you say you will sell everything if it gets below a certain amount,” he said. Most centralized crypto exchanges let users place a stop-loss order either in terms of a percentage drop (sell bitcoin (BTC) when it drops by X%) or a specific price (sell BTC at $X).  “Set sell targets/take profit levels in advance, at least loosely, and stick to them. Your objective self from the past is a better guide than your euphoric self in the future,” Cred, a pseudonymous trader, told CoinDesk. Cred has a free and comprehensive technical analysis course available on YouTube.  See Also: 4 Things to Do in a Crypto Bear Market  Avoid panic selling, but also avoid greed  Taking a profit, and perhaps having a strategy to exit the market completely, doesn’t mean panic selling.  “Avoid panic selling unless you're in the urgent need of money,” Fedor Linnik, builder of several NFT (non-fungible token) projects, said. And in retrospect, he said, “being greedy and being afraid to miss the top” was a mistake he made in 2018. Make your selling decisions based on data, not on emotion or on advice from social media.  Stay solvent  Most people who invested in crypto in late 2020 saw their portfolios at all-time highs in April or November 2021. But the fireworks are behind us.  “Don’t trade or invest with the mindset of ‘making back’ what you lost in the bull; it’s an inherently flawed comparison,” Cred said.  Although it may be tempting to try and “make it back in one trade” by entering highly risky trades, revenge trading can also easily backfire. Alex Svanevik, CEO of data analytics firm Nansen, said staying solvent is key in a bear market, and it helps if one didn’t “touch leverage.”  Leverage is a common tool in crypto markets, but resorting to leverage to buy coins in a falling market “has a much higher chance of ruin and will erode your mental capital,” Cred warned. “Even if you manage to get a good entry, the chances that you have the mental fortitude to hold a large position like that are significantly reduced.”  Research projects  Crypto is a place for innovation and experimentation. Many projects pop up, die, reinvent themselves, succeed or vanish from memory. Crypto projects often have tokens associated with them, and the tokens are often (but not necessarily) tied to the success of the projects, especially during the early days.  Reynolds said what worked for him during the last bear market was to keep investigating both new and old projects. “You will need to keep re-investigating as projects pivot from their original idea and find a much better product-market fit, like Aave,” he said. “I look for a core new mechanism that creates a better user experience and bet on multiple projects utilizing it.”  He explained that in this last bull cycle creation of peer-to-contract protocols was the core new mechanism. People who instead bet on peer-to-peer protocols mechanism “mostly lost.”  Peer-to-contract protocols include Uniswap, Aave, Trader Joe and many others. Although many peer-to-peer protocols like NFT swapping protocol Sudoswap have found a market fit, others like peer-to-peer payments protocol Dharma have acknowledged the failure of the model.  Nobody knows what the narratives of the next bull cycle will be. “But I expect the person that finds it and bets on protocols using it will do very well next cycle,” Reynolds said.  Get involved with projects  Passively researching projects isn’t the only option available to those interested in crypto.  Many crypto projects, especially those building in decentralized finance (DeFi), are structured as decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs. Anyone can join and participate, and as an added benefit, that can be a good way of getting a good job.  “Focus on building and contributing, understanding the core underpinnings of the ecosystem instead of whatever's hot that day,” blockchain developer Foobar said. Building and contributing help advance the industry, and there's a high premium on having an impact on the ecosystem. It helps you understand crypto better and also helps you build relationships.  Have an ape fund  “Aping” is a common activity in crypto. It refers to investing in project tokens without much due diligence simply because the tokens are new and shiny and could soon rise in value.  But aping is a strategy that is more likely to work in a bull market than in a bear one, Svanevik said. “Start spending time looking at data and reading up on projects instead of aping things mindlessly.”  Aping doesn’t have to be throwing money at whatever feels hot and is shilled by your favorite YouTube influencer. Perhaps a project that aligns with your long-term convictions will launch or appear on your radar and you will want to get in on the ground floor. “Have an ‘ape fund’, a modest portion of your portfolio, which you use to try new tech, new projects and so on,” suggests Cred. “The best performers of the next cycle probably don’t exist yet or are in their infancy.”  Be mindful of vesting schedules  If a project has existed for a long time, then it’s likely that its investors will be able to sell their tokens soon, if they haven’t done so already. Unlocks, as they are called, can happen anytime, including during a bear market. The sell pressure tends to push down the price.  “Be mindful of vesting schedules so you don’t get dumped on,” Svanevik said.  Build relationships  Smart contracts, protocols, front-running bots… It’s easy to forget there’s a human element in crypto, and it’s a tight-knit community that lives on crypto Twitter and frequently meets in conferences around the world.  Jason Choi, a crypto investor, joined the industry in the depths of the 2018 crypto bear market, and he said he spent almost “all the time building relationships, researching and creating content, which paid massive dividends down the road.” He said that during a bear market “there's a lot of self-selection in who chooses to double down their efforts in the industry, so it's often the best time to make lasting, meaningful relationships.”  During the last bull market, NFTs rose to prominence in crypto with their emphasis on community, and it’s a sector that didn’t exist during the last bear market. “Use the bear market time for networking. Especially now. Hanging out in a JPEG-based community is still more fun than it was in 2018-19 when there were mostly valueless tokens around,” Linnik said.  Keep your job  Think twice before quitting your job just to pursue your interest in crypto. If you have bills to pay, you may be better off sticking with a secure job, and your participation in crypto can be a side gig.  “If you have a job, keep it unless you’re absolutely certain that you’d be better off doing crypto full time. Especially if you want to be a trader, most people that think they need to be full time don’t actually need to be full time and end up overtrading,” Cred said.  Get a job in crypto  Maybe the point is to keep a job – but not necessarily your same old job. To accelerate your crypto journey and also earn an income in the meantime, consider getting a job in crypto.  Linnik, who saw his crypto portfolio value sharply decline, had to get a job in the last bear market. And it was a job with an NFT startup in 2018. “It failed in 2019, but we were prepared for the NFT boom in 2020,” he said.  Although some major companies such as crypto exchange Coinbase have gone as far as rescinding offers at the last minute, many are still hiring.  Read More: What It Takes to Get a Job in Crypto  Have a life outside crypto  Crypto is a 24/7 market. The industry often feels like a fast-moving Netflix show, and it’s so easy to get carried away and lose sight of other things in life.  “Have hobbies, friends outside of crypto and finance, read books and articles outside of crypto and finance,” Cred said.  But that’s also true for your investment portfolio. Foobar swears by the maxim, “Enough crypto to be happy if it goes up, and enough elsewhere to survive if it goes down.""

The company held $20.1 billion of commercial paper in May.  According to an update on Tether's website, it aims to bring the figure down to zero as it diversifies its holdings into U.S. Treasury bonds.  Commercial paper is short-term unsecured debt issued by companies. Its value depends on the companies that issue it. The quality of Tether's holdings has been the subject of speculation, calling into question how much backing the company can count on for USDT.  Last month, Tether denied it had any exposure to Three Arrows Capital, the hedge fund that was reported to be insolvent, sparking concern about its financial ties to other crypto companies.  In May, Tether published an attestation of holdings by independent accountants MHA Cayman. The report stated that Tether held $39.2 billion in Treasurys.  It also had $4.1 billion in bank deposits, $6.7 billion in money market funds and $3.1 billion in secured loans.  The market cap of Tether's USDT stablecoin has plunged to $66.1 billion from $82.2 billion since May due to an increasing amount of user redemptions following the collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST).  Hedge funds are placing short positions on Tether worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Tether Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino was quick to dismiss any concerns, labelling the report on hedge funds shorting USDT as spreading ""FUD"" (fear, uncertainty and doubt).",NEUTRAL,USDT,FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | USDT,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/tether-reduces-commercial-paper-holdings-almost-60-as-it-tackles-quality-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11216892ab77819bf4146ebda64315b9d68faaec-1496x1122.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to one report, the number of new DAO governance proposals, which codify a company's organizational and operational structure, has risen eightfold in the past year. In May 2021, only 700 DAOs were operational. Today there are more than 6,000.  Simon Yu the CEO and co-founder of StormX. This article is part of “Future of Work Week.”  Bringing DAOs into the mainstream is complicated, especially in a nascent crypto environment where people are often more committed to making a buck than building sustainable companies. Consequently, many brands and companies aren't in a position to fully decentralize their corporate structure, eliminate titles and put all decisions in the hands of a decentralized community of pseudonymous members.  Every company, however, can implement a hybrid DAO model that gives customers a greater voice, increasing engagement and putting brands in a position to thrive in a decentralized future.  Hybrid DAO models  DAOs offer a unique learning experience for brands preparing for the inevitable rise of the metaverse and other blockchain-based business elements. The main goal as always is to find realistic and durable ways to increase engagement from their consumer base.  For starters, customer engagement is critical to bottom-line outcomes. According to one customer engagement report, brands that invest in and elevate customer engagement saw increased revenue by 70%, a staggering sum that underscores the importance of developing communities and relationships.  Read more: What It’s Like to Work as a DAO Bounty Hunter  Meanwhile, customers with positive brand experiences are 50% more likely to try new products or pay premium prices. That’s why customer engagement is central to operational sustainability and revenue growth for successful companies.  A hybrid DAO model – where projects deploy a community-owned token – can enhance customer engagement by offering all stakeholders an opportunity to have a voice in a variety of decisions that enhance buy-in, inform better products and cultivate community.  This is all theoretically possible for brands without those brands having to completely overhaul their existing structures.  How brands can adapt  A hybrid DAO can take many forms. Ultimately, it’s about allowing customers to propose and vote on various product or service features.  For instance, brands can distribute a product road map poll, letting stakeholders weigh in on the most important feature enhancements and new capabilities. This delivers the voice of the customer directly to product development teams, which can simultaneously enhance customer sentiment and brand maturation.  Similarly, brands can embrace a DAO ethos by engaging stakeholders on:  Design updates: Product design is more than just a technical specification. It fosters an emotional and practical connection with buyers, so that customer insights can have a meaningful impact on future iterations.  Product look and feel updates: A product or platform’s look and feel affects engagement. Letting users give input adds significant audience input to these aesthetic choices.  Branding and logo changes: A company’s brand and logo strongly resonate with the most loyal customers. In addition to letting people vote on changes, consider soliciting special event or temporary logo submissions from the community and letting people vote on their favorite designs.  Event or festival programming: To ensure a company event or sponsored activity resonates with an audience, companies can solicit input on the artists, speakers, schedule and other program specifics.  Communities’ competitive advantage  When brands give customers more of a voice, they foster an avid following of loyal customers who are highly invested in the future of the brand/product because they are contributing to elements of decision making.  Simply put, insights into customer demands and desires help brands to be more successful in delivering what people actually want. Crowdsourcing ideas can lead to even stronger end results when it comes to changes to products, branding, design and more.  In other words, brands can benefit from the wisdom of the crowd.  Read more: How I Made It: From Pro Baller to Master of DAOs  Brands and companies that adopt a hybrid DAO model will create a shift from thinking of buyers as ""customers"" to thinking of them as team members and part of their community. This shift in brand mindset could have greater repercussions for business culture and structure than can be fully anticipated.  Ultimately, the rise of the metaverse and Web3 will favor brands that adopt this type of model over those that do not, making a hybrid DAO model a multifaceted competitive differentiator that can set brands apart from the competition both now and in the years ahead.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price Point: Even as BTC appears to stabilize, a flurry of new developments among the crypto firms wrecked by the market turmoil continues to unfold.  Market Moves: How much more deleveraging in the crypto market needs to happen? JPMorgan’s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou weighs in.  Price point  The fallout from this year's stunning plunge in cryptocurrency prices continues, even as bitcoin's price appeared to stabilize just below $20,000.  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading 1% up on the day, at around $19,100.  The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading down 7% over the last seven days and ether (ETH) is also down by 12% over the last seven days.  Futures tracking BTC and ETH racked up nearly $200 million in liquidations as volatility on Thursday saw prices break above and back below resistance levels.  The number of active crypto users among Bank of America (BAC) customers slumped more than 50% to fewer than 500,000 between November and May, according to a new report from the bank.  Over in Central America, El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele tweeted that the country bought 80 bitcoin at $19,000 each.  Meanwhile, there was a flurry of developments among crypto firms wrecked by the market turmoil, now looking to restructure their finances or searching for a lifeline from better-capitalized peers.  Celsius shareholder ""BnkToTheFuture"" proposed three recovery plans Thursday aimed at helping users affected by the insolvency of the crypto lender.  Crypto exchanges Blockchain.com and Deribit have said they are cooperating with ongoing investigations into Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Blockchain.com wrote in a report the hedge fund “defrauded the crypto industry.”  Su Zhu, the co-founder of 3AC, is looking to sell his house in Singapore, bought in December for $35 million.  Some analysts are comparing all of the pain to the 2008 financial crisis. Read down to Market Moves for more on that.  I also read an interesting, in-depth thread by TaschaLabs on how the next wave of crypto adoption will come from utility tokens of real-world companies. You can read it here.  Market moves  The wipeout of value in the latest downturn has been staggering for an industry that seemed to be firing on all cylinders as recently as last year. The current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $850 billion. In November 2021, the total market cap was nearly $3 trillion. This is a cumulative 70% drop so far since then.  The crypto market is now suffering from what some analysts are referring to as a credit crisis. This has exposed the fragile system of credit and leverage in crypto, increasingly compared to the 2008 Wall Street crash. It began with the collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin – supposed to be worth $1, good as cash. It's now becoming clear just how many centralized crypto lenders were offering unsustainable returns.  Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, cross-asset analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a LinkedIn post Friday that it's hard to tell how much more deleveraging still needs to happen in the market. Referring to the bank’s net leverage metric, which is based on futures, he wrote that it suggests deleveraging is already well advanced.  “Similar to the credit market deleveraging seen after the Lehman crisis [when the brokerage firm failed in 2008], the bottom in crypto markets is likely to take place before the failure rate among crypto companies peaks,” wrote Panigirtzoglou.  He said there are two additional reasons to believe the current deleveraging cycle would not very protracted: “1) the fact that crypto entities with the stronger balance sheets are currently stepping in to help contain contagion and 2) VC funding an important source of capital for the crypto ecosystem continued at a healthy pace in May and June.”  Latest headlines  Bank of America Customers’ Crypto Activity Slowed as Market Slid Almost 70% of the U.S. population has not invested in or is not interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, the bank said.  Celsius Shareholder BnkToTheFuture Proposes Bitcoin Investments, Restructuring in Rescue Bid Community investing protocol BnkToTheFuture put forth three proposals on Thursday night in a bid to save Celsius from going under.  Three Arrows Capital's Su Zhu Looks to Sell $35M Singapore House Zhu and his wife purchased the property late last year for S$48.8 million ($35 million) and now they are selling it in what analysts call a slowing market.  Singapore Central Bank Censures 3AC for Misleading and False Disclosures Three Arrows Capital also exceeded the threshold of assets it could manage in Singapore, according to the central bank.  Bitcoin, Ether Futures Rack up Nearly $200M in Liquidations on Short Squeeze Price volatility arose as signs of looming recessions were renewed among investors, one analyst said.  Blockchain.com, Deribit Among Creditors That Pushed for 3AC Liquidation: Report Blockchain.com has also said it is cooperating with ongoing investigations into the hedge fund, which ""defrauded the crypto industry.""

42394526,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bwAVkn,1656680450,What Are Crypto Screeners?,"Crypto screeners, just like stock screeners in the traditional stock market, are tools utilized by crypto investors and traders to enable them to enhance their trading decisions. It is a web interface that helps traders find an easier way to identify cryptocurrency trading opportunities.  In using crypto screeners you will have to set specific parameters such as market price, market cap, average daily trading volume or specific charting patterns. After setting the specific parameters, the crypto screener will filter out thousands of cryptocurrency projects and will show you which ones match what you seek.  See Also: 3 Indicators Beginner Crypto Traders Should Use, According to Pros  Examples of criteria for crypto screeners  Different crypto screeners use different approaches to generate results and rankings of cryptocurrencies. The following are the most frequently used search parameters:  Market capitalization – Total value of all cryptocurrency in the market  Volume – Amount of cryptocurrency being bought and sold within a period of time  Technical Patterns – Distinctive patterns that form on a chart that have specific price movements  Technical analysis – These include indicators such as MA crossovers and the RSI  How do I use crypto screeners?  Using a crypto screener is relatively easy as you toggle values for certain criteria.  To get started, you would select which criteria you are interested in filtering such as price, volume, circulating supply or many others. For instance, you can check whether you want to see coins with a specific market cap or volume or coins added to the exchange within a specific time frame.  If we look at the example below using CoinMarketCap, we are able to create a filter for cryptos that have a market capitalization between $1 billion and $2 billion.  Once you've entered your criteria, the site will show you all of the cryptocurrencies that meet the requirements you have entered. You can filter them by market cap and volume to see only highly liquid coins or sort them by price (ascending or descending).  Continuing with the example we stated above, we now have a list of cryptos with market capitalization between $1 billion and $2 billion:  Benefits of using crypto screeners  Let's look at the advantages of using a crypto screener before initiating a transaction.  Data-driven decisions  Crypto trading can be an emotional rollercoaster. To counter that, you can leverage crypto screeners to make decisions based on facts and data. By eliminating emotions, you can also eliminate biased decisions which can affect your return on investment.  For instance, let’s look at a common investing trap. You have seen people hyping ZXYZ crypto on Twitter and Facebook and you decide to buy, fueled by FOMO. Three days later, the price has plummeted as the chatter died down and people who bought early cashed out.  Time-saving  Imagine manually sifting through thousands of cryptos only to find only one crypto to your liking. There’s no point overwhelming yourself with data when you can simplify the search process. All crypto screeners allow you to input numerical ranges for different criteria as well as input minimum and maximum values to further narrow cryptos into a list, quickly and easily.  Real-time data updates  Crypto screeners update their prices and other criteria regularly. For example, if you wanted to find the top 5 cryptos with the largest price movement in the last seven days, screeners will have up-to-date info for that.  Some crypto screeners such as Coin360 provide a heatmap that tells you how the overall market is doing in a single glance. Some cryptocurrency screeners may even let you customize the display to include your portfolio and show you how your top holdings have performed in the previous 24 hours.  New investment opportunities  In addition to screeners with typical price and volatility features, crypto screeners may be used to rapidly discover coins and tokens that are generating charting patterns that may indicate an investment opportunity. For instance, you may recognize a bullish flag signaling a major breakout in a cryptocurrency’s chart and target that for further research to confirm the indicator and buy it.  Read more: 4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment  Popular crypto screeners  Here are five popular cryptocurrency screener tools to add to your arsenal:  CoinMarketCap  This is one of the most popular crypto screeners on the market. The site also has a news feed and other information about the top 100 cryptocurrencies. It is an excellent tool for finding cryptocurrency prices, market caps and the allocation of cryptocurrencies.  CoinGecko  CoinGecko is another great crypto screener to use when looking for information on your favorite cryptocurrencies. They have more than 1,500 coins listed on their site with price charts and other helpful information about each coin's trading volume and price changes over time.  Messari  Messari aims to provide up-to-date data. It's robust, giving you a complete view of all the data you need to make an informed decision in just one click. It also comes with several valuable features that make it easy to use, like its cryptocurrency directory which lets you see all of your holdings at once. There is also a subscription plan for advanced features such as screener customizations and real-time alerts.  DappRadar  DappRadar is another useful crypto screener because it has all of the same features as Messari, plus some extra ones that make it easier to keep track of your portfolio. For example, DappRadar lets you see how much each token is worth in U.S. dollars, bitcoin (BTC) or another denomination, making it easier for newcomers who are just getting started with cryptocurrencies. It is also really useful to see data on other digital assets including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 projects like decentralized apps (Dapps) and play-to-earn games.

Of course, FTX isn&apos;t looking to intervene in all distressed crypto firms, as &apos;some third-tier exchanges are already secretly insolvent,&apos; he told Forbes in an interview on June 29.

Furthermore, Bankman-Fried attributed bitcoin&apos;s (BTC-USD) recent slump to $30K to the Federal Reserve hiking interesting rates to bring down persistently high inflation.

Among the broader population, Bank of America found that sentiment toward cryptocurrencies soured between April and June as the market headed toward a record half-year loss. Surveys of 1,000 people showed 30% of those questioned in June hadn’t invested in crypto and had no plans to do so, up from 21% in April.  First-time users of crypto fell sharply. Only about 33,000 clients conducted a crypto transaction for the first time in May, down 87% from almost 267,000 last October, Bank of America said.  BofA’s data shows that flows into crypto platforms have tumbled as well, and are now broadly equal to flows out, indicating that consumers are pulling back their “net investment in crypto platforms,” it said.  For the one-third of customers who were conducting crypto transactions, the data shows they had only a single transaction, generally for a smaller amount. They account for only 5% of the dollar value of crypto transactions. A considerable 69% of customers who conducted crypto transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic are no longer active, the report added.  Almost 70% of the U.S. population hasn't invested in crypto or isn't interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, the note said, adding that it appears that many consumers haven't participated in crypto markets and if anything their “inclination toward doing so has waned” in recent months.

BnkToTheFuture is registered as an excluded securities business with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and holds 5% of Celsius. “We believe that this allows us to call a shareholder meeting as part of our statutory shareholder rights that legally cannot be ignored by the Celsius board,” it said in the Thursday post.  The first proposal calls for restructuring and relaunching Celsius, which would allow depositors to benefit from “any recovery through financial engineering.” This could refer to the issuance of additional tokens or additional fundraising.  The second proposal is to form a pool of the most influential holders of bitcoin (BTC) and have them “co-invest with the community” in a bid to raise significant amounts of capital for Celsius. BnkToTheFuture said it had handled the previous fundraising of over $20 million for Celsius that 1,039 investors participated in.  “We completed a similar disaster recovery offering for Bitfinex in 2016,” BnkToTheFuture explained. The effort saw over $76 million raised from investors to help the then beleaguered crypto exchange, which experienced a hack of 120,000 bitcoins at the time.  The third proposal is to “form an operational plan that allows a new entity and team to rebuild and make depositors whole.” That move, however, would involve “risks and full recovery of funds is not guaranteed,” BnkToTheFuture said.  A community vote for the three proposals is underway as of Friday, following which BnkToTheFuture is expected to hold a formal meeting with Celsius board members.  BnkToTheFuture didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  Celsius cut off withdrawals from its platform earlier this month because of “extreme market conditions,” which led to fears of its possible insolvency at the time.

Primitive Capital's Dovey Wan first spotted the offering, which is being conducted on a private basis according to sources in the Singapore real estate sector that spoke to CoinDesk.  Zhu and his wife Tao Yaqiong purchased a detached house on Singapore's Yarwood Avenue in December 2021 for S$48.8 million ($35 million), according to title data from the Singapore Land Authority.  Records from the Land Authority show the couple moved the house's title to a trust for their three-year-old child in March.  The 31,000-square-foot home was constructed in 1990, title data shows, and was only sold once, to Zhu. Known locally as a Good Class Bungalow, these luxurious detached houses are home to Singapore’s elite.  Title searches show Zhu’s wife, Tao, owns another detached house, currently being renovated, worth S$28.5 million on Dalvey Road in Singapore. The couple also owns another home at the Goodwood Grand on Balmoral Road, worth S$6.25 million.  Although Zhu has his reasons for needing to sell the property, local media reports suggest the detached home market is softening given the global economic downturn.  Local newspaper Business Times reported in late June that so far this year the volume of transactions for detached homes were less than a third of the volume in 2021.  The paper also quotes Carin Puah, a senior director of capital markets at JLL, who said that prices are expected to remain firm for these homes despite the market decline because of the status symbol nature of a GCB.  “Owners will only divest if the price meets their expectation,” Puah said.

42374427,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZSA7,1656672474,"Bitcoin, Ether Futures Rack up Nearly $200M in Liquidations on Short Squeeze","Futures tracking bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) racked up nearly $200 million in liquidations as volatility on Thursday saw prices break above, and then back below, resistance levels.  On Thursday, bitcoin dipped under $20,000 amid a broader fall in Eurasian markets, recovered over that level and then fell to as low as $18,650 in U.S. evening hours. A short squeeze then saw bitcoin touch over $20,900 in early Asian hours on Friday, which was then followed by a drop to $19,400 at writing time as traders took profits.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Thursday’s downward move caused over $76 million in “longs,” or bets on higher prices, to get liquidation. This likely caused the short squeeze early on Friday.  Similar trading in ether futures saw the asset add more than $100 within hours as it jumped from Thursday lows of $966 to Friday morning’s $1,115. Liquidations on ether futures crossed over $100 million alone in the past 24 hours, Coinglass data shows.  Futures tracking other major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana’s SOL and Avalanche’s AVAX, saw just over $5 million in liquidations each, implying their price action was mostly spot-driven.  The volatility arose earlier this week as traders assessed fresh comments from central bankers that signaled relief from rate hikes may not occur in the coming months, as reported.  ‘’Fears rattling financial markets show little sign of subsiding,” said Susannah Streeter, markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, in an email to CoinDesk. “Investors (are) spooked about signs of looming recessions, while inflation stays stubbornly high.”  Fresh falls on Wall Street marked a miserable milestone with the S&P 500 tumbling in the first half of the year by 20.6%, a fall not seen since 1970 and creating a technical “bear market.” The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been wracked by volatility, has plummeted in value by a third this year and is on track for the biggest-ever yearly drop.  Streeter said there are concerns among investors about demand and inflation, and the Federal Reserve and other central banks will have to step on interest rate hikes to bring “red hot prices under control.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/07/01/bitcoin-ether-futures-rack-up-nearly-200m-in-liquidations-on-short-squeeze,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/190064e1b0b7ab16eda2a43dd1a5e7a60c1ce60e-1680x1260.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42374414,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZRtl,1656637732,VanEck Files New Application for Spot Bitcoin ETF,"Investment giant VanEck has filed a new application for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  VanEck’s filing for its VanEck Bitcoin Trust comes just eight months after the SEC rejected its previous application and just a day after the regulator denied the spot bitcoin ETF applications of Grayscale Investments and Bitwise. Grayscale Investments is a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group.  A spot bitcoin ETF is comprised of bitcoin or assets related to bitcoin's price. Proponents of a spot bitcoin ETF approval have argued the product would offer a low-cost and easily accessible way for individuals and institutions to invest in bitcoin.  The SEC has repeatedly cited concerns about applicants’ ability to prevent market manipulation and protect investors in this type of ETF, although the agency has approved multiple ETFs that track bitcoin through futures.  “Spot commodities and currency markets for which it has previously approved spot ETPs are generally unregulated and that the Commission relied on underlying futures market as the regulated market of significant size that formed the basis for approving the series of Currency and Commodity-Based Trust Shares, including gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, and other commodities and currencies,” VanEck noted in its filing.  Grayscale Investments filed suit against the SEC barely an hour after its ETF filing was rejected, asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the SEC's order.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/vaneck-files-new-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3317353857cd7664679f7ccb6b61688127575d97-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Over the last 24 hours, DOT lost close to 8% of its market value invalidating weekly gains that DOT secured. Technical outlook for the coin indicated bearish price action. In accordance with the same, it is likely that the coin might not be able to hold itself above the $6 support level. The coin has been witnessing stiff resistance at the $7.20 mark. Only if the coin manages to trade above $7.20 for a considerable period of time, the bulls could be back. On the developmental front, Polkadot is introducing a new on chain governance model. Gavin Wood, Polkadot founder announced about the on chain governance model as a part of the Polkadot Decoded 2022 conference. The primary goal of this new governance model is to ramp up the number of collective decisions the governance structure is able to make. The newest development is yet to have any positive effect on the price of the altcoin. Polkadot Price Analysis: One Day Chart DOT was trading at $6.76 at the time of writing.
