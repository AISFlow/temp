42394466,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw18R5,1523098840,How to Defend Yourself Against Pump-and-Dumps,"Tanzeel Akhtar is an independent British journalist whose work has been published in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, FT Alphaville, Investing.com, Forbes, Euromoney and Citywire.     “Pump and dump” schemes have been around since long before cryptocurrency was invented. What’s striking about the crypto markets is that this type of manipulation is done out in the open.  On various social media channels, for example Telegram, BitcoinTalk and Reddit, groups of individuals come together and agree to buy altcoins at a certain price and to sell simultaneously at a specific time when the price peaks. They often spread false or misleading information to persuade unsuspecting investors to buy during the run-up.  But you have to give them credit for one thing: they don’t couch their activities with euphemisms.  Just look at the names of the top five P&D chat groups on Telegram, according to Business Insider:  PumpKing Community (14,317 members)  Crypto4Pumps (7,602 members)  AltTheWay (5,582 members)  Pump.im (148 members)  OCPump (1,281 members)  While this twisted sort of transparency may be refreshing when compared to the secretive manipulation of Libor by traders at large banks a decade ago, the prevalence of these groups underscores the hazards facing investors in cryptocurrency.  “This has a negative effect on the overall market and easily creates fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in the overall crypto community,” said Oleg Seydak, the CEO of Blackmoon Financial Group, a platform for marketplace lending of cryptocurrency.  “This type of manipulation unfortunately affects a great majority of new crypto investors and if we want the industry to prosper, we need to work together to prevent and shut down these channels and groups,” he said.  Potential solutions  How, though? One way is to encourage whistleblowing.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. agency that regulates derivatives, announced in February that it would pay a bounty to those who come forward with information that leads to an enforcement action.  Another potential solution is a self-regulatory organization (SRO) like the one proposed by by Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The concept has the support of CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz. But it’s unclear whether an SRO would have any teeth.  Until regulators come up with rules to curb P&D scams, investors need to be extra cautious they don’t get taken for a ride.  Psychology is key behind these scams. Beware as fraudsters are usually masters of persuasion and will tailor their pitches to tap into their targets’ psychological profiles.  Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Keep your guard up  For an illustration, below is a screenshot of a P&D group in action, courtesy again of Business Insider. Note the breathless language that tries to capitalize on FOMO (fear of missing out): a coin’s price is “flying”; it’s “so cheap now.”  Proceed with extra caution around tokens issued from initial coin offerings (ICOs), as some have estimated that perhaps one out of 10 ICOs has used this scheme at least once.  According to a January blog post by Sergey Khorolskiy, when some ICO teams understand that their project is close to failure, they organize a pump and dump. The strategy is simple: Using all types of social networks, they begin to ""shoot"" followers with good news.  Cryptocurrencies in general are susceptible to manipulation because, like penny stocks, they are thinly traded when compared to mainstream financial assets.  “One investor can drive prices on a single exchange by taking a large position one way or the other, or simply by putting out a large bid or ask that by itself moves the market,” said Trace Schmeltz, a partner in the Chicago and Washington, D.C. offices of Barnes & Thornburg LLP.  What’s more, “for cryptocurrencies that trade on multiple markets, a trader could potentially move the market globally by moving the price on a single exchange.”  For this reason, investors should be wary of following pricing as reflected on less well-established exchanges, Schmeltz added.  Like it or not, crypto is here to stay. As the market evolves the scammers and fraudsters will be weeded out as regulation is enforced. Until then, we can expect there will some tears along the way.

42380522,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8gGJJ,1523096139,Hating On Craig 'Satoshi' Wright Has United Crypto,"Satoshi or not, it's been a rough week for Craig Wright.  The man who rose to notoriety in 2015 by boldly claiming he was bitcoin's creator is under fire from not just some of the industry's most respected names, but the very people that have most embraced his shaky affirmation. Indeed, despite not offering any evidence to date to prove his claim, the Australian cryptographer and nChain founder had found a home among supporters of bitcoin cash.  From supportive T-shirts to displays of public support, Wright has developed a close association with the cryptocurrency that split from bitcoin and that is valued at $10 billion today.  Recently, though, he's faced a round of backlash.  It all started earlier this week when ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin took the microphone at a Q&A session at the Deconomy conference in Seoul, South Korea. There, Buterin used the moment to attack Wright's technical arguments issued onstage, highlighting a criticism levied by anyone and everyone respected in crypto since: that his technical commentary just doesn't make sense.  ""Given that he makes so many nonsensical claims, why is this fraud allowed to speak at this conference?"" Buterin told the crowd to tumultuous applause.  Though some in the community have hurried to Wright's defense, the backlash has only mounted.  ""I wrote the lightning network whitepaper and I still didn't understand your talk,"" developer Joseph Poon, co-inventor of the lightning network, later shouted.  Miles away, litecoin creator Charlie Lee couldn't help but join in.  ""Craig S Wright's talks and papers are filled with illogical technobabble and his Satoshi proof is fraudulent. He's a fraud. Why give this guy a platform?"" he said.  And with that, it seems, Buterin has started something of a movement.  Generally sympathetic to bitcoin cash's approach to scaling, Cornell computer scientist Emin Gun Sirer perhaps summarized the general sentiment the best.  He said in a tweet:  ""Right now, I have bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum and zcash devs in my mentions, all roundly ridiculing Craig Wright's technobabble. Cryptocurrencies have never been as united.""  Long-standing feud  The particular criticisms would go on to reignite a long-standing battle between Wright and Peter Rizun, a well-known bitcoin cash and aggressive bitcoin scaling advocate who has faced no shortage of criticism in the past for his views.  The technical feud started last summer when Rizun critiqued one of Wright's white papers wherein he argued (with math) that an attack in bitcoin called ""selfish mining"" is not actually viable.  Rizun essentially replied, in detail, that his paper doesn't make sense.  More recently, on March 25, Rizun – much like Vitalik – cornered Wright after a lecture, to argue his technical ideas related to unconfirmed transactions were not feasible. Rizun implied Wright's ideas would lead to mining attacks.  Rizun and Wright have since taken the argument to Twitter, with Rizun going as far as to call Wright a ""proven fraud.""  He's not the only one. Sirer expanded upon Rizun's critiques, arguing Wright has ""repeatedly failed to grasp"" selfish mining. (This is a notable claim since Sirer was one of the first to independently find the attack.)  Sirer went as far as to argue, ""He is done. No one takes him seriously as a technical person,"" before adding Wright hasn't yet delivered on last year's promise to release another bitcoin code.  This weariness of Wright now seems to be spreading to the rest of the community, even on forums that have been historically friendly to ideas he's championed.  One Reddit user on the forum stated in a post: ""I am now downvoting every post with Craig Wright's face on it.  Inclusive community  Still, it's worth noting many others in the community have come to Wright's defense.  A popular argument is that, whether or not he is Satoshi, his high profile and allegedly well-capitalized startup have done a lot for certain cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash.  ""Regardless of whether he's Satoshi or not, or whether he's even right or wrong about various technical points, I think [it's] unfair to accuse him of 'fraud' because claiming to be Satoshi (and then not proving) isn't fraud,"" Jonald Fyookball, who's penned many critical essays for the community, argued.  ""Also, giving away tons of money to various bitcoin cash endeavours doesn't seem like fraud either,"" Jonald continued.  His comments to back up Wright were met with a chorus of agreement.  That said, many other key members of the community have been quiet on the issue, or equivocal in whether they have a similar opinion of Wright. Still, with crypto enthusiasts never seeming to shy away from a debate, the comments can't help but feel unique in context.  As Poon concluded on Twitter, this type of dispute is not normal in the technical community. Whereas fits of rage and public animosity may not exactly be rare (investor Roger Ver accused bitcoin's developers of ""killing babies"" at the Seoul event), he argued that among the world's top developers, respectful disagreements are tactfully embraced.  “The confrontation at the conference should not be seen as a normal response to disagreements in the crypto ecosystem,"" he wrote, adding:  ""It was an extremely strong response to extreme, intentional deception.""
