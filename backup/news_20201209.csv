It joins crypto payments firm BitPay and custody provider Anchorage in seeking a federal charter to operate as a bank.      The bank would operate out of New York (where Paxos is already located), according to the filing. The company, which already has a New York trust charter and a slew of licenses, currently offers cash custody, gold custody, cryptocurrency services, digital asset issuance, securities clearing, commodities trading and other services.      Notably, the firm's crypto brokerage offering was tapped by PayPal earlier this year to power the payments giant's cryptocurrency service.      ""U.S. law is organized at both a state and federal level. The national charter was designed expressly to allow banks to conduct business across state lines more easily. This flexibility allows a young company like Paxos to focus resources on building great products. A national Trust Bank charter provides us with flexibility to operate across the U.S. while continuing to adhere to the highest regulatory standards,"" General Counsel Dan Burstein said in a blog post.      Read more: Crypto Startup BitPay Files to Become Federally Regulated US Bank      As with BitPay, the application will see a 30-day comment period as the next step in the process before it can proceed, though there's no guarantee it will be granted. However, Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks has said in public statements he would like to see fintech firms – like crypto companies – secure federal charters so they can more easily operate across the country.      Anchorage filed early last month for a federal charter, though the status of this application is unclear.      If approved, these companies would join Kraken and Avanti as some of the first crypto-native banks in the U.S., though the latter two secured state charters from the Wyoming Division of Banking rather than go the federal route.

He must also pay over $23 million in victim restitution.      The accused, Jose Angel Aman, and his partners were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II of the Southern District of Florida for soliciting funds from people in the United States and Canada for purported diamond contracts.      Aman and his partners promised investors the money was safe and backed by an inventory of actual diamonds, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said, but Aman “rarely used investors’ money to purchase, cut and resell rough diamonds. Nor did Aman have a $25 million diamond inventory.”    The DOJ said Aman also had a cryptocurrency venture, Argyle Coin, LLC, that was set up only after funds for the regular diamond investment scheme began to dry up.  While the accused solicited new funds on the pretext of developing a crypto token backed by diamonds, the announcement said only a fraction of the funds were used to develop that token and the rest went to “purported interest payments to the earlier investors and to benefit himself and his partners.”  ""To conceal the fraud, Aman made purported interest payments to existing investors with money from new investment victims. At the end of the investment period, Aman and the partners would convince the investors to roll over their money by falsely claiming that the investors had the full value of their investments to put into new deals,"" according to the DOJ.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $18,355 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.9% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $17,630-$18,836 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC near its 10-day moving average and below the 50-day, a sideways-to-bearish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin fell for the third straight day this week, dropping to as low as $17,630 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. Price has bounced back somewhat to $18,355 as of press time.      Read More: Bitcoin’s Options Market Skews Bearish as Spot Price Loses Ground      “Obviously we are now seeing the impact of temporary bullish exhaustion,” said Andrew Tu, an executive for crypto quant trading firm Efficient Frontier. “After failing to break the all-important $20,000 psychological figure several times, having been held down repeatedly between $19,000 and $20,000 over the last two weeks, we are now seeing a correction for BTC.”      On Dec. 3, bitcoin hit a high of $19,464 before slumping, according to the CoinDesk 20.      “In the medium run, the continued bullish news from institutional players, like the recent Wells Fargo report, should drive the price upwards past the $20,000 resistance, assuming that the macro landscape doesn't dramatically change,” Tu added.      Read More: Why Wells Fargo Won’t Recommend Bitcoin to Clients      “The recent run-up from $10,000 was primarily driven by spot volumes as U.S. financial institutions are increasingly buying up bitcoin,” said Jason Lau, chief operating officer San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “This means that funds are not overextended on leverage right now like in previous rallies and these institutions have capital to deploy to buy any dips.”      Total volume on major CoinDesk 20 exchanges were higher Wednesday than they have been any other day this week, at $1.3 billion as of press time.      “Since bitcoin didn’t break the $20,000 threshold, we have started to witness a weakening bullish trend,” said Jean Baptiste Pavageau, partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha.      According to data from Skew, funding rates for long leveraged positions are dropping, indicating a more bearish trend. That’s because traders appear to be seeking more downside exposure than rocket-fueled bullish positioning.      “We expect the price to retest $16,000 first and to bounce on its major support at $13,000 in case of further correction,” added Pavageau. “The bullish trend would still be intact on a larger scale since the second part of this year.”    DeFi 'locked' metric near all-time high    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Wednesday, trading around $573 and climbing 1.8% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      The amount “locked” in Ethereum-based decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been flirting with an all-time high of $15 billion for the first time, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse. Locking value in DeFi provides these protocols with liquidity. In turn, investors get a “yield” on their assets, usually quoted in average percentage yield (APY) terms on those assets.      Drilling down, the amount of ether locked is still hovering near 7 million total ETH.      Meanwhile, the amount of bitcoin locked has been dropping for most of the past month and was at 162,703 BTC as of press time.      John Willock, chief executive officer of Tritum, a diversified crypto investment firm, says market dynamics are playing a role in total value locked nearing $15 billion while crypto appears to be withdrawn from DeFi.      “The total value in dollar terms of assets locked in DeFI is highly levered to the price change of ETH, BTC and to a lesser extent the long list of other non-stablecoin crypto tokens circulating in the ecosystem,” Willock said. “Price buoyancy and positive sentiment drive a lot of the activity in chasing speculative opportunities in all of crypto, and DeFi is very much the same.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed on Wednesday.

Sells, the former chief innovation officer of New York-based Quontic Bank, is joining New York Digital Investments Group (NYDIG) as its head of bank solutions, the company announced Wednesday.      Sells will be responsible for developing NYDIG’s custody, execution, financing and anti-money laundering and know-your-customer compliance services for banks through a white-labeled offering.      In other words, if banks want to offer crypto trading and custody to their customers, NYDIG stands ready to do all the work for them behind the scenes. And such banks might be out there, judging from the public comment letters filed by a handful of U.S. institutions over the summer in response to a national regulator’s request for input.      One of only 26 companies to receive New York State’s rarefied BitLicense, NYDIG is best known for managing multi-million-dollar crypto funds and offers prime brokerage and custody services to institutional clients. It raised $150 million for twin crypto funds earlier this month. It is a unit of Stone Ridge, an alternative asset manager handling $10 billion for clients.      Quontic is a tiny bank with only $1.4 billion in assets, about 0.044% the size of JPMorgan. Sells and his former boss, Quontic CEO Steven Schnall, provided hard-to-come-by bank accounts to cryptocurrency firms and gave Quontic employees a crypto education by handing out $20 in bitcoin to each staff member.      Sells won American Banker magazine’s Digital Banker of the Year award in 2020, and revealed that he was working with Schnall on a deposit product tied to crypto.

42405540,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMrU6,1607545217,Would the STABLE Act Make Running an Ethereum Node Illegal?,"Last week, Congresswoman and ""Squad"" member Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) sent Crypto Twitter into a tizzy with the following proposal:      The bill's academic/think tank proponents followed up with posts such as this:      There's a lot to unpack here and a lot of crossed wires, mostly due to (I suspect) the fact that the proponents of the bill are MMT theorists and not engineers. While they may have fairly elaborate theories about what function cryptocurrency serves (and in particular how it has the potential to undermine their macro strategy of money printer go brr), they may have a somewhat looser grip on how cryptocurrency actually works.    1. What the bill does    I preface this essay by saying that stablecoin issuers should be licensed. What sort of license is anybody's guess. Currently I should think a money transmitter license would be the thing but there's no reason in principle why an issuer shouldn't go get a bank license as well.      The STABLE Act does way more than that, and appears to require any blockchain that runs stablecoin code to be licensed, among other things. For example:    The bill outlaws the issuance of a stablecoin otherwise than by ""an insured depository instiution that is a member of the Federal Reserve System,"" i.e., a bank.  The bill bans the issuance of stablecoins, provision of ""stablecoin-related"" services, or ""otherwise engaging in any stablecoin-related commercial activity,” including activity involving stablecoins issued by other persons, without obtaining written approval in advance from the appropriate federal banking agency.  The bill creates a requirement for preapproval, among other things, for ""otherwise engaging in any stablecoin-related commercial activity.""    It's a swing and a miss:    First, the largest stablecoins available in the marketplace – which shall remain nameless for the purposes of this blog post – have lists of compliance issues a mile long already. Adding another requirement doesn't answer the question of how we get non-compliant stablecoins to adhere to the rules that currently exist.  Second, one of the stated purposes of this bill is to protect underserved communities from being discriminated against by stablecoin issuers. To this I would reply that any stablecoin issuer worth doing business with will operate in New York State and need to comply with the provisions of the N.Y. Human Rights Law, which prohibits discrimination. (For the disabled, I note also that the Second Circuit federal court thinks that under Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act there is no requirement for a ""public accommodation"" to have a physical location, so that aspect of equal access might also be covered by New York-based stablecoin providers.) Additionally, given the regulatory problems with some existing stablecoins, and in particular their role as dollar liquidity providers for offshore exchanges with lax know-your-customer enforcement that can't get banking access, it is likely those who would access stablecoin markets don't need to be protected from denial of access to stablecoins, but rather they need to be protected from most of the stablecoins they are likely to encounter in the wild.  Third, the plain text of the bill presents the bizarre possibility, one which is apparently intended by the drafters, that node operation on any unlicensed chain that supported any stablecoin contracts would be unlawful and, pursuant to 12 U.S. Code § 1833a, would be subject to fines of up to $1,000,000. Criminal penalties might also be possible. The rest of this post deals with this point.  2. Introducing the Ethereum Rule of Statutory Construction    Lawyers have these little critters called ""canons of statutory construction"" we use to interpret laws. For example, in England they have something called ""the golden rule,"" which basically means that when trying to understand what a law calls for, you give the statute its plain and ordinary meaning unless doing so would render the statute absurd. In the alternative there is an approach called the ""purposive approach,"" which is generally used to interpret indirectly effective European Union law, where interpretation of the rule is driven by the purpose for which the statute is drafted.      See also: Why Stablecoins Are the First Battleground of the Coming Crypto Regulation Wars      In America, by contrast, you may have heard of ""textualism,"" ""originalism"" or the ""living Constitution"" approach in recent U.S. Supreme Court hearings. It's the same game, choosing which rules we use to understand language.      I propose one for cryptocurrency. I call it the Ethereum Rule, and it holds that ""A law is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning unless it would require Ethereum (as it exists in 2020) to apply for a license, in which case the law is absurd.""      This bill appears to require just that. Although the definition of ""stablecoin"" in the act seems to exclude cryptocurrencies like ether, the issue isn't that the definition is over-broad but that the bill seeks to force anyone engaging with stablecoins to do so under the aegis of the Federal Reserve System. Just read the plain language:    ""It shall be unlawful for any person to ... otherwise engage in any stablecoin-related commercial activity, including activity involving stablecoins issued by other persons, without obtaining written approval in advance ... from the appropriate [f]ederal banking agency""    This doesn't leave a lot of wiggle room: ""Any"" means ""any,"" and ""any stablecoin-related commercial activity"" is a broad brush when we consider that any user of any smart contract blockchain will be verifying stablecoin transactions to some extent.      Lest we think that we're misreading the proposal, its own proponents publicly agree with this interpretation:      To this I respond with the Ethereum Rule of Statutory Construction. Ethereum has no central owners, forks regularly and is currently regulated as a commodity. If your law requires that kind of a system to get a bank charter, not only will the law fail to effectively control the blockchain, but the regulators tasked with enforcing it will have difficulty finding someone with standing to sign the application.      The STABLE Act says that blockchain users will be permitted to transact, if only they would first achieve the impossible. This is an absurd state of affairs and a strong indication that, as written, the STABLE Act would not make good law.    3. Would the STABLE Act actually make running a node illegal?    Of course, there is zero chance the STABLE Act is going to become law during this Congress. However, coin people – and Ethereum people in particular – have been asking the question: What if it did?      The answer is not straightforward. Peter van Valkenburgh over at Coin Center says the prohibition on ""stablecoin-related commercial activity"" hands down applies to node operators or anyone running the Ethereum client:    “The logical consequence of the bill is that if any person is running software that validates dai or other stablecoin smart contracts they will, themselves, be violating the law unless they are a chartered bank.”    Though a reasonable conclusion, and on balance likely the correct one, it is not a forgone one, since the current language of the STABLE Act, being both overbroad and imprecise, leaves plenty of scope to poke holes in it. For example, it is not clear whether operating a node gratis (as many full nodes do) counts as ""stablecoin-related commercial activity"" if done on a non-commercial basis. Seeing as nodes are not ordinarily compensated it is certainly conceivable there will be situations where node operation is sub-commercial if not non-commercial. Research would be required to find the answer here.      Additionally, it is not immediately apparent to me that running a full node is ""stablecoin-related commercial activity"" given that many if not most cryptocurrency transactions don't have a stablecoin component. The statute's lack of specificity narrows its application. If the statute said ""any commercial activity related to, or any communication which may facilitate, any stablecoin transaction,"" that would be one thing. But that's not what the language says. Properly understood, Ethereum is a rail, and just as we don't refer to the act of driving a car as being ""jogging related"" just because cars and joggers use the same roads, we shouldn't refer to the act of running a node as ""stablecoin-related"" just because stablecoin transactions are broadcast alongside all other transactions via devp2p. Again, more research would be needed to see whether a court would agree with that interpretation.      See also: Preston J. Byrne – Stop F**king Around With Public Token Airdrops in the United States      There is another matter: In my view, the operator of a cryptocurrency node is capable of being a provider of an interactive computer service under a legislative provision known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (47 U.S. Code 230(c)(1)). This law states in relevant part that providers of interactive computer services, properly ""information content providers,"" are not treated as the publisher or speaker of, and therefore have no liability for, content which third parties submit to their servers, subject to certain limited exceptions.      Coin Center has called, in the past, for a node operation safe harbor similar to Section 230 (which exempts social media networks from content liability). Since the blockchain is really little more than a published, cryptographically verifiable feed of transactions that have been authorized by the Bitcoin network (and other blockchains, the same for their corresponding native assets), I tend to think that it's more likely than not a blockchain application falls within the confines of Section 230.      I freely admit that whether a node operator qualifies for the exemption is an open question. The law defines an ""information content provider"" as a ""system ... provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server."" I'd have to do a little research to see if there are any precedents dealing with the question of what a ""server"" constitutes for this purpose, but at least at first glance there is an argument to be made that operating a full node on a blockchain, which in its essence is a distributed timestamp server, could qualify, at least insofar as it pertains to third-party financial communications that are being relayed by that node.      Section 230, however, only confers immunity from state criminal law and civil actions. It has no effect on federal criminal law, and there are criminal sanctions in the FDI Act (see e.g. 12 U.S. Code § 1818(g)). To figure out whether a full node could be captured within the STABLE Act the first thing to do is read the statute and try to determine whether providing peer-to-peer network access services counts as ""stablecoin-related commercial activity.""      If not, then node operation is not captured by the statute and the analysis ends. If so, the next questions would be (a) whether node operators were covered by Section 230(c)(1) and (b) whether the STABLE Act impliedly narrowed or repealed Section 230's application to node operators insofar as the nodes processed transactions related to stablecoins. After answering those questions the picture would be clearer.      In terms of the current federal picture, we know that providing network access services is not equivalent to money transmission, that FinCEN doesn't consider node operation to be money transmission, and that for most federal crimes accessory liability requires heightened knowledge and participation of the kind we don't usually ascribe to node operators. This is perhaps why, to the best of my knowledge, there have been no prosecutions for running a Bitcoin full node to date.      See also: Child Porn On Bitcoin? Why This Doesn’t Mean What You Might Think      Nor should there be, now or ever, and if American leadership in the crypto arena is to continue it might be worthwhile, given how wrongheaded the STABLE Act is – not on stablecoin licensure, as I think stablecoins are properly the subject of regulation, but on blockchain node licensure – to revisit Coin Center's proposal for a blockchain node safe harbor that clearly and unambiguously accords blockchain nodes the status enjoyed by other online publishers.      Section 230's most learned interpreter, Jeff Kosseff, titled his book on the provision ""The Twenty-Six Words That Created The Internet."" I note for the record that Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube were not founded in Europe. If America is to lead the decentralized internet we would do well to look to Section 230 as an example of how to do internet regulation the right way.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Preston J.

In a joint letter sent to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton Wednesday, the bipartisan group of representatives wrote they want the SEC to build out the requirements that would enable crypto firms to custody digital securities, and in turn allow FINRA to approve broker-dealer applications for the space.      The letter pointed to recent guidance by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which published an interpretative letter in July declaring that federally regulated banks may provide custody services for cryptocurrencies.      The lawmakers specifically ask the SEC to take three actions:    Confirm that banks can provide custody services for digital securities  Create requirements for crypto custody services that FINRA can use to assess broker-dealer applications  Tell FINRA to approve broker-dealer applications from the crypto industry    The issue has been outstanding for years. CoinDesk reported in June 2019 FINRA had been sitting on a number of broker-dealer applications from firms that touch crypto, some for over a year. FINRA had taken no actions to approve or disapprove these applications, letting them sit in a sort of limbo.      In a joint statement referenced by Wednesday's letter, the SEC and FINRA said various concerns needed to be addressed, such as whether the custody provider could prove that no other party had control of its private keys and how they could prevent unauthorized or accidental transfers.

In a Tuesday report, BofA analysts said digital euro accounts to individuals, if they are seen as a popular alternative, would cut into commercial bank deposits and possibly harm the region's banking sector.      “Money, like internet data, has a strong tendency to monopoly,” noted the analysts in the report. The European Central Bank is concerned by the Libra (now Diem) Association working to get its diem dollar stablecoin off the ground, as well as China's continuing efforts with its digital yuan. Thus, “the ECB perceives the risk"" of a monopoly, say the analysts, and may be thinking it's ""better to move quickly and ensure a digital euro.”    The BofA analysts view a digital euro as “predominantly a downside risk” for banks because while reducing costs and complexity in the payments chain for individuals, it would also reduce the need for third parties.  “A [digital euro] that functions for transactions could prove a convenient substitute for current accounts,” added the BofA analysts.  Banks in Europe already face considerable deposit requirements under the current financial system, the analysts note, so the competition coming from a widely adopted digital euro could further eat into deposits.

42405513,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMpCQ,1607535932,"10 Predictions for 2021: China, Bitcoin, Taxes, Stablecoins and More","While 2020 has been a very difficult year, it has, ironically, been a catalyst year for fintech and crypto.      And there are no signs of the momentum slowing down in 2021!    Henri Arslanian is Global Crypto Leader, PwC and an Adjunct Professor, University of Hong Kong.    Here are my 10 crypto predictions for the coming year:      1. China leading the CBDC and future of money race      As we predicted last year, 2020 was a banner year for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). With 80% of central banks active on CBDCs and the invisible pressure from Libra (now called Diem), which is expected to launch shortly, we should expect to see a lot of new developments in this space.      See also: Henri Arslanian discusses his predictions with Ben Schiller on the Opinionated podcast.      While wholesale CBDC developments are important, the focus of central banks will probably center on retail CBDCs, as that is the real game-changer. Unlike wholesale CBDCs that are just between a central bank and banks and that operate “behind the scenes” from the public’s perspective, retail CBDCs allow the public to hold a truly digital form of central bank money, something that does not exist today. Just as 2020 saw some countries from the Bahamas to the U.K. grab headlines with some of their retail CBDC initiatives, we should expect other G20 countries to announce their own plans.      But in practice, all eyes in 2021 will be on China as it continues to move forward with its digital renminbi (called DC/EP), blazing the trail when it comes to the future of money. In its last pilot phase, more than 2 billion RMB of value (US$300 million) were transacted via 4 million transactions using the digital RMB. The big question may be not if but how quickly China continues to move forward on this project.      2. Traditional financial institutions (and private banks) falling in love with bitcoin?      2020 was an incredible year when it came to the entry of institutional players in the crypto space. Not only did we see large institutions such as JPMorgan and Standard Chartered continue to build solutions for clients, many, from Citi to Deutsche Bank, even began regular coverage of the asset class.      We should expect this trend to accelerate in 2021 as many banks begin to make their crypto plans public. This should further catalyze the entry of traditional buy-side firms that are not only more comfortable trading with such regulated intermediaries but, in many cases, are obliged by their own regulatory or investor restrictions.      While investment banks have been the most active players so far, we should keep an eye on private banks. Most of the large private banks disregarded bitcoin as not a serious asset (not having crypto-related products to sell probably did not help!) but we should expect the forward-looking private banks to adapt and see crypto as a differentiator offering to engage and drive new revenue from the much-coveted high-net-worth and family office client base that is increasingly looking to buy bitcoin.    Crypto unicorns [are] increasingly becoming crypto octopuses and spending some of their bull market gains.    3. The taxman provides crypto tax clarity      As we correctly predicted last year, 2020 saw ground-breaking developments in crypto taxation. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service sent a questionnaire covering crypto holdings to every American, while organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development published impressive reports on the topic.      As the ""PWC Global Crypto Report"" showed, an increasing number of tax authorities around the globe are providing explicit crypto tax guidance. And while almost none of them provide guidance on topics like crypto borrowing and lending or crypto staking, the majority now provide guidance on areas like capital gains on crypto or mining income. Expect the level of tax clarity to improve in 2020.      This is a positive for the industry because tax clarity is important for giving comfort to institutional investors. On a practical level, many retail and professional traders made gains with the rise of crypto markets in recent months, representing an opportunity for tax authorities to take what they believe is due, especially in such a difficult economic environment!      4. Crypto M&A turning crypto unicorns into crypto octopuses      Despite the economic crisis, 2020 was an impressive year for crypto M&A. Data suggests the total value of crypto M&A in the first six months of 2020 has already surpassed the total from 2019, with the average deal size increasing from $19.2 million to $45.9 million.      We should expect crypto M&A activity to continue in 2021, particularly with crypto unicorns increasingly becoming crypto octopuses and spending some of their bull market gains and acquiring or investing in firms that offer ancillary services to their current offerings.      And these crypto octopuses may be increasingly swimming in Asian waters in 2021, as an ever-increasing percentage of such crypto M&A deal activity continues to shift away from the Americas, with 57% of deals occurring in Asia-Pacific countries, and in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the first half of this year, up from 51% in 2019 and 43% in 2018.      5. Retail investors (and my mom!) can finally buy bitcoin easily    “Where should I go to buy bitcoin?” Anyone in crypto regularly gets this question from friends and family. My mom is a great example. After I gave her a bitcoin as a gift a couple of years ago, she desperately tried to understand what I do for a living. The reality is that it has never been easier to buy crypto. Not only are there numerous regulated fiat-to-crypto exchanges in most countries now, but the number of people with accounts at such exchanges grewhttps://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2020-ccaf-3rd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking-study.pdf from only 5 million in 2016 to over 100 million this year.    Of course, the elephant in the room here will be large tech players like PayPal and Square that continue to make it easy for people to buy bitcoin and other crypto assets. These two firms alone are buying the equivalent of 100% of newly minted bitcoin just to cover the demand they are getting from U.S. customers. When some of these platforms open to international customers next year, their impact will be interesting to measure.      And many of the macro economic developments, from the record levels of quantitative easing to countries blocking their citizens from withdrawing their own money, are raising interest in bitcoin. 2020 saw a record number of bitcoin wallets, so we should not be surprised to see this record be broken in 2021.      6. Traditional hedge funds and family offices rushing into crypto      2020 saw large hedge funds, from Guggenheim to Renaissance Technologies, take a serious look at entering the space, while several prominent public hedge fund managers, from Paul Tudor Jones to Stanley Druckenmiller, made headlines by talking up bitcoin as a store of value.    We should expect this to accelerate in 2021, driven by a multitude of regulated and “traditional” solutions that allow such players to get exposure to the asset class, from CME Bitcoin Futures to the listed Grayscalehttps://grayscale.co/ crypto products. (Grayscale is a sister company to CoinDesk.)    And with the numerous regulated and institutional focused crypto exchanges that are now happy to service such funds, as well as crypto prime brokerage solutions, many of which did not exist during the last bull market three years ago, the table is set for a potential boom in crypto trading by traditional hedge funds in 2021.    Open interest on Bitcoin Futures on the CME [is] a good barometer of investor appetite going forward.    7. Crypto derivatives exchanges growing up      Outside crypto, the size of the derivatives market is multiple times that of spot markets. This is not the case yet with crypto markets. Although there are many crypto derivatives exchanges, very few of them are regulated or would pass operational due diligence by institutional investors.      In 2021, crypto derivatives will be an area to watch. Open interest on bitcoin futures on the CME has recently been at record highs and will be a good barometer of investor appetite going forward.      This space still offers a lot of opportunities for firms that understand the institutional-grade requirements, from counterparty risk mitigation and high-speed connectivity to being regulated. That will provide great opportunities not only to existing players (many of whom have been institutionalizing quite quickly) but also to potential new entrants and traditional institutions.      8. Move away, Hoodies: Here come the Suits to professionalize the industry      Many in the first generation of crypto entrepreneurs came from tech backgrounds. But now, many of the larger crypto firms have decided to institutionalize by bringing aboard individuals with institutional financial services backgrounds to run their businesses, with numerous recent examples from crypto native firms like BitMEX to new ventures like Diem.      We should expect this trend to accelerate in 2021. However, the crypto industry is a sink or swim environment. Crypto markets never sleep, firms operate 24/7 and the industry evolves numerous times faster than traditional financial services, meaning executives need to be comfortable in continuously operating outside of their comfort zones.      Some will be able to adapt and be very successful in building the next bridge towards the future of money. But many will not make the cut and may realize they prefer the comfort of “traditional” finance with its comfortable after-market hours and free weekends.      9. New regulations driving traffic to DeFi      As correctly predicted last year, decentralized finance, or DeFi, exploded in 2020, with total value locked (TVL) growing from less than $1 billion in January to more than $15 billion today. Some months, trading volumes on certain DeFi exchanges were bigger than those at some of the large traditional exchanges.      In 2021, DeFi is likely to grow further. While it is unlikely we will see institutional investor interest in the sector, the dedicated group of folks from the crypto community working in this exciting area will continue to make breakthroughs. Some of the features of DeFi, like composability, for example, give us an opportunity to reimagine financial services with a first-principles approach.      One area to watch will be the impact of new regulations, from the FATF’s travel rule to the potential ban of crypto retail trading in certain markets, which may inadvertently drive traffic to such offerings.      See also: The Biggest Story in Crypto: The Stablecoin Surge and Power Politics      10. Stablecoins play a bigger role in cross-border transactions    2020 was a record year for stablecoins. With assets growing from less than $5 billion at the beginning of the year to over $25 billion by December, we should expect this momentum to continue in 2021. All eyes here will be (once again!) on Diem (formerly Librahttps://www.diem.com/en-us/updates/diem-association/).    Diem aims to make sending money around the world as easy as sending an email or a message on WhatsApp. This should, I hope, help us reduce cross-border retail money transfer and remittance fees that are still around 7%, an embarrassment in 2020. While stablecoins already play a big role in crypto trading, one area to watch in 2021 is whether usage of stablecoins picks up when it comes to cross-border commercial transactions.      Data suggests usage of stablecoins is already increasing in certain corridors, such as between Latin America and Southeast Asia for example, where merchants are using stablecoins to settle transactions, completely bypassing the traditional banking rails in the process. In 2021, it will be interesting to see if this trend continues.      So there you have it, my top 10 crypto predictions for 2021!      2020 was an exciting year for crypto. And 2021 is shaping up to be even more exciting!      Do you agree or disagree with the above predictions?

One of the world's oldest banks will issue a euro stablecoin on the Stellar blockchain. Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm, found 13% of the proceeds from crime involving bitcoin travel through “privacy wallets.""    Top shelf    Cornered market? Latin American crypto exchange Bitso has raised a whopping $62 million funding round, the largest in the region for a digital asset firm. Announced Wednesday, Mexico City-based Bitso’s Series B also heralded the first investment in crypto by renowned fintech VC firms QED Investors and Kaszek Ventures, which led the fundraise. With the capital, the company, which now boasts over over one million users and has cornered the Mexican and Argentinian crypto markets, looks to expand to the rest of Latin America, particularly Brazil.      Stellar stablecoin Germany’s Bankhaus von der Heydt (BVDH), one of the world’s oldest banks, will issue a euro stablecoin on the Stellar blockchain network. Bitbond, a component in the project, has already partnered with the Stellar Development Foundation to issue a euro-denominated stablecoin with Tempo, and has also received approval from the German regulator BaFIN to issue tokenized bonds, also on Stellar. A fiat currency transfer is held at an escrow account at BVDH, which then triggers the issuance of the stablecoin.      Declining profit The British arm of the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase saw a sharp downturn in business in 2019, with annual profits dropping by nearly a quarter year on year as a result. In a filing with the U.K.'s business registrar Companies House on Tuesday, Coinbase UK reported turnover of €94.8 million (US$114.9 million) in 2019, down 38% from €153 million ($185.6 million) in 2018. Still, after taxes, Coinbase UK netted some €5.1 million ($6.2 million) – though that, too, is down by 22.5% from €6.6 million ($7.9 million) the year before.      Bertelsmann-backed Greenfield One, an early-stage crypto venture firm based in Berlin, has secured its first major backers for a second fund, including an investment from publishing giant Bertelsmann. Greenfield invests in “crypto networks and developer teams that use blockchain-based technology to create the infrastructure for Web 3.0,” according to the press release. “There seems to be a trend emerging with existing Ethereum applications moving over to other ecosystems, which is something we are excited about even though we remain long-term bullish on Ethereum,” Sebastian Blum, of Greenfield, said.      Downgraded Following MicroStrategy’s latest bid to raise funds to invest in bitcoin, Citibank analysts have downgraded the company’s publicly traded stock. Citi analyst Tyler Radke lowered his recommendation on MicroStrategy to “sell” from “neutral,” warning investors in a Tuesday research note the company’s recent bitcoin euphoria may be overextended. Radke cited CEO Michael Saylor’s “disproportionate focus” on bitcoin as a potentially troubling trend for the business intelligence company. He also said MicroStrategy’s planned $400 million debt offering to fund additional bitcoin purchases signals “incremental risk to the story.”      Crypto index Bitwise Asset Management announced Wednesday its 10 Crypto Index Fund is now live as a public-traded cryptocurrency index fund. Listed under the ticker symbol “BITW” and open to U.S. investors, shares of the fund will be tradable through traditional brokerage accounts and the assets will be custodied with Coinbase Custody Trust Company. The fund will track the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, a diversified, market cap-weighted index of the 10 largest cryptocurrencies. As of Nov. 30, the fund held approximately 75% bitcoin and 13% ethereum. The firm has had several failed bids to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).      Washed? Elliptic, a blockchain analytics firm, found 13% of the proceeds from crime involved bitcoin travel through “privacy wallets” – a 2% increase from 2019. In a report published Wednesday the firm estimated that some $160 million in bitcoin was laundered through privacy wallets this year, typically originating from scams, thefts and the darknet. These are tools like Wasabi Wallet and CoinJoin transactions, which work by mixing BTC transactions to obscure the users.

42405541,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMp8U,1607532551,Crypto Startup BitPay Files to Become Federally Regulated US Bank,"Crypto payments firm BitPay has filed to become a national bank in the U.S.      According to a Dec. 8 legal notice published by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, BitPay has applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to organize a federally regulated bank, dubbed the BitPay National Trust Bank, headquartered in Georgia. The news was first reported by The Block.      The filing calls for a 30-day comment period, with comments to be directed to the OCC licensing director.      OCC Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks announced earlier this year he would seek to set up a licensing framework for fintech startups, including crypto firms, to streamline their operations within the U.S. At present, crypto exchanges and other digital payment firms typically must acquire money transmitter licenses in each of the U.S. states and territories in which they hope to operate.      According to BitPay's application, the total capitalization its national bank would receive for shares issued would fall just under $12 million, with 120 million shares to be issued.      By becoming a national bank, companies like BitPay could bypass this state-by-state regime.    Backlash    The acting comptroller said in September his agency would be ready to begin processing applications. More recently, he told CNBC the crypto space could expect to see additional good news as the year ends.      However, his move has sparked pushback from banks and Democrat lawmakers who see his focus on crypto as excessive and de-regulatory.      Last week, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, wrote a letter to incoming President Joe Biden asking him to overturn a number of actions conducted by his predecessor's agency heads, including all of Brooks' crypto actions.      It's unclear whether Biden will do so at this time.      Brooks is also up to take on a full five-year term at the OCC. President Donald Trump nominated the former Coinbase general counsel to the role last month, though the Senate has yet to announce a confirmation vote. If Brooks is not confirmed, Biden or his designated Treasury secretary nominee, Janet Yellen, may announce a different name.      Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) has also introduced the STABLE Act, which would require all stablecoin issuers to secure bank charters.      BitPay confirmed the move in an emailed statement.      ""Our operations as a national trust bank will be subject to strict safety and soundness requirements, which will provide our customers with assurances that our services remain best in class and allow us to be subject to a uniform regulatory framework,"" the statement said.

Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturer Bitfury has filed to sell at least part of its 38% stake in Toronto Stock Exchange-listed mining company Hut 8.      The Amsterdam-based manufacturer filed a notice of intention to distribute securities on Dec. 3 for the sale of up to 37,226,958 shares of Hut 8. At current prices, the stake is worth $56.6 million.      Until September, Bitfury held over 40 million shares when it parted with an initial 4 million HUT shares priced at $0.94 each as payment for “a strategic commercial agreement with a third party,” per a press release.      Hut 8 currently has 96.73 million total outstanding shares. Trading at $1.52 at last check, shares have dropped 12% in December.      Bitfury said in a statement it plans to be looking only at secondary market transactions. Precisely when and how much of its stake Bitfury plans to sell is still being evaluated, the company said.      Hut 8 declined to comment on the filing.

The Fidelity Investments subsidiary will hold the cryptocurrency and not make loans itself.  Partnering on the initiative is crypto lender BlockFi, which will help manage risk by offering cash worth 60% of a loan backed by bitcoin, according to the firm's CEO, Zac Prince.  “As the markets grow, we’d expect that this becomes a fairly important part of the ecosystem,” said Jessop.  In order to receive the loan, a Fidelity customer will have to have an account with BlockFi.

42405505,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMp2a,1607527800,Crypto Remittances Prove Their Worth in Latin America,"Western Union recently announced it would be suspending U.S. dollar transfers to Cuba, due to sanctions from the United States. This may only increase the attractiveness of sending remittances with cryptocurrencies, which are much more resistant to geopolitical tensions.      According to the World Bank, Latin America’s formal remittance market is around $96 billion. But traditional services like Moneygram or Western Union can come with high commissions, unfavorable exchange rates, limited office hours, long transmission times and daily exchange limits.      Crypto remittances are a different story. I’ve sent money from Venezuela to family members in Colombia and Spain, using the peer-to-peer platform LocalBitcoins. These transactions are often faster and cheaper than their traditional finance counterparts, with fewer steps to send money, at least if you know how to take advantage of the platform.      First, I would buy bitcoin with bolivars through a bank transfer in LocalBitcoins, then I would look for sell offers of BTC in Colombia or Spain. I would choose the offer with the best exchange rate for the currency my relatives use. After the other party transferred the currency to my relative’s bank account, I would release the BTC. This whole process takes less than an hour, and the platform charges a 1% fee to whoever published the trade offer. There are other platform options as well, such as Binance P2P and LocalCryptos. (Disclaimer: In 2021 I will be hosting a program on YouTube that is sponsored by LocalBitcoins).      Crypto remittances organized on messaging platforms like Whatsapp, Telegram and WeChat can be more competitive. Members of the group set their own exchange rates, but they will use other exchange rates as references. There are no official commissions or exchange limits, you just need to have good references, publish the price and amount that you want to trade.      I have participated in a WhatsApp group of almost 200 informal cryptocurrency merchants processing remittances and/or other trades, with a diversity of phone numbers from different Latin American countries, but most were numbers from Venezuela. Various numbers are business accounts with names or descriptions that include words like “money transfer” or “remittance.” There was even one person from China.      The transaction amounts I’ve seen range from $100 to $5,000 per transfer. Escrow is not generally used on these platforms because trading tends to happen between select and trusted people.    Remittance agents    Even though crypto remittances might be less cumbersome than traditional ones, crypto remains bewildering to many people and, depending on from which country funds are being sent, complicated and expensive. As a workaround, a new market has come into existence, where individuals like Gabriela Fernández, a Venezuelan who emigrated to Argentina in 2018, helps her clients send cross-border remittances using BTC and USDT. She offers an unofficial VES/ARS exchange rate and also takes a commission.      Gabriela receives Argentine pesos from her clients who are in Argentina, and she then exchanges those pesos for bitcoin on peer-to-peer exchanges. This bitcoin is converted to bolivars in her personal account in Venezuela, which is then transferred to her clients’ family members. Her clients don't even necessarily know that she uses bitcoin to send remittances, she says, and they probably wouldn’t understand it anyway.      Gabriela told me that due to the increase in unemployment spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume of remittances has been reduced but competition between crypto remittance operators has been growing. This could be interpreted as a sign of health of the remittance market.      “When I arrived in Argentina, in 2018, the profit margin I had (in each transaction) was between 15% to 30%. Now, with more competition, I get a lower profit between 5% to 10%. This is because of new competitors who settle for lower profits. ""    Venezuela    Between 2016 and November 2019, almost 4.6 million Venezuelans moved to other countries, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), perhaps fleeing the economic or political crisis in our country. This diaspora generates demand for remittance services: Venezuelans abroad can send money to their families back home, using the local currency of their new country of residence. Small businesses, ranging from individuals who handle transactions to startups like Valiu and Reserve, help people make these crypto transfers. Even the Venezuelan government wants to participate in the cryptocurrency remittance market with its own crypto platform.      Recently, Venezuelan remittances have been suffering from the reduction of economic activity in countries with more Venezuelan immigrants like Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador and Brazil. According to various local analysis, remittances will decrease by almost half from $3.7 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion this year. Much of this has to do with the impact of COVID-19 because people simply have less money to send.      Chainalysis estimates Venezuela may have received roughly $4 million in crypto on-chain remittances in June 2020, down from around $6 million a year ago. Chainalysis estimates the remittance market based on an approximation of smaller transfers directly received in Venezuela from other countries. A spokesperson for Chainalysis told CoinDesk via email there is no way to verify if these are indeed remittances because they cannot ask a person to reveal the intention behind a transfer.      Danilo Sánchez, a Venezuelan ex-crypto miner who emigrated to Peru and who now engages in financial arbitrage between currencies, observed of the crypto remittance market:      “All of this is driven by the immigration of Venezuelans who have the need to send funds to their families. Bitcoin is an efficient tool for sending money to Venezuela from the comfort of home.""    Regional trends    Mexico has the largest share of the remittance market in Latin America. Emigration to the United States has formed a fairly formal remittance industry with high competition, where there is little space for remittances with cryptocurrencies made by informal operators. That's why there aren’t many offers on P2P platforms like LocalBitcoins, compared to Venezuela.      In this environment, Mexico’s Bitso crypto exchange stands out. It offers a service that uses the Ripple network and its XRP token to send remittances between Mexico and the United States. Bitso claims that it moves up to 10% of total remittances between the U.S. and Mexico, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.    In 2019, the U.S. received almost 3 million Cuban immigrantshttps://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/wmr_2020.pdf, but due to sanctions the remittance industry becomes complicated, as we saw with recent restrictions on Western Union.    This just makes a stronger case for sending remittances with crypto. Cuban YouTuber Erich García Cruz explained in an interview with CoinDesk that tech-savvy Cubans are getting closer to bitcoin, since it is a digital electronic money that is resistant to geopolitical problems or government regulations. García has even launched a remittance service with informal operators to send remittances to Cuba. The recipient of remittances never even has to interact with cryptocurrencies.      García explained that his business receives bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from abroad, then auctions them for a lower price in the local market for those interested in acquiring cryptocurrency with Cuban convertible pesos, making a profit from the difference in the sale price. There are around 300 to 400 active users, moving amounts of $10 to $20 per transaction.      There are other enterprises operating in Cuba that try to offer a way to send remittances while avoiding direct interaction with the Cuban or U.S. governments. They work mainly with P2P exchanges, similarly to how the U.S. sent money to doctors in Venezuela without needing the approval of the Maduro government.

The firm estimates that over 13% of the proceeds from crime involving bitcoin are now being transferred through such wallets, up from just 2% in 2019, according to a report published Wednesday.      Elliptic said privacy wallets, such as Wasabi Wallet, have tools that help obfuscate the identity of users. An example is the automatic peer matching and sending of CoinJoin transactions, in which bitcoin is mixed within one transaction.      The wallets are proving popular as a means to avoid the risks of centralized coin-mixing services, such as theft of funds by service providers and authorities running ""honeypot"" sites, per the report.      In 2020, Elliptic estimates $160 million in bitcoin from the darknet, thefts and scams has been laundered through privacy wallets.      The hack of prominent Twitter accounts in the summer promoted a crypto scam that raised $120,000 in different cryptocurrencies, much of which was laundered through Wasabi Wallet, the report indicated.

Also involved in the round were existing shareholders Coinbase Ventures and Pantera Capital.      Nigel Morris, co-founder and managing partner of QED Investors, and Nicolas Szekasy, co-founder and managing partner at Kaszek Ventures, are joining the board of Bitso.      “We have been talking to QED and Kaszek for a really long time and they have been interested in crypto but hadn’t pulled the trigger until now,” said Daniel Vogel, CEO and co-founder of Bitso. “I think the conviction from them is because we are really focused on making this technology accessible to the people of Latin America.”    Market share    The spectre of deflationary currencies has driven Bitso user numbers to over a million, and a crypto market share of 97% in Mexico and 77% in Argentina, Vogel said.

""The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced,"" JPMorgan bank's quantitative strategists and managing director, Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, recently noted, according to Bloomberg.      The investment bank's research has found that $7 billion has flowed out of gold's exchange-traded funds (ETFs) since October, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has seen inflows of $2 billion during the same period. Grayscale's asset under management recently rose above $10 billion for the first time on record. Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.      JPMorgan said it expects that trend to continue and have a bearing on the yellow metal's price. While gold accounts for 3.3% of family office assets, bitcoin accounts for just 0.18%, according to JPMorgan's calculations. And while bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, its current capitalization of $343 billion is quite small compared with gold's market capitalization of over $10 trillion. As such, the transfer of cash from gold to bitcoin could bring in big losses for gold and gains for the cryptocurrency.      ""If this medium- to longer-term thesis proves right, the price of gold would suffer from a structural flow headwind over the coming years,"" wrote JPMorgan's strategists.

42405509,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMp9T,1607522621,First CoinSwap Test Could Herald an Era of Stronger Bitcoin Privacy,"CoinSwap, a promising Bitcoin privacy technology, was finally put to the test on Tuesday.      Bitcoin is not very private, despite the perceptions to the contrary. The full history of every transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is public for anyone to browse. CoinSwaps are a type of transaction that boosts a user's privacy by making that history much less straightforward.      ""A big day for bitcoin privacy and fungibility,"" tweeted Bitcoin privacy developer Chris Belcher when announcing the transaction. Belcher claims it's the first of its kind sent on Bitcoin's testnet.      CoinSwap transactions look like transactions going from one address to another, but they're actually being sent somewhere else. Further, CoinSwaps can be implemented in such a way that they look just like normal transactions, making them “invisible,” unlike the most popular privacy tools currently.      Belcher announced he was refocusing his Bitcoin privacy efforts on CoinSwapsinMay with the mission to ""massively improve"" Bitcoin privacy. Over the summer, he was awarded two grants from Square Crypto and the non-profit Human Rights Foundation to support his work.    A different Bitcoin privacy technology    Right now, it's easy to track where a bitcoin transaction came from. If the Bitcoin blockchain says that 0.1 BTC went from address A to address B, then that's probably what happened.      Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?      CoinSwaps use cryptography – math deployed for shielding digital information – to throw a wrench in these assumptions. They make it harder for blockchain viewers to know what's going on.      ""For anyone looking at the blockchain [Alice's] transaction appears completely normal with her coins seemingly going from address A to address B. But in reality her coins end up in address Z, which is entirely unconnected to either A or B,"" Belcher explained on Reddit.      A crucial piece of Belcher's test CoinSwap is that it uses multiple transactions.      This helps to preserve privacy. Because all blockchain data is public, one way blockchain spectators can tell that transactions might be related in a CoinSwap is if two transactions with the same value are being sent at the same time. Multiple transactions get around that.      ""Alice made a CoinSwap for 0.05 tBTC [testnet bitcoin] but nowhere on the blockchain is the actual value 0.05 tBTC found, instead any surveillance analyst spy would see the values 0.02919015, 0.01233641 and 0.00847344 for Alice and 0.01286471, 0.02457554 and 0.01245975 for Bob. Those numbers can be generated randomly using any algorithm, and the surveillance analyst spy would have a very hard time figuring out that the transactions are related at all,"" Belcher said.    Still much to do    This test is a big step – especially considering how complicated CoinSwap is under the hood. But there's still a lot of work left before users will be able to use CoinSwaps.      For example, Belcher's goal is to make the CoinSwap transactions indistinguishable from normal bitcoin transactions. The test Belcher provided Tuesday does not put this property into practice. Belcher test uses a 2-of-2 multisig address, which stands out from a normal transaction.      Eventually, this won't be the case. Belcher's goal is to make CoinSwaps and normal transactions look the same. His plan is to use the cryptographic protocol ECDSA-2P, to accomplish this.      ""This allows CoinSwaps to blend in with the rest of the bitcoin transactions out there,"" Belcher writes. This would give all Bitcoin users more privacy – beyond those executing CoinSwaps.      He offers the example of Carol, who doesn't use privacy transactions: ""Because Carol's transaction looks exactly the same as Alice's, anybody analyzing the blockchain must now deal with the possibility that Carol's transaction actually sent her coins to a totally unconnected address. So Carol's privacy is improved even though she didn't change her behaviour, and perhaps had never even heard of this software.""      This difference sets Coinswaps apart from CoinJoins, the most popular privacy-preserving transaction used on Bitcoin today. Though CoinJoins provide users with privacy, they stand out on the blockchain. CoinSwaps don't (at least if they're implemented the way Belcher plans to).    Future of Bitcoin privacy    But is CoinSwap the future of Bitcoin privacy? The jury is out.      ""I think Chris' work in this area is great. [...] This multi-transaction CoinSwap doesn't appear to be a panacea for privacy, but definitely moves us in the right direction, blending private Bitcoin transactions in with non-private ones,"" Blockchain.com security and privacy engineer Kristov Atlas told CoinDesk.      But he seemed jaded by Bitcoin's privacy levels.      ""I have low expectations for overall financial privacy in a world where only a small percent of Bitcoin users take advantage of privacy-protecting software. That's based partly on what we see in the web space, where a small number of users (e.g. those of Tor Browser) get to enjoy some protection against tracking, but mostly people are heavily tracked and their information sold,"" Atlas said.      That said, Belcher is optimistic for the future, especially with CoinSwap on the table. ""The future of bitcoin privacy and fungibility is bright. I continue to work on this project every day,"" he wrote.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/09/first-coinswap-test-could-herald-an-era-of-stronger-bitcoin-privacy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cf53f30f2477708490d5c5be240957b60ec0125f-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405519,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMpIK,1607522092,First Mover: Why Wells Fargo Won't Recommend Bitcoin to Clients,"Bitcoin was little changed, holding above the key psychological support level of $18,000 after a drop on Tuesday of more than $800, or 4.5%. But that decline was only the biggest in a week, in a reminder of just how volatile bitcoin prices can be.      The slide might have been triggered by blockchain data showing large cryptocurrency investors known as ""whales"" keeping sizable amounts of their bitcoin on exchanges, an indication that they could choose to sell at any time, Ki Young Yu, CEO of analytics firm CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair.      “An 80% increase in bitcoin price over only two months might be a profit too tempting not to take,” Lucas Huang, head of growth at decentralized exchange Tokenlon, told Sinclair.      In traditional markets, European shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open as a $916 billion U.S. stimulus proposal from the White House energized investor hopes for a year-end deal. Gold weakened 0.6% to $1,858 an ounce.    Market moves    After First Mover on Tuesday mentioned a report featuring bitcoin from an investment-research division of Wells Fargo, a media representative for the giant U.S. bank invited us to attend a Zoom call with reporters later in the day for mapping out the investing outlook for 2021.      We got a chance to hit the Wells Fargo Investment Institute analyst team with some of our favorite big-picture macroeconomic questions, such as how a secular shift toward remoteworking might affect everything from the labor market to commercial real estate to oil and travel stocks.      ""It touches every single asset class,"" said Darrell Cronk, Wells Fargo's chief investment officer for wealth and investment management.      And whether markets have become addicted to the trillions of stimulus money pumped into the global economy this year by governments and central banks, ostensibly pushing up traditional-asset prices from stocks to bonds to gold.      ""The markets are drunk on liquidity, and I don't think 2021 will be the year they have to sober up,"" said Brian Rehling, head of global fixed-income strategy.      Then, of course, we asked about bitcoin.      Regular readers will recall just how many times First Mover has reminded them of bitcoin's outperformance this year compared with U.S. stocks – up 169% in 2020, or 11 times the gains in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. And that while hindsight is 20/20, many investors often simply choose where to put their money in assets that have done well in the past, or into things where everyone else is going.      So the question was whether the Wells Fargo analysts were recommending bitcoin to clients.      The answer was no, with an asterisk: ""Clients cannot hold crypto at Wells, so we don't have an official recommendation,"" said John LaForge, head of real-asset strategy.      But aren't clients demanding to know why they've missed out this year on what is arguably the world's best-performing major asset?      ""We get the occasional question from clients, 'Hey, what do I do here?' but we're still not at that stage,"" LaForge said. ""From a regulatory standpoint there's still a lot of vagueness just generally in this space.""      That was about the extent of the exchange. Other reporters had questions, to,o that had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies, believe it or not, such as how the stock market might react if Democrats manage to take control of the U.S. Senate following next month's run-off elections in the state of Georgia, or if President-elect Joe Biden's administration might successfully push through tax increases.      The upshot for bitcoin investors might be twofold:      First, this year's frenzy in cryptocurrency markets has yet to grab the attention of retail investors to the point where big banks like Wells Fargo are rushing to meet the demand – or lobbying regulators and lawmakers for a quick resolution of any regulatory uncertainties so they can start selling the product.      Second, the fact that big banks like Wells Fargo are still not helping clients put money into bitcoin highlights the reality that many investors are still locked out of the market if they're relying on traditional financial services to aid them in saving for retirement or anything else.      Wells Fargo's Wealth and Investment Management division boasts some $1.9 trillion of client assets. Multiply that across all the world's big traditional financial firms that aren't really doing much just yet in the cryptocurrency arena. What would be the incremental demand for bitcoin if and when clients do eventually gain access via their traditional financial accounts?      Not all of those retail investors might choose to buy bitcoin, but some might want to, especially if bitcoin prices keep rising at uncanny clip, relative to traditional assets. Past performance is no guarantee of future success, but fear of missing out (FOMO) has proven a powerful motivator.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin has had a volatile day so far, with prices falling as low as $17,640 during the early European trading hours before charting a quick bounce to above $18,000. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading near $18,300, down roughly $1,000 from Tuesday's highs near $19,300.      According to Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, the dip below the psychological level of $18,000 spooked markets, causing heavy selling. ""There has been no real fundamental news to have driven the price and, as we have seen, the market has now recovered somewhat,"" Chung said in a Telegram chat.      For some observers, the latest pullback isn't surprising, and the long-term bullish case remains intact. ""Given how close the price is to bitcoin's all-time high, a certain amount of profit-taking and selling is to be expected,"" Su Zhu, CEO of Three Arrows Capital, told CoinDesk. ""I would consider any continued dumping on BTC to be undeniably bullish.""      Technical charts have turned bearish with the cryptocurrency's drop below $18,500. That was the key support, according to Ray Youssef, CEO of peer-to-peer marketplace Paxful, and its violation has opened the doors for further declines to $17,300.      There is evidence of investors scrambling for hedges to protect against further downside. The one-week put-call skew, which measures the value of short-dated puts relative to calls, has risen from -0.20% to 15% in the past 24 hours, according to data source Skew. It means that short-dated puts – a type of options bet that prices might decline – are now drawing higher demand than calls, which are bets that prices will increase.      The one-month put-call skew has also recovered from -21% to -7%, again reflecting a pickup in the hedging demand for puts. The majority of the activity has been concentrated in $17,000 puts, and $15,000 puts expiring this month.      Downside may be limited to $16,000, a level bitcoin nearly tested on Nov. 27 before turning higher to reached a record high of $19,920 on Dec. 1. “We believe there is strong support that should hold around $16,000, and if so, it sustains its bullish uptrend,” Dibb said.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Bitcoin’s Options Market Skews Bearish as Spot Price Loses Ground    What's hot    London’s Standard Chartered bank has gathered a group of crypto exchanges for a new digital asset trading platform tailored to the institutional market, according to two sources familiar with the plan (CoinDesk)      Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters (and former top lieutenant to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon) says digital currencies' widespread rollout is ""absolutely inevitable"" (CNBC)      Bank of America analysts say move to government-backed digital currencies could turn European banks into ""providers of balance sheet capital only,"" leaving fee income ""highly vulnerable"" (Barron's)      Saxo Bank floats possibility that “China’s new digital currency inspires tectonic shift in capital flows” as one of its “outrageous predictions” for 2021 (Saxo Bank)      Crypto exchange Huobi's HUSD stablecoin to run on Nervos blockchain (CoinDesk)      Prices for second-hand, lower-generation bitcoin mining machines have increased upwards of 40%-50% as manufacturers Bitmain and MicroBT experience multi-month backlogs on new equipment orders (CoinDesk)      Citi analyst cuts Microstrategy rating to ""sell,"" citing CEO Saylor's ""disproportionate focus"" on bitcoin (CoinDesk)      Digital-asset custodian BitGo gets into business of introducing crypto money managers to big investors like family offices, sovereign funds, pensions and endowments (BitGo)      Morgan Stanley investment division's chief global strategist, Ruchir Sharma, asks in op-ed if bitcoin will end the U.S. dollar's reign (FT)    Analogs  The latest on the economy and traditional finance    Portugal joins negative-rates club with benchmark bond (WSJ)      Million-dollar homebuying soars with U.S. rich on shopping binge as ""work-from-home phenomenon is enabling more buyers to live where they want"" (Bloomberg)      San Francisco median rent for studio apartment plunges 35% from a year earlier to $2,100 a month as workers flee for suburbs, Lake Tahoe and beyond (Bloomberg)      Standard & Poor's cuts New York City's debt-rating outlook to negative from stable as coronavirus hits tourism and subway ridership while threatening ""weakness in property tax values that will not be evident until fiscal 2023"" (Reuters)      McConnell refuses to back bipartisan stimulus, slowing talks (Bloomberg)      ""There no simple link between money and inflation,"" Exante's Jens Nordviq writes (Exante)      Bleak holiday ahead for millions of Americans seeing income drop (Bloomberg)      More than one in three jobless people in the U.S. have been unemployed for at least 27 weeks, up from pre-pandemic average of around 20% (Statista):    Tweet of the day",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Omkar Godbole, Sebastian Sinclair",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/09/first-mover-why-wells-fargo-wont-recommend-bitcoin-to-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ef5022614af34f71ef49ed5b177c7898151d60a-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, Germany’s Bankhaus von der Heydt (BVDH), established in 1754, is working with tokenization and digital asset custody technology provider Bitbond for the first direct issuance of a stablecoin by a banking institution on Stellar, the companies said.      Bitbond has already partnered with the Stellar Development Foundation and Tempo to use their stablecoin, and has received approval from the German regulator BaFIN to issue tokenized bonds, also on Stellar, said Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond founder and CEO.      “When using our technology to tokenize securities, you also have the payment method on-chain – but not as a volatile cryptocurrency, as a stablecoin,” said Albrecht in an interview. “Banks normally wouldn't feel comfortable using [stablecoins] like tether or USDC, due to the potential counterparty risk that is behind them. They prefer to work with stablecoins issued by banks, and the same is true for institutional investors.”      The stablecoin development comes months after BVDH experimented with tokenized securities on Stellar as well.      Read more: German Bank to Offer Tokenized Securities Based on Stellar    Crypto shift    Munich-based BVDH had enjoyed a pretty traditional boutique business in areas like securitization, fund administration and M&A. But a couple of years ago, it became very focused on digital assets, according to Lukas Weniger, BVDH business development.      The main shortcoming of stablecoins in circulation today, is the general lack of a fully licensed bank behind them, Weniger said.      “The stablecoin is a very sensitive product, and it requires a lot of trust from the users at the end of the day,” he told CoinDesk. “So if we look at other projects, for example Tether, there’s a kind of a trust issue. It relates to the fact Tether is not really publishing [its] audit reports and stuff like that.”      A fiat currency transfer is held at an escrow account at BVDH, which then triggers the issuance of the stablecoin, Weniger explained. Stringent regulatory and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements mean the stablecoin will not be openly traded on exchanges.

""Mastering Blockchain: Unlocking the Power of Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, and Decentralized Applications"" by Daniel Cawrey and Lorne Lantz from O’Reilly Media is a masterful guide on the essentials of blockchain technology.      Often a daunting and elusive subject matter, Cawrey and Lantz demystify blockchain technology by presenting history, breaking down fundamentals, and providing real-life implementations covering the space with clarity and precision. Years of research led to their intimate understanding of the technology, but it was the conversations along the way that sharpened their ideas.      Daniel and Lorne, both longstanding members of Silicon Valley Bitcoin and Silicon Valley Ethereum meetup groups, would have had their book launch in person under normal circumstances. But 2020 is anything but normal.      Networking can be tough even in normal times, but today's remote world adds a whole new set of challenges. The pandemic and its side effects changed the world. We no longer interact as much in person, and our information sources seem distorted. We're all playing the classic game of ""telephone"" where one-to-one means that information gets lost in translation.      In the aim of educating and bridging communities, CoinDesk is hosting its first-ever VR event with Cawrey and Lantz to celebrate their book launch on Dec. 15, 2020, at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT and 8 a.m. Singapore time). The authors are also providing a 30% discount code to purchase the book for VR attendees.      The event will livestream on CoinDesk.com, YouTube and Twitter as we chat about the book, socialize in VR and discuss the future of IRL and virtual events.      The VR afterparty is limited.

42405507,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMp6W,1607518800,OKCoin Agrees to List Blockstack's STX Token in US Following New Network Launch,"OKCoin said it will become the first U.S.-based crypto exchange to list Blockstack PBC’s stacks token (STX).      STX is expected to be available on OKCoin, an exchange with daily volume of around $30 million, as soon as Jan. 14, 2021, upon the completion of the Stacks Blockchain 2.0 launch, the company announced.      ""After our compliance team carefully reviewed the Blockstack statement of decentralization and the PoX mechanism, we've concluded it has successfully transitioned from a security to a utility token, and thus OKCoin can and make STX available to U.S. users for the first time,"" according to OKCoin’s chief compliance officer, Megan Monroe-Coleman, in an email to CoinDesk.      That presumes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't object to the STX transition and so OKCoin can be involved. The implication is explained in detail in a Twitter thread by Marco Santori, chief legal officer at crypto exchange Kraken.      Other than purchasing, trading and a scheduled airdrop of STX to OKCoin’s users, the listing of STX will enable OKCoin users to earn bitcoin as a reward by locking their STX on the Stacks Blockchain 2.0 network. It will be the first token to do so, said Haider Rafique, the chief marketing officer at OKCoin, in an interview with CoinDesk.      On Monday, Blockstack’s co-founder and chief executive, Muneeb Ali, outlined how STX could become a non-security, presumably with the expectation that the SEC wouldn't bring an enforcement action against the company upon completion of the Stacks Blockchain 2.0 and anticipated early next year.      Read more: Blockstack’s Stacks Tokens Could Be Tradable in US Amid New Blockchain Launch      Blockstack and its platform’s utility token STX became famous in 2019 when the company launched the first SEC-approved token sale through the securities market. But with the company retreating from a central role in issuing new STX, it has made the argument the token should no longer be considered a security and thus should become tradable by investors in the U.S.      “It gives most of these decentralized protocols a framework to operate in a way that they can transition from being a security to ultimately a utility token,” Rafique said. “Blockstack has paved the way in a framework to be able to do so.”      Stepping back, Blockstack aims to rival Google with a suite of decentralized applications that don’t fall prey to the data collection conducted by the Mountain View, Calif., tech giant. Blockstack even rolled out an anti-Google branding campaign in 2019: “Can’t be evil.” To date, however, adoption has remained niche.    OKCoin's aim    In the email to CoinDesk, OKCoin’s Monroe-Coleman said the legal memorandum revealed by Ali shows that retail users and investors in the U.S. can be “more confident in the legitimacy” of Blockstack’s transition from “a regulated security token to an open-source, decentralized blockchain protocol.”      The partnership between OKCoin and Blockstack came as a result of the two companies’ shared values of building and supporting Bitcoin’s core development, said Rafique, who also worked closely with the team behind Blockstack at his previous company, crypto firm Blockchain.com.      Read more: Blockstack’s New Consensus Mechanism Creates New Use Case for Bitcoin      Version 2.0 of the Stacks blockchain will require miners on the network to post bitcoin to mine a block, as CoinDesk previously reported. That bitcoin would then get shared with nodes maintaining a copy of the ledger.      OKCoin, founded in 2013, migrated its core business to San Francisco after a 2018 crypto crackdown by the Chinese government. The exchange has since rebranded itself as a regulatory-friendly exchange with licenses approved in countries including the U.S. and Japan.      The exchange also launched a funding program earlier this year to support Bitcoin Core developers, whose open-source coding improves the network.

42405521,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMpKI,1607517000,Valid Points: Ethereum 2.0 Soars Past 1M ETH Staked,"Since the epic launch of Ethereum 2.0 last Tuesday, there have been tons of data about its activity to decipher and analyze.      Early statistics shared after the first day of launch in our previous newsletter revealed how Eth 2.0 was inundated with 66% more funds than the minimum required to secure network operations. We were also able to view in real time the progression of over 100 epochs, in which more than 3,000 blocks were processed by validators.      Heading into the network’s second week of live development, we’re seeing the total amount of staked ether continue to rise for the network from 66% to 141% above the original threshold of 524,288 ETH. We’re also seeing a higher number of blocks and epochs finalized on the network, which is positively impacting the amount of rewards validators accrue daily.      We’ll take a deeper look at some of these Ethereum 2.0 metrics in our weekly Pulse Check. Then, for the New Frontiers essay, we’ll explore some of the scaling solutions to Ethereum that are being developed alongside the Eth 2.0 upgrade.      On with the show!    Pulse check    One full week has passed since the launch of Ethereum 2.0 on Tuesday, December 1.      Over that time period, deposits of 32 ETH (worth roughly $19,000 at time of writing) to the network have increased an additional 40% to 1.2 million ETH. This means that roughly 1.1% of the total circulating supply of ether is locked into securing the new proof-of-stake network. These funds will be immovable until developers enable a two-way bridge between the current Ethereum blockchain and Eth 2.0.      For now, users who have deposited the minimum amount of 32 ETH to Eth 2.0 can do little else with their funds except validate. Validating on Eth 2.0 primarily consists of proposing new blocks and attesting to blocks that other validators have proposed. With each proposal and attestation, validators earn rewards that are automatically added to their staked ETH.      The first day of Eth 2.0 brought an average earning of 0.00569 ETH. This is slightly higher than what we reported in our previous issue of Valid Points, which was 0.00403 ETH. (Our calculations counted the rewards earned from the first 100 epochs rather than the full 112 epochs initiated on that day.)      As explained in our first Valid Points issue, an epoch on Eth 2.0 is a cycle of time lasting roughly 6.4 minutes in which up to 32 blocks on the network can be processed.      While on the first day only 112 epochs were initiated, the subsequent days saw more than 1,500 epochs in which more than 42,000 blocks were proposed. As a result, average daily validator income has almost doubled to 0.011 ETH/day as of Tuesday, Dec. 8.      One final metric to highlight in today’s issue is the validator participation rate which, as of Monday, Dec. 7, is at an all-time high of 99.22%.      This chart illustrates what percentage of eligible validators on Eth 2.0, on average, are attesting and proposing blocks. A figure as high as 99% indicates nearly all users who have staked on Eth 2.0 and passed the activation queue for entry into the network are participating in consensus.      A high participation rate among Eth 2.0 validators comes as no surprise, given there is little else for users to do on the network. However, as network functionality broadens and the pool of validators continues to increase, we’re likely to see variations from this near-perfect figure.    New frontiers    Scaling Ethereum doesn’t only come down to Eth 2.0. In fact, Eth 2.0 could fail.      Luckily, Ethereum developers know this and have solutions on the table. When you’re attempting to build a new financial system, a backup isn’t a terrible idea.      Some are layer 2 (L2) throughput solutions like Rollups. Some depend on making the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) the go-to standard for smart contract blockchains. And there’s always making incremental adjustments to the current Eth 1.x blockchain with research from Eth 2.0.      This year, however, a new proposal, EIP 1559, has taken off in developer circles and looks likely to not only be a large part of making Ethereum usable in the near term, but also an integral part of the Eth 2.0 update.      First penned by Vitalik Buterin and a few other developers in 2018, EIP 1559 will help keep the Eth 1.x network humming along while Eth 2.0 continues in development.      It accomplishes this by addressing Ethereum’s biggest problem: fee pressure. Like Bitcoin in 2017, network fees continue to hamstring Ethereum-based projects during times of high market volatility. For example, Ethereum fees broke record highs numerous times in August and September due to demand for Ethereum blockspace from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, sending the cost of simple payments on MetaMask into the single or double digits.      EIP 1559 changes the Ethereum fee market in two ways: Implementing a dynamic fee paid in ether and burnt to the network, plus an optional tip feature to Ethereum miners.      Called BASEFEE, the burnt fee creates a lower bound on how much it costs to transact on Ethereum. The tip allows urgent transactions to jump the queue to be processed into a block and settled on the Ethereum blockchain. Of the two, BASEFEE has garnered more attention due to the game theoretical implications of imposing a consistent fee burn over the more traditional first auction model Ethereum currently uses.      Columbia University computer scientist Tim Roughgarden recently published a report fleshing out the possible consequences from a new Ethereum fee model.      Generally, he found the two largest positives from EIP 1559 are better fee estimation and a new deflationary pressure on ether.      Better fee estimation will make the dapp experience more slick and will lower fee variance, he said. Moreover, a new deflationary pressure on ETH through transaction burns is thought to be a positive for the long-run price implications of the digital asset.      Not only do users have to use ETH to use the network, a little bit is destroyed forever every time they do so. For example, a Dune Analytics dashboard modeling EIP 1559 if it were already active assumes some 1.23 million ETH worth $710 million would have been burnt in the last year. (Not surprisingly, Ethereum miners are less than enthused over the proposal).      That’s a long way of saying there’s a lot more going on than just Eth 2.0.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | RESEARCH,"Christine Kim, William Foxley",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/09/valid-points-ethereum-20-soars-past-1m-eth-staked,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fc6f3ffb4d950067461a467fb1b9f7f92d71b318-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405508,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMp7V,1607515239,Bitwise’s Crypto Index Fund Becomes Available to US Investors,"Bitwise Asset Management, a provider of cryptocurrency index funds to professional investors, announced Wednesday its 10 Crypto Index Fund is now available to U.S. investors as a public-traded cryptocurrency index fund.      After a Form 211 for quotation of the fund’s shares were reviewed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund was enabled to be listed on the over-the-counter markets and trades under the ticker symbol “BITW,” the company said in a news release.      Shares of the fund will be tradable through traditional brokerage accounts and the assets will be custodied with Coinbase Custody Trust Company.      The fund will track the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, a diversified, market-cap-weighted index of the ten largest cryptocurrencies. As of Nov. 30, the fund held approximately 75% bitcoin and 13% ethereum. According to Hunter Horsley, co-founder and chief executive of Bitwise, this gives investors exposure to cryptocurrencies “without trying to pick winners or having to constantly monitor the rapid changes in the space,”      “BITW is designed for financial advisors,” Matt Hougan, Bitwise's chief investment officer, said in an email response to CoinDesk. “Financial advisors are eager for a safe and easy way to allocate to crypto for clients.”      The news came after the company failed its attempts to win approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund.      While many exchange-traded fund (ETF) efforts have focused around bitcoin only, Hougan said that having a crypto index fund gives investors exposures to other cryptocurrencies, with several having outperformed bitcoin thus far this year.      Unlike an ETF, the BITW’s shares are exempt from registration with the SEC. Nonetheless, the launch of BITW will not stop the company from pursuing a bitcoin ETF, Hougan told CoinDesk.      Bitwise had more than $100 million in assets under management as of the end of October. The company attributed the significant growth to rising demand from hedge funds, financial advisers and multifamily offices.      “Crypto is about more than bitcoin,” said Hougan. “As phenomenal an asset as bitcoin is, it is far from the best-performing asset in the Bitwise 10. In fact, it’s the sixth-best performer year to date.”    Bitwise will not be entering this crypto fund space without facing some established competitors. Grayscale, the oldest and largest digital currency asset manager, also offers a similar investment product, Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, with about $170.6 million worth of digital assets holdings, according to a public available documenthttps://grayscale.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Grayscale-One-Pager-December-2020-Open.pdf by Grayscale in early December. (Grayscale is owned by DCG, the parent company of CoinDesk.)    Hougan clarified that Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund is not an index fund because it holds a basket of five crypto assets without tracking an index. And while Grayscale’s product requires a 3% management fee, BITW is slightly cheaper at 2.5%.

42405517,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeMpGM,1607515230,Bitcoin's Options Market Skews Bearish as Spot Price Loses Ground,"Bitcoin's options market has flipped bearish for the short term, as demand rises for ways to hedge against further sell-offs in the spot market.      The top cryptocurrency by market value fell to $17,640 earlier Wednesday, the lowest since Nov. 29. Prices later rebounded somewhat and bitcoin was last seen changing hands near $18,300, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Prices have declined by $1,000 in the past 24 hours, taking out crucial technical levels and triggering fears of a deeper decline in the short run. That's evident from the increased demand for put options highlighted by a positive turn on the one-week put-call skew.      The gauge measuring the value of short-dated puts relative to calls has risen from -0.20% to 15% in the past 24 hours, according to data source Skew. Essentially, short-dated puts are now drawing higher demand (or prices) than calls. The one-month put-call skew has also recovered from -21% to -7%, again reflecting a pick up in the hedging demand for puts.      The majority of the activity has been concentrated in $17,000 puts, and $15,000 puts expiring this month.      ""Over 300 contracts of $17,000 put with a notional value of more than $5 million have been traded on Deribit since midnight UTC,"" said Shaun Fernando, head of risk and product at Deribit, the biggest crypto options exchange by volume and open interest.      According to Matthew Dibb, CEO of Stack Funds, put options at $15,000 and $16,000 strikes have also seen increased purchases over the past week. ""Investors appear to be hedging before the year is out,"" he said.      However, the three- and six-month skews remain strongly in the negative territory, implying a bullish longer-term outlook.      Technical charts, too, indicate scope for an extension of the pullback from bitcoin's recently reached record price of $19,920.      According to Ray Youssef, CEO of peer-to-peer marketplace Paxful, $18,500 was a key support level, and its violation has opened the doors for further declines to $17,300.      Bitcoin's move below $18,500 has marked a downside break of the triangle pattern as seen on the daily chart. The 14-day relative strength index is now on the verge of crossing into a bearish territory below 50.      Downside may be limited to $16,000, a level bitcoin nearly tested on Nov. 27 before turning higher to reached a record high of $19,920 on Dec. 1. ""We believe there is strong support that should hold around $16,000, and, if so, it sustains its bullish uptrend,"" Dibb said.      Bitcoin has seen several pullbacks of more than 20% during previous bull runs that didn't break the upwards trend. At the current price of $18,200, bitcoin is down just 9% from the recent high of $19,920.      According to market analyst Joseph Young, the current bull run is different from the one seen three years ago. While the cryptocurrency could see more protracted periods of consolidation and decent pullbacks, ""that just makes bitcoin more healthy in the longer run,"" he tweeted.      That said, the market may be shaken if there is negative news about the financial health of the business intelligence company MicroStrategy, which has adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset.      Bitcoin's price slide of the past 24 hours has happened alongside a decision from Citi to lower the recommendation on MicroStrategy to ""sell"" from ""neutral."" An analyst cited CEO Michael Saylor’s “disproportionate focus” on bitcoin as a potentially troubling trend for the business intelligence company.      Also read: Citi Analyst Chides Saylor’s Bitcoin Focus, Cuts MicroStrategy to ‘Sell’      ""The concerns are that MicroStrategy’s recent foray into digital asset space will raise questions from regulators about its purchasing spree and also, some shareholders may voice their discontent about the move,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at the London-based prime brokerage Bequant, told CoinDesk. ""If indeed the company’s underlying position is much less rosy and the company’s financial health comes into question, it is the bitcoin holding that will be forced to be sold.""",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/09/bitcoins-options-market-skews-bearish-as-spot-price-loses-ground,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5c88f7c3daddeabc0c01a6dcbf13dfbae38f636-1200x732.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a filing with the U.K.'s business registrar Companies House on Tuesday, Coinbase UK reported turnover of €94.8 million (US$114.9 million) in 2019, down 38% from €153 million ($185.6 million) in 2018.  The turnover is derived from its cryptocurrency exchange service and debit card service, per the filing.  Coinbase UK reported after-tax profits of €5.1 million ($6.2 million) in 2019, down by 22.5% from €6.6 million ($7.9 million) the year before. Numbers have been rounded off.  According to the filing, Coinbase had no U.K. staff incurring costs in 2019 or the previous year, suggesting the local exchange operation is run entirely from its California headquarters.  Despite the drop in turnover, the aggregate value of customer funds held in wallets was €1.493 billion ($1.81 billion) at the close of 2019, up significantly from €741 million ($898.5 million) on Dec. 31, 2018.

Speaking at the Singapore Fintech Festival, Tuesday, ING blockchain lead Herve Francois discussed the work done so far with Pyctor, a custody and post-trade infrastructure for crypto assets that was included in this year’s cohort of the Financial Conduct Authority’s regulatory sandbox in the U.K.      Pyctor, a collaborative effort involving ING, ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas Securities Services, Citibank, Invesco, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and others, is designed to make banks feel comfortable handling crypto. The project involves layers of security such as multi-party computation (MPC) and hardware security module (HSM) technology, and is also decentralized, according to Francois.      “The Pyctor Network of Financial Institutions increases security of the custodied digital assets and removes single points of failure. These principles were the core design choices when designing relevant pilots with our partners,” he said.      ING is also focused on cryptocurrency from an anti-money laundering (AML) perspective, as one of the founding members of the TRP (Travel Rule Protocol), which includes Standard Chartered and Fidelity Digital Assets.      Prior to joining the FCA sandbox in July 2020, Pyctor conducted a first pilot alongside firms such as DLA, Piper, R3 Tata Consultancy Services and Securosys. This involved two asset managers serviced by their respective custodian, who transferred a token on Ethereum's testnet, representing a digitally native bond issued by Societe Generale's digital assets initiative, Forge.      The transaction validated Pyctor’s secure custody and asset transfer decentralized operating model, Francois said.      See also: ING’s Chief Economist Predicts Central Bank Digital Currencies in 2-3 Years      Within the comfort of the FCA regulatory sandbox, Pyctor conducted another pilot around its token issuance and management operating model. In this case, a smart contract involved in the token issuance on the Ethereum blockchain was operated from Pyctor private network, Francois explained.      “It was done in a decentralized manner using MPC and the newly issued tokens were safeguarded by a custodian of the Pyctor ecosystem,” François told CoinDesk via email. “The transaction was processed on the Ethereum mainnet, validating assumptions about the viability of using public blockchains.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/09/ing-bank-opens-up-about-crypto-custody-solution-at-singapore-fintech-event,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b81f6dc355aa8515a9e26b913e8bf26ab51939f7-2560x1554.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bertelsmann is a media company with a vast portfolio, including the largest publisher of books in the English-speaking world, Penguin Random House, as well as music publisher BMG.      The Berlin-based fund may be appealing to older companies because it is regulated by the German regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).      ""BaFin provides regulatory clarity and a safe haven for an institutional product like ours,"" Sebastian Blum, one of Greenfield's founders, told CoinDesk in an email, adding:    ""We have deliberately decided to structure all of our funds as an on-shore product to provide a high level of clarity and comfort for investors with no exposure to crypto yet. This caused additional scrutiny and complexity in fund formation on our end, but we believe that this turns out to be helpful in the long run.""    Founded in 2018 by Blum and Jascha Samadi, Greenfield has already made many blockchain investments under the auspices of its first fund, including in NEAR, Spacemesh, Arweave and Dapper Labs.      The firm has several smart-contract blockchains in its portfolio that could run decentralized finance applications – if existing projects start to migrate beyond Ethereum. ""There seems to be a trend emerging with existing Ethereum applications moving over to other ecosystems, which is something we are excited about even though we remain long term bullish on Ethereum,"" Blum wrote.      Read more: Audius, the ‘Decentralized Spotify,’ Is Moving Part of Its Service to Solana Blockchain      Previously, the company released a report on the state of governance across blockchain projects of all kinds.      ""For now, Greenfield One invests in the fundamentals of Web 3.0: The fund focuses on crypto networks and developer teams that use blockchain-based technology to create the infrastructure for Web 3.0 as a fundamental asset layer on the internet,"" according to a circular released by the company.      Bertelsmann did not reply to a request for comment from CoinDesk, but an in-house spokesperson did confirm the investment via email.      The new fund has also already closed investments from a major European family office known as Lennertz & Co., which invested in its prior fund. Greenfield declined to disclose the size of its first fund.

42385265,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnyoT,1607486400,India’s State-Regulated Digital Payments Network Is Dominated by Google and Walmart,"Google Pay and Walmart’s PhonePe continue to dominate the digital payments sector in India built on the country’s United Payments Interface (UPI), a shared payments infrastructure initiated by the state and joined by 200 Indian banks.      According to data released by UPI’s governing body, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), Google Pay accounted for about 45% of UPI’s transaction volume and PhonePe came in second with little over 41% of the pie for November.      Developed by the NPCI and regulated by the Indian central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, UPI enables both digital payments and peer-to-peer inter bank transfers. Launched in 2016, the network also clocked over 2 billion transactions last month, up from 1.2 billion transactions in November 2019. According to central bank data, the overall transaction count for digital payments in India stands at over 34 billion for the current fiscal year.      While the list of payment services using the UPI network also features other prominent names in the sector including Paytm Payments Bank, AmazonPay and Whatsapp Pay, their growth seems to have been sluggish so far. Facebook’s Whatsapp received approval in June to roll out payments services in India after a two-year long testing phase, but has managed to capture only about 0.31% of the market share so far.    See also: India Plans to Tax Income From Bitcoin Investments: Report    The UPI-based digital payments network is visibly dominated by the top three platforms, which account for over 93% of transactional volume. In an apparent move to counter such market dominance, the NPCI announced in November that no single app would be allowed to account for over 30% of UPI transactions on a rolling basis. The cap is supposed to go into effect starting January 2021, but local reports indicate there is little clarity on how the NPCI plans to enforce it.

42385268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAnypj,1607480613,"Bitcoin Price Drops $1,000 in Worst Sell-Off in a Week","Bitcoin has fallen precipitously in the past few hours and is testing a key level of psychological support near $18,000.      At around 06:00 UTC on Dec. 8, the price of the world's first cryptocurrency fell to around $18,031 from $18,770. It subsequently retraced slightly to $18,200 by press time, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.      The last time bitcoin experienced a similar drop was on Dec. 1 after the bellwether cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of around $19,920, per the BPI.      According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, the availability of sizable amounts of bitcoin on exchanges provided by large holders – ""whales,"" as they are often called – contributed to the price drop.      ""When it comes to short-term price prediction, I think the most important data is supply and demand, said Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant. ""I think this plummet was started from bitcoin ... whales who wanted to keep their bitcoin on exchanges making them readily available for sell orders.""      Others see recent buyers taking their winnings out of the market. Lucas Huang, head of growth at decentralized exchange Tokenlon, noted that from a retail trading perspective, ""an 80% increase in bitcoin price over only two months might be a profit too tempting not to take.""      Meanwhile, another signal may be coming from how Wall Street views the prospects of one particularly large buyer in recent months. Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citibank, downgraded his recommendation on business intelligence firm MicroStrategy to ""sell"" from ""neutral,"" flagging to investors bitcoin euphoria might be overextended.      Not everyone is bearish on bitcoin. ""Bitcoin's latest move down is a rest stop on the way to $30k levels by mid-2021,"" said investor Jehan Chu, co-founder of Kenetic Capital. ""Experienced bitcoin investors are well accustomed to these drops and understand them as opportunities to buy the dip. Longer term, we can expect these moves to become less frequent as institutional funds continue surging into the market and the volatility declines further.""      Yet, in the near term for technical analysts, the latest price action for bitcoin represents a continuing narrative of lower highs on the daily chart. That signals weakening buyer interest in the midst of increasing daily sell volume.      Should buyers fail to push prices above $18,600, a likely spell of further downside may break out as the short-term trend flips from bullish to bearish.
