42422895,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0qoPh,1601415992,Overstock Short Sellers Fall Short as Judge Gives Digital Dividend Claims Short Shrift,"Overstock.com and its former leader Patrick Byrne have prevailed over the dividend-doubting short sellers who cried foul (and filed suit) over the e-commerce site's issuance of a digital security.  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball tossed the federal class action first filed last September by short sellers who claimed they'd been hosed by Byrne.  The suit had been challenged by defendants as ""meritless"" when they called for its dismissal in May.  Plaintiffs accused Overstock of fraudulently pumping its stock with misleading financial projections and by promising to issue a digital dividend to shareholders via its tZERO subsidiary, an alternative trading system for digital securities.  That digital security's originally planned six-month lockup would have put the squeeze on short sellers unable to cover their positions. In their original filing in U.S. District Court, plaintiffs called it a ""secret plot"" by Byrne to exact ""revenge"" on short sellers  But if the plot was one for revenge, then it was hardly a secret: Judge Kimball said the digital dividend's ""broad media coverage"" undercuts plaintiff's claims that Byrne or Overstock ""deceived anyone,"" according to Law360.  While Byrne's very public hatred of short sellers is rivaled perhaps only by Tesla's Elon Musk, Judge Kimball said that's neither here nor there because Overstock had a ""legitimate business purpose"" for issuing its digital security.  ""Overstock was trying to transition from being a traditional online retailer to a blockchain technology business. The dividend was a creative way to strengthen that transition,"" Judge Kimball said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/29/overstock-short-sellers-fall-short-as-judge-gives-digital-dividend-claims-short-shrift,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bde1891b2c175054c9317437d633645c8e66eb84-2326x1574.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,757 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,621-$10,924  BTC above its 10-day moving average but below the 50-day, a sideways signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price dropped a couple of hundred dollars as a spate of selling took the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to as low as $10,621 on spot exchanges such as Coinbase, recovering to $10,757 as of press time.      Katie Stockton, analyst for Fairlead Strategies, says cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are affected by traditional markets, particularly equities, which are considered “risk-off” or liquid assets that can easily be sold during a market slide.      “Bitcoin has been attuned to the day-to-day moves in risk assets, but the end result of the intraday volatility is a consolidation phase on the chart,” said Stockton. “Short-term momentum has improved with equities, so I expect the consolidation to give way to a move that leaves support near $10,000 intact.”      Global equities markets are weak today, either flat or down:    Asia’s Nikkei 225 closed flat, in the green 0.12% as Japanese investors remained pensive ahead of Tuesday’s U.S. presidential debate.  Europe’s FTSE 100 ended the day slipping 0.51% as the U.K. and European Union signaled they are still a ways off on finalizing Brexit negotiations.  In the United States the S&P 500 slipped 0.30% as a resurgence of coronavirus cases in New York City helped to lead negative sentiment Tuesday.    Michael Gord, chief executive officer of crypto trading firm Global Digital Assets, senses a bearish mood for the crypto markets. “Bitcoin might get over $11,000 for a short period this week, but with a big exchange like KuCoin being hacked over the weekend I expect this week to have a more bearish sentiment with retail investors,” said Gord. “Institutional investors, on the other hand, might be taking this buying opportunity to buy cheaper bitcoin.”      Read More: KuCoin Maintains Wallet Freeze as Hackers Begin Laundering Stolen Crypto      Several stakeholders in the crypto market see a lack of yields coming from traditional markets as a sign cryptocurrency has a place in uncertain times.      “We are moving into a period of stagflation – stagnant growth and inflation – which creates a steepening of yield curves in the fixed income world,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank.      Indeed, U.S. Treasury yields have dropped in 2020 - the two-year maturity is at its lowest yield in over 10 years.      “I have a customer leaving bonds for bitcoin. I look at that as very bullish,” said Henrik Kugelberg, a Sweden-based over-the-counter crypto trader. “Bonds that are supposed to be the safest bet there is to actually make a buck on your invested money now all of a sudden seems less attractive than bitcoin.”    Uniswap volume dips    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Tuesday trading around $356 and slipping 1.5% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Bitcoin May Return to Center Stage After Ethereum's White-Hot Summer      Uniswap has had a stellar September, with the decentralized exchange, or DEX, having a record $953 million in volume on the very first day of the month. Since then, however, volume has declined.      Toward the end of Tuesday, volume was $312 million, lower than September’s $468 million daily average.      “Uniswap is by far the most successful decentralized trading venue, some days rivaling its centralized counterparts,” said Brian Mosoff, chief executive of Ether Capital.      However, volume doesn’t mean everything for a DEX: Mosoff points to Uniswap’s Tuesday record-high of $2.29 billion in liquidity, which is the depth, or availability, of assets traded on the DEX, as a metric traders should also consider.      ”Liquidity has just reached a new all-time high on Uniswap - this means that asset pricing is becoming more competitive and because of this it may capture the majority of trading volume once speculative activity abates,” Mosoff added.

Called Kadenaswap, the new DEX, unveiled Tuesday and set to debut late this year, will attempt to skirt Ethereum's surging gas fees and perennial network congestion (caused in part by the explosive success of Uniswap) by providing decentralized finance (DeFi) traders with an alternative platform that Kadena President Stuart Popejoy claims can handle high volumes.    Popejoy told CoinDesk his DEX will have no problem processing 480,000 transactions per second sitting atop Kadena's public blockchain, launched early this year.  Further, he said Kadena's existing bridge infrastructure, which currently facilitates cross-chain KDA token transfers via the Pact smart contract language, can easily port over to the coming DEX.  ""We already have production code with fully decentralized bridges, and so that creates an interesting opportunity to think of a multi-protocol, multi-venue DEX,"" Popejoy said.  Kadenaswap will incentivize DEX market makers to spread their token pools ""across the board"" in a bid to ensure adequate cross-chain liquidity, said Popejoy.

Monday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published the innocuously titled “Coinbase Is a Mission-Driven Company.”      While the post talked a lot about Coinbase’s core mission, its real goal seemed to be to make clear Coinbase would not be engaging with any other social or political issues beyond that, and to the extent employees wanted to do so they needed to do it on their own time.      The reactions were intense, immediate and in many instances, totally opposite.

42384827,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRUh,1601406074,Better Broadband Will Pave the Way for a 'Brand New World',"Bandwidth will be the defining factor of modern life and social evolution going forward. With increased access to the internet as well as ever-advanced computing, it’s likely the tone and tenor of human existence will change forever.      Augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and the ubiquity of cryptocurrencies will become fixtures of life a decade from now, but will only become popularized once the internet is everywhere, running at speeds we can hardly imagine.      This story is less about the possibility of downloading a feature length film in less than a second than the emergence of trillions of interconnected devices and people, making the web ever present. The year is 2030, and everything has changed.    James Altucher is an entrepreneur, angel investor, standup comedian and prolific author. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series about the future of the crypto economy.    We're upping a ""G"" (as in 4G, or fourth-generation broadband technology) almost every two years and expanding bandwidth at an exponential rate. With ""10G"" on our phones, we'll look back at 2020 and laugh about how slow the internet was and how Zoom calls were of such low quality.      With 100GB/ps we'll be able to not only work remotely, but work remotely in the same office. I can ""VR-port"" into work, go into my office, see my co-workers, go to meetings, all without leaving my home. Haptic sensors will not only make me feel everything I touch in Microsoft VROffice Suite but also massage my muscles so they don't atrophy, in case I work overtime.      See also: Crypto-Powered Internet Helps Rural Residents Work From Home During Coronavirus      We may become nostalgic for the days when it wasn't so easy to go into a complete virtual reality – composed of millions of pixels every centimeter – that will feel as real as any other reality once you’re transposed. Where is the solid ground?, you may ask yourself.      With broadband connection so advanced it’s hard to imagine it not becoming a natural right, as important a commodity as air itself, opposed to something you have to ""sign up"" for.      In a world where bandwidth and storage are 100% commoditized, everything will change. Here are the knock-on effects I predict will follow.    Augmented reality    Consider the scenario of my wife, Robyn, and me taking a walk, where we pass an Amazon 3D printing store. With augmented reality, she might see a coupon for bras while I see a coupon for some marijuana.      Augmented reality will exist seamlessly side by side with regular reality. Our worlds will be reshaped to meet our personalities, experiences and mood.    With convenience comes costs.    We'll walk by a restaurant and she'll see, about 12 inches in front of her eyes, the vegan menu and I'll see the paleo menu. A neighbor may pass and – if his settings are set for ""Everyone” – we'll see a floating image of the last movie he saw or recent photos from his latest vacation.      Or a listing of his political beliefs on display for all to see in case you want to have (or avoid) a conversation with him.    Crypto    When COVID-19 ended, everyone abandoned the expensive cities for safety, quality of life and financial reasons. And because bandwidth only increased while Zoom got easier to use, there was no more need for office buildings to be full. People could live anywhere and work in the 2D virtual office or in Microsoft VROffice.      With fewer people and companies, city tax revenues plunged just when deficits were spiking. Mayors in each city had to fire teachers, garbage collectors and police. Crime spiked, garbage was everywhere and fewer tourists wanted to enter the metropolis.      To combat these countervailing forces, some cities created a local cryptocurrency to provide incentives to stay and shop locally. New York City, for instance, created NYCBucks. Everybody in the city got a steady universal basic income (UBI) of NYCBucks, and everyone who visited NYC as a tourist got an allocation based on how many days they would be in the city.      You could only spend your NYCBucks in NYC. For every transaction both the buyer and the seller mined micro NYCBucks pro rata with the size of your transaction.      Tourism began to come back to cities. And businesses returned and required more employees to be local. Cities, for the moment, were saved.      The same method was applied at the federal level, with the U.S. unveiling USBucks shortly after.      See also: Jeff Wilser - The Man Who Forecast a Currency Cold War    Auto ecommerce    The widespread deployment of cryptocurrencies and wallets made it possible to financialize even the most mundane aspects of modern existence.      The smart refrigerator will read when you are running low on milk, complete a blockchain transaction with the wallet at the grocery store and a drone will make a milk delivery directly to the house. The more transactions the refrigerator does, the more USBucks are mined.      But it’s not just kitchen gadgets. Everything that can be chipped will be. This is a trend that has come to be known as acommerce, short for auto-ecommerce. The economy will thrive on these microtransactions. In other words, people will spend what they make.    Data storage    With convenience comes costs.      Because of VR and enormous blockchain demands following crypto’s mass adoption, cloud storage demands will be 1,000 times what they are currently. The biggest companies in the world – Amazon, Google, Dropbox, Apple – will only grow larger to meet and upkeep growing amounts of cloud storage data. Every day of 2030 will add up to more information and data created than the entirety of the human race from 2020-2025.    DNA computing    These monolithic companies, bolstered by growing profits, will make advances in DNA computing, an experimental form that seeks to bring the human body and machines closer together.      These new machines will be powerful enough to solve NP problems (“nondeterministic polynomial time” – or incredibly complex computer problems) meaning that today’s public key cryptography can be decoded.      For a time, Bitcoin, Ethereum and all public chains became essentially worthless. However, although quantum computing never worked out (the scientists realized that just the observation of a result could make it wrong), quantum cryptography was solved, thereby ensuring the safety of crypto and making it more resilient.    Genomics and gamifying enlightenment    See also: Ben Goertzel – AI for Everyone: Super-Smart Systems That Reward Data Creators      In 2020, genomics is in a state of 2D hibernation. Yes, the genome was sequenced and diseases based on single-gene mutations (e.g. Tay-Sachs) are regularly cured with CRISPR technologies, diseases based on multi-gene mutations are still impossible to compute.      DNA Computing will be suited to solve the problem, and able to discover the gene pairs that mutated for all cancers, heart disease, strokes and Alzheimer's. And then, later, IQ, emotional intelligence, athletic ability and charisma will be figured out.      The Chinese government will quickly use 3D Genomics to create a country of super intelligent babies. Nobody knows what the final result will be.      Though in the west, daily life will also increasingly be brought under the yoke of technology companies and the state. Depending on your DNA and other factors, the ideal number of steps, hours of sleep, hours of reading, Vitamin D, calories consumed and water drank will be counted each day. There will be no “biological privacy.”      It will be agreed that competition breeds the best results, so the health statistics of everyone in the country will be made public and ranked. Dating apps will be set up to match those with similar health. The healthiest, and most mentally fit, will receive direct payments of USBucks.      Will it be a better world? I have no idea.

42384830,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRYT,1601402924,Crypto Co-ops and Game Theory: Why the Internet Must Learn to Collaborate to Survive,"If the internet was a person, ARPANET was its first tooth, Facebook was the pubescent rage of middle school and Bitcoin was the key to its first car. Today, we find ourselves riding shotgun, unsure of what direction the internet will take next.      There are those who feel we’re about to careen off a cliff, and others who write off the internet’s dangers as inevitable growing pains of innovation.      The internet allows us to work together while simultaneously incentivizing us to tear each other apart. That dynamic isn’t sustainable for long. Perhaps over the next 10 years the internet will go through one more phase of reckless adolescence (who could forget their post-college twenties?) before arriving at the plateau of middle age and all of the wisdom, maturity and better judgment that comes with it.    Elena Giralt is product marketing manager at Electric Coin Co., the team that launched zcash. She runs Blockchain Latinx, a monthly meetup group that discusses blockchain, cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies. This post is part of CoinDesk's ""Internet 2030"" series about the future of the crypto economy.  Positive-sum games    At any given time on the internet, more than four billion people have the ability to collaborate or compete with one another. Through social networks, memes and subcultures take on a life of their own, iterating off of each other like a psychedelic fractal. On the internet, we create, play and share new games that have never before existed.      These games are helpful frameworks to model out the tension between selfish incentives and community benefits. Informally, a zero-sum game is a competition where one player’s gain is the other player’s loss. In contrast, a positive sum game is generally thought of as a win-win situation.    What is the optimal balance between cooperation and competition?    The key feature of positive-sum games is that collaboration leads to better outcomes than competition. That sounds great doesn’t it? But, in practice, collaboration often gives way to competition.      A decade ago, many people considered social networks like Facebook and Twitter positive sum games (look at all of the connections! all of the value generated! how fun!). Now the pervasive narrative is that our attention, our data and democracies around the world were a dear price to pay for the explosive growth of digital advertising.      Credit cards were also once considered positive-sum games – until you factor in predatory loans, crippling interest rates and discriminatory scoring systems. And for a moment it looked like liquidity mining was turning out to be another zero-sum wolf in positive sheep’s clothing. Or was it?      As communities shift from the monolithic platforms of Web 2.0 to the decentralized protocols of Web 3.0, it raises the question: what is the optimal balance between cooperation and competition?      See also: Yearn, YAM and the Rise of Crypto's 'Weird DeFi' Moment    Platform cooperativism    ""Platform cooperativism,"" coined in 2014 by New School Professor Trebor Scholz, establishes a framework for digital platforms that are cooperatively owned and governed by their users. Advocates of cooperative business models say they are more resilient, more equitable and more sustainable. To a crypto audience, this narrative should sound temptingly familiar.      More and more, people are demanding input over how platforms are governed and managed. They want to weigh in on content moderation on Facebook, ad standards for children on Youtube and predictive AI models used by law enforcement.      In his essay ""Exit to Community,"" Nathan Schneider said platforms should let the users decide these questions. He extolls the benefits of platform cooperativism and cites examples of big tech companies like Twitter considering this option. Vitalik Buterin seems to be a fan of this approach as well.      Governance tokens and auditable open-source code allow individual contributors to work together to determine the direction of a project. Airdrops and developer funds align incentives between end users and developers. Don’t think that cooperative models mean the absence of competitive mechanisms. In proof-of-work mining, individual nodes are pit against each other to compete for the block reward.      What makes these systems cooperative is that projects can update rules and redefine the game so long as they reach (and maintain) consensus among their members. On Ethereum, what started with gerbils in 2017 morphed into sushi three years later.      As we get better at coordinating, we will get better at reinventing and redefining the world we want to live in.    Twitterswap: What does this look like in practice?    Is platform cooperativism the way to turn a zero-sum game into a value-add system? It’s probably part of the solution but you can’t just shill some tokens and expect the community to follow. Let’s consider a hypothetical to better understand what positive sum games and participatory business models look like in practice.      See also: Jack Dorsey Details Twitter's Blockchain Strategy at Oslo Freedom Forum    From Twitter to Uniswap    In December 2019, Jack Dorsey announced that a special R&D team at Twitter was developing “an open and decentralized standard for social media.” Imagine if such a standard was released and widely adopted within the next decade.      This move could help correct some of the challenges faced by social media today. For starters, it could assuage antitrust concerns. It could also cut down on bot activity and ad fraud. These platforms already have enormous developer communities who could quickly start building, hacking and integrating these networks to other services, spreading more open, decentralized standards across the web.      Uniswap’s new governance token illustrates how powerful aligning incentives can be to protect a cooperative platform. By rewarding its users, Uniswap not only doubled its liquidity but also ensured the continued cooperation of community members. While people have been writing about crypto coops and Ostrom’s principles for years, examples like Uniswap prove that these models can bear fruit and are worth implementing.    It is imperative that we consider a better future is possible without deluding ourselves into thinking it will happen naturally and without sacrifice.    Now, imagine a governance token for Twitter. Imagine a mechanism that would allow users to weigh in on protocol upgrades, community rules and business strategies. While this scenario is extremely unlikely given that the top three investors of Twitter are Vanguard, BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, it is still fun to consider.      In this world, Twitter users would not only have an incentive to improve the platform, but they would also have to coordinate with each other to do so. Developers would need to coordinate with each other to maintain a reliable and secure standard. End users would need to coordinate to understand the impacts and second-order effects of community decisions. If users in the United States want to remove all political advertising on the platform or censure politicians for violating community guidelines, how does that impact political dissidents in China or Belarus?      There are challenges with decentralized governance and cooperativism. Earlier this year, when a single hacker hijacked multiple high profile accounts, Twitter admins were able to freeze accounts and isolate the issue. This would have been a feat more difficult to coordinate in a decentralized system.    Keep your hands on the wheel    Whether you believe the internet is driving us through dark forests or digital gardens, this is not going to be a smooth ride. It is imperative we consider a better future is possible without deluding ourselves into thinking it will happen naturally and without sacrifice.      See also: Jonathan Beller – How We Short Capitalism – And Finance the Revolution      In his latest post on Coordination, Buterin describes an unsettling feature about cooperative games, “We can prove that there are large classes of [cooperative] games that do not have any stable outcome ... In such games, whatever the current state of affairs is, there is always some coalition that can profitably deviate from it.”      The internet in 2030 will be exciting and in flux. However, if we keep our hands on the wheel, focusing on shared objectives and aligned incentives, we should be able to steer ourselves in the right direction.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | FORKS,Elena Giralt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/29/crypto-co-ops-and-game-theory-why-the-internet-must-learn-to-collaborate-to-survive,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b79229ac207e84cffe2e786413f69e864d960eba-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384829,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRXD,1601397189,How the Crypto Industry Seesaws Between Assets and Infrastructure,"In the beginning, there was bitcoin. And with bitcoin, a new asset was invented. And with that new asset, the way we interact with capital was redefined.      Bitcoin achieved both of these things. It created a new form of money: one that needed neither central banks nor collateralization. One that was provably scarce and governed only by code and those who wrote and ran it.      It also created a new model for ownership, trading and transacting. This new model required no third parties or middlemen. It meant that anyone could directly control their assets and could transfer them in a purely peer-to-peer manner. A new form of money. A new model of ownership.      With bitcoin, there was born a new industry. The cryptocurrency space. The blockchain world. The creation of bitcoin spawned thousands of new assets and just as many new ways to interact with those assets. And while these two forms of innovation – assets and infrastructure – have often occurred side by side and have frequently happened under the same banner, they should not be confused. New assets do not necessarily create new experiences of ownership and trade. Similarly, new models of ownership and trade do not always require new assets.    Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.    The fact that bitcoin marked the invention of both a new asset and new infrastructure has long been a source of confusion and has resulted in the conflation of the two. It’s time we started noting the difference.      The industry, while rarely recognizing it, has pivoted back and forth over the years between prioritizing the creation of new assets and prioritizing the building of new infrastructure.      The period from 2013 to 2015 saw the emergence of altcoins like zcash, monero, ethereum, Ripple, litecoin, dogecoin and a multitude of others. These represented new assets. Some of these new assets also offered users fundamentally new ways of interacting with their assets and with each other: privacy and programmability, for example. Others did not offer much that was new at all, besides branding. The cryptocurrency universe was left holding many bags it wasn’t quite sure what to do with.      See also: Jill Carlson - What Goldman Gets Wrong About Bitcoin (From Someone Who Used to Work There)      From 2015 to 2016, having learned the lesson that not all new assets are valuable, much of the interest in the industry turned to building new infrastructure around old assets. The whole enterprise blockchain space was born. Companies like R3, Chain, Symbiont and Digital Asset focused their efforts on re-platforming legacy financial products like equities, bonds, derivatives and swaps.      These companies sidestepped the challenge of creating new assets. What they encountered, however, was the potentially even bigger problem of how to create new, peer-to-peer models of ownership and trade around old, entrenched asset classes that today rely on rich, powerful third parties.      Tiring of this slog, the collective attention of investors and operators returned to new assets. 2017 and 2018 were, as anyone will recall, the year of the ICO: initial coin offerings. Tezos, Polkadot, 0x: again, some of these new assets also offered fundamentally novel experiences for their new owners.    Before long (and perhaps sooner than I anticipate) we will see this pendulum of interest swing back from infrastructure to innovation around assets themselves.    Many others – far, far too many to mention here – did not. Much value had been extracted in the form of unprecedented fundraises, but in many cases, not much value was created, even in the cases where networks were launched and assets were issued. The reckoning around this became known as crypto winter.      And then, over the last two years, we saw a return to innovation around infrastructure and experiences of ownership and trade. The rise of decentralized exchanges, fresh competition among wallet providers, the creation of blockchain-based lending and borrowing protocols. All of this, much like its enterprise-oriented predecessor, has been much more an experiment around how we interact with our assets than an exercise in attempting to invent new assets themselves.      This experimentation in decentralized finance has, in many ways, proven fruitful. People, albeit a limited number for now, are for the first time able to conduct two-way, purely digital trades, without relying on centralized third parties to custody and escrow their assets or to provide liquidity. The primary limitation of this new infrastructure lies in the fact that many of the assets that are compatible with it still do not represent fundamental, durable, long-term value.      See also: Jill Carlson - Me, Myself and My Multiple Avatars      There has emerged a pattern of fluctuation back and forth between innovation in crypto assets, discovering the challenges, turning to build blockchain infrastructure, running into roadblocks there and back. Before long (and perhaps sooner than I anticipate) we will see this pendulum of interest swing back from infrastructure to innovation around assets themselves.      Indeed, we are already seeing this in the world of decentralized finance in moves like Uniswap (an infrastructure project) issuing a token. The persistent rise of community- and governance-tokens more generally represents a continued search for a way to issue new, decentralized assets imbued with fundamental value. Renewed attention on non-fungible tokens and the significant traction among certain, primarily artist-affiliated NFTs also indicates a swing back in the direction of emphasis on assets.      The resurgence of conversations around “Initial Country/Currency Offerings” and central bank digital currencies also represents a possible direction for porting real-world value into the digitally native universe of blockchains. I also suspect this exploration will drive interest back to Bitcoin, one of the few blockchain-native assets that seems to have proven its value.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ZRX | TOKEN SALE,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/29/how-the-crypto-industry-seesaws-between-assets-and-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b4377a036bc58846f45eece7218b323b4e5d84ea-1420x945.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Top shelf    Brokerage raise European crypto brokerage Bitpanda has raised a $52 million Series A led by Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures, to be put to use expanding the company’s payroll and adding a variety of products. Next year the Vienna-based firm intends to expand to “all kinds of asset classes” including stocks. In an interview, the firm’s co-founders told CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen France, Spain and Turkey were among the fastest-growing crypto markets out of the roughly 34 countries the platform serves.      Regulator reprised California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Friday that increases the scope of the state’s financial regulator. Renamed the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, the agency is now equipped with ""new tools to shape the regulation of virtual currency” and enhanced abilities to crack down on unlicensed or deceptive financial services and products. The new law will also create an Office of Financial Technology Innovation to engage with emerging financial products such as cryptocurrencies and a division to oversee markets.      Hard fork Artificial intelligence and data service Ocean Protocol has suspended its old contract on the Ethereum blockchain and hard-forked its project, following the $150 million KuCoin hack. On Sunday at 22:00 UTC, Ocean Protocol announced it had migrated from its old token address to a new one to thwart the KuCoin hacker’s attempts to offload 21 million OCEAN tokens worth some $8.6 million. “Moving contract addresses has effectively blacklisted the hacker’s stash of OCEAN tokens. But it also raises questions of the project’s true immutability if the protocol can be effectively hard-forked in one weekend,” CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports.      Corporate statement Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong published a blog Sunday calling the company “mission focused,” with the underlying message that it won’t engage on political or social topics outside its domain of open finance. That said, employees are expected to pursue social activism in their own time. CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports the blog has “split the crypto industry straight down the middle,” with many commending the public stance while others deem it regressive. For instance, Boost VC’s Adam Draper said focusing on a “unified mission” was the only way to achieve its goals. Others in the Twitterverse have called the message out-of-touch, and a way to downplay issues that directly affect employees’ lives.      Maker doubts? A class-action lawsuit alleging the Maker Foundation and others knowingly misrepresented the risks of investment has been sent to arbitration. The case centers around plaintiffs who claim to have incurred six-figure losses during the “Black Thursday"" crash in mid-March and allegations that Maker’s stewards misrepresented the security and collateralization of the platform. The DAI stablecoin is over-collateralized, they argue. In an order last Friday, Judge Maxine Chesney granted a motion by the Maker Foundation to refer the case to the American Arbitration Association as specified in a clause in the foundation's terms of service.

CeFi In an exclusive CoinDesk interview, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he fully expects decentralized finance (DeFi) to cannibalize his own crypto exchange.      “Our mission is not to build a CeFi exchange,” Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen, using a shorthand term for centralized finance. “Right now it is one of our larger businesses that support our growth. But over the long term, we want to push decentralization.”      Zhao’s comments reflect the growing competition between centralized exchanges and their more community-driven alternatives. Faced with quick-moving projects that can iterate week to week, Zhao is tasked with evolving the world’s largest crypto exchange (by volume) to something that can meet the moment.      At a micro-scale this battle played out between Uniswap, a venture-backed automated market maker (AMM), and its upstart clone Sushiswap, which features a governance token. As reported, Uniswap responded to the challenger by integrating its own governance token – a means to spreading the wealth among its community members.      Uniswap is part of the DeFi ecosystem currently threatening exchanges like Binance, Huobi and Coinbase. In recent months, Binance has been targeting the DeFi ecosystem as a growth sector.      “The company’s new foray into DeFi, Binance Smart Chain, attempts to replicate some of the features of the Ethereum blockchain that have proven fertile for developers building decentralized, blockchain-based trading and lending applications that theoretically could one day challenge traditional lenders and Wall Street trading firms,” Shen reported.      But building decentralized systems is difficult. The Binance Smart Chain is run by only 21 nodes and the majority stakeholder of its native BNB tokens remains Binance.      Zhao said this comparatively centralized structure was to better compete with Ethereum.      “So in my mind, I’m never worried about the business model,” Zhao said. “I’m always much more worried about if we have users using the product. There’s always multiple options for business models, so the key is to build something that’s useful.”    Market intel    Alt-season? Some digital asset traders say they’ve been rotating funds out of alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins) into bitcoin (BTC) in anticipation of the leading cryptocurrency significantly outperforming the entire crypto market for at least the next several months. CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reports bitcoin is down so far in September, dropping more than 10%. Still, bitcoin became “under owned” during the DeFi craze, according to Kyle Davies, a prominent DeFi investor and co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, and likely correction is due to follow. Kevin Zhou, co-founder of San Francisco-based Galois Capital, outlined a similar theory.    Tech pod    Latest testnet Ethereum 2.0 developers have launched yet another testnet, this time to give on-boarding stakers a dry run before the launch of Eth 2.0 sometime this fall. The testnet, called Spadina, follows the official Ethereum Foundation’s Medalla testnet which launched in early August and will only be in use for the next three days while Eth 2.0 stakers practice joining the network with the testnet. “The main objective is to give us all another chance to go through one of the more difficult and risky parts of the process – deposits and genesis – before we reach mainnet,” Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan blogged.    Op-ed    Rethink CoinDesk Executive Editor, Operations & Strategy Pete Pachal penned a response to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong’s recent public statement and the division his “mission-focused” stance has stirred. “Armstrong’s position isn’t a message to Silicon Valley heavyweights to turn back the clock on employee “wokeness” – it’s an open letter to every other corporate leader, urging them to connect the dots between the political positions they might be taking and the central mission of their companies. And if the result is a picture they don’t like, rethink,” Pachal writes.      Stability? Shiv Malik, author and head of growth at Streamr, thinks crypto needs a euro-pegged stablecoin. The U.S.’ recent social and political upheavals are placing serious strain on the dollar’s future hegemony. “And if America is so precariously balanced between further prosperity and potential disaster, so, too, rests the fate of the U.S. dollar for the rest of the world. Just the issue of U.S. Treasury debt issuance alone has had professional money managers warning this month that the U.S.’s reserve currency status is under threat,” he writes.

42384835,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRel,1601396466,Permission.io Has Quietly Raised $50M to Make Advertising Personal and Data Private,"Permission.io is a platform that pays users in ASK tokens for engaging with, or even looking at, ads. Built on a fork of the Ethereum blockchain, the Permission platform incentivizes users to grant advertisers and other merchant participants access to their time and data in a peer-to-peer way.      Over the past 12 months, the startup has raised $5 million through a token pre-sale, and recently closed another round of funding that put the company at $47 million raised through equity financing. And since the platform came out of beta a few weeks ago, it has over 450,000 users, according to the company.      “Our model is all about advertisers being able to pay individuals directly through crypto, where advertisers’ return on their investment will go up dramatically,” said Permission CEO Charlie Silver. “Everybody's happy and everybody wins. The user is now being compensated for what typically, today, companies like Google and Facebook are being compensated for.”      See also: Twetch Launches Encrypted Messaging, In-Chat Payments on BSV Blockchain    Data ownership: How users give Permission    The idea of shifting the benefits of ads back toward users and advertisers rather than middle men isn’t necessarily new. The Brave browser, for example, has let its users choose whether or not to turn on their rewards token system in exchange for viewing ads since its official launch in 2019.      Silver, while complimenting Brave’s leadership in the area, is quick to point out how Permission is different. He said Brave is purely a browser that collects no data, contending the ads people are served are random.      Permission, on the other hand, allows people to be served ads through their “behavioral data.” Behavioral data means ads are served based on activities such as brand interactions and content consumption.      “By the end of the year, users will have access to a feature called ‘MyData,’ which will allow them to input specific data points around preferences that will create even more precise ad targeting, and also restrict the ability of brands to reach users that aren't interested in their products,” said Silver.      Silver said this tool will allow users to directly revoke or manage their data, with Permission acting as an agent for this data rather than a middle man.      All data generated through Permission, regardless of source, is anonymized on the advertiser end, according to SIlver. While Permission will know which data is tied to a person (for the purpose of awarding ASK Coins) advertisers won’t be able to link it to an individual.      See also: Tor Project Launches Membership Program to Boost Agility, Funds      The startup has integrated with the payments provider CoinPayments, which is accepted by over 3,000 merchants and retailers, to enable people to use various cryptocurrencies like ASK for online purchases.      When you sign up for Permission, you earn some ASK for doing so. You're then free to go throughout the platform and “shop and discover product videos that would be of interest to you,” according to Silver.    Tailored advertising: How merchants get Permission    There are two ways that merchants can connect with customers through Permission. First, Permission hosts its own Shopify store where it lists all the participating merchants in its program.      Second, Permission enables merchants to install its plugin on their own Shopify store sites.      “We've built plugins for Shopify and Magento, so e-commerce merchants can simply install a plugin, which will allow them to offer ASK on their site and reward their customers,” said Silver. “So on Permission we’re working to show the efficacy of this kind of permission-based ad delivery.”      For example, a shoe store on Shopify could plug into Permission and display its ads in the Permission marketplace, reward people with ASK for viewing tailored advertising, and then let people purchase their goods in the Permission.io marketplace, using ASK.      To test this, I logged onto Permission.io (I earned 100 ASK for doing so), and was taken to the marketplace dashboard, where a number of ads were displayed to me. One was for a pair of steel-toed sneakers, and I clicked on it.      After watching a 30-second video of someone jumping around in the sneakers and having their steel toe-protected foot rolled over by a car, I earned 100 ASK.      At this point I only had 200 ASK in my wallet, but if I were to complete enough tasks and earn enough ASK, I could spend it on these sneakers, foregoing U.S. dollars.      See also: Social Engineering: A Plague on Crypto and Twitter, Unlikely to Stop      “While we will promote those stores on our platform, ultimately we're looking to help eCommerce merchants drive traffic and conversion to their own stores,” said Permission CTO Hunter Jensen. “By installing our plugin, users will interact with the merchant's store but will be able to earn ASK along the buying journey.""      Silver said he thinks the Permission model is a key part of data ownership and sovereignty, based around the user, rather than companies like Google and Facebook.      “Our goal is to really build what we call the permission economy, where millions of websites are offering their users ASK to engage with them on various levels,” said Silver.",POSITIVE,BSV,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MINING | BSV,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/29/permissionio-has-quietly-raised-50m-to-make-advertising-personal-and-data-private,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9132b491d58751b7ab89c1baa2d35f500f1cce5f-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384840,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRN9,1601395592,Bitcoin May Return to Center Stage After Ethereum's White-Hot Summer,"With the U.S. elections just five weeks away, the crypto market's focus looks to be shifting back to bitcoin and away from ether and the Ethereum ecosystem.    The spread between the six-month implied volatility (IV) for ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), a measure of expected relative volatility between the two, fell to a 2.5-month low of 4% over the weekend, according to data source Skew.  The metric has declined from 21% over the past four weeks.  The spread's reduction indicates that the market doesn't expect a lot of dispersion between the two coins and foresees ether trading in line with bitcoin in the near term.  Implied volatility is the market's expectation of how risky or volatile an asset would be over a specific period and is driven by net buying pressure for options and historical price volatility.  ""The decline could signal a change in market leadership back to bitcoin after a couple of months focus on the Ethereum complex,"" Skew's CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin has matured as a macro asset since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in March.  As such, it could lead the price action in crypto markets in the run-up to and following the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, which could be the most contentious in recent decades and have a significant impact on traditional markets.  The six-month ether-bitcoin IV spread rose sharply from 0.9% to 15% in July and reached a high of 21% in mid-August, as the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom boosted interest in ether.  The total value locked in the DeFi platforms, most of which are based on Ethereum's blockchain, quadrupled to over $8 billion in July-August and recently rose to record highs above $11 billion, according to DeFi Pulse.com.  As such, ether options drew greater demand than bitcoin, leading to a rise in volatility spread. Options are hedging instruments that give holders the right to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price.  ""ETH volatility had gone to a premium due to increased demand for options at higher prices. That demand is now subduing a bit, and leading to a mean reversion in the ETH-BTC volatility spread,"" Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of Polychain Capital-backed derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  The ether-bitcoin one-month realized correlation coefficient has also risen back to 0.80, having declined from 0.90 to 0.57 in July-August, as per data provided by Skew. A coefficient of 1.0 means two assets are perfectly correlated while 0.0 means they are not correlated at all.  At press time, bitcoin is trading at $10,750, having faced rejection near $11,000 on Monday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

Shortly after that, four batches of roughly four million tokens apiece flowed into yet more sub-wallets, where they appeared to sit at press time.  The XRP is only a drop of the $281 million in cryptocurrencies (especially bitcoin, Tron tokens, Stellar tokens and Ethereum tokens) that tracing firm Elliptic estimated was stolen from KuCoin over the weekend.  Ethereum-based tokens in particular dominate the haul. Hackers made off with $150 million total in tether, chainlink and other Ethereum-based tokens, Elliptic said.  The hackers have largely failed to sell those tokens on closely guarded centralized exchanges which quickly flag and often block hacked funds.  Still, by Monday, Elliptic said that hackers had already flipped millions of stolen tokens for $7.5 million in ethereum (ETH) on decentralized exchanges (DEX) Kyber Network and Uniswap.  Elliptic, which is now eyeing that ETH, said in its Monday blog post that the laundering will likely continue on DEXs.  KuCoin maintained its post-hack deposit and withdrawal freeze well into Tuesday.

The New York-based exchange said in a blog post Tuesday it had added ""shielded"" zcash withdrawals – meaning users can take assets off the platform without disclosing their identities or the size of their transactions.  The addition comes after Gemini received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services.  The exchange claims it's the first time shielded zcash transactions have ever been supported on a regulated exchange.  ""[W]ith the right controls in place and the proper education, regulators can get comfortable with privacy-enabling cryptos,"" the blog post reads.  “This announcement demonstrates that zcash is compatible with a robust AML/CFT regulatory regime,” Jack Gavigan, head of regulatory relations at the cryptocurrency's lead developer, Electric Coin Company, said in a statement, referring to anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism.  Gemini, which only supports 24 digital assets, first listed zcash back in 2018. It has been registered under a Limited Purpose Trust Charter – which authorizes it to perform certain bank-like functions – since 2015.  Although users have been able to deposit zcash into Gemini with the shield feature, they have previously been forced to turn off privacy settings in order to withdraw assets from the platform.  A Gemini spokesperson declined to provide further comment, pointing CoinDesk instead back to its blog post.  Last year, several exchanges dropped zcash and other privacy coins, citing regulatory compliance and concerns over money laundering.

DeFi protocols UniLend Finance and PlotX announced Tuesday they had both successfully completed their seed rounds.  UniLend, a lending protocol, raised $3.1 million in a round led by Woodstock Fund, which includes data oracle provider, Band Protocol, in its portfolio.  (Disclosure: The author of this article has previously worked for one of the investors in UniLend, but has no current relationship.)  Meanwhile, DeFi prediction market platform PlotX raised $2.4 million in seed, including a commit from NGC, whose portfolio ranges from Algorand and Zilliqa.  The appeal of DeFi for investors has rapidly grown, as total value locked (TVL) increased more than tenfold over the summer, according to DeFi Pulse.  Just in the past couple of weeks, Linear Finance has finalized a $1.8 million seed round, and Dune Analytics, which specializes in providing data on the DeFi space, raised $2 million.  The raises for UniLend and PlotX come as the local cryptocurrency industry is finding its feet again after the Supreme Court of India overturned a two-year ban, imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), that prevented cryptocurrency companies from accessing mainstream financial services.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a UniLend spokesperson said the lifting of the ban had been part of a broader thaw, as India's government becomes ""increasingly progressive"" on the question of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  The spokesperson added that investors are turning to India as the hub for promising new blockchain projects.  ""With such a strong base of developer talent and a rapidly growing community of crypto enthusiasts, India is poised to become a leading hub of blockchain innovation and people are increasingly recognizing this,"" they said.

42384836,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRdV,1601384525,First Mover: Binance CEO Sees Future in DeFi While Bitcoin Volatility Turns Minuscule,"It might be part of every job in crypto to anticipate and react to fast-moving developments that seemingly change the industry's direction overnight.      And apparently not even Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the high-profile leader of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is immune to the industry's capricious shifts.      In a video interview with CoinDesk's Muyao Shen, Zhao acknowledged that the emerging blockchain sector of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, could eventually upend the business that Binance has grown to dominate: running a centralized cryptocurrency exchange.      “Our mission is not to build a CeFi exchange,” Zhao said in the interview, using a shorthand term for centralized finance. “Right now it is one of our larger businesses that support our growth. But over the long term, we want to push decentralization.”      The company’s new foray into DeFi, Binance Smart Chain, attempts to replicate some of the features of the Ethereum blockchain that have proven fertile for developers building decentralized, blockchain-based trading and lending applications that theoretically could one day challenge traditional lenders and Wall Street trading firms.      Like rival cryptocurrency exchanges OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase, Binance is trying to hold on to its central role in digital-asset markets as upstart DeFi projects like Uniswap, Curve, Balancer and SushiSwap attract a bigger share of industry trading volumes. Zhao says he’s open to the idea that Binance may have to adapt its business model to stay relevant, especially with total collateral locked into DeFi protocols surging 16-fold this year to $11 billion.      In designing Binance Smart Chain, the company had to sacrifice elements of decentralization to compete against Ethereum and protect the company’s brand. Binance Smart Chain is controlled by 21 node operators, which are elected by Binance Coin (BNB) holders. But because the company is one of the largest holders of the BNB tokens, it retains significant control over the project’s direction.      “There is a trade-off between more decentralization versus speed, so we thought that 21 nodes run by the community is probably enough,” Zhao said in the interview.

The spread between the six-month implied volatility (IV) for ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC), a measure of expected relative volatility between the two, fell to a 2.5-month low of 4% over the weekend, according to data source Skew.      The IV spread peaked at 21% in mid-August and has been declining ever since.      ""The decline could signal a change in market leadership back to bitcoin after a couple of months focus on the Ethereum complex,"" Skew's CEO Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk.      The impending U.S. elections could be the most contentious in modern history and have a significant impact on traditional markets. As such, bitcoin, which some investors argue has evolved into a macro asset over the past six months, could lead the price action in the crypto markets in the near term.      - Omkar Godbole    Token Watch    Filecoin IOU (FIL): Three years after $257 million initial coin offering, blockchain-based data-storage provider says main network is set to launch around mid-October.

In a letter to a senior executive at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street's self-regulatory body, the SEC's trading and markets division said exchanges that go to lengths to comply with existing regulation will not face sanctions.  As well as conforming to federal securities law, the SEC, which has jurisdiction over FINRA, said such entities will need to introduce procedures that assess if listed digital securities have been sold legitimately throughout their lifetimes.  This includes checking the initial offering was either properly registered or came under a valid exemption, as well as ensuring secondary market transactions are also compliant.  The SEC's clampdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs) means it is often characterized as the industry's boogeyman.  But as the tokenized version of an already heavily regulated asset class, digital security offerings already largely comply with federal law.  Thus, issuers have already used some of the exemptions allowing them to host a sale without first registering as a public company.  Indeed, in recent months, the SEC has made steps to better accommodate these sorts of offerings. It published a proposal in March to increase the amount startups can raise under an SEC exemption.  In the summer, an SEC-registered broker-dealer unveiled plans to launch the first security token platform that can also be used to host compliant offerings.  FINRA itself has made tentative moves to move forward with the security token industry and just this month approved tZERO's plans to launch a retail-focused broker-dealer.  As the crusade against unregulated ICOs fades, U.S. regulators, the SEC in particular, may well be preparing the ground for a host of compliant digital security offerings.

42384833,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRcF,1601381518,Traders Rotate to Bitcoin Expecting a Quiet Q4 for Altcoins,"Some digital asset traders say they’ve been rotating funds out of alternate cryptocurrencies (altcoins) into bitcoin (BTC) in anticipation of the leading cryptocurrency significantly outperforming the entire crypto market for at least the next several months.      Kevin Zhou, co-founder of San Francisco-based Galois Capital, told CoinDesk his firm is now bullish on bitcoin and expects the upward altcoin trend of the last few months to revert into several months of downward price action.      During months of sustained excitement over new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and various altcoins, bitcoin became “under owned,” according to Kyle Davies, a prominent DeFi investor and co-founder of Three Arrows Capital.      Bitcoin is down so far in September, dropping more than 10%. But with a subsiding of the DeFi craze and yields “collapsing,” Davies said he expects investor interest to pivot from altcoins toward bitcoin.      Two futures indices recently launched by FTX reflect the recent cooling off in the altcoin market. After consistent double-digit percentage gains since April, the exchange’s Decentralized Finance and S**tcoin indexes have both dropped by double digits this month.      In 2020, altcoins with lower market capitalizations significantly outperformed BTC and ether ETH thanks in part to global financial markets recovering and stabilizing “a bit,” said Ryan Watkins, bitcoin analyst at Messari.      Also aided by the DeFi and yield farming frenzies, most of the significant altcoin returns started in the second half of the year as tokens like COMP and YFI came onto the market.      As Q4 approaches and returns for altcoins have started to cool off, some professional cryptocurrency traders are betting on significant upside for bitcoin amid continued downside for altcoins.      “The market owns too much stablecoin and non-bitcoin,” Davies told CoinDesk, betting that cryptocurrency investors will rebalance toward bitcoin and away from altcoins for now.      September’s moderate altcoin sell-off could extend beyond Q4, however, according to Zhou who told CoinDesk that, although he’s not a fan of making predictions, this month’s downward trend for altcoins could last for “at least a year.”",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Zack Voell,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/29/traders-rotate-to-bitcoin-expecting-a-quiet-q4-for-altcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c610d5ef50e90552fb403aebf95c42fafac82b16-1057x688.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Developers will only be supporting Spadina for the next three days while Eth 2.0 stakers practice joining the network with the testnet, said Ethereum Foundation researcher Danny Ryan in a Sept. 14 blog.      “The main objective is to give us all another chance to go through one of the more difficult and risky parts of the process – deposits and genesis – before we reach mainnet. If all goes well, it should give us greater peace of mind before we jump into the real deal later this year,” Ryan said.      Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Ethereum 2.0      The release of Eth 2.0 – a fully functional Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain to replace the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) Ethereum mainchain – has been years in coming.

Once enough Ethereum investors have deposited ether (ETH) into the new blockchain’s deposit contract, the Beacon chain can begin validating transactions.      Those ether holdings work as skin in the game for those participating on the new blockchain. Stakers validate transactions and receive staking rewards in return. Ether deposits are slashable in the case that multiple investors try to collude against the blockchain by validating invalid transactions.      Yet, the process of moving ETH from one blockchain to another can be difficult for investors, particularly for those new to the space.

42384828,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlRTR,1601378654,$28M MakerDAO 'Black Thursday' Lawsuit Moves to Arbitration,"A class-action lawsuit alleging the Maker Foundation and others associated with lending platform MakerDAO knowingly misrepresented the risks of investment has been stayed and the case sent to arbitration.    In an order last Friday, Judge Maxine Chesney granted a motion by the Maker Foundation to refer the case to the American Arbitration Association as specified in a clause in the foundation's terms of service.  In the lawsuit filed in April, plaintiff Peter Johnson claimed the Maker Foundation, the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation and the Dai Foundation knowingly deceived investors, describing it as being a more secure investment than other assets because its DAI stablecoin is over-collateralized.  The plaintiff claimed he and other investors each endured six-figure losses when the price of DAI's primary collateral, ether (ETH), dropped sharply in the March 12 ""Black Thursday"" crash, liquidating thousands of collateralized debt positions (CDPs) held by investors.  That was despite being assured that the over-collateralization policy would safeguard against large drops in the value of ether and result in a maximum 13% loss, Johnson claimed.  According to the project’s white paper, the 13% figure is not a hard cap but may vary dependent on internal conditions in the Maker ecosystem, though the plaintiff claimed that various Maker products state the figure is the maximum strike.  Johnson claimed to have lost more than $200,000 worth of ether during the crash.  By bringing the matter to court, Maker has argued that Johnson acted in defiance of the arbitration clause he agreed to when signing the terms of service in 2018.  Johnson attempted to counter in August, claiming Maker’s 2018 agreement was based on an outdated and ""now abandoned product,” but the court rejected that claim on Friday.  Legal proceedings have now been halted until the arbitration proceedings have been settled, vacating a previously scheduled court hearing on Oct. 2.  The plaintiff had been expecting to have up to 1,000 members join the lawsuit seeking damages equivalent to the total claimed losses of around $8.325 million, plus punitive damages of $20 million.  It's not clear how many investors had joined the class action.

It’s often claimed by crypto enthusiasts that bitcoin will eventually displace the financial system as we know it. As it stands today, however, banks still play the pivotal role of fiat on/off ramps for exchanges and investors.

With over 880 digital asset clients with an aggregate balance of $1.5 billion in deposits, Silvergate is one of the market leaders within this niche market.      Some takeaways:    Due to increased levels of risk and higher compliance requirements, there exist only a handful of U.S. banks, including Silvergate, who provide banking services to cryptocurrency customers.  Silvergate sets itself apart through its deep list of industry connections as well is its unique products that cater to the digital asset industry such as its instant payment network, SEN.  The total number of customers continues to increase, but Silvergate’s deposits have failed to grow over the past two years. Despite the utility of SEN, management notes the bank has experienced deposit outflows to competitors offering yield on deposits, unlike Silvergate whose deposit base is almost exclusively non-interest bearing.  As the space matures, it’s likely more banks will feel compelled to service the crypto market, just as JPMorgan recently announced its acceptance of Coinbase and Gemini as its first digital asset customers. This type of development could be a major cause for concern for Silvergate as it competes with much larger financial institutions with more access to capital. Should this become the case, it will become crucial for Silvergate to deepen its competitive moat by boosting SEN’s utility.

In a blog post on Monday, Armstrong said Coinbase employees should be ""laser-focused"" on the company's mission: to create an open financial system for the world. The message is clear: Coinbase won't touch topics unrelated to its business and it expects employees to pursue social activism on their own time.      Armstrong predicted his blog might stir up some controversy. He was right. Twelve hours after publication, the post has split the crypto industry straight down the middle. Some have come out in praise of Armstrong's public stance; others have criticized it as regressive and out of touch with the times.      Some supporters responding to Armstrong's tweet picked up on the theme that business leaders should remove unnecessary distractions from the workplace. Building a business is hard enough, said Messari's Ryan Selkis, ""without feeling the need to build a pitch-perfect political platform."" Boost VC's Adam Draper said focusing on a ""unified mission"" was the only way companies get things done.      Similarly, former Coinbase Vice President Dan Romero, who left last year, tweeted that ""resolutely pursuing"" the corporate mission of building an accessible finance system would do more social good for countries outside the U.S.      See also: Coinbase Has Drawn a Line in the Sand for Its Activist Employees      But not everyone saw it that way. Likely anticipating the negative reaction to his blog, Armstrong restricted comments to the Twitter accounts he followed. The only critical one, on his thread anyway, came from Reuben Bramanathan, a lawyer and former product manager at Coinbase, who said the exchange shouldn't use its mission statement to ignore problems of inequality and injustice.      Others on a separate thread – where replies weren't restricted – accused Coinbase of trying to bury its head in the sand. Coinbase and its employees are part of American society and can't close the blinds on issues that directly affect their lives, both in and outside of work, said one.      Some highlighted that such a narrow focus on the mission might harm Coinbase's business in the long run. One said the stance could inadvertently shrink the pool of talent willing to work at the exchange. Another, that screening for just the mission could likely lead to the wrong sort of people – those unable to handle and manage different objectives and perspectives – working at the company.

42384812,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlPMb,1601371801,Binance CEO Says He Fully Expects DeFi to Cannibalize His Crypto Exchange,"Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao acknowledges the contradictions inherent in trying to tap into the fast-growing business of decentralized finance, or DeFi, while trying to defend his company’s reign as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.      The company’s new foray into DeFi, Binance Smart Chain, attempts to replicate some of the features of the Ethereum blockchain that have proven fertile for developers building decentralized, blockchain-based trading and lending applications that theoretically could one day challenge traditional lenders and Wall Street trading firms. But DeFi could also threaten big cryptocurrency exchanges like his own.      Like rival cryptocurrency exchanges OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase, Binance is trying to hold on to its central role in digital-asset markets as upstart DeFi projects like Uniswap, Curve, Balancer and SushiSwap attract a bigger share of industry trading volumes. Zhao says he’s open to the idea that Binance may have to adapt its business model to stay relevant, especially with total collateral locked into DeFi protocols surging 16-fold this year to $11 billion.      “Our mission is not to build a CeFi exchange,” Zhao said in an interview with CoinDesk, using a shorthand term for centralized finance. “Right now it is one of our larger businesses that support our growth. But over the long term, we want to push decentralization.”      In designing Binance Smart Chain, the company had to sacrifice elements of decentralization to compete against Ethereum and protect the company’s brand. Binance Smart Chain is controlled by 21 node operators, which are elected by Binance Coin (BNB) holders. But because the company is one of the largest holders of the BNB tokens, it retains significant control over the project’s direction.      “There is a trade-off between more decentralization versus speed, so we thought that 21 nodes run by the community is probably enough,” Zhao said in the interview.      Binance Smart Chain’s goal is not to be “the Ethereum Killer,” Zhao says, but to provide an alternative to users and developers frustrated with Ethereum’s soaring transactions fees.      “There are people who are really more into more decentralization,"" Zhao said. ""They will probably stick with Ethereum.”      An ""anything goes"" culture thrives in DeFi, with ridiculously named projects from Yam to SushiSwap exploding in popularity seemingly overnight, only to quickly flame out. But Binance can’t afford to release the reins entirely on its DeFi project; there are reputational concerns, a brand to protect.    BakerySwap Falls Flat    After Binance Smart Chain launched earlier this month, anonymous developers used it to create BakerySwap, a type of decentralized trading network known as an automated market maker, similar to Uniswap.      Zhao tweeted that he was ""Introducing BakerySwap"" and that his message was ""not endorsement and SUPER HIGH RISK"" but that the project was ""causing quite a stir on the street.”      Within an hour of BakerySwap's launch, the protocol collapsed. And Zhao deleted his earlier tweet.      “There are probably more projects that failed on Ethereum, but nobody complains to Vitalik,” Zhao said, referring to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. “So I think it just takes time for people to realize that, ‘Look, the projects on Binance Smart Chain are not run by Binance.’”      Zhao sees DeFi becoming more popular in the Asian markets of China, Thailand and Singapore.      “We just experiment with a bunch of different things, that something will stick,” he said. “And when something sticks, we want to push ourselves and also push our innovation in the same space.”      Zhao has said that if decentralization wins out as the dominant business model for trading venues in digital-asset markets, Binance could still profit from its holdings of the BNB tokens. In the interview, he said the company could also profit by shifting its focus to building decentralized applications.      “So in my mind, I’m never worried about the business model,” he said. “I’m always much more worried about if we have users using the product. There’s always multiple options for business models, so the key is to build something that’s useful.”",NEUTRAL,BNB,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/29/binance-ceo-says-he-fully-expects-defi-to-cannibalize-his-crypto-exchange,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b16a7de273e7a162706aae722a7fd2cddc4b1ecf-2394x1336.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law Friday to rename the California Department of Business Oversight as the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.  The bill (AB 1864), introduced by lead author Assemblywoman Monique Limón (D-Santa Barbara) on Jan. 7, will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2021.  The changes will equip the regulator with ""new tools to shape the regulation of virtual currency,"" the department's commissioner, Manuel P. Alvarez, told CoinDesk via email.  The new California Consumer Financial Protection Law will, among other things, provide the department with greater enforcement powers designed to protect Californians from ""pandemic-inspired scams,"" per a Friday press release.  The move means the department will have new regulatory authority to begin cracking down on deceptive or abusive practices undertaken by unlicensed financial services or products.  But the new law will also see the creation of an Office of Financial Technology Innovation designed to engage with new industries and consumer advocates to encourage consumer-friendly innovation and job creation within the state.  In addition, a new Division of Consumer Financial Protection will be created to monitor markets, with a research arm that will keep up with emerging financial products such as cryptocurrencies.  With the expansion of the department, 90 additional employees will be added to the government payroll representing a 13% increase in staffing.

42384799,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlP7V,1601368107,Coinbase Has Drawn a Line in the Sand for Its Activist Employees,"You might call it taking a stand by not taking one.      Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, took a strong stance against employee-driven corporate activism over the weekend, explaining that, going forward, his company would be ""mission focused.""      That means Coinbase will devote all of its attention to achieving the goal of creating ""infrastructure for the crypto economy,"" but will eschew any kind of activism, and won't take a stand on policy or societal issues that go beyond that mission.      It's not that those issues aren't important and don't need solving, Armstrong says, but that Coinbase's best shot at making the world a better place is by achieving its central mission.      It's clear that Armstrong's post comes in response to some kind of employee movement at Coinbase rather than pressure from the outside. He explains how he recently realized some employees believed Coinbase's world-changing mission means the firm should actively push forward other ways to improve the world.      Now that he's taken this stance, though, he has very politely told those people to be activists on their own time or find another job.      What's also clear is Armstrong believes he's far from alone among his C-Suite peers – not just at Coinbase or in the crypto industry, but among executive teams across corporate America. By sharing his position publicly, Armstrong obviously hopes it resonates and catches on, perhaps lighting the spark of some kind of backlash to the cultural moment that has, among other things, seen Scientific American take a position on the presidential race for the first time in its 175-year history.      And Armstrong is probably right to think so. Although barely any other CEOs responded to his post, several influencers chimed in their support. To be fair, the odds were skewed in his favor – big chunks of the crypto community, generally known to favor libertarianism and pseudonymity, would certainly feel affinity to Armstrong's ""leave me out of it"" position.      Of course, there was no shortage of people calling out Armstrong for taking a position that doesn't just go against the grain of a trend sweeping companies throughout America, but is in their view fundamentally cowardly and on the wrong side of history. Ultimately, it will push away talent, critics say, since it will set the wrong tone with exactly the kind of employees they should want. Many workers feel empowered, and potentially more productive when they're allowed to speak out on causes.    Sapping productivity?    Time will tell who is right with respect to Coinbase, but Armstrong's stance is such a line in the sand in today's culture that bigger questions are at stake. Coinbase isn't just a darling of the crypto industry poised for an IPO – it's a tech company based in Silicon Valley, ground zero for exactly the kind of employee activism Armstrong is eschewing.      While many corporations make donations to righteous causes or respond to the cultural zeitgeist with message-based marketing, tech companies have seen employees take strong positions in recent years to pressure their employers to do what they believe is the right thing.      Thousands of Google employees staged a walkout in 2018 over how the company handled sexual harassment allegations. Amazon workers continually speak out against the company making its facial recognition technology available to law enforcement. And Facebook's employees are so emboldened that they're directly critical of CEO Mark Zuckerberg in public forums.      Armstrong even name-checks Facebook and Google in his Medium post, pointing to those companies' internal strife as an indicator of sapped productivity. The company I really think he's thinking about, however, is Spotify, whose employees are openly revolting over podcaster Joe Rogan's arrival on the platform, demanding new safeguards be put in place over potentially objectionable content.      This is where the comparison between Coinbase and the strife within the tech industry starts to break down. It's one thing for a crypto exchange to take an apolitical stance, and another for a communications platform – where speech, information and the handling of those things are the company's core product – to do so.      But that's exactly the point. Armstrong's position isn't a message to Silicon Valley heavyweights to turn back the clock on employee ""wokeness"" – it's an open letter to every other corporate leader, urging them to connect the dots between the political positions they might be taking and the central mission of their companies. And if the result is a picture they don't like, rethink.      I'm not naive. In today's world, where every day seems to bring a new tragedy or flashpoint that raises the cultural temperature even more, that's a hard thing to do.

This fundraising round, plus a seed round in 2016 and an initial exchange offering in 2019, means the 240-employee company raised roughly $100 million to date, according to the team.    Bitpanda co-CEOs Eric Demuth and Paul Klanschek said this raise, which included additional funds from SeedInvest, will help scale the company to 300 employees, plus fund a variety of new products, in Q4 2020.  According to CoinGecko, Bitpanda Pro facilitates roughly $2 million in daily volume. Klanscheck said the platform also offers trading in precious metals in addition to other crypto options, totaling “over a $1 billion in volume in 2019.”  These co-founders said France, Spain and Turkey were among the fastest-growing crypto markets out of the roughly 34 countries the platform serves.  The recent buzz around decentralized finance (DeFi) has been a boon for Bitpanda. “We just launched a DeFi market on our broker and it went through the roof,” Demuth said. “People are really crazy about buying DeFi coins.”  Outside of crypto, Klanschek said roughly 100,000 people solely used Bitpanda this past year for trading gold options. Demuth said in 2021 Bitpanda will expand to include “all kinds of asset classes,” including stocks.  As part of the deal, Valar’s Andrew McCormack will join Bitpanda’s board. “Together, we’re going to ensure everyone in Europe has the power to access the financial markets and invest in their financial futures as we build Europe’s next fintech unicorn,” McCormack said in a statement.
