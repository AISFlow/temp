42427284,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1EXh,1485013518,Is Bitcoin App Abra Finally Ready for Its Big Debut?,"At this week's North American Bitcoin Conference, P2P digital cash startup Abra announced that, starting next month, it will begin its long-awaited global rollout.  It's a move that Abra has had in the works since May, when CEO Bill Barhydt said he was eager for the startup, founded in 2014, to make the transition ""as quickly as possible"".  Notably, the latest news provided new details on what this long-held plan might look like in action.  In a blog post published this week, Abra revealed that, at launch, its wallets will support the buying, selling and storing of bitcoin, as well as over 50 traditional currencies, which it said can also be sent peer-to-peer using the service.  According to Barhydt, the system is now ready for primetime.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We've put the system through its paces over the past year and built out our infrastructure to be able to scale to millions of users.""  The Silicon Valley-based startup will begin gradually launching the service in select markets, where users send digital cash via their phone number.  As previously detailed, users can also act as tellers, providing liquidity to the system along with the startup's exchange partners. Abra users can find a teller nearby and carry out a cash transaction in exchange for bitcoin or fiat currency in the app.  ""I hand that teller $500, he accepts the $500, pushes whatever currency is on his phone to my phone, it automatically gets converted to bitcoin regardless of which currency in their Abra wallet they're holding,"" Barhydt explained. ""The Abra system is capable of doing a dual foreign exchange transaction on the fly.""  This feature is still being finalized, but if the on-boarding works with little or no hiccups, the firm will ""flip the switch globally,"" he said.  Focus on usability  At the core of the product is usability. Barhydt likes to point out how his mother, in her 70s, can use the Abra app with no issue.  But in spite of the boasts, the CEO remained tight-lipped about the company's user numbers and teller numbers. He claimed the company will begin publishing statistics in late spring, but told CoinDesk that in the Philippines there are a few thousand tellers and a backlog of people applying to take on the role.  It's a clichéd comparison, but the CEO likens the Abra system to Uber. Location and fees are some factors in choosing a teller, but so too are the ratings, which generate trust.  The primary motivation for becoming a teller is, of course, making money. Tellers can set their own rates for transactions (from which the startup will take a cut of around 20%), so the cost for users will vary.  ""If you're in Mexico City, the teller is going to get away with 1–2.5% for money in and money out and be very competitive with ATMs,"" he said.  On the other hand, he said someone in a rural location with fewer users around, you may get away with rates as high as 3–5%.  However, Barhydt believes some tellers will use the app in settings like relief work and charities to help people get access to money. In these cases, no rate is charged and Abra takes no cut.  ""Their motivation is helping people help themselves, like giving them access to financial services that they normally wouldn’t have access to,"" he said. ""Think about Somalia, think about the African refugees that are coming to Europe.""  Hurdles to overcome  Abra is pushing the teller system hard, and it wants everyday people to sign up and become tellers to help grow the network. Yet, according to some technology observers, the ability for such a network to take off remains in question.  To Dr Paul Ennis, assistant professor at University College Dublin, it's still difficult to tell if this teller model will work at scale, but not just because it's built on the bitcoin network.  ""As novel as human ATMs sound, I think all that will matter to most people are the fundamentals – namely, are they cheaper than Western Union when it comes to remittances?"" he said.  Ennis emphasized that the cost factor would like be an issue for any user, even those who had previously used only an open-source wallet on top of bitcoin. He called it a challenge, but potentially an ""exceptionally rewarding one"".  Still, Barhydt envisions that, in the short term, most Abra users will be using tellers, but eventually more people will integrate their bank accounts too.  ""My prediction is that 50% will use Abra via bank accounts using our exchange partner integration, and 50% will use the teller network,"" he said.  The main barrier to that right now is the paucity of exchange partners in major markets.  It currently has no such partners in Europe, so if the app launches there soon, only the teller system will be available. Barhydt said it is working on deals in this area to facilitate more people linking their bank accounts.  ""We've been working with exchanges all over the world for some time and expect to see lots of announcements in that area,"" he said.  Critical mass  All in all, Barhydt has plenty of lofty ideas about what Abra can become, but expectations may need to be managed.  Currently, the startup is letting a select number of merchants accept payments with a view to selling merchant APIs in the future.  Once again it sounds all very simple, but it’s going to take time. The reality is that Abra still needs to build up its network of tellers, get more liquidity in the system and constantly improve the usability to make it attractive to merchants in the first place.  Some observers have been positive about the firm's plan.  ""I believe Abra's model is potentially viable,"" Dr Garrick Hileman, senior research associate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, told CoinDesk.  He added:  ""There are two key elements to it succeeding: the expansion of Abra’s teller network, which will need to achieve critical mass, and wide-scale user adoption of alternative channels for moving value across borders.""  It's a work in progress, but next month’s global launch marks a significant step for the startup, which has raised $14m in VC funding so far.  Barhydt concludes by saying he believes the world hasn't seen anything like Abra before:  “You have a lot of domestic payment apps both in the banking world as well as the bitcoin world, but you don’t have anybody that’s tried to be that global P2P solution to send money between any two phone numbers in the world.”  Globes image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Jonathan Keane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/21/is-bitcoin-app-abra-finally-ready-for-its-big-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/aa0be8a555de002b2ca630294bee111638566a4d-1500x987.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427304,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1F5h,1485010355,Bitcoin Traders Adopt 'Wait and See' Stance As China Impact Fades,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 14th through 20th January.  After a wild start to 2017, bitcoin took it slow this week.  This relative calm was punctuated by a handful of sharp fluctuations, which saw the digital currency’s price fall to as little as $810 on 15th January and rise to as much as $914 on 18th January, data reveals.  But, despite the calm, there was uncertainty under the surface.  According to analysts, the market is still reluctant to make big moves in the wake of continued news from China that has found its central bank more actively engaging with local exchanges.  Trader reluctance  For now, this is keeping traders on the sidelines.  Ryan Rabaglia, head trader and digital asset specialist at Octagon Strategy, described the situation as one where 'wait and see' is still the attitude.  ""Although the last round of news out of the mainland has seemingly been fully digested, we're still seeing most traders sitting on the sidelines,"" he told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The fear of any rumor or news has spooked most.""  This state of mind contrasts, however, with market performance.  Bitcoin prices surged close to 10% on 17th January, climbing to as much as $908.13, but overall, markets have struggled to move above that mark.  The digital currency proceeded to fluctuate below $900 for most of the week’s remainder, trading at $894 at the time of reporting.  Investigation unfinished  While the PBoC investigation started out with central bank officials meeting with representatives of OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC, the first two of these major Chinese exchanges have now ceased margin trading.  This means the big question for now is, how will the lack of margin impact liquidity at what are effectively the world's largest exchanges.  In this context, bitcoin prices will likely trade within a range between $850 and $950 for some time, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin exchange BitMEX.  ""The market also needs to absorb the unwind of the Chinese margin books,"" he told CoinDesk.  Hayes is certainly not the only one optimistic about bitcoin markets moving forward, as other analysts – and market data – appear bullish.  Market sentiment has pushed higher over the last several days, as data provided by leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub shows the market was 91% and 93% long on 19th and 20th January, respectively.  Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, noted the currency’s price recovery in recent week as a positive sign, but emphasized that the markets are cautious.  China's importance  Compounding matters is that China is still the effective center of bitcoin trading activity.  Though data sources peg the market share of its exchanges at 95%, recent market assessments beg this closer to 85%. Either way, both data points are indicative of what's at stake.  According to analyst Jacob Eliosoff, the ongoing developments surrounding the nation’s central bank could make China even more important than usual in the days and weeks ahead.  He concluded:  ""The market will probably continue to be hypersensitive to the latest whispers on that front.""
