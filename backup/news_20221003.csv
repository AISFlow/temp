42416142,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZjBv,1664837166,"Rare David Bowie NFT Collaboration With FEWOCiOUS Sells for $127,000","A non-fungible token (NFT) in The Bowie Estate’s exclusive collection with OpenSea sold on Monday night for 96.5 ether (ETH), or about $127,000.  The David Bowie estate partnered with top NFT marketplace OpenSea to sell “Bowie on the Blockchain,” a 15-piece NFT collection to commemorate the British pop legend and the colorful motifs used throughout his career. The collection, initially listed on the marketplace on Sept. 30, features artwork from nine artists across the NFT landscape.  The collection highlight, created by 19-year-old NFT artist FEWOCiOUS, features an animated video clip paired with a physical seven-foot-tall sculpture wearing one of Bowie’s custom suits from his archive.  “I thought it was so cool that he was always what he wanted to be. And created a world that he wanted to live in. That's really the feeling I try to capture in my art,” said FEWOCiOUS in the collection description.  According to OpenSea, the collection will carry out Bowie’s legacy of reshaping the nature of musical performances, empowering digital communities and being a proponent of new technologies within the span of his career.  Other NFTs in the collection have so far sold for between 3 ETH ($4,000) to 7.5 ETH ($9,800).  The NFT that sold for the second-highest amount is titled “It Became A Myth Land” by NFT artist Defaced. The unique digital work runs on a 12-hour clock that travels through six different segments of Bowie’s life and career. Upon purchase, it comes with an Atomic Form digital frame to display the work.  Bidding for some NFTs began on Sept. 30 and the final NFTs in the collection will be sold on Nov. 3. After all collection sales end, 100% of the profits will be donated to CARE, an organization that aims to end global poverty and hunger. Bowie’s wife Iman is a global advocate for CARE.  Celebrity estates on the blockchain  The Bowie Estate’s entry into digital collectibles follows a growing trend of celebrity estates using NFTs to as part of their legacy.  In July, Biggie Smalls’ estate partnered with music NFT marketplace OneOf to release “Sky’s the Limit,” a 3,000-piece collection of generative art profile pictures (PFPs) with exclusive access to license his unreleased track “Fulton Street Freestyle.”  Read more: OneOf Raises $63M in Seed Funding to Build Music NFT Platform on Tezos  Wayne Barrow, the manager of Biggie’s estate, told CoinDesk that NFTs are a way to give back to fans who have supported the rapper over the years.  “Giving them the opportunity to decide how Biggie’s freestyle is used is something we know he would be proud of by seeing his work shared with the people who cared about it the most in this unique way,” said Barrow.  OneOf has also helped other celebrity estates venture into the Web3 space. In December, OneOf partnered with Whitney Houston’s estate to sell an unreleased track as an NFT for $1 million.  “I’m excited to see Whitney's legacy and her wonderful music expand into the bold new technology of this era,” said Pat Houston, the executor of Houston’s estate, in an email. “It was a joy … watching the artistry of Whitney's music influence a new generation.”  Another NFT platform, LTD.Inc, launched a collection with the late photographer Chi Modu to sell physical and digital prints of artists like Mary J. Blige, Method Man and Nas. Each physical print comes with a chip that features scannable access to digital perks.

42416128,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZiIZ,1664836338,What Is EthereumMax? Inside the Crypto Kim Kardashian Lost $1.2M Promoting,"Kim Kardashian’s $1.26 million regulatory fine this week for improperly touting a cryptocurrency raises many questions, but a big one is this: what the heck is ethereumMax (EMAX), the token she shilled?  Though the name begins with Ethereum, it’s not related to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, but a token built on top of the blockchain. Like many cryptocurrencies, it promises to reshape the future of finance in hyperbolic terms. It screams that vision to the world with flashy ads and sidewalk spray paint stencils that implore readers to buy in.  Any investor who read the EthereumMax project’s grand plans for inking deals that “drive value” into EMAX or heard its promoters predicting price pumps would have the “reasonable expectation” of making money, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Monday. In other words, EMAX is a security.  While the SEC doesn’t have a mandate for crypto, its top brass believes the vast majority of digital assets are securities they can regulate like stocks or bonds. Getting branded as one by the SEC dramatically escalates what’s required of a crypto project and its promoters, but relatively few have faced SEC action.  Kim Kardashian pumps EMAX  “The SEC can have their pick of the litter in terms of tokens that they deem securities, but only one is associated with Kim Kardashian,” said attorney Nelson Rosario, who runs a crypto-focused practice. “You can make an example of her. You reach a lot of people – it's kind of a 'bang for your buck' situation.”  The SEC on Monday fined Kardashian for shilling EMAX to her 225 million Instagram followers in June 2021 without disclosing she was paid $250,000 to do so. It was one of the biggest financial promotions in history, opined one British finance regulator at the time. But it was also for a security, and therefore an illegal act.  EMAX’s promoters have given no official hint they view their token as a security; they’ve never registered with the SEC. Representatives of EthereumMax did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk.  EthereumMax token  EthereumMax wants to create a “robust and scalable ecosystem that fully maximizes the power of” decentralized finance (DeFi), its white paper promises. The project’s self-reported history traces to the depths of COVID-19 lockdowns; then, its progenitors – hardcore crypto believers – began to “deeply focus” on making a token that could soar.  The result: EMAX, a token that purports to deliver cultural upside. EMAX owners get “special access” to “the hottest restaurants and clubs,” the white paper said. The “culture token” is the official coin of EthereumMax’s growing realm. Its creators preach of EthereumMax-linked exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and other outposts that deliver value to holders. Those have not yet launched.  A CoinDesk reporter searched the EMAX website for information about how to unlock those purported cultural perks with 1 billion EMAX tokens purchased Monday for $5, but was unsuccessful.  One thing EMAX holders can do with 1 billion tokens is get access to a series of chance-based casino games on the EthereumMax website. The games pay out in more game credits, not crypto tokens. The highest performing users could win trillions of EMAX tokens; third place gets a T-shirt.  The website’s merch store touted an “EthereumMax dad hat” available for $25.95. Paying in EMAX was not an option.  In the meantime, EthereumMax’s burn-baby-burn tokenomics/circulating EMAX supply “to increase scarcity” of a token whose supply started at 2 quadrillion. Kardashian’s ad touted how the EMAX founders’ burning of 400 trillion tokens was “giving back to the entire EMAX community.”  Crypto projects commonly use deflationary tokenomics to pump up the price of their assets, said Serhii Zhdanov, CEO of London-based crypto exchange EXMO. The logic is straightforward: By removing assets from circulation, they can increase the value of those remaining.  “It's like a stock buyback in the traditional financial market,” said Zhdanov. But instead of buying the tokens from the open market, they burn them. As long as demand for the token remains stable, he said, the price will rise.  But things haven’t exactly worked out great since Kardashian’s post: EMAX has plunged 97% since then.  One notable change to the token is its February shift from Ethereum to the fast and cheap scaling system Arbitrum, which EthereumMax backers say is better suited for the ecosystem. Some 31% of circulating tokens have moved over to Arbitrum, according to data from Nansen. Their owners aren’t able to do much with the tokens just yet.  The community behind EMAX  Nearly every cryptocurrency project touts its “community” of investors who believe this token or that NFT will somehow change the world. EthereumMax, whose website promises to “disrupt history,” is no different. It feeds its most accessible community (some 30,000 Twitter followers) streams of educational and partnership content to keep them engaged.  If EthereumMax’s Twitter is meant to broadcast to the world, then its Discord server is where the projects’ true believers (or at least its most committed) roam. There, some 2,300 members can talk about EthereumMax’s crypto partnerships, its forays into gaming, its price action – pretty much anything – with fellow investors.  Well, not quite anything. On Feb. 27, a user questioned the “credibility” of EMAX, a token he’d bought well before the Kardashian ad and held onto “through ups and downs.”  Read more: Kim Kardashian and EthereumMax. Why?  “I didn’t buy this coin because Kim Kardashian said it was cool,” a user known as Donwonfosho said after grumbling that he would have to pay yet more money to move his tokens to Arbitrum from Ethereum, where holding EMAX had brought him only headaches.  “Always something with them. Oh latest and greatest. Invest more invest more,” Donwonfosho said in the chat, prompting the Discord’s moderator to mute the account.  “If any concerns are ever raised you get that response,” Donwonfosho told CoinDesk.  A prominent crypto Discord community manager who has worked with multiple high profile Ethereum non-fungible token (NFT) groups told CoinDesk that the philosophy of “crypto communities” is to unite a group of individuals around a common cause.  “There are a large number of people in the space who use the term ‘community’ as a method of rallying support around pump-and-dump schemes when in reality there is nothing deeper there than speculation,” said the manager, who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity.  The manager said it's not uncommon for crypto Discord members to deploy “hyperbolic” accusations when there’s bad news afoot, like cratering prices. However, silencing those voices for simply their airing of grievances is seen as a non-starter, the manager said.  EthereumMax’s community was bullish in the wake of the SEC’s action against Kardashian, which one Discord user pointed out only alleged that EMAX was a security, not a scam. (The SEC has said Kardashian is cooperating with its ""ongoing investigation"" of EMAX).  Read more: SEC: Celebrity ICO Endorsements Could Be Illegal  The consensus in EMAX’s Telegram appeared to be that heightened media attention would only be good for the cryptocurrency. Even so, user Deebo said “it was a bummer” many articles called EMAX a “‘scam token’ when in reality the coin is waiting to release stuff for when the market is better.”  Regardless, EMAX rallied over 40% following the SEC action. More than $63,000 of the tokens traded, the highest single-day volume since March.  “Yes, we have had a good pump today thanks to the SEC and the free advertising from them,” moderator Tony Stark said in response to a question. “Lots of big buys and lots of new investors sticking 2 fingers up at the SEC.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/03/what-is-ethereummax-inside-the-crypto-kim-kardashian-lost-12m-promoting,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38e48040c47b78c978ffa943df92a8c97a51ec80-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At least, that was the speculation of many crypto traders.  But the impact turned out to be underwhelming.  Since the mechanism was implemented a week ago, Binance destroyed – “burned” in crypto terms, or a reduction in the outstanding supply – $1.8 million worth of LUNC, based on a tweet Monday by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. That amount represents only 0.08% of the total supply of the token, too minuscule to make any measurable impact on the tokens' hyperinflated supply.  The price of LUNC dropped 12% in the last 24 hours, to $0.0003037, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko.  LUNC is the native token of the Terra Classic blockchain, which imploded this May, wiping out $60 billion in market value; the project’s algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg to the dollar, and LUNC, the token that was supposed to be its stabilizer, fell into hyperinflation. While most crypto developers and projects left the blockchain, some community members attempted to bring new life to the network by introducing a scheme that reduces the bloated supply of the token.  Read more: Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference?  LUNC almost doubled its price last week after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, unveiled its own supply-reduction scheme, CoinDesk reported last week. The crypto exchange implemented a mechanism that destroys the same amount of coins as the fees it collects from trading LUNC.  LUNC became the third-most traded asset on Binance with trading volume after bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), according to data by CoinMarketCap.  The burn was calculated based on the token’s trading volume between Sept. 21 and Oct. 1. So Binance took 5.6 billion tokens out of circulation by sending them to a “burn” address, according to blockchain data.  Given that there are more than 6.8 trillion tokens in circulation, the burn rate works out to a meager 0.08% of the total supply – extrapolating to only a few percentage points of reduction on an annualized basis.  Binance's scheme “is meaningless in its direct impact,” a crypto trader, who goes by the pseudonym of Ogle, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat, adding, “At this rate, assuming the volume continued to be as high as now (which I doubt), it would take 15 years to get to the total burn goal.”",NEGATIVE,LUNC,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | LUNC | TRADING | BNB,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/03/luna-classic-remnant-of-terra-collapse-drops-after-underwhelming-binance-burn-mechanism-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fa649b54d639b3941e935e15889d327aa65fdaf-1181x914.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416129,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PuZiNb,1664834418,Court Rules CFTC Legally Served Ooki DAO Through Help Bot,"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) can serve a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) through a website help bot and forum post, a federal court ruled Monday.  The CFTC appropriately served Ooki DAO, which it alleges offers illegal leveraged and margined trades without a Futures Commission Merchant designation or know-your-customer program, on Sept. 22, 2022, the District Court for the Northern District of California further ruled. The DAO has three weeks to respond from that date, meaning if no one responds by Oct. 13, the CFTC could win a default judgement.  The ruling came the same day a group of crypto lawyers and developers filed to join the CFTC's case against Ooki DAO, claiming the regulator's efforts to hold the DAO's members individually liable is denying them the ability to respond.  LeXpunK, a collective group of lawyers and developers active in the crypto sector, asked a federal judge for permission to join the Ooki DAO case as a friend of the court, or amicus curiae, according to a filing also made Monday.  ""LeXpunK has an interest in this case and can provide the Court with important additional information and perspective with respect to the novel facts at issue here, in a case of first impression dealing with liability for participation in a so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization or DAO,"" the filing said.  Read more: CFTC’s Ooki DAO Action Shatters Illusion of Regulator-Proof Protocol  Stephen Palley and Samuel Moniz of Brown Rudnick LLP and Alex Golubitsky of Alex Golubitsky PLLC jointly filed the motion on Monday. According to the court docket, no attorney has filed to join the case to defend Ooki DAO or any of its members.  The CFTC sued Ooki DAO last month on allegations that, as an unincorporated association, it violated federal laws around offering leveraged and margined trading products by refusing to register as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) and by not having a know-your-customer (KYC) program.  Controversially, the CFTC said it intended to hold any voting member of the DAO individually liable, and filed for permission to serve the DAO's members by posting the complaint on Ooki's website and in a help chat bot, the motion the court ruled on Monday.  The lack of individual service is one area LeXpunK took issue with, arguing the regulator ""failed to take adequate steps"" to properly serve the defendants.  ""The CFTC should be required to take additional steps to provide notice of this Complaint to the person[s] it alleges have violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

The renewable energy arm of YPF – YPF Luz – three months ago commenced a 1 megawatt (MW) pilot operation that provides power generated from waste gas left over from oil production, YPF Luz CEO Martín Mandarano told the national news agency Télam.  The project is located in southern Argentina, in an area known for its shale oil and gas resources called Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow).  The company plans to open a second pilot – this one 8MW in size – before the end of the year, Mandarano said.  “We started to develop this generation pilot for cryptocurrency mining with a vision of sustainability and business from flare natural gas, which cannot be harnessed during exploration and at the beginning of the production of an oil field,” Mandarano added.  In June, Crusoe Energy, a privately held U.S. company that pioneered bitcoin (BTC) mining by using wasted natural gas as a power source, announced it was expanding to Oman and Abu Dhabi after receiving investments from the sovereign wealth funds of those two countries.

42394697,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUzU2,1664830224,Market Wrap: Bitcoin and Ether Kick Off Week in Positive Territory,"Price Action  Bitcoin and ether showed continued resiliency Monday, both starting the week in positive territory.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose 2.7% on Monday on low trading volume, continuing its recent range-bound trajectory. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading just north of $19,000, and 3% below the psychologically important $20,000 level.  Ether’s (ETH) price increased 3.2% on Monday, on low trading volume when compared with its 20-day moving average for volume. Ether’s recent trajectory has been flat, with prices moving an average of just 1.2% over the prior 10 trading days. Since the Ethereum Network’s transition from proof-of-work to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism, ETH’s price has declined 20%. The supply of ETH has increased by 11,000 ETH since the transition, but would have increased by more than 228,000 had the Merge not occurred.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures performance across a basket of cryptocurrencies, increased by 2.33%.  Economic Calendar: September ISM Manufacturing PMI data led off the week with an unexpected decline to 50.9 versus estimates of 52.8. Manufacturing PMI data measures inventory, supply, production, employment and pricing info within the manufacturing sector.  An ISM Manufacturing PMI report that exceeds 50 implies that manufacturing is expanding. A reading below 50 indicates that manufacturing is declining. Today’s reading of 50.9 represents the slowest increase in manufacturing activity since 2020.  The ISM Manufacturing index fell to 51.70 from 52.5 in August, and slightly below the consensus estimate of 51.9.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities increased across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rising 2.6%, 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively.  Commodities: In energy markets, WTI crude and European Brent crude rose 4.7% and 4.1%, respectively. Both increases were likely due to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announcing a possible reduction in supply of one million barrels of crude oil.  OPEC will not make a formal decision until its meeting Wednesday in Vienna, so the price could reverse if the group does not follow through on the production cut.  In metals, traditional safe-haven asset gold rose 2.2%, while copper futures declined 0.2%.

Technical Take  BTC trades flat while 'whales' remove bitcoin from exchanges en masse  The Sept. 29 Market Wrap discussed a potential uptrend because bitcoin had been reaching a series of “higher lows,” implying that buyers are willing to acquire BTC at higher prices.  Subsequent lows retraced on both Oct. 1 and Oct. 2, although this moderation occurred on the weekend when trading volume is lighter than during the week.  Monday’s volume was 40% of the 20-day average, where Saturday and Sunday trading volume was 14% and 21% of the trading volume average. The extent to which volume exceeds or falls short of its average often signals the degree of conviction behind a move.  Investors may not have to abandon hope for a resumption of an uptrend, although price action seems to favor sideways trading.  A look at BTC’s hourly chart on Monday shows the price pushing past the upper range of its Bollinger Band. Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator that plots an asset’s average price and subsequently calculates two standard deviations above and below that average.  Statistically, an asset’s price stays within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time, making the breach of an upper or lower bound meaningful to watch.  While prices on the hourly chart have breached the top end of the Bollinger Bands, BTC’s daily chart shows its price is situated within a close range of the median price. Today’s activity may be merely pushing BTC back to a recognized average and is not providing a catalyst to push it significantly past its current level.  Derivative and on-chain activity implies an underlying support that could prevent prices from falling significantly. Funding rates for BTC have been positive for seven consecutive days, and for 16 of the last 20.  Funding rates can serve as a measure of sentiment, as investors who wish to be long BTC pay investors who wish to be short. In conjunction with this is a sharp decline in “whale” net volume to exchanges.  The graph below shows that “whales” (entities holding at least 1,000 BTC), have moved BTC off exchanges to the largest extent in four years.  BTC movement off exchanges is often viewed as bullish, or at least supportive, because it suggests investors are moving assets into cold storage and not designating them for trading.  Centralized exchanges have also seen significant BTC outflows.

42394695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUzT3,1664829830,Azurbala NFT Mint Postponed After Art Goes Viral for Wrong Reasons,"The next big non-fungible token (NFT) mint has been delayed by a controversy of its own making: its artwork.  The project is none other than Azurbala, a Bored Ape Yacht Club-inspired profile picture (PFP) collection, whose mint passes have already amassed more than $3.6 million in sales volume on OpenSea. The new venture is tied to a larger storytelling ecosystem created by Tally Labs, which will include the release of a “Bored and Dangerous” novel set in the Bored Ape universe written by Neil Strauss, an actual author.  The project, which has been in the works for over a year, tweeted a video of its art reveal on Friday to mixed reviews for its cast of amateurish, reptilian characters.  “What on earth is this cursed shite,” crypto influencer Cobie wrote. “Gotta be a troll job to garner attention?” another user suggested.  The response to the video was so strong that the project’s team decided to scrap the artwork altogether. Jenkins the Valet, a Bored Ape character that acts as the project’s social media steward, tweeted Monday that the collection’s mint has since been postponed.  Prices for the collection’s mint passes have fallen since the less-than-ideal reveal. The floor price for a “Bored and Dangerous” NFT on OpenSea is now just 0.26 ether (around US $341), down from around 0.52 ETH (around $676) before the video was tweeted.  The situation drew comparisons to the Pixelmon saga of last March – the NFT collection raised $70 million to build out a Pokemon-style video game, but its reveal of blocky, meme-worthy artwork ultimately tanked its momentum.  Big picture  Despite its artwork hiccup, Azurbala appears more equipped to weather the controversy than the Pixelmon team was. The project’s leaders say they hope to turn this week’s setback into a positive by incorporating community feedback into the artwork’s next iteration.  “We failed at doing the very thing that we do best, which is to involve the community in the creative process,” Valet Jones, co-founder of Tally Labs, told CoinDesk. “But it has caused us to build out a bigger and better version of our community software. We’ve had great feedback from our community giving us examples of art they think captures the vibes of the Azurians.”  Jones and Tally Labs’ other co-founder, Safa, say they plan to start gathering community feedback on the new artwork this week, which they will then turn over to a professional artist to remake the PFPs. There is no set date for the mint’s next go-round.  The Azurbala Discord channel has remained lively, with more than 1,500 members currently online at the time of writing. The Discord even has a chatroom teasing snippets of interactions between its future characters.  The Tally Labs duo will take on the artwork issue with no shortage of bankroll. The company’s “Writer’s Room” NFT collection, which gives its holders some creative direction over the project’s storytelling, has also had nearly 7,000 ETH (around $9.2 million) of sales volume separate from Azurbala.  Even the project’s cartoon figurehead, Jenkins, has had its own degree of professional development – the Bored Ape character is signed to CAA, a major talent agency that started signing Web3 clients, fictional and otherwise, earlier this year.",NEGATIVE,ETH,ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/10/03/azurbala-nft-mint-postponed-after-art-goes-viral-for-wrong-reasons,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b899e337fd9036567b4c0106361662468b0ef34d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The capital, which brings total funding up to $60 million, will help Golden build its decentralized and incentivized data protocol.  A16z co-founder Marc Andreessen served on Golden’s board of directors prior to the fundraise, and a16z partner Ali Yahya will now join the board. A16z set a new industry record in May with a $4.5 billion commitment for its fourth crypto-focused venture capital fund.  “Knowledge is fragmented; to find reliable information, one needs to search across centralized repositories, personal webpages, news sites, blogs, and private databases. The world lacks a standardized interface for discovering, contributing and verifying knowledge,” wrote Golden founder and CEO Jude Gomila in the announcement. “Creating this interface in a scalable way requires not just data; it requires the development of incentives for data entry, verification, and governance.”  The blockchain-backed Golden protocol is essentially designed to provide financial incentives via tokens to those who provide correct data and the validators who verify the data is accurate. Incorrect information will be penalized. Organizations can pay to access and use the data.  The Golden protocol is currently in testnet, with the mainnet launch planned for the second quarter of 2023.  Other investors in the round included Protocol Labs and its founder Juan Benet, Solana blockchain founder Raj Gokal and Dropbox co-founder and ex-Chief Technology Officer Arash Ferdowsi, among others.

42394685,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUzIE,1664824067,US Risk Watchdog Asks Congress to Name Crypto Spot Market Regulator,"The top U.S. financial regulators are warning of dangerous holes in the oversight of crypto and are asking Congress for more powers, including settling which agency will oversee the bulk of trading in bitcoin and other non-security tokens, according to a report unanimously approved at a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) on Monday.  The council's report flags several of the unregulated hazards in the digital assets industry, including the spot market for bitcoin (BTC). These latest recommendations from the group, which is led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, effectively bolster the two leading efforts in crypto legislation: a bill that would put the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in charge of overseeing that spot market, and another that would establish rules for stablecoin issuers.  “Innovation without adequate regulation could result in significant disruptions,” Yellen said during the council’s Monday meeting. She said the report ""identifies a number of current gaps in regulation"" and finds that crypto assets ""could pose a risk to financial stability.""  Read more: Biden’s Executive Order Produces Few Answers in Crypto Reports From US Treasury  The 125-page FSOC document concluded that potential fraud and manipulation in crypto trading begs for a spot market watchdog, according to a staff presentation at the meeting. Legislation in both the Senate and House would place the CFTC in that role, though the bills leave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with authority to decide which tokens are ""securities"" over which it will have jurisdiction.  The FSOC – whose members include the heads of financial agencies, including the Federal Reserve and both the SEC and CFTC – is also preparing to recommend that U.S. regulators need to be able to reach into all corners of digital businesses. They not only need to be able to supervise a crypto firm, but also all of its affiliates and key service providers – as the Fed can do when it oversees Wall Street banks, the report will argue, asking Congress to grant that power.  This is the latest document – and one of the most anticipated – set to emerge from President Joe Biden’s executive order calling on federal regulators to come up with plans for overseeing crypto. While the FSOC will once again note that U.S. financial regulators do have powers that reach into much of the industry, the report’s recommendations rely heavily on Congress to step in and solve many of the government’s shortcomings. However, the current congressional session is nearing its end and lawmakers will be directing their attention to the midterm elections next month that will remake Congress. Thus, any reliance on the legislative branch could represent a long-term project.  ""Crypto cannot exist outside of our public policy frameworks, regardless of what the crypto industry initially expected or what certain market participants might say today,"" SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said on Monday, adding that the policies need to protect consumers and financial stability, while also shielding against illegal activity. ""Whether you call something a crypto token, stablecoin or decentralized finance platform (DeFi), those public policy goals remain the same,"" he added.  As expected, the report calls for Congress to “create a comprehensive federal prudential framework for stablecoin issuers” that will let regulators set up guardrails around the tokens that are so vital to current crypto trading and future payments ideas. A high-profile bill in the House Financial Services Committee is seeking to do that.  The FSOC contends the crypto industry has been picking and choosing regulators – or often ignoring them completely.  “Crypto-asset entities do not have a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework and can take advantage of gaps in the regulatory system and engage in regulatory arbitrage,” according to the report. It added that agencies should use their existing authority and coordinate with each other to block the industry’s ability to pick and choose the rules they want to follow and the regulators they want to deal with.  The FSOC’s recommendations also targeted the kind of proposal made by crypto broker FTX to directly clear its customers’ crypto derivatives trading rather than using traditional go-betweens.  “A number of firms have proposed to offer vertically integrated services so that retail customers can directly access markets,” the report noted, without mentioning FTX’s very public proposal being considered now at the CFTC. The FSOC is wary of the idea that customers’ under-margined positions could automatically be closed out at all hours, which the council argued “creates the potential for cascading liquidations and reduced capacity for human intervention during periods of stress.”  The council said its agency members need to more closely study such “vertical integration” and whether the structure “can or should be accommodated under existing laws and regulations.”  UPDATE (Oct. 3, 2022, 19:27 UTC): Adds council's approval and comment from SEC's Gary Gensler.

There is a concept called &apos;market depth,&apos; which is the ability of any market to take in large orders without impacting the price of the commodity much. Generally, the more orders there are in a market, or simply, the higher its volume, the stronger the depth of the asset.

Titled “The Financial Stability Implications of Digital Assets,” the paper comes in the same week the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council – a group of regulators led by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – is poised to release a report in response to President Joe Biden's executive order calling for a plan to oversee crypto. The report is meant to explore the potential hazards that digital assets pose to the wider financial system.  The U.S. Congress is still in the process of taking action on cryptocurrencies, in particular stablecoins because they pose the largest risk to the broader financial system due to their interconnection to traditional markets. Just Monday, USDT issuer Tether announced it increased its holding of U.S. Treasury bonds to 58.1% of its total portfolio.  “The implications of stress in the crypto ecosystem on financial stability depend crucially on how interconnected it is with the traditional financial sector,” the paper said.  In the past, researchers have often pointed out the danger of stablecoins not being fully backed or being unable to maintain a 1:1 peg to the dollar. The latest report, however, seems more concerned with the risk that one large issuer could have the power to blot out competitors, which could then result in a run on those coins.  To mitigate those risks, the Fed recommends that whichever agency eventually oversees stablecoins should have the authority to implement laws that would facilitate interoperability among stablecoins. It also suggests Congress provide that overseer with a way to limit stablecoin issuers’ affiliations with commercial entities.  The report also followed the President's Working Group’s recommendation that stablecoin issuers should be insured depository institutions.

42411360,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glNIG1,1664816224,What Ripple's Latest Win Means for Its Ongoing Fight With the SEC,"Last week, Ripple notched another procedural victory as part of its ongoing legal defense against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the crypto firm and several of its executives in 2020 for the unregistered sale of $1.3 billion worth of XRP.  On Sept. 29, a U.S. District Court judge ruled to release emails and other correspondence written by former SEC Corporation Finance Division Director William Hinman related to a speech where he said ether (ETH) was not a security because, like bitcoin, it was “sufficiently decentralized.”  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  These communications are a cornerstone of Ripple’s legal strategy in a case that is nearing the two-year mark. Instead of settling with the agency, Ripple seeks to prove the SEC has taken an unclear, contradictory and arbitrary approach to regulating crypto. If it’s successful, the case could set an important precedent for the crypto industry.  “The final version of Hinman’s speech discussed a concept that is central to the Ripple founders’ defense theory – whether assets that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network are not a security, even if they could be packaged and sold as a security,” Liz Boison of Hogan Lovells, wrote in an opinion last week.  Though Hinman’s actual speech, delivered at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in June 2018, is public, the SEC has repeatedly sought to hide early drafts and other documents related to it from Ripple. At the very least, the SEC’s aversion to transparency here is unsportsmanlike – and the investing public at large is better off having access to them.  However, while the SEC will now have to produce Hinman’s documents, it’s unclear if any of this will have meaningful bearing on the case. In fact, the judge released the documents precisely because they reflect the personal opinions of one employee, not the agency at large.  The SEC filed suit against Ripple and its current and former CEOs, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, respectively, in December 2020, claiming that Ripple’s “rolling” sales of XRP represented an investment contract and securities offering. Ripple has used these sales to fund operations and, including in all likelihood, its expensive legal defense.  The lawsuit was filed shortly before Chairman Gary Gensler took charge at the SEC, presaging his more aggressive approach to reining in the crypto industry. Ripple argues that the SEC has “picked two winners” – BTC and ETH – in the digital asset industry and is unfairly targeting the payments-focused company. (XRP, which was delisted from a number of crypto exchanges after the agency filed suit in 2020, rallied 9% on the recent news.)  The SEC argued that Hinman’s correspondence was protected by attorney-client privilege and was not deliberative in the case. Kik, the messaging company that was sued by, and settled with, the SEC after its initial coin offering (ICO), also sought access to these documents.  Critics have argued the SEC “regulates by enforcement” rather than by clearly communicating how cryptocurrencies and tokens should fit into existing securities rules. The situation is made more complex by who the SEC has sued, and what tokens it deems aboveboard and why.  See also: SEC's Gensler Signals Extra Scrutiny for Proof-of-Stake Tokens  It’s unlikely there’s a “smoking gun” in Hinman’s correspondence that will clear all this up – for the industry or Ripple. But it’s worth noting Hinman quit the SEC after his infamous speech to work for Andreessen Horowitz, a firm with ties to the Ethereum Foundation. And, notably, both the SEC and Ripple have asked the judge to make a ruling based on available evidence – without bringing the case to trial.  At stake in the Ripple case is a standard that could be applied to other token projects. If the company wins, there could be standing for continuing token sales to fund decentralized project development – though it will ultimately fall upon the legal system to determine what XRP buyers thought they were buying.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | XRP,BTC | ETH | REGULATION | XRP | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/10/03/what-ripples-latest-win-means-for-its-ongoing-fight-with-the-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2aa90ffb9c3a3772d197d6b2fe8625a1330f982f-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The privately held miner has brought an additional 40 megawatts (MW) of mining capacity in its South Carolina facility, bringing its total mining capacity to 140MW, according to a statement on Monday. The site will be mining bitcoin (BTC) using Bitmain’s latest mining rigs, the S19J Pro and S19 XP.  The crypto winter has clearly been rough for miners, who have seen profit margins shrink as bitcoin prices plunged more than 50% this year, while power prices soared and capital dried up. However, some miners, such as Merkle, have continued to build up their facilities during the bear market to solidify their position when the market eventually turns.  Read more: Amid Market Rout, Crypto Miners Are Still Building  The Blue Ridge in South Carolina is Merkle’s second facility and estimated to have 80MW worth of mining capacity by the end of 2024, according to its website. Meanwhile, Merkle’s main mining site in Eastern Washington currently has 100MW of power online, with 225MW slated for 2023 year-end and maximum expansion capacity of 500MW.  Merkle previously said on Jan. 21 that it had executed a purchase agreement with Bitmain for 13,500 ASIC miners, consisting of both S19 XP and S19J Pro mining rigs.

42420936,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtvvZ,1664809377,UK Shuts Down Temporary Crypto Company Licensing Program,"Last week, digital trading app Revolut registered with the U.K.'s top financial regulator, bringing to an end the “temporary registration regime” (TRR), a program that allowed crypto companies to operate in the country while they are waiting for full regulatory approval.  Revolut was the only company from the five that were left on the list to qualify for full registration. Crypto firms seeking to operate in the U.K. must now go through a full registration process with the Financial Conduct Authority, the country’s primary financial regulator, a spokesperson from the FCA said.  Crypto firms, however, have been complaining about the FCA’s delays in processing applications. Those delays led to some companies dropping out of the process last year.  “If a firm is able to satisfy us that it meets the conditions for registration, we will register them,” the FCA said in an email to CoinDesk. “It’s a two-way street, so the time it takes to register a firm, and whether they’re registered at all, depends on the quality of the information provided to us. Thirty-eight firms have successfully done so.”  In April, the U.K. government said that it wanted to turn the country into a global crypto hub, and the government’s commitment was reiterated by new Prime Minister Liz Truss’ government. The same month, the FCA said it had been critical of crypto and wanted to move forward with a balanced approach. Since then, it has hosted several “crypto sprints” to hear from the digital-asset industry. But despite the regulator's efforts to support the crypto industry, only five companies have managed to register since April.  Read more: Crypto Firms Weigh Options as UK Registration Deadline Looms  The TRR regime  The TRR regime was set up in December 2020 by the FCA and was open only to cryptocurrency companies that were already operating in the country. More than 100 firms were entered into the list, but only 38 of those (including Revolut) managed to qualify for full registration with the FCA.  Although the FCA had set a deadline for companies on the TRR list to try to get full approval by March 31, a select few companies like Revolut were allowed to stay on the list past that date. The FCA didn’t provide any details on why the deadline was extended for some companies, but said the firms may have been pursuing an appeal or had “particular winding-down circumstances.”  By April 8, five companies out of the 106 that were initially on the list were still operating under the TRR regime’s auspices. Those included crypto exchange CEX.io, digital bank Revolut, digital asset-trading platform GlobalBlock, digital asset custody provider Copper.co and crypto wallet and payment platform Moneybrain.  By June 30, Revolut was the only company remaining on the list and ended up being the only one to receive approval from the FCA. The other four companies have opted to register elsewhere and operate outside the U.K.  Exodus  GlobalBlock planned to come off the TRR regime because it felt the FCA was “not ready” for crypto companies at that point, CEO Rufus Round told CoinDesk in an interview in April. Round added that the regulator hadn’t approved its application for at least 18 months.  The company saw a better opportunity with the European Union, which finalized its markets in crypto assets (MiCA) legislation in September, Round said. GlobalBlock announced that in May it had registered in EU member Lithuania via its subsidiary GlobalBlock Europe.  Copper is still in talks with regulators across the jurisdictions the company is operating in, including the U.K., Carly Nuzbach Lowery, the firm’s chief legal officer, said in an email to CoinDesk in July. Copper’s subsidiary received a stamp of approval in Switzerland when it was added to the country’s Financial Services Standard Association, a self-regulatory body recognized by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, Lowery said.  CEX formally withdrew its application on May 31, according to Jonathan Wykes, managing director of U.K. and Europe at the firm. It has moved users located in the European economic area and the U.K. to its British Virgin Islands subsidiary CEX Overseas Ltd.  Firms serving U.K. customers should be regulated with the FCA, but the regulator is waiting for crypto to be added to the financial promotions rules to stop firms that aren’t authorized from advertising to U.K. customers.  Moneybrain didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The Transit Swap hack is the most recent in a long line of decentralized finance-related exploits this year. In September, prominent crypto market maker Wintermute had $160 million siphoned out of its DeFi business, while Curve Finance lost $570,000 in a hack in August.

Exploits of cross-chain bridges – which is software that allows users to move assets from one blockchain to another – led to at least $2 billion in lost cryptocurrency during the first half of the year, according to a recent Chainalysis report.  “Investing in DeFi is a labyrinthian hellscape that even the most devoted crypto evangelist can get lost in,” Exponential co-founders Driss Benamour, Mehdi Lebbar and Greg Jizmagian wrote in a post announcing the funding. “Finding legitimate projects, executing trades, moving funds across chains, tracking performance and filing taxes is more than enough to scare off most investors.”  The Exponential platform has an institutional-grade risk assessment system that analyzes a user’s current investments for potential risks in the underlying protocols, assets and blockchains. Users can also find and compare yield opportunities across the major chains and protocols. Exponential will soon launch the ability for customers to invest directly in DeFi projects through its custodial platform.  Other participants in the funding round included Haun Ventures (the VC firm of Andreessen Horowitz alum Katie Haun), the venture-capital arm of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, the Solana and Polygon blockchains and the investment arm of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, among others.

Crypto adoption has not been without issues in El Salvador, but it&apos;s difficult to weed through the different stories about Bitcoin because there are so many competing interests promoting or FUDing Bitcoin. This article will filter through the nonsense and describe how Bitcoin in El Salvador has panned out one year after it became legal tender. Why El Salvador Made Bitcoin Legal Tender El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender ostensibly for a few reasons. The government cited the following reasons: A significant portion of El Salvadorans receive remittances from the United States. Remittances from the US actually make up 20% of El Salvador&apos;s GDP. Fees for wiring money to El Salvador are not cheap. Bitcoin transactions are cheap, so the El Salvador government made Bitcoin legal tender to reduce the fees citizens must pay for remittances. Approximately 70% of El Salvadorans do not have bank accounts. Transacting in Bitcoin can act as a sort of bank account. El Salvador uses the United States Dollar, which is suffering from fairly bad inflation at the moment. El Salvador moved to Bitcoin to hedge itself against inflation of the US Dollar. The three reasons listed above are all the official reasons that El Salvador gave for making Bitcoin legal tender.

Grey, who was formerly CEO of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform EONS and CEO at crypto exchange Bitfineon, will serve as Sushi’s “head chef,” as the company terms the role.  Sushi was created as a copy of Uniswap with added liquidity mining and governance features. Although aiming to improve on the original, it appears to be falling behind: Data from CoinGecko ranks Uniswap as the top-performing DEX with 24-hour trading volume of nearly $415 million. Sushi has $12 million.  DEXs are blockchain-based apps that coordinate large-scale trading of digital assets between many users. Unlike centralized exchanges, they use automated algorithms rather than acting as a financial intermediary between buyers and sellers.  Grey, who won with about 84% of a total 13 million votes across a ballot of five candidates, told CoinDesk that he hopes to bolster engagement on the platform and improve the exchange's internal organization.  “There is still quite a bit of inefficiency regarding automated-market makers, protocol user experiences and other areas of the industry where we should continue iterating to build richer product experiences,” Grey told CoinDesk. “I think Sushi has an opportunity to lead in these areas.”  The election followed a year of organizational difficulties at Sushi. In September 2021, the de facto CEO and founding member, pseudonymous 0xMaki, left for an external advising position. In December, Chief Technology Officer Joseph Delong departed to serve in the same role at NFT (non-fungible token) lending platform Astaria.  “I think there are bright and passionate minds on Sushi's team, and I want to help them realize their ambitions.

Market Moves: Long-term holders are keeping bitcoin, helping the cryptocurrency to remain resilient as other risky assets fall. One trader, however, sees a sell-off coming.  Chart of the Day: About $1.1 billion in bitcoin left centralized exchanges in the three days between last Thursday and Saturday, according to CryptoQuant.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) was trading slightly up on the day at $19,200. The cryptocurrency appears to be showing resilience, while global stocks fell to a two-year low and U.S. stock futures struggled to find direction on Monday.  Bitcoin touched $20,000 on Friday and dipped to as low as $18,900 on Sunday.  Ethereum (ETH) was trading at around $1,293 on Monday, a small increase, while Uniswap (UNI) rose about 3.5%.  In traditional markets, the focus was on Credit Suisse. The bank’s shares fell by as much as 10% on Monday after the Swiss lender failed to calm investor fears about its financial health.  Digital-asset investment products saw inflows of $10.3 million last week, the third consecutive week of inflows, according to a report from CoinShares.  “The flows remain low implying a continued hesitancy amongst investors,” the report stated. “This is highlighted in investment product trading volumes, which were $886 million for the week, the lowest level since October 2020.”  The report also noted that there was broadly negative sentiment for altcoins last week with outflows totaling $3.5 million. The most affected were the tokens for the Polygon, Avalanche and Cardano blockchains, CoinShares said.  In the news, CoinDesk’s Sam Reynolds reported that crypto futures and spot exchange BitMEX is planning to launch its exchange token, BMEX, by the end of the year, its CEO said at the Token2049 conference in Singapore.  Alex Mashinsky, founder and former CEO of Celsius Network, removed $10 million from the now bankrupt crypto lender weeks before Celsius halted customer withdrawals in June, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources.

Market Moves  Range-Bound Bitcoin Reminds Crypto Twitter of 2018 Lull That Ended With 50% Crash  By Omkar Godbole  It's the glass half-full, glass half-empty bitcoin market.  To bulls, factors like the absence of large sellers, persistent holding by long-term investors and the cryptocurrency's resilience in the face of turmoil in traditional financial markets provide hope.  To bears, the current lull is reminiscent of September-October 2018, when the largest cryptocurrency held steady at close to $6,000 for weeks before slumping by almost 50%.  Over the weekend, pseudonymous analyst and swing trader il Capo Of Crypto explained to his 540,000 followers that much like the 2018 consolidation near $6,000, current trading at around $20,000 represents a temporary pause that will pave the way for another price sell-off.  Read the full story here.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin Worth $1B Leave Centralized Exchanges  By Omkar Godbole  Centralized exchanges registered an outflow of more than 60,000 BTC worth $1.1 billion between Thursday and Saturday, according to data tracked by South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant.  ""That's the highest amount [of outflows] in months. After months of lowering prices, this is a sign of demand coming back into the market,"" CryptoQuant's community manager, JA Maartun,said.

42394678,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUzCK,1664800200,"Grayscale Takes Over Key Role for Bitcoin Trust, Other Products From Genesis","Crypto asset management firm Grayscale Investments, which offers the world’s biggest bitcoin (BTC) trust, is bringing a key administrative role for all of its products in-house through a newly created broker-dealer unit.  The company will now act as the authorized participant for the products through its Grayscale Securities subsidiary, the firm announced Monday. That means it will now be responsible for creating new shares of the trust and selling them to investors. Previously, Grayscale outsourced that role to Genesis Global Trading. (Grayscale, Genesis and CoinDesk all share the same parent company: Digital Currency Group.)  The change “creates efficiency but doesn’t fundamentally change the Grayscale business,” Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in an interview. “What it’s doing is bringing a capability in-house to the Grayscale organization while continuing to adhere to any financial rules and regulations.”  Genesis will still handle buying the cryptocurrencies underlying Grayscale’s trusts, and there are currently no plans to add any liquidity providers beyond Genesis, Sonnenshein said.  “The way that we’ve structured all of those kinds of agreements is we can and, at some point, will perhaps access more liquidity providers,” he said. “Today, Genesis remains our sole liquidity provider and we’ve had nothing but a positive relationship with them, going back to 2013, so I can’t see a need to expand.”  He added that the customer experience will not be affected by the authorized participant change. Grayscale offers nearly 20 different products, which either offer investors exposure to a single cryptocurrency like bitcoin or Ethereum’s ether (ETH), or a diversified basket of tokens.  Earlier this year, before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected Grayscale’s application to turn the $2 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund, the company said it had lined up Jane Street and Virtu Financial as authorized participants following a conversion.

42394681,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUzGG,1664799336,Citi Says Decentralized Crypto Exchanges Are Gaining Market Share From Centralized Peers,"Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) have grown faster than centralized exchanges (CEXs) over the past two years, Citigroup (C) said in a research report Thursday. The gap is likely to widen as users move away from centralized platforms to avoid their more onerous know-your-customer procedures.  DEXs are blockchain-based apps that coordinate large-scale trading of digital assets between many users by using automated algorithms, instead of the traditional approach of acting as a financial intermediary between buyers and sellers.  DEXs offer distributed revenue, like dividends, to token holders and the ability to self-custody funds, the report said. Once the trading rewards are included, these exchanges have comparatively lower fees than platforms such as Coinbase Pro, Citi added.  One of the main differences between DEXs and CEXs is the custody of funds, the bank said, as there is a risk in storing assets with CEXs. The bank highlighted the collapse of lending platform Celsius Networks and broker Voyager Digital as examples.  One potential driver for DEX volumes in the near term is an increase in regulation, the note said. As crypto regulation develops more broadly, with expanded reporting requirements, users could begin to migrate to DEXs from “KYC-heavy CEXs,” it said, referring to “know-your-customer” requirements. The regulatory landscape is expected to become more “onerous,” and more users are likely to switch to decentralized exchanges from centralized ones, the note added.  Citi says DEXs are responsible for 18.2% of spot-trading volume, noting that volumes have remained resilient at over $50 billion a month, with total revenue of $3.6 billion in the last year. Uniswap continues to dominate, accounting for around 70% of total DEX volume, and could distribute up to $250 million to token holders if a recent governance proposal is passed.  “This could mark a key pivot for a foundational DEX within the DeFi space,” the bank said, referring to decentralized finance, which is an umbrella term used for lending, trading and other financial activities carried out on a blockchain without traditional intermediaries.

42394698,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASUzV1,1664793820,Range-Bound Bitcoin Reminds Crypto Twitter of 2018 Lull That Ended With 50% Crash,"It's the glass half-full, glass half-empty bitcoin (BTC) market.  To bulls, factors like the absence of large sellers, persistent holding by long-term investors and the cryptocurrency's resilience in the face of turmoil in traditional financial markets provide hope.  To bears, the current lull is reminiscent of September-October 2018, when the largest cryptocurrency by market value held steady near $6,000 for weeks before slumping almost 50%.  Over the weekend, pseudonymous analyst and swing trader il Capo Of Crypto explained to his 540,000 followers that much like the 2018 consolidation near $6,000, current trading around $20,000 represents a temporary pause that will pave the way for another price sell-off.  According to il Capo Of Crypto, the market is exhibiting a downtrend, followed by temporary consolidation with an extended drop yet to come.  In first-half 2018, the cryptocurrency crashed to $6,000 from almost $20,000. It traded sideways around $6,000 between August and early November, convincing many traders – including the likes of billionaire investor Michael Novogratz – that it had formed a base around $6,000 and was ready for a new bull run.  The bulls' optimism was misplaced. The cryptocurrency nosedived below $6,000 on Nov. 14 and eventually bottomed out at $3,200 in December. The already-battered alternative cryptocurrencies followed suit, falling 60% or more, according to data from charting platform TradingView.  The current price structure appears similar to that of mid-November 2018, with prices consolidating near $20,000 for nearly three months after a sell-off from the record high of $69,000.  There are other similarities too. For instance, XRP and other alternative cryptocurrencies have recently rallied, shrugging off the comatose action in bitcoin – perhaps a sign that there is still some speculative interest left in the market. XRP and other smaller coins saw occasional rallies during BTC's price consolidation in 2018.  Bitcoin, the most liquid and the biggest digital asset, remains an anchor for the broader market. That means price rallies in alternative cryptocurrencies, referred to as pumps on Crypto Twitter – the social network's vocal, frequently pseudonymous commentators on the industry, are often taken to represent market froth.  ""There is still a lot of money in dead and dying projects that needs to be redistributed,"" pseudonymous trader BIG Chonis tweeted Saturday, hinting at another market-wide sell-off.  Crypto Twitter's fears seem reasonable given macroeconomic factors, mainly the declining U.S. dollar liquidity and the rising dollar index (DXY), favor a resumption of the downtrend. It's worth noting that previous bear markets have coincided with the dollar rally. The DXY rose over 4% in 2018.  Industry experts disagree  Some fund managers and analysts disagree with Crypto Twitter's take, saying several on-chain indicators suggest the worst may be behind us.  ""On-chain data analysis shows that long-term holders are not turning over their holdings – they are holding on to their coins without engaging in trading activities and churning of new market participants' holdings is likely not enough to push prices much lower,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, which has $10 billion in assets under management, said when asked about the possibility of a 2018-like slide.  ""Unlike previous bear markets, there is now regulatory engagement. The asset class has also fundamentally changed with institutional interest, many serviced by Matrixport, and there is a value-driven bid, at one point,"" he said.  The bitcoin market has matured significantly since the coronavirus crash of March 2020, with many institutions and corporations adding the cryptocurrency to their balance sheet. Alternative investment vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETF) and CME derivatives have equal, if more more, say in price discovery as the spot market. Previous cycles may not be good indicators of what lies ahead.  Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said, ""While further downside might be apparent, we aren't expending much more than 15% to 20% drop. This being the case, a lot of longer-term traders are deploying capital at the current support level.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/03/range-bound-bitcoin-reminds-crypto-twitter-of-2018-lull-that-ended-with-50-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/565e61c225a4ff417008ac8d67b5416dd7b5c802-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As of Sept. 30, the company increased its U.S. Treasury holdings to 58.1% of its total portfolio from 43.5% of its total portfolio as of June 30.  Commercial paper is short-term unsecured debt issued by companies, where the value of the paper is dependent on the issuing company. Commercial paper is less stable than other debt instruments, such as U.S. Treasury bonds.  Tether had earlier said that it will bring its commercial paper holdings to zero by the end of the year because of growing concerns over the stability of the Tether ecosystem and its stablecoin, USDT.  In May, the company held $20.1 billion in commercial paper, which it reduced to $8.5 billion by June 30.  The USDT issuer also appointed a new auditor, BDO Italia, to take over its regular attestation reports. Recently, the firm was ordered by a New York-court judge to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT.

Fair Marketing Price, No Discount Sam Bankman-Fried stated that his company&apos;s proposal was based on fair market pricing and no discounts in response to BnkToTheFuture creator Simon Dixon&apos;s claim that FTX was seeking financing at a $32 billion value to purchase Celsius&apos; assets for cents on the dollar. to be clear — in Voyager, our bids are generally determined by fair market price, no discounts; goal isn&apos;t to make money buying assets at cents on the dollar, it&apos;s to pay $1 on the $1 and get the $1 back to customers.

October Starts but Fails to Ignite Crypto Prices  By James Rubin  The opening of the historically crypto boom month of October bore a stronger resemblance to the recent dreary days of September.  Bitcoin was recently trading slightly above $19,200, down 0.5% over the past 24 hours and roughly where it stood at the start of the weekend. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose briefly above $20,000 last week before descending to the ledge it's occupied for much of the past month.  ""Indecision and lack of buying above $20,000 are pushing Bitcoin to test its recent lows,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote in an email, adding optimistically: ""If we do drop sharply, the price may bottom soon and put up a nice rally. However, most bulls may be scared out of their longs before that happens.”  Ether was recently changing hands a little below $1,300, off approximately 1.5% from the previous day. The second largest cryptocurrency spent much of the past two weeks trading comfortably above this level. Most other major cryptos were recently off with XRP and ATOM falling more than 4% and 3%, respectively, as investors continued to process a range of largely deteriorating, economic indicators and the latest hawkish comments by U.S. central bank Vice Chair Lael Brainard in a speech Friday.  Cryptos tracked equities, which closed a dismal month with a final dismal trading day on Friday. The tech-focused Nasdaq, S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all finished down at least 1.5% amid ongoing fears that the struggle to end high inflation is leading inevitably to a harsh recession – a so-called hard, economic landing.  By the traditional definition of two, consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the U.S. has already entered a recession, although its severity and length remain uncertain. The Nasdaq and S&P have declined six of the last seven weeks, and the DJIA recently became the latest index to fall into bear market territory, meaning that it has dropped at least 20% from its last high.  Economic indicators  A third consecutive monthly decline in pending home sales offered the latest evidence of the once hot housing market's cooling and wider, economic slowing. Yet the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of measuring U.S. inflation, was higher than expected in August, rising 4.9% on a year-over-year basis after increasing 4.7% in July. The reading indicated that inflation will continue to plague the U.S. economy and beyond.  Meanwhile, the cost of Hurricane Ian in structural damage and economic disruption to Florida presents a fresh wildcard, as First Republic Bank noted in a weekly review to investors. ""The total cost of the hurricane is unknown, but given the scale of this natural disaster it’s possibly one of the most expensive in U.S. history,"" the bank wrote. The overall economic effects depend on the breadth and duration of the disaster.""  Investors will be eyeing the release on Monday of September's ISM Manufacturing index, which is expected to remain unchanged, and the September unemployment rate on Friday, which is expected to remain at its current 3.7% reading.  On Saturday, citing three unnamed sources, CoinDesk reported that Indian exchange WazirX had laid off about 40% of the company's workforce. And U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase temporarily halted transactions from U.S. customers, according to a status update made by the crypto exchange at 7:57 a.m. ET Sunday morning. Later Sunday, the Financial Times reported that Alex Mashinsky, the embattled founder and former CEO of Celsius Network, removed $10 million from the now bankrupt crypto lender weeks before Celsius halted customer withdrawals in June.  ""A terrible week, month, and quarter for stocks was not exactly mirrored by bitcoin,"" wrote Oanda Senior Market Analyst Edward Moya in an email, adding that last week's declines in bond yields had provided ""some relief for crypto.""  ""Bitcoin’s hodlers remain unfazed and if Wall Street avoids any major de-risking moments, the world’s largest crypto could continue to stabilize here,"" he wrote.

Participants included Latin America-based payments company Ripio, which is seeing surging demand for USDC transfers in Brazil and Argentina, or the Web3 service provider Recur, which solely accepts the stablecoin from users of its various metaverse worlds, including Star Trek Continuum.  It seems USDC, the second most-traded stablecoin, is developing its own “ecosystem,” a word (perhaps overused) that open-source advocates apply to networks of third-party developers and providers that build on a tech platform. Below I’ll get to a lesson I see here for U.S. lawmakers contemplating what digital form the dollar should take. But let’s first reflect on these ecosystem ideas as they pertain to a stablecoin like USDC. It’s not an obvious concept, though its implications are profound.  This was excerpted from Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Let’s compare Converge to NEARCon, the annual conference sponsored by the Near Foundation I attended two weeks ago in Lisbon. It’s easier to understand that event as an “ecosystem conference.” Like other such gatherings – Ethereum’s Devcon being a prime example – Near uses it to bring together and energize the far-flung community of developers and companies building dapps and other services with smart contracts that run on its protocol.  USDC isn’t a smart contract protocol for dapps. It’s primarily a payment vehicle, conceived of by most people as a “coin.” It is a tokenized expression of dollar-based value that happens to be more fluid than non-digital dollars, one that can be exchanged peer-to-peer over public blockchains. (Circle’s launch on Wednesday of a new cross-chain transfer protocol brings USDC a little closer to a more common definition of a crypto protocol, but it’s not why all those third-party, USDC-tied providers attended the event.) ...
