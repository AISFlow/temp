42397622,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDagN,1400450463,New Bitcoin Foundation Board Members Seek to Defend Bitcoin in Canada,"Despite the recent controversies that have cast a shadow on the international chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation, its local affiliate chapters are in the midst of developments that are highlighting the organisation's purpose in both the bitcoin industry and the world at large.  In Canada, the foundation is growing, and those who are getting involved in the structure are hopeful about its ability to positively influence the local bitcoin space.  The Canadian Chapter of the Bitcoin Foundation (hereon referred to as Bitcoin Foundation Canada) recently elected two new members to its board of directors – one to fill the Industry seat, and one to fill the Individual seat, with the election fully concluding this past week.  Both new members have been met with optimism from the community, though challenges for the ecosystem lie ahead, especially in light of recent announcements from the Bank of Canada that have cast doubt on bitcoin's long-term viability.  Bitcoin Foundation Canada is the official chapter of its parent organization – the Bitcoin Foundation – and, as such, seeks to accomplish the same: 'standardise, protect and promote' bitcoin.  The chapter is focused solely on the inclusive and transparent ways to defend these interests in Canada.  Emerging leaders  Throughout March and April, Bitcoin Foundation members across Canada were invited to submit their candidacy for a seat on the board of directors for the Canadian chapter.  Six individuals applied for the Individual seat, and four companies competed for the industry seat. The Canadian Bitcoin Foundation opted to use Helios, a voting platform that sought to ensure transparency via ballot encryption.  Voting commenced on the 28th 11:59, with a further round of voting beginning on the 13th due to a tie in the industry election.  On 5th May, the individual seat was awarded to Jillian Friedman, with 50% of all ballots cast.  The victory was seen as a positive for the foundation and Canadians, as Friedman is a Montreal-based legal expert who advises clients in the digital currency industry and acts as general counsel to the Bitcoin Embassy.  Friedman has also proved open to collaboration – especially with the other Canadian national non-for profit, which could be seen by some as a competitor: the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada.  Her goal is to put a 'face' on bitcoin, so Canadians can shift their perception from ""thinking that bitcoin got shut down or is illegal to understanding how disruptive and awesome this technology really is"".  She hopes that the Foundation will help as a ""unified voice to the public"" and ""speak to politicians, and the public sector, as well as players in the public sector"" about the incredible technology.  Furthermore, she would like to see it as a place for people to go to acquire resources, to learn more and to interact with the technology and currency.  Boots on the ground  This should be good news for the bitcoin industry to hear. Transparency, process and clarity on how decisions are made are essential for any organization to grow, thrive and contribute positively to the environment in which it operates.  Friedman’s first steps as a new board member include possibly setting up CBF meet-ups all over the country, to grow the organizations’ presence across Canada.  ""As I understand,"" she explains, ""the bitcoin community in some Western provinces like Alberta is not as robust as in Ontario or Quebec – CBF can share knowledge and capacity to help change this"".  Guillaume Babin-Tremblay, founding member of the CBF, believes Friedman is a positive choice for the foundation.  Babin-Tremblay said:  ""Jillian will make a great addition to our team. Having a Bitcoin legal expert on our board will be a great advantage in our ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies.""  Exchanges aim to lead local industry  With regards to the industry seat, the first round of voting resulted in a tie between British Columbia-based exchange Quadriga CX, represented by Gerald Cotton, and Quebec-based exchange Morrex Inc., represented by Philippe-Antoine Plante.  After the second round of voting, Morrex Inc. took the coveted industry seat.  Located in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Morrex Inc. appears to be the only Quebec-based exchange in operation.  Francis Pouliot, director of Public Affairs for the Canadian Bitcoin Foundation helped organize the elections on behalf of the board, and was pleased with how the process was conducted smoothly and without controversy.  He said:  ""[I was] very pleased with the high participation rate and general conduct of this first Board of administrator’s elections.""  Local competition  Of course, one potential roadblock to these goals is community support.  Bitcoin Foundation Canada is Canada’s second national ‘Bitcoin board’, with the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada looking to accomplish a similar set of goals. Given that there two organisations seeking to promote the industry, there have been questions regarding whether the two organizations work together.  Canada is known for its openness to our new technology. Many businesses set up shop in Canada due to our (seemingly) secure financial position in the world marketplace. By comparison, the US can often be seen as a hostile environment in which to operate business given the uncertainty and high cost of regulation.  However, issues still remain: bitcoin has bad PR in Canada. People who know of it know of the scandals. As such, there is hope that these organisations will be able to advance the conversation in an organised manner.  Challenges ahead  Although bitcoin in general is not faced with the type of resistance in Canada as it is elsewhere in the world, Canada has hurdles to mass adoption.  CAVirtEx  , one of the country's largest digital currency exchange, explained quite clearly in a Senate hearing earlier this year that they needed bank accounts, or would continue to face operational difficulties.  As such, Friedman envisions BFC as ""…a bridge for the traditional financial services economy and anyone for that matter"".  She told CoinDesk:    ""One major problem many bitcoin businesses encounter is maintaining banking relationships.      While this may change with greater clarity as to the legal obligations of bitcoin businesses with respect to anti-money laundering compliance – this is an issue that is on CBF’s radar – as it directly prejudices the growth potential of the industry here in Canada.""    Ms. Friedman hopes to increase the visibility of the Foundation to the Canadian mainstream, and also ""create a transparent organization – where members know what is going on and how decisions are made"".  One way to do this, she says, is by having more frequent updates and newsletters.  With the elections concluded, the local ecosystem is optimistic that both the Alliance and the Foundation will cater to those it serves: members and the general public.  Remaining focused on the overall goal and not getting influenced by politics, competition and in-fighting will prove to be the largest challenge for these two centralized organizations.

42397625,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDakJ,1400422491,Skyhook Releases Open-Source Bitcoin ATM for Merchants on a Budget,"Skyhook is new to the bitcoin ATM-scape but is already interesting many with its first project – the first ever portable, open-source bitcoin ATM machine, with prices starting at $999.  The Portland-based manufacturer launched the machine on 12th May and demoed it at the Bitcoin2014 conference this weekend.  Existing manufacturers like Robocoin and Lamassu charge from $5,000 to $20,000 for an ATM that exchanges bitcoin for fiat currencies worldwide. Skyhook’s hardware and software are designed to make bitcoin more accessible to the masses, as well as existing bitcoin users. Chief operating officer Kyle Drake said:  “It's very difficult for non-experts to buy bitcoin in the United States and around the world right now, without a lot of work. There are some great bitcoin wallets out there, but most of them come with no way to buy bitcoin.”  There are online exchanges, but these will normally require the user to verify their identity and home address, and to use a (sometimes costly) bank transfer or credit card transaction to deposit fiat currency, before any bitcoin can be purchased.  If usability among the general population is what holds bitcoin back from wider adoption, as some digital currency enthusiasts have argued, developers will have to focus more on making existing technologies useful to main street consumers. Drake continued:  “We want to help solve the bitcoin purchasing problem by making it so anyone that wants to try and use bitcoin can just go to a nearby ATM, and get some with cash. The best way to do that is to make bitcoin ATMs affordable, so that anybody can get and use one. It's a great way for people to get comfortable using bitcoin.”  Small and light, the Skyhook ATM also makes it simple for bitcoin individual users and businesses of any scale to become an exchange, quickly and affordably. The ATM is sufficiently portable, Drake said, but also provides a durable security mounting plate to permanently attach the unit to something, if the user prefers a fixed location – and all with the same level of security.  Skyhook further gives merchants the option to generate revenue while protecting them from price volatility. The bitcoin price is set automatically using the major exchanges, and merchants can set a percentage rate and minimum price if so desired.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/18/skyhook-releases-open-source-bitcoin-atm-for-merchants-on-a-budget,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55711bce53b94d47269e4ceeb9fd093225ef2ffa-1440x811.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397628,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDaoF,1400414709,How Regulators Should Approach The Bitcoin Derivatives Market,"We already know of bitcoin's complicated relationship with governments and regulatory agencies the world over. But bitcoin's relationship with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the agency responsible for regulating the futures and options markets, is particularly ill-defined.  Bitcoin is in a Catch-22-style bind. As long as the price remains volatile it will remain dangerous for merchants to accept the cryptocurrency, barring adoption on a massive scale. Derivatives might be a useful risk management tool to hedge against volatility. But regulatory ambivalence leaves entrepreneurs timid or unwilling to invest in the infrastructure for these transactions.  While derivatives have the ring of abstruse tools, they could make or break the bitcoin ecosystem.  Despite this uncertainty, the bitcoin derivatives markets are drawing attention. Seed-stage incubator Seedcoin allotted 500 bitcoins to BTC.sx, a derivatives trading platform, in early July. Last year, SecondMarket awarded a leveraged FOREX trading platform, Coinsetter, $500,000 in venture capital.  In a Mercatus Center working paper, scholars say that based on current regulations, many bitcoin derivatives should be exempted from CFTC regulation. They also recommend that policymakers use a “bottom-up” approach to the new technology.  The volatility problem  It's no secret that bitcoin is volatile. In theory, the volatility will decrease as the network reaches a larger capacity.  But for now, a dive in price could impact the future of a company that wants to transact in it, making vending in bitcoin a prohibitively risky move.  What are derivatives?  That is where derivatives come in. The contractual tool “derives” its value from an underlying asset – in this case bitcoin. The value of the underlying asset can fluctuate, but the contract locks it in at an agreed-upon price for a period of time.  There is a lot of uncertainty. It is beneficial for merchants to lock in a long term price, so that they can still operate and plan in the face of possible fluctuations. Traditionally, this has been a useful tool for agriculture, oil, and other markets where the prices of underlying commodities were subject to volatility. BTC.sx chief operating officer George Samman said:  ""It will make bitcoin less and less volatile over time. It provides a proper hedging mechanism.""  There are a number of types of derivatives: options, forwards, futures, and swaps. CoinDesk correspondent Daniel Cawrey previously touched on the various types of derivatives.  As long as the network is composed of a small number of actors, many institutional players are hesitant to move into the bitcoin market until hedging instruments develop.  Houman Shadab, professor at New York Law School and author of the Mercatus paper told CoinDesk: “The development of bitcoin derivatives means that people are taking bitcoin seriously and want to make it easier to use.”  Mercatus recommendations  Right now, regulatory focus is fixed on bitcoin's use in money laundering and illicit purchases. But when the markets for advanced financial instruments expand, the arm of the government will likely follow.  In mid-April, the Mercatus Center, a market-oriented think tank, released a working paper titled Bitcoin Financial Regulation: Securities, Derivatives, Prediction Markets, & Gambling that describes the government's role in these transactions.  According to the authors – Jerry Brito, Houman B. Shadab, and Andrea Castillo – as bitcoin evolves and the infrastructure develops for bitcoin trade, new financial instruments will pop up to deal with risk. Securities, derivatives, prediction markets and gambling will assume greater significance in the bitcoin ecosystem.  The paper is a draft and is subject to change. The scholars' recommendations is summarized as follows:    ""Following the approach to virtual currencies taken by FinCEN, we argue that other financial regulators should consider exempting or excluding certain financial transactions denominated in bitcoin from the full scope of their regulations, much like private securities offerings and forward contracts are treated.      We also suggest that to the extent that regulation and enforcement becomes more costly than its benefits, policymakers should consider and pursue strategies consistent with that new reality, such as efforts to encourage resilience and adaptation.""    Many bitcoin derivatives resemble forwards, which are not regulated by the CFTC. Forwards are not subject to regulations outlined in the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA) for a couple of reasons. Forwards contracts are generally tied to a physical commodity, unlike futures which are settled in cash. Since bitcoins have a cap and inherent value it resembles a physical commodity. Bitcoins are also easily transferable.  CFTC regulations are reserved for speculative markets.  Bitcoin derivatives should be treated like any other commodity derivative, Shadab told CoinDesk. ""The CFTC should exempt from the full scope of its regulation derivatives that ultimately transfer bitcoins between users, for the same reasons physically settled commodity derivatives are not regulated as heavily as futures.""  ""The CFTC should help to foster a liquid and robust market for bitcoin derivatives so investors and users can decrease their exposure to price risk,"" he added.  Other opinions  A CFTC spokesman declined to comment because the agency ""has not taken any actions with regard to bitcoin"". But last year, the former chairman Bart Chilton said the agency was ""seriously considering"" regulation.  Some think clarity is the number one priority. Early this year Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE) asked the CFTC to clarify its position to ""remove the cloud of uncertainty"". Harvard Review reported on the general attraction to regulation amongst bitcoin entrepreneurs, simply because it helps to dispel the paralyzing uncertainty.  Undoubtedly, bitcoin would benefit from clarification from the CFTC.

42397630,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDaqD,1400410784,Battle of the Explainer Videos: Who Tells Bitcoin's Story Best?,"Many have tried to explain bitcoin, some with more success than others.  Creating a short and snappy video that makes bitcoin accessible to a general audience, while simultaneously doing justice to the complex ideas behind its technology is a big ask. Anyone who tries should be applauded.  However, while some have clearly done a very good job, others haven't quite cracked it.  Below, Kadhim Shubber takes a look at some of the best (and worst) bitcoin explainer videos out there. You can let us know which is your favourite by voting at the bottom of the article – or suggesting your own in the comments.      Vox  Probably the snazziest bitcoin explainer yet, Vox leaves aside any discussion of bitcoin as a currency and instead focuses on its potential as a payment network. The promise of bitcoin is “permissionless innovation” in the financial sector, argues Vox. Although Ezra Klein, who narrates the video, does shy away from bitcoin's history and exactly how it works, as a primer on bitcoin's potential impact this video is top-notch.  Straight to the moon: “You can do cool things without any central authority being able to tell you 'no'.”  Crash and burn: Not embeddable  Length: 1:55      The Guardian  A more comprehensive overview of bitcoin, The Guardian emphasises the benefits of sending money directly from customer to merchant: no money-grubbing banks taking a cut. The video touches on the double-spending problem, but doesn’t really address how the block chain (which doesn’t get a mention) solves that problem. Although it's an enjoyable walkthrough of the story of bitcoin, people looking for an explanation of how it works will have to go elsewhere. After all, it is called ‘Bitcoin made simple’.  Straight to the moon: “You may think that the system we have is pretty good, but everything we buy today has to go through a bank or credit card company, who take a cut of the transaction.”  Crash and burn: Pays lip service to the double-spending problem, but doesn’t follow through. Also, not embeddable.  Length: 03:17      The Washington Post  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxYj5G9CinU  Less slick than the previous explainers, The Washington Post promises to explain bitcoin but spends much of the second half of the video discussing the impact of Mt. Gox’s collapse. A key part of the bitcoin story, sure, but we're not left any the wiser about how bitcoin works or why people are excited about it.  Straight to the moon: ""It's virtual money that can be transferred from person to person online, without a middleman. That means no banks, and their transaction fees.""  Crash and burn: This video only really makes sense if you already know what bitcoin is. A newcomer is unlikely to understand the jargon.  Length: 01:30      The New York Times  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFChBFoqA8s  “What makes ‘money’ money?” That’s the angle The New York Times takes on bitcoin, addressing an issue the other videos mostly skirt around. Admirable, but it’s arguably a poor way to explain what bitcoin is, with the video focusing on mining itself instead of the system and processes that mining facilitates.  Straight to the moon: ""There's no Ben Bernanke of bitcoin, no central bank or government authority at all.""  Crash and burn: The Winklevoss Twins feature for 11 whole seconds, which is about 11 seconds too many.  Length: 02:36      Duncan Elms and Marc Fennell  http://vimeo.com/63502573  One of the most viewed bitcoin explainer videos ever, this dazzling and beautiful video by Duncan Elms and Marc Fennell isn’t as strong as it would first appear. Its main failing is that it doesn’t break things down, leaving the viewer with a hefty amount of google-fu to do afterwards to get a proper feel for the concepts discussed.  Straight to the moon: Damn this video is beautiful, I need to rewatch it.  Crash and burn: I'm not sure I really understood, I need to rewatch it.  Length: 03:24      My Drunk Kitchen  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE53Z_St9XE  You are really unlikely to learn anything about bitcoin from this video, but if you don’t smile at least once you are a heartless so and so.  Straight to the moon: “The new digital decentralized chocolate chip market is based purely on supply and demand.”  Crash and burn: Forget digital currencies, let’s get drunk and open a bakery!  Length: 06:26      We Use Coins  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2en3nHxA4  The updated version of the most watched bitcoin explainer ever, this video covers all the bases and uses some cool graphics to explain the concepts around bitcoin. Like Vox, it notes the potential of bitcoin as a platform for innovation but when it says “Let’s look at how it works”, it really means, 'Let’s not scare anyone away with the nitty gritty'. However, explaining bitcoin in just over a minute and a half was always going to requires compromises and, on the whole, We Use Coins provide a great introduction to the digital currency.  Straight to the moon: “Bitcoin is changing finance the same way the web changed publishing.”  Crash and burn: The wide-eyed cartoon people are a little bit creepy. Just a little bit.  Length: 01:36      Curious Inventor  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE  Are you willing to spend 20 minutes learning about how bitcoin actually works? Yes? Great! Watch this video. No? Move along then.  Straight to the moon: Now I’m finally beginning to understand what’s going on here.  Crash and burn: What year is it?  Length: 22:24      Khan Academy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-w7SnQWwVA  It’s probably not entirely fair to include this video, as it’s merely the introduction to a longer series of lessons on the mechanics of bitcoin. But it deserves a mention because if you really want to get to grips with the computer science behind bitcoin, it’s worth grabbing a pen and paper and spending a weekend with Zulfikar Ramzan, your teacher in these videos.  Straight to the moon: Achievement unlocked, bitcoin expert.  Crash and burn: My head hurts now.

42374529,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvlCsz,1400407554,Bitcoin's Youngest Entrepreneurs and Educators,"One day, probably quite soon, most kids will be getting their pocket money in digital currency and skilfully using it for in-game purchases, tipping buddies on reddit and other really cool things which have yet to be invented.  Currently, of course, most kids are still raiding their parents' pockets for a few units of their local fiat currency.  Yet there are a few enterprising youngsters here and there who have already discovered the advantages of bitcoin, are using it, and are even making generous amounts of pocket money from it.  In this article, CoinDesk looks at the kids that are making the most of bitcoin.  A swarm of talent  Hailing from Cache Valley, in northern Utah, three brothers between the ages of 11 and 15 have their own successful honey business at home in the Cache Valley.  It all began when Nate, Sam and Ben Huntzinger caught a swarm of bees as an experiment. Little did they know it would lead to a small business and an obsession with bitcoin.  Their father, Craig, says they had no intention of starting a business. “As we started working with honey and beeswax we started making new things for ourselves, and eventually got a small business licence, more honeybee hives, and started selling our items at our local Farmer’s Market,” he said.  They heard about bitcoin in 2011 and were instantly attracted by the concept of a decentralised, non-inflationary currency. The ideals behind bitcoin seem to align with those of the Huntzinger family.  The three brothers are home-schooled as their father admits they have a different view of education. “We don’t believe that government has a monopoly on education, nor that the only way to learn is being forced to sit at a desk all day and stare at a book […] The whole purpose of getting that first hive, and later the business licence, was all about education. What would happen if we did this…?”  The answer is a flourishing business and three boys learning about finance and investing before they've even finished high school. Business is booming. From selling pots of their honey locally, their company, Bees Brothers now produces several different flavours of honey caramels, honey roasted almonds, beeswax lip balms and candles both at the markets and via their website. And all can be had for bitcoin, of course.  The publishing moguls  If your children are confused about what bitcoin is and how to use it, then head right over to the BitKidz website where you'll find a host of online tutorials, as well as the chance to buy a host of books (using bitcoin) that explain the subject.  And that's not the best part. The site and books, as well as a host of other blogs and publications are all written by a trio of young sisters, who describe themselves thus on their blog:  ""We’re three tech tweenpreneurs, also known as The Sabra Sisters. We were born in 2000, 2001 and 2003. We’ve been blogging since 2008, started making money online in 2010, [and] became bestselling kindle authors in 2013.""  30th May 2013 was a life-changing day for the sisters. That was the day they were introduced to cryptography by their Uncle I.J.  Aware that they were all successful juvenile nonfiction authors, he challenged the sisters to write a '25 Fun Facts of Bitcoin' book, which eventually evolved into the five-book 'Bitcoin for Kids' series.  They immediately started researching into bitcoin and, less than 24 hours later, surprised him with the launch of their brand new blog dedicated to learning about the digital currency – the first post being entitled, 'Yes, we're interested Uncle I.J.' The rest as they say, is history.  The girls generally divide up the different tasks required for the publications, depending on their skills and preferences, but said JuJu:  ""My sisters and I split up the various tutorials so everyone had a share in spending bitcoin and having fun. ;-)""  Now the home-schooled girls justifiably boast they are ""professional bloggers and bestselling authors"", with some credit given to their mother Ponn – also a blogging professional – for her guiding input too.  Collectively, the Sabra sisters have over two-dozen kindle books published, with an astonishing 55,000 plus downloads during the past year, JuJu told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We rarely look at each individual title, but two books are our bestsellers making up nearly 40,000 of those downloads: 'Science Projects for Kids' and the 'My First Smoothie Recipe Book'.""  Cuteness and cookies  Reddit user DorkusPrime came across young entrepreneurs Mia and Taylor in California back in January in the Noe Valley neighbourhood of San Francisco. He posted a photo of the two little girls at their cookies and lemonade booth and it quickly became something of a web sensation.  ""These adorable little girls just sold me snickerdoodles for Bitcoin in San Francisco. I asked them to say cheese for the Internet :),"" DorkusPrime wrote at the time.  The girls were accepting bitcoins via the QR code plastered to the booth's roof. And business was pretty good too – the pair told Foodbeast that they had made 0.083 BTC, which was around $70 at the time.  The youngest bitcoin author  Youthful writer, Jaden Shelton (A.K.A. the Bitcoin Kid) claims to be ""the youngest author ever who has published a book offered only in bitcoin"".  Published last year, when he was nine, his book The Scary Blueberry is the ""ideal book for children facing new foods and new challenges!"", Jaden says on his online store.  Inspiration for the book came from his problems eating certain foods as a younger child, Jaden told CoinDesk:  ""It was something funny that happened in my childhood – I used to not eat certain foods and we would say ‘are you scared of a blank? I would say ‘no’ and we would keep joking around with it. A few years later, we started thinking about making a book about it.""  As well as being a self-published author, the Bitcoin Kid maintains a blog about aspects of bitcoin that interest him and as a platform for his videos.  A promising TV presenter, Jaden has posted a series of videos in which he interviews key staff at prominent digital currency businesses, such as ripple, Mycelum and BitInstant.  When asked what he planned to do later in life, Jaden said:  ""Well, you can’t buy anything unless you have a job, so I might be an entrepreneur ... or maybe sell toys to kids.""  The shrewd investor  📷  Andrew Karam isn’t your average nine-year-old. While most kids his age ask for the latest must-have toy for their birthdays, Andrew requested shares in Apple.  His parents bought him $120-worth and Andrew watched the price of the stock with interest, checking regularly whether his investment had gone up or down in value.  Andrew’s father, Steve, later told him about bitcoin and the schoolboy was hooked.  “He was incredibly excited about it and asked if I could take his Apple stock and cash it out for BTC, so I made him a paper wallet and […] bought a bit at a time,” Steve wrote in a post on reddit.  Andrew later told his teacher about his investment, revealing he had made about $50 since his dad bought him some bitcoins. He said he was originally thinking of cashing out 25% of his investment, but the savvy youngster decided to hold on to his cryptocurrency.  Andrew wanted to do more than just a talk at school to get his peers involved in digital currency. So he asked his father whether he could sell bitcoins to his classmates, then get them back by accepting BTC as payment for his Wonder Bracelets, which he makes from colourful elastic bands.  With a few doubts, Steve set up an online store for the aspiring entrepreneur called Bracelets for Bitcoinhttp://www.diddit.net/wonderbracelets/.  Andrew’s story and enthusiasm struck a chord within the bitcoin community, with some members of reddit making donations to the 4th grader.  Steve said his son is “super excited” by all the support he is getting and even commented that he wants to be a “professional millionaire” when he grows up.  The chancer  And finally, let us not forget the enterprising college kid who, in early December 2013, made it onto TV holding up a sign with a bitcoin logo and wallet QR code at ESPN's 'College GameDay' game.  After a little sharpening by helpful members of the public, a still of the moment made it onto the front page of reddit and caught the attention of the bitcoin community, who promptly sent him a flurry of donations amounting to over $24,000 in bitcoin, some of which he allegedly donated to Sean's Outpost – a bitcoin-funded homeless outreach centre in Pensacola, Florida.
