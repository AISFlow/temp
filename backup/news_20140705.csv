42397749,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3KG,1404565534,Online Art Gallery Experiments with Bitcoin Payments,"Two artists want to take on the art-world hierarchy with a website selling art with prices quoted in bitcoin.  The artists, Andy Boot and Valentin Rurhy, both based in Vienna, have created an online platform selling work by international contemporary artists. The twist is that its exhibitions are ephemeral. Cointemporary.comhttp://cointemporary.com/ only features one artist every seven days, and there's no way for buyers to purchase works if they missed the original showing.  Artists can also choose to accept payment in bitcoin and will receive a greater share of the proceeds than they would at most traditional galleries.  As Ruhry sees it, the top-heavy art economy, dominated by a cadre of elite dealers and gallerists, could benefit from some of the disruptive effects of a decentralised cryptocurrency:  ""The whole art world is very centralised. There are only a few gatekeepers who decide who will be the next big star, who will show at [for example] Art Basel.""  Cracking the Silicon Valley art market  The moneyed technologists of Silicon Valley know something about disruption. They have also long been a coveted customer demographic for art dealers. Getting the Valley's elite interested in buying art was the main motivation behind Silicon Valley Contemporary – an art fair that was organised for the first time three months ago, according to Artnet News, a trade title covering the art world.  The fair was geared towards technologists by exhibiting new media works. Bitcoin made an appearance both as a medium of payment and subject matter for the artworks themselves. Artnet reported that, within a half hour of the event, a sale had already been agreed, and settled in bitcoin, for a painting by Dana Louise Kirkpatrick featuring the bitcoin logo.  Another artist whose work has featured bitcoin prominently is San Francisco-based Tom Loughlin. His 2014 piece 'Bitcoin Payday' is a neon sign designed to mimic the look of a payday lender's window sign in downtown San Francisco. It was installed at Google in Mountain View and will be hung at the Jack Fischer Gallery in the City soon, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.  Loughlin took his bitcoin interest further by attempting to bid for the seized Silk Road bitcoin that was auctioned by the US Marshals Service with his piece Bitcoin Payday instead of the expected US dollars. The piece is priced at $13,500.  As the Chronicle reports, Loughlin's bid was driven by an insight into the economic value of art and its parallels with bitcoin and other decentralised cryptocurrencies. Loughlin's thought was that both art and bitcoin have seemingly arbitrary values. Ruhry, of Cointemporary, echoes Loughlin's insight.  ""Art is like bitcoin in that there is no intrinsic value. Why does a certain amount of canvas with a certain amount of colour on it cost $20,000 while the next work is $2,000? If you look at the materials, they're the same, right? It's almost impossible to value artworks, and it's almost impossible to value currencies.""  Cointemporary's currency risk  Artists are warming to the the idea of accepting bitcoin for their works, Ruhry said. According to him, artists who consign their works to Cointemporary are given the choice of taking payment in fiat currency or bitcoin. Cointemporary gives an incentive to artists who accept payment in bitcoin by offering a larger cut of the sale price, or 70%, compared to a fiat payout, which yields 60%.  Ruhry said:  ""We are quite surprised by how well [Cointemporary] has been received in the art world. We were really afraid, to be honest [...] artists could say we are trying to rip them off, but it's the opposite. We have a long pipeline, we can't have any new artists, we're fully booked.""  Cointemporary agrees on the price of a work with the artist before it is exhibited on the website. The price is then converted to bitcoin using the average bitcoin price over the last 24-hours at the point it is listed.  Because of the way Cointemporary sets its bitcoin prices, there is a chance that the market may move against it before a piece is sold. Ruhry and Boot have to bear the exchange rate risk as a result. Ruhry pointed out that buyers could also exploit a fluctuating bitcoin price by purchasing a work when the cryptocurrency was weak and then offloading it when the price rose.  ""If the artist is paid in US dollars or euro, we bear the risk if the price [of bitcoin] goes down. Then of course, we have to exchange more of our own bitcoin [to make up the difference],"" Ruhry said.  Cointemporary consigns pieces from artists who work across a range of media. It launched at the end of May with works by Swiss photographer Beat Streuli, who has exhibited at London's Tate Gallery and Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art. Recent weeks have featured work ranging from paintings by New York-based Larissa Lockshin to installations by Berlin duo Anetta Mona Chişa and Lucia Tkáčová.  Works shown at Cointemporary range from a painting by Lockshin for 4 BTC, to a Chişa and Tkáčová installation costing 16 BTC. Artwork that's sold is shipped by a Viennese fine art logistics company called Kunsttrans, which also accepts bitcoin.  Bitcoin's negligible impact  Not everyone shares Cointemporary's optimistic take on bitcoin and the art world. Jessica Silverman, who runs an eponymous gallery in San Francisco focused on emerging artists, believes bitcoin's impact on the art economy is negligible:  ""We have never sold anything using [bitcoin or cryptocurrencies]. I would be open to it but at this moment, we do not see the need to move in this direction or how it would help our clients, artists or the gallery itself.""  Silverman is already a relatively enthusiastic proponent of bitcoin, however. Her gallery's next exhibition, 'The History of Technology', will include an artwork that will be available for sale on Cointemporary.  Ruhry, who is a sculptor and currently a lecturer at the San Francisco Art Institute, learned about bitcoin while he was teaching at an art school in Austria in 2011. He concedes that it took him several years before he bought the cryptocurrency himself.  Cointemporary itself hasn't made any sales yet, he said, although he said he had received serious enquiries into some of Lockshin's work. Getting art collectors into the bitcoin economy will take time, he said.  ""For us, Cointemporary is an art project, it's a statement, an experiment, and then it's a commercial platform. We don't expect to get rich with this, but we think it's important.""

42397754,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3OC,1404563118,Under the Microscope: The Real Costs of a Dollar,"Money makes the world go round, and for the past several hundred years, paper currency and coins were the physical manifestation of money. Once upon a time, most paper currency in the world was backed by gold and directly exchangeable for it. This system of backing currency with tangible, universally exchangeable reserves was known as The Bretton Woods system, and was used to help the world rebuild economically after World War II (United Nations, 1948). On August 15, 1971, US President Richard Nixon ended the Bretton Woods System (Ghizoni, 1971), in what is now known as “The Nixon Shock”, allowing all currencies to float freely, with only the backing of the faith and credit of their issuing sovereign state. This type of currency is known as “fiat currency”, i.e., currency that is given value by government decree (Keynes, et al., 1978). This report will not discuss the relative merits and drawbacks of gold-backed currency and fiat-money, only the triple-bottom-line impacts of each.    Future trends  With the built-in “infinite” inflation of fiat money, more and more physical currency will need to be printed and minted every year, unless we move to a completely digital system of transaction. According to a research report issued by Smithers-Pira (2014) on the world security printing market, “digitisation and convergence are two megatrends that the security printing industry needs to come to terms with. They can be seen as a threat jeopardising the very existence of the industry, or as an opportunity to innovate and evolve in order to address risk in a broader context. In the near foreseeable future, however, security printing will continue to fulfil its critical role of preventing and detecting alterations, forgeries and copies, and support product authenticity”.  In terms of printing trends, countries like Australia and Canada use polymer-based notes which reduces both economic and environmental costs of physical currency significantly, with the United Kingdom poised to go polymer in 2016 (Allen, 2013). Coins, which have a high environmental impact due to the metal required to produce them, will most likely be phased out over the next 40 years. The reason for this is it currently costs the United States Government 1.83 cents to make a 1 cent coin, and 9.41 cents to make a 10 cent coin (Zielinski, 2014). Ireland has spent €11.8m to produce €7.1m worth of 1 Euro cent coins (Reilly, 2013). Over time, due to increasing metal costs, it will become untenable for governments to make real losses on production of currency. Some jurisdictions, like Australia, discontinued their 1 cent and 2 cent coins in 1990 (Royal Australian Mint, 2014), and as inflation continues on towards infinity, it will be less and less economically viable to produce such low denominations of currency, and therefore we might expect impacts due to minted coins to reduce over time.  Physical currency lifecycle  Banknotes  According to the US Federal Reserve, the life-span of non-polymer paper money varies based on denomination, as shown below.  A report prepared for The Bank of Canada ahead of the implementation of Polymer notes found that they will typically last at least 2.5 to 4 times as long as paper notes (PE Americas; Tryskele, 2011), (Ahlers, et al., 2010).  Once notes have reached the end of their useful life, they are typically pulped, compressed into bricks, and sent to an official government incinerator where they are burned, leading to environmental impact during both creation of new notes and destruction of old ones (Jackson, 2010).  Coins  After coins are minted from a typical mix of copper and steel with nickel plating, they are put into circulation where their average life is roughly 25 years (U.S. Mint, 2014). Once coins have reached their useful life, or are too worn and mutilated for circulation, they are returned to the mint for recycling (U.S. Mint, 2014).  Currency in Circulation  M0 & M1 Money Supply  The M0 money supply is defined as the total amount of monetary assets available in an economy at a specific time (Johnson, 2005). The M1 money supply accounts for all physical currency circulating in an economy, but global M1 figures are difficult to obtain. The below table shows global M0 figures from 2008. After the global financial crisis, world money supply increased dramatically, however, this didn’t translate highly into printed physical currency, i.e. M1 supply – just more numbers on a screen in a financial institution, i.e. M0 supply. The rest of this chapter will simplify the analysis greatly by assuming similar proportions for M0 and M1 money supply, and typically only consider the Euro, USD and Yen, who account for 60% of the world total, and extrapolate figures from there.  Coins  The next sections will use the Euro and the USD to illustrate this point further, and attempt to extrapolate production to other markets.    Japan  Japan bucks the trend of the US and EU and only has about 4.5 billion coins in circulation, over 20 times less than the EU or USA (Statistics Japan, 2014).  Rest of world  Statistics from India show over 1 trillion coins in circulation – roughly 4 times the quantity of USD coins and Euro coins combined (Chinnammai, 2013). Combining the USD, EU and India accounts for only one third of the world’s population, so to be conservative, it will be assumed that 1.5 trillion coins are circulating around the planet, at an average weight of 3.5 tonnes per million coins, i.e., 5.25 million tonnes of metal circulating in the form of coins.  Banknotes  Due to their higher value, there are much less banknotes in the world than coins, as demonstrated in the US example in the figure below. According to the US Federal Reserve, there is approximately USD$1.27 trillion in circulation, of which $1.22 trillion is in over 35 billion Federal Reserve notes.  The EU has 15.8 billion notes in circulation that are valued at €933.7 billion as at February 2014 (European Central Bank, 2014). Japan, the country with the 3rd Japan, 2014). With the US, EU and Japan accounting for 60% of the world’s M0 money supply, and through assumption, 60% of the world’s M1 money supply, it can be assumed that at least 200 billion bank notes are in circulation around the world.  Economic costs of physical currency  Banknotes  Smithers-Pira estimates the global market for security printing in 2018 to reach USD$35.3 billion, based on a compound annual growth rate of 5.9% between 2013 – 2018, putting the current global market size at USD$26.5 billion (Smithers Pira, 2013).  As a check, the United States paper currency budget for 2014 is USD$826.7 million (U.S. Federal Reserve, 2014). The United States has typically cheaper printed currency, due to their cotton-linen mix as opposed to typically polymer-based security currency. Whilst polymer notes cost twice as much as cotton ones, they last 4 times as long, effectively cutting the whole-of-life costs by 50% (Ahlers, et al., 2010).  Due to their increased defence against counterfeiting, as well as their longevity and lower environmental impact, it is expected that if the world does not go digital with their currency, polymer security notes will take over the cotton-linen market.  Coins  The budget to mint US Coins in 2013 was USD$459 million (U.S. Mint, 2014) however, it is difficult to glean a detailed breakdown of these costs. To take the simplest approach, we can multiply the mass of all coins in circulation by the cost to buy the equivalent amount of raw materials, with a 25% premium put in place for the production process.  In 2013, the US used 37240 tonnes of metal to produce coins, of which 90% was copper and 10% was nickel (U.S. Mint, 2014). At a copper price of $7000/tonne and a Nickel price of $16,000/tonne (London Metal Exchange, 2014), this equates to USD$350 million in materials. A 25% premium brings it to just over USD$430 million, which is close to the official figure of USD$459 million.  Applying this logic to Euro coins which have similar composition, and the very conservative assumption the Euro and USD account for only half of the world’s yearly minted coin stock, it can be concluded that international coin minting costs over USD$1.5 billion every year.  Environmental Costs of Physical Currency  Again, whilst little globally aggregated data exists, we can analyse data on coins, paper and polymer-based notes from the world’s major economies. Detailed data exists for the USA, Euro, Australia and Canada.  Paper Currency  A very comprehensive sustainability assessment undertaken by Ahlers et al (2010) attempts to quantify the environmental impacts of the US Dollar, in contrast with polymer-based notes produced in Australia. The major environmental costs, based on data from 2002, are as follows (Ahlers, et al., 2010):  Water Use During Paper Making: 1 million gallons / day = 1.4 billion litres per year  Water Use During Printing: 250,000 gallons / day = 0.35 billion litres per year  Waste Ink & Pulp Sludge = 6 million pounds = 2720 tonnes  Electricity Use During Printing: 97850 MWH of electricity = 0.35 million GJ  Electricity Use for Pulp Making = Same as electricity used during printing = 0.45 million GJ  Ink Usage = 3540 tonnes  Over 7100 tonnes of cotton  Over 2300 tonnes of linen  Using the above data, production of US paper notes in 2002 has similar electricity use to the Euro (0.8 million GJ vs 0.87 million GJ), and as the M0/M1 money supplies of both countries grew pretty similarly, it can be concluded that current electricity need to produce all notes in circulation is on par with the Euro at around 4.6 million GJ.  The Euro publishes sustainability statistics on their currency, and according to latest estimates, 3 billion banknotes printed in 2003 had an equivalent energy impact of 460,000 60W bulbs switched on for a year, which equates to 240 million kWh, or 0.87 million GJ. With circulation now at 15.8 billion notes, this would scale up to 4.6 million GJ (European Central Bank, 2007). To get to a global figure, for the purposes of this report, I will be multiplying this figure by a factor of four (i.e. a proportional share of global M0/M1 money supply). Therefore, we reach a figure of 18.4 million GJ, which would correspond to almost 3.07 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.  Using heuristics from analysis of 100 paper bank notes, the conclusion can be drawn that 200 billion notes produce 3.2 million tonnes of CO2, with 100 paper notes producing 1.59kg CO2 equivalent (PE Americas; Tryskele, 2011). This figure checks well.  Polymer Currency  Polymer Currency has shown to produce at least 30% less environmental impact than cotton-paper currency (PE Americas; Tryskele, 2011). Due to the relatively small volume of polymer-based currency currently circulating internationally, polymer based currency will not be considered further in this report. As discussed earlier, due to economic, environmental, and social superiority to cotton-paper money, it is likely that over the next generation, all paper money circulating in the world will become polymer based.  Coins  Although there is no concrete data of global yearly minting statistics, data from the EU and US can be extrapolated globally. As a check, you can divide the number of coins currently in circulation in the world, 1.5 trillion, by the average life of a coin, 25 years, to reach a figure of 60 billion coins minted per annum. For reference, the U.S. mint minted 10.7 billion coins in 2013 (U.S. Mint, 2013), so a global figure of 60 billion is not unreasonable.  Using weight data from earlier sections of this report, the average weight of one million coins is roughly 3.5 tonnes. This means that 60 billion coins will require 210,000 tonnes of metal. Simplifying further and optimistically assuming that coins are 50% copper and 50% steel by weight, and using the carbon emissions data from the table below, we reach a figure of 21.25 million GJ to simply mine the materials used for coin making, not including the energy required for cutting and stamping coins.  Using the GJ to kW to tCO2 heuristics from earlier in the report, 21.25 million GJ equates to 3.5 million tonnes of CO2.  Socioeconomic Costs of Physical Currency  Due to its inherent physical and economic properties, fiat currency can be highly advantageous to malevolent actors. Paper money is very easy to counterfeit and launder, and almost impossible to trace and track. Due to its inflationary nature, nefarious types like drug dealers, human traffickers, corrupt public officials and other members of the shadow economy use it as their currency of choice to facilitate their ongoing operations. The socioeconomic costs of these activities are shown below.  Money Laundering  In 1996, the IMF estimated that 2-5% of the entire world’s economy involved laundered money – a figure translating to about $1.5 trillion a year. Whilst this figure seems large, several other experts estimate that the value is closer to $2.85 trillion per year (Smith, 2011). These experts are backed by a 2008 UN report into money-laundering and globalisation which put the figure at anywhere between $800 billion and $3 trillion per annum (UN Office on Drugs and Crime, 2008).  A report by The Council on Foreign Relations translates this dollar figure poignantly into human costs, citing 50,000 deaths in Mexico over the past 6 years due to drug trafficking, as well as the enslavement of 27 million people in forced labour, prostitution, and other activities relate to human trafficking (Council on Foreign Relations, 2013). Social costs of illegal arms trafficking are difficult to quantify, but are no doubt significant.  Seigniorage  As shown in the above calculations, the cost to print money is substantially less than what the money is valued at. The result is inflation / loss of consumer buying power. Global average yearly inflation is 3.9% (CIA World Factbook, 2013), which makes your money worth more than 30% less after 10 years, less than half after 20 years, and 70% less over 30 years, a reasonable estimate for length for a retirement commencing in 2014.  Corruption  In addition to the social damage and the trillions of dollars that money laundering costs the global economy, it is estimated that an additional $1.6 trillion is lost to governments around the world every year (BBC News, 2009) due to corrupt politicians and public officials.  Transactional fraud  Transactional fraud, mainly through credit and debit cards, cost the global economy a staggering $190 billion per year (LexisNexis, 2013).  Institutional Fraud  The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates the yearly cost of fraud to be 5% of global revenues, or, $3.7 trillion per year, based on 2013 global figures (Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, 2014).  It should be noted that institutional fraud is a problem that is systemic to humans, and not to monetary systems per se. However, as there have been several attacks against the quantity of institutional fraud and scams found in the unregulated world of Bitcoin, it is useful to quantify the magnitude of fraud in the regulated world of corporations. Due to the frequency and magnitude of fraud in the legacy system, I will only refer to single fraud events larger than the largest ever single alleged institutional Bitcoin fraud event (Mt Gox in 2014), so as to not encumber the reader with too many examples.  Theft  Again, it should be noted that theft is a problem that is systemic to humans, and not to monetary systems per se. However, as there have been several attacks against the quantity of thefts found in the world of Bitcoin, it is useful to quantify the magnitude of thefts found in legacy systems. Due to the frequency and magnitude of thefts in legacy systems, I will only refer to single theft events larger or similar in size to the largest ever single alleged Bitcoin theft event (Mt Gox in 2014), so as to not encumber the reader with too many examples.  Further to the above single events, it is estimated that 1.4% of retail revenues, or $112 billion in 2012, are lost to petty theft and shop-lifting every year (Griffin, 2013).  The Black Market  In addition to the more than $3 trillion dollars lost to laundering and corruption, the world’s economy is subject to a further loss of $1.8 trillion dollars to the black market. A lot of the money that enters the black market is “clean”, i.e., a citizen using legally obtained money to purchase illegal goods. The breakdown of this $1.8 trillion dollar market is shown in the table below (Havoscope, 2014).  We've now looked at the costs of printing and minting physical currency, alongside gold production and bitcoin mining.

42397742,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3BP,1404560117,Bitfin: Concluding Panel Talks Bitcoin Doomsday Scenarios,"The concluding session of the Bitcoin Finance 2014 Conference and Expo (Bitfin) featured a wide-ranging, high-level discussion on bitcoin's future that included prominent figures from the bitcoin world and elsewhere.  The panellists were Max Keiser, the host of The Keiser Report, which airs on Russia Today; Elizabeth Rossiello, chief executive of the Kenyan remittance company BitPesa; Rainey Reitman, activism director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit focused on civil liberties in the digital world; Jay Bregman, CEO of taxi-hailing app Hailo; and Greg Brockman, chief technology officer at payments services company Stripe.  Michael Terpin, managing director of social media marketing firm Social Radius, moderated the panel, titled 'Evolution or Revolution?'. The panellists were to discuss the question of whether bitcoin would ""fundamentally change money and the global financial system"".  The empire strikes back  Perhaps the most interesting spell of discussion came towards the end of the almost hour-long session. Terpin posed the provocative question of how the ""empire would strike back"". That is, how would the incumbents in the current financial system potentially limit or impede the growth of decentralised currencies like bitcoin?  Reitman, of the EFF, described a future for the cryptocurrency that would see it be gradually overwhelmed by ""small bits"" of regulation, rather than a dramatic, sweeping move by a government or large financial institution, saying:  ""What I suspect is going to happen first is that we're going to see small bits of regulatory pieces work their way into existing laws [...] What other little pieces of regulation are they going to stick in [that could create] particular limitations on bitcoin?""  Dangers of consumer demand  Reitman also warned that a growing demand for simplified, convenient bitcoin-based products and the entrepreneurs and investors supplying them could ironically sound the death knell for bitcoin. She highlighted consumer demand for familiar financial products and the guarantees that come with them, citing debit and credit cards as examples:  ""Big players trying to move into this space, offering super-simple, consumer-oriented services that offer, for example, the same kind of consumer protections that people have come to expect with debit cards and credit cards [...] would create a kind of environment that is centralised and is everything that is wrong with the existing financial systems.""  Reitman further underlined the seriousness of a consumer-driven threat to bitcoin, saying that the danger was imminent.  ""I'm not talking 10 years from now. I'm talking two years from now,"" she said.  Financial panic  Hailo CEO Jay Bregman painted a slightly more dramatic picture of central authorities creating a financial panic that would cause people to stop using bitcoin. He drew on his personal experience running a company that served banks during the financial crisis of 2008 as an example of the sort of widespread fear that could cause mass abandonment of the cryptocurrency.  ""I was in London during the financial crisis,"" he said. ""I was scared and so were lots of other people [...] The best thing you can ever do to try and quell any large sea-change in your market is to precipitate that kind of fear. One way is to exploit holes in the infrastructure itself. You get things like Gox.""  He also described an alternative scenario where bitcoin would be allowed to grow in popularity, only to have a calamity befall it, where some central authority would ride to the rescue:  ""The alternative is [...] let bitcoin get so big and then precipitate a crisis based on that. And then you say, 'Look, this is why you need us: you need us because we're the guys who keep finance going'. I believe that's the thing that people should be on the lookout for.""  Keiser on bitcoin's future  The panel also discussed more optimistic possible futures for bitcoin. When asked what he thought would be the next inflection point for bitcoin, Max Keiser said a major banking meltdown would provide an opening for the cryptocurrency; that the dollar would eventually be replaced as the global reserve currency, and that a cryptocurrency could be a candidate.  ""The next battleground will be in the next major crisis in the banking sector. If you have a situation like we've seen with BNP being forced to pay a nine billion fine [...] that's outright extortion,"" he said, referring to the fine issued to French bank BNP Paribas over alleged US sanctions violations.  Keiser summed up the panel's consensus that the existing financial system, centred on large banks and their business models, needed fixing.  ""Banks are so tied to this business model of fraud, there is no room for legal behaviour in banking,"" he said.

42397740,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbE3DN,1404556250,How Wisconsin is Helping Lead the Bitcoin Movement Across the Greater US Landscape,"A whitetail doe and her fawn run through the woods at the Donges Bay Gorge, a parcel of Lake Michigan-fronting land wedged between new McMansions in Mequon, Wisconsin. The nature preserve is one of the many properties in this part of the Midwest whose future protection could be funded by bitcoin.      The properties are owned or managed by the Ozaukee Washington Land Trust, a non-profit entity that posts its bitcoin address on its website for potential donations.      “Donate your bitcoins and we’ll plant trees,” said executive director Shawn Graff, a cryptocurrency enthusiast who brought the idea to the board in 2010 and saw the bitcoin donation option through to reality. So far, the group has received three bitcoin donations.      He continued:      “It’s not huge, but you never know, maybe someday each bitcoin will be worth several thousand dollars. Or there might be a crash and somebody might give us a million bitcoins – and one day they’ll be worth thousands of dollars again.”            Bitcoin enthusiasts in the country    The Ozaukee Washington Land Trust is managed out of a historic railroad depot, tucked behind a townhouse complex in suburban West Bend, WI. It’s not a likely spot to envision the future of cryptocurrency. Yet Graff, in his neat polo shirt and khakis, exemplifies the kind of bitcoin enthusiast you can find everywhere in the middle of the United States, far from hubs like New York or San Francisco where bitcoin conferences convene and investors pour dollars into new cryptocurrency ventures.      Wisconsin, after all, is the state where Mark Clear, a candidate for the State Assembly, recently accepted – and had to give back – a bitcoin campaign contribution. It’s also the state where Jamie Russell, of Eau Claire, is mounting a legal case against the alleged fraudster, who he said pocketed $150,000 in bitcoin that he was supposed to convert into physical coins.    A Milwaukee meetup    On a Thursday night, a dozen bitcoin enthusiasts gather at Hotel Foster in Milwaukee’s hip East Side neighborhood. A deer head mounted on the wall melds with illuminated chandeliers and a chalkboard full of sophisticated cocktail names that create an eclectic space that still screams “Wisconsin”. On an upstairs patio, a passionate but orderly discussion proceeds about ways to broaden bitcoin acceptance in the city.      Several businesses here take bitcoin, said BitcoinMKE member Tareq Fares, including a club called The Bad Genie – where Fares, a CPA by day, DJs at night – a gas station, and a smoke shop on Old World 3rd Street called 414 Glass & Grooves that is about to launch its acceptance of bitcoin with a weekend party.      The next target, Fares said, is a juice bar where the owners are interested but aren’t making bitcoin acceptance a high priority.      “Next time you’re in the area, stop by and ask them about it,” Fares urged the others at the meetup.

The men, sitting around nursing Lakefront Brewery beers, are all serious about bitcoin. There are fewer newbies than typically turn up at bitcoin events in San Francisco. Also unlike San Francisco, none of the members here tonight work in a bitcoin-related business – although some of them would like to.      Group member Paul Sanchez said he doesn’t understand why bitcoin companies aren’t spreading their hiring across a broader swath of the country:      “How can the merchant adoption grow unless CoinBase and BitPay are actively seeking salespeople in places like this?”              Until recently, Sanchez operated Crazy Chef restaurant, where he accepted bitcoins and sold a “Bitcoin Burger”, with a bitcoin symbol on the bun (he painstakingly marked each bun with a heated coat hanger). He posted his QR code on the menu, to make bitcoin payments easy, and encouraged his waitstaff to accept bitcoin tips.      He has since sold the place, and the new owners don’t seem to be interested in picking up the bitcoin mantle, Sanchez said.      “There was always a bitcoin conversation going on there,” Fares said, a little wistfully.      BitcoinMKE hosted bitcoin superstar entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos in February, at an event that drew 100 people in person and several hundred more online. Chris Bresette is a trumpet player trying to get other members of the local band De La Buena to embrace bitcoin. He said that event “was the biggest event since I’ve been with the group”.      The group's founder, bitcoin advocate Will Pangman, has since moved on.    Bitcoin around Wisconsin    Wisconsin's college town capital Madison, where Clear accepted that short-lived bitcoin contribution at a fundraiser, is another bitcoin hotspot. The city has its own Meetup group and its own bitcoin-accepting businesses, like the Bandung Indonesian Restaurant.      Bitcoin use isn’t limited to Wisconsin’s major cities. Businesses that accept the digital currency are scattered here and there. Even in outdoorsy, tourist mecca Door County, you can use bitcoin to take a kayak tour or ride a zipline at Door County Kayak Tours.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Carrie Kirby,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/05/how-wisconsin-is-helping-lead-the-bitcoin-movement-across-the-greater-us-landscape,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/477fab4fab038d7cb49ff47875961945c22b75e5-2048x1530.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
