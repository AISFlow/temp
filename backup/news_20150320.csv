42398278,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Uo,1426882869,Bitcoin in the Headlines: UK Regulation Trumps Dark Market Collapse,"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly look at global bitcoin news, analysing media coverage and its impact.  The UK Treasury set the tone for a positive, if quiet, bitcoin news cycle this week with the publication of a lengthy report that promised the industry will soon be regulated domestically.  As the UK-based bitcoin community revelled in the news, others were left reeling at the sudden dissolution of a black market that seems to have sent the price of bitcoin into a tailspin.  Once again we will bear witness to the good, the bad and the ugly as we take a look at this week's top headlines from across the globe.  The UK's big moment  The normally quiet UK bitcoin ecosystem was thrust into the spotlight this week after the Treasury published proposed regulation for the nascent sector, which included anti-money laundering (AML) rules.  The global ecosystem has long been plagued with a level of uncertainty, with entrepreneurs reporting that the lack of existing regulation has made it difficult for them to do business and hampered the possibility of securing banking relationships, the latter of which has proved especially problematic in the UK.  Although the specifics of the Treasury's proposal will not undergo consultation until the next parliament, it seems that the news was well-received across the media. At the time of press the terms ""bitcoin"" and ""UK budget"" brought up over 70 Google results.  In her piece in the Financial Times, Jane Wild noted the change from the government which had previously warned mainly of the technology's risks.  Wired's Katie Collins also discussed the government's announcement, stating:  ""It is hoped that regulation will not only prevent criminal use of digital currencies, such as bitcoin, but support innovation.""  She continued: ""Ideally the environment would allow for the fast, efficient and secure transfer of ownership of anything of value over the internet. It could guarantee that a secure and permanent record is made of what had taken place, without the need for a third party to oversee the process.""  This week's scandal  As the chatter about regulation increased, the other side of the Internet was shouting about bitcoin's most recent scandal – another dark web marketplace running away with users' money.  Whether you think that criminals, who have been fouled by other criminals, deserve sympathy or not, the truth seems to be that Verto and Kimble, Evolution's administrators, ran off with approximately $12m worth in bitcoin.  Whatever the story, major publications are rushing to tell the latest tall tale.  Forbes' Thomas Fox-Brewster described the site as a ""bigger, badder version of the Silk Road drug bazaar"".  Highlighting the issue of trust in bitcoin transactions, the author said:  ""Ironically, the site had what was supposed to be a security feature, with funds held in escrow until at leat two of the parties involved in a transaction signed off.""  AlJazeera published a piece titled ""Evolution devolves: When dark net drug deals go badly"", noting that ""since Silk Road, dark web markets have gotten darker"".  While narcotics were by far the most popular listings on Evolution, it continues, the author also says that it did a swift trade in stolen bank information and other illicit activities. It seems that drug dealers are diversifying their business, which begs the question of what we can expect to see next.  Verge of mainstream  With the regulation chatter invading the UK, and the sudden disappearance of Evolution, credit goes to Forbes' Ilya Pozin for asking the question that everyone wants answered: is the world ready for bitcoin to go mainstream?  Pozin said:  ""Bitcoin is changing the way people pay for things and the larger economy overall. Although bitcoin remains mysterious and confusing to most people, there are signs nearly every day that bitcoin is gaining more and more legitimacy, not only in technology circles but also amongst the mainstream.""  Citing Goldman Sachs' recent report, which construed that bitcoin had the potential to reshape the financial industry, Pozin was sure to point out that it if was ever to succeed, the digital currency had to become integrated into everyday use.  Whether bitcoin will ever hit the big time will remain to be seen, but it seems that we may be moving in the right direction, at least for now.

42398267,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Ky,1426866817,Ukraine 'to Crackdown on Separatist Bitcoin Accounts',"The Ukrainian government is planning to block bitcoin accounts used by separatists operating in the Eastern regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, reports suggest.  Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the chairman of Ukraine's security service (SBU) told iPress that the crackdown would also focus on card and bank accounts.  Nalyvaychenko noted:  ""The financing of terrorism in the territory of Ukraine is carried out not only by the cash coming from Russia, but also through attempts to make money through electronic systems [...] we will work to block cards and bitcoin accounts being used by the separatists.""  The chairman did not explain how the security service was planning to block the accounts.  In the meantime, Reddit users have fuelled speculation that Ukranian exchange website BTCTrade.com.ua may be inaccessible to domestic Internet users.  Confirmation, which has been loosely translated, came via Twitter: ""We are under suspicion by Privatbank. We apologise for temporarily suspending payouts in Hryvnia.""    #приватбанк заподозрил нас в чем-то, приносим всем извинения, временно выплаты гривны приостоновленны...      — btc_trade_ua (@btc_trade_ua) March 19, 2015                    Privatbank  is the largest commercial bank in the Ukraine.  The SBU defines itself as a special-purpose law-enforcement agency, and serves as the country's main agency in the areas of counterintelligence activity and combatting terrorism.  Ukraine's cash crisis                  Despite claims that bitcoin has been used to fund terrorist activity in Eastern Ukraine, the digital currency has also played a role in the aftermath of Kiev's protests.  After President Viktor Yanukovych's removal from office and the subsequent eruption of violent demonstrations across the country, people rallied to campaign for funds.  Sending money to Ukraine, however, was not an easy feat. PayPal would only allow money to be sent out of the country, while international bank transfers could take days to clear.  Photos of protesters holding campaign signs to raise funds directly via bitcoin in Kiev's central square began to surface online. The insurgents were holding up QR codes, as part of a co-ordinated effort to collect instantaneous donations from everywhere in the world.  At press time, BTCTrade.com.ua and SBU had not responded to requests for comment.

42398277,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Vn,1426865422,Treasury Report: UK's Bitcoin Startups React,"This week's news that the UK government will seek to regulate digital currencies made waves in the local startup community.  The UK Treasury report, revealed on Wednesday as part of chancellor George Osborne's annual budget, outlined plans to curb criminal activity via AML (anti-money laundering) regulation and allow digital currency companies to opt-in to standardised consumer protections following May's election. The government also proposed injecting £10m into research on digital currencies as part of its larger pledge to innovation in FinTech.  While many of the 120 submissions that informed the Treasury's plans came from payment bodies, banks, academics, consultancies and fellow government agencies, bitcoin companies also weighed in on the future of digital currency regulation in the UK.  Now that the report and its conclusions are public, are the UK's crypto startups happy with the balance that has been struck? We tracked them down to find out.  The Exchanges  Chief among the Treasury report's proposals was the introduction of anti-money laundering regulation for digital currency exchanges operating in the UK.  The exact scope of this regulation (and the regulator enacting it) will be up for debate in the next parliament, but it is likely that exchanges in the UK will have to perform tighter background checks on the digital currency flowing through their books. In turn, customers buying bitcoin may no longer be able to do so anonymously.  Marc Warne, founder of UK bitcoin marketplace Bittylicious, praised the sensibility of the proposals, but questioned regulating crypto-only exchanges at this early stage:  ""A light touch approach, such as HMRC's general AML policies, make sense for fiat-to-crypto exchanges, and many legitimate businesses in the UK are already implementing such procedures, even if not required. Some AML regulation for digital currency exchanges makes sense to me, but I feel it may be wise to limit this to on and off ramps at this stage rather than crypto-to-crypto exchanges.""  QuickBitcoin  co-founder Hugh Halford-Thompson was also impressed by this 'light-touch'. He, like many others, hopes that the government's actions will help bitcoin companies score banking relationships, which have so far proved elusive both in the UK and abroad.  ""It's good that they see our industry as a nascent one where heavy handed regulation could be detrimental. The government has a real chance here to legitimise the sector. I hope that with this banks will change their tack and stop blacklisting the word 'bitcoin'.""  Not everyone agrees, however.  Rather than legitimising the industry, Akin Fernandez, who runs London's bitcoin voucher shop Azteco, said he suspects the Treasury's ""artificial restrictions"" will force the UK's bitcoin companies to move abroad. He added:  ""It’s the opposite of what we asked for. In our submission, we made it plain that arbitrary, irrational regulation is precisely what is not needed. We wanted Britain to be the top destination for bitcoin startups. As far as Azteco is concerned, we can incorporate in any jurisdiction, and will choose the one that is best suited to our business model.""  Bitcoin firms already implementing background checks on customers are more welcoming.  Speaking to CoinDesk, a spokesperson from London-based bitcoin derivatives trading platform, Crypto Facilities, said the company already has ""strict"" KYC and AML procedures in place and is prepared to comply with ""reasonable guidance"" from the government. The company also welcomed what it termed as the UK's active and open approach towards digital currencies, adding:  ""We think best practice standards would benefit the industry, provided that they do not unduly burden UK-based businesses, reflect the intricacies of digital currencies and are commensurate with the limited resources of many digital currency-related companies and the early stage of the industry as a whole.""  One of the UK's top Local Bitcoins traders, who wished to remain anonymous, said the regulations will probably be workable for his business, which also requires users to present proof of identity. He has made several thousand trades since joining the platform.  ""Due to fraud risks the ID we require currently is generally stricter than [traditional] AML requirements so it won't be that big a change on the customer side. There will be more admin in making and maintaining records so there will be time and costs to be met. However, the devil is in the detail and we won't know that for a few months.""  The Developers  Much like New York, which announced that software developers would be exempt from its forthcoming BitLicense, there is no indication that the UK will require digital currency startups to comply with regulation if they do not hold customer funds.  Blockchain  , which operates an office in East London, provides a range of bitcoin tools, including a wallet service. Unlike other wallet providers however, its users retain custody of their private keys.  The company's Global Policy Counsel, Marco Santori, praised the line the report has drawn between exchanges and other bitcoin businesses:  ""If any digital currency business model creates a risk of money laundering, it's the exchange model. HMT (Her Majesty's Treasury) did research sufficient to understand this, and has decided to control for it by developing AML requirements. This is in welcome contrast to the blunderbuss approaches we've seen in other jurisdictions.""  He added that the Treasury's proposals are likely to put consumers first:  ""As to consumer protection, HMT has rightly focused on custodians, and the resulting framework will likely be opt-in. This approach respects consumers' right to choose the custodian of their funds, which Blockchain supports. Though Blockchain, as a non-custodian, will likely not be directly included in this framework, the company sees it as a step in the right direction, and an opportunity to further develop a consumer-friendly regulatory landscape.""  Jonathan James Harrison, formerly of ATM startup Satoshipoint, started a new software venture, Telebit, last month. The service, which operates on Telegram, lets the messaging app's 50 million monthly users send bitcoin to each other without the need to register. Unlike Blockchain, Telebit does store users' funds in a centralised company wallet.  Harrison said:  ""This report shows the UK government is supporting digital currencies and the innovation they bring, which is very positive news. For us at Telebit, we operate in a crypto-only environment and will not be subject to these new AML regulations.""  He added that the report comes as welcome news to bootstrapped startups who may be unable to afford legal advice and compliance officers.  The Storage Providers  While respondents to the Treasury's Call for Information were fairly united on the need for crime prevention, they were more divided on the subject of consumer protection. Just under half didn't think the government should regulate on the subject, while others advocated to adapt existing FCA frameworks for consumers.  The government's conclusion fell somewhere between the two camps, advocating for a set of voluntary industry standards developed in consultation with the BSI (British Standards Institution) and the bitcoin community, something championed by industry group UKDCA.  Indeed, bitcoin custodians – companies who hold funds on behalf of customers – have been moving towards standardised practices for some time. Multi-sig wallet provider BitGo recently joined with C4 to create a draft Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS), while UK bitcoin vault Elliptic has taken steps to audit and insure its operations.  Elliptic  's COO Tom Robinson said the Treasury's conclusions mirrored the recommendations put forward by the company:  ""It is positive that the industry is being left to develop its own technical standards (led by the UKDCA) – self regulation will promote innovation much more effectively than onerous regulation. These measures will help to make the UK a global hub for digital currencies and maintain its position at the forefront of FinTech innovation.""  One of the best-funded startups in the space, Circle, which operates out of Boston and Dublin, also offers a bank-like service for bitcoin users, with an emphasis on insurance and security.  Chief Compliance Officer John Beccia praised the report for its ""proactive"" stance, which he said doesn't overburden businesses:  ""We appreciate that the report recognises the benefits of digital currency and acknowledge that the report appropriately identifies key areas of risk, such as money laundering and consumer protection concerns. We are encouraged that the UK regulators are focused on developing balanced regulations that not only mitigate these risks, but also do not place burdens on legitimate businesses.""  Adam Cleary, the founder of Bullion Bitcoin, a storage provider and gold-bitcoin exchange, also echoed this sentiment:  ""We are very pleased by the government's response. By providing regulatory clarity and legitimacy to digital currencies and related startup businesses, specifically around anti-money laundering requirements, the UK is reaffirming its position at the forefront of digital currency innovation. In particular we welcome the news that the FCA's Project Innovate will work with HM Treasury and the Prudential Regulatory Authority to explore a regulatory 'sandbox' to allow innovative start-up companies to test ideas at an early stage without excessive regulation.""  The specifics of the Treasury's plans will undergo a consultation process in the next government. Whether the UK will succeed in its ambition to create a world-leading bitcoin hub will become clearer in time. For now, the nation's bitcoin ecosystem remains positive.  What are your reactions to the Treasury report?

42398276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Tp,1426854627,ChangeTip Integrates with Game Streaming Service Twitch.tv,"Bitcoin tipping service ChangeTip has integrated with video streaming platform Twitch.tv.  The integration works by way of a ChangeTip tip bot, which Twitch.tv streamers can authorize to join their chat channels. Once activated, users can begin contributing bitcoin tips.  Twitch began accepting direct bitcoin payments for its Turbo subscription service last August, and later announced the addition of dogecoin payments in October.  Created in 2011, Twitch reaches millions of users per month and has become a source of income for a number of high-profile streamers. The platform has been buoyed by the growing popularity in competitive e-sports, as well as demand for venues to view matches of League of Legends, StarCraft II and other popular games.  As part of the launch, ChangeTip said it will give $10,000 in bitcoin to prominent Twitch users to jump start tipping among their respective followers.  Suggestions that the bitcoin tip service would integrate with Twitch emerged several weeks ago, when CEO Nick Sullivan hinted as such in response to a thread on Reddit. Users later noticed the existence of a ChangeTip Twitch bot page on GitHub prior to today’s official announcement.  Sullivan said of the integration:  “We are excited to see development work like this come from our community. Our API enables community members to craft the tools they want to see in use. This bot allows fans to connect with their favorite players in a new way.”  According to ChangeTip, the tip bot was developed for Twitch by an independent developer rather than the company itself. When contacted for comment, a representative for Twitch said the tool was compatible with the platform but it did not directly sponsor or contribute resources to its development.  The announcement represents the latest high-profile integration for San Francisco-based ChangeTip. In the past few months, the startup has integrated its service with Facebook, YouTube and other platforms. The company also recently launched its first foray into donation micropayments through a partnership with the non-profit BitGive Foundation.

The model, widely used by lenders in the mortgage and financial services industries, sets the borrower's interest rate based upon their credit score; the higher the credit score, the lower the interest rate.  A statement from the lending network, said:  ""Since BTCJam has all of the information about the borrowers, we are in a better position to determine the likelihood of the borrower paying back the loan and will adjust the interest rate accordingly.""  ""We are confident that this change will improve BTCJam and allow us to continue to maintain the highest repayment rates in peer-to-peer lending, as well as increase overall returns to investors,"" the statement concluded.  The new model means interest rates for all loans will be standardised, ensuring that investors are able to offset possible loans from defaults.
