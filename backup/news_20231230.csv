Asset manager Bitwise is the issuer currently making waves as it could potentially outrank the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, in terms of seed funds for their respective ETFs. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF Could See $200 Million Seed Fund Bitwise’s latest amendment to its S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that the asset manager has gotten interest from an investor to have its ETF seeded with $200 million upon launch. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted its significance as he stated that it “blows away” BlackRock’s initial seed fund of $10 million. Related Reading: Want To Predict Bitcoin Tops And Bottoms? ‘The Rainbow Chart’ Is For You The analyst noted that Bitwise actually seeding its ETF with such an amount could be a “huge help” in the early days of the race. It is believed that the SEC is likely to approve the pending ETF applications simultaneously. As such, Bitwise being able to create $200 million of shares could give the asset manager an advantage in terms of meeting demands by clients. Bitwise had previously shown its intention to lead the way from the get-go following the release of its Bitcoin ETF commercial. This move could help the asset manager gain much interest in its Bitcoin ETF even before launch. That way, the public sees it as the first choice upon launching. Notably, Bitwise didn’t mention who the authorized participant (AP) for its ETF would be. The AP would act as the middleman between the ETF investor and issuer, as they are responsible for creating and redeeming the ETF shares. While Bitwise failed to name its AP, other issuers like BlackRock however included it in their latest S-1 filing with the SEC.

These inclusions also give an idea of what strategy these issuers may be looking to adopt in order to lure investors to their funds. In Fidelity’s case, the asset manager will be looking to entice investors with its relatively low fees. Related Reading: Here’s The Reason The Solana Price Fell 8% To $98 Balchunas noted that Fidelity’s ‘sponsor fee’ of 0.39% happens to be the lowest so far among other issuers that have made theirs known. Interestingly, Invesco is adopting a more enticing strategy as they revealed in their latest amendment that they will be waiving fees for the first six months and the first $5 billion in assets.

According to its Q3 liquidity rankings, XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) managed to beat out Solana and Cardano in liquidity rankings, coming in behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. There were also some surprise numbers on the rankings, like BNB coming in 8th in terms of liquidity, and Litecoin also outperforming. Related Reading: LUNC Plunges 14% As SEC Scores Knockdown Blow Vs. Terraform Labs Kaiko Analysis Highlights Liquidity For Crypto Assets The vast number of crypto assets has always brought out the idea among investors to rank their valuation on a scale of some sort, with the most adopted being the market cap. However, according to Kaiko, liquidity, along with other metrics like volume and market depth is a better way to measure a token’s real value apart from its market cap. This was best demonstrated by FTX’s token FTT, whose market was bloated to reach a peak of nearly $10 billion without having enough liquidity on exchanges to back this up. According to its latest rankings, Bitcoin took up the first spot in liquidity. This wasn’t surprising, as Bitcoin has always held a tight reign over the crypto industry since its inception. Ethereum followed in second place in terms of liquidity to reiterate its position as the king of altcoins. However, Kaiko’s liquidity rankings started to digress from the market cap at the third position, with BNB underperforming massively to come in at 8th place. Instead, XRP came in at 4th place, beating out the likes of Solana and Cardano (the Ethereum killers) on exchanges among traders. XRP’s liquidity boost in the quarter was thanks to the asset receiving regulatory clarity in the US. Dogecoin came in at 5th place, despite being 10th on market cap rankings, to solidify its position as the leader among meme coins. Litecoin came in at 5th place to complete the top five, despite being 18th in market cap rankings. Total crypto market cap at $1.59 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com On the other hand, AVAX’s liquidity ranking dropped 11 places when compared to its market cap, while TON came in at 37th place despite being 9th by market cap during the quarter. Also, ATOM, UNI, APT, TON, SHIB, OKB, LEO, and CRO all fell more than five spots. What Does Liquidity Say About Dogecoin And Crypto Assets? Kaiko’s measure of liquidity included the spread and the average daily trading volume on different exchanges. The analytics platform also included two different market depth levels; 0.1% for higher frequency traders and 1% for longer-term holders. Related Reading: Can BSV Hold Its New 2023 Peak? Analysts Watch As Trading Volume Explodes In terms of trading volume, BTC came in first place while ETH and XRP followed suit. However, SOL beat DOGE in this metric with around $2 billion in the quarter. The bottom line is that greater liquidity often precedes greater success over the longer term for cryptocurrencies. Q4 2023 should tell a strong tale in terms of crypto liquidity, as most cryptocurrencies registered new yearly highs in terms of market cap.

However, the Shiba Inu community has ramped up SHIB burn activities in the past 24 hours, pushing the burn rate up by more than 2,700%. What this means is that SHIB holders have been sending large amounts of the meme coin to unrecoverable wallets, reducing the total supply amidst efforts to push the price up. Related Reading: LUNC Plunges 14% As SEC Scores Knockdown Blow Vs. Terraform Labs Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets In 24 Hours Amid SHIB Decline SHIB tokens are normally burned sporadically, and any investor can burn tokens by sending them to any of the three SHIB burn addresses. Members of the Shiba Inu team have increased sensitization efforts in recent months to increase the burn rate of community members. According to information obtained from the official SHIB burn tracker, Shibbburn, the Shiba Inu burn wallets have witnessed an influx of burn transactions in the past day. These burns came in from four major transactions, with the highest being 13,140,241 SHIB tokens burned in one go from address “0xa034”. As a result, the SHIB burn rate spiked by a whopping 2,752% with more than 14.8 million SHIB incinerated in total. This is in stark contrast with the previous day’s figures which came out at around 2.5 million SHIB tokens sent to the burn addresses. The Shiba Inu team has been particularly active with SHIB burns, burning a total of 33.8 billion tokens in four transactions this month. In all these, the SHIB community has removed 410.69 trillion tokens from the initial SHIB token supply. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu’s circulating supply stands at 581 million tokens. SHIB market cap currently at $6.146 billion. Chart: TradingView.com SHIB Trades In Tight Range SHIB, on the other hand, has been trading inside a narrow price range for approximately a week now, with the upper resistance of $0.000011 and the support of $0.00001067 serving as the two main points of contention. There has been a relative lack of reaction to token burns this week, as the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.00001054, which is a decrease of 1.5% over the past seven days. According to data from IntoTheBlock, 37.26% of addresses are in profit at the current price, compared to 42% profitability last week. Related Reading: Can BSV Hold Its New 2023 Peak?

McDermott shared these positive predictions in a recent interview with Fox Business, expressing much optimism in the future of digital assets. Related Reading: Eyes On $50,000: Bitcoin Poised For Major Rally Amid Spot ETF Optimism – Analyst Goldman Exec Expects Spot ETFs To ‘Gradually’ Boost Institutional Demand For Crypto Assets Speaking to Fox Business, McDermott has backed the continuous growth of cryptocurrencies as he foresees a rise in the institutional adoption of these assets. Notably, the Goldman executive shares popular sentiment with many crypto enthusiasts that the approval of a Bitcoin or Ethereum spot ETF will open up the digital asset ecosystem to more institutional investors who are weary of the market volatility attached to direct crypto investments. McDermott said: One, it broadens and deepens the liquidity in the market. And why does it do that? It does that because you’re actually creating institutional products that can be traded by institutions that don’t need to touch the bare assets. And I think that, to me, that opens up the universe of the pensions, insurers, etc. However, McDermott has cautioned crypto enthusiasts against expecting a sudden impact of crypto spot ETFs. He believes the anticipated increased demand and price rise will be a gradual process that will occur over the course of 2024. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to grant approval orders to several Bitcoin spot ETF applications in the coming weeks following discussions between the regulator and multiple asset managers. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has set a potential decision window of January 8 – January 10, stating there is a 90% chance the SEC finally delivers a verdict on these various applications putting an end to the 6-months chronicle. Related Reading: Matrixport Predicts Bitcoin 2024 Surge, Regardless Of Spot ETF Approval – Here’s Why Asset Tokenization In 2024 In addition to potential crypto spot ETFs, McDermott also mentioned a potential increase in commercial blockchain application as another contributing factor to his projected rise in institutional demand for digital assets. Particularly, he spoke about an improvement in existing tokenization systems, which can lead to the creation of secondary liquidity on blockchains. He said: When I think about tokenization, which is obviously a topic that’s kind of talked about quite extensively, I think for me next year what we’ll start to see is the development of marketplaces. So where we start to see scale adoption, particularly across the buy side in the context of investors. And that’s because we’ll start to see the emergence of secondary liquidity on chain, and that’s a key enabler. So for me, that’s one of the key developments for next year.” At the time of writing, the entire crypto ecosystem is valued at $1.602 trillion, with a 15.09% gain in the last month.

The last seven days have not been much different for the cryptocurrency, which currently trades below $42,000. However, a popular crypto analyst on the X platform has come forward with an interesting trajectory for the price of BTC in the coming weeks. Based on his projection, investors could see the market leader trade above the psychological $50,000 level – but there is a caveat. BTC Price To $50,000 – But What Happens After? In a recent post on X, prominent crypto trader Ali Martinez put forward a price prediction, stating that Bitcoin’s value could climb as high as $50,000 in the near future. The analyst came up with this projection after identifying and studying a historical pattern on the coin’s price chart on a higher timeframe. Related Reading: ARK Invest Pivots To Bitcoin As Cathie Wood Expects BTC Price To Explode Martinez’s prediction is based on BTC’s price action between 2016 and 2019 on the weekly chart. According to the crypto analyst’s post, the premier cryptocurrency witnessed a major price correction – after reaching a market bottom – when it touched the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level. A weekly chart showing Bitcoin's price movement between 2016 -2023 | Source: Ali_charts/X Martinez believes that current price action mirrors the Bitcoin pattern observed in the last years of the previous decade. Historical price patterns can be helpful in technical analysis and in predicting the future trajectory of a cryptocurrency. If this history – on the Bitcoin price chart – does repeat itself, investors could see the value of BTC surge toward $50,000. However, Ali Martinez noted that the flagship cryptocurrency could come tumbling down afterward by a significant 40%. From the current price point, Bitcoin’s journey to $50,000 would mean an almost 20% upward swing. Meanwhile, a 40% decline right after this surge could see the premier cryptocurrency return to around $30,000. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the value of Bitcoin stands at $41,831, representing a 1.5% price decline in the past 24 hours. This recent dip only further reflects the bearish pressure the market leader has had to face in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is down by nearly 4% in the last seven days. However, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly successful December, having increased by about 10% in the last month of 2023.

21894160,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567400,1703915074,LUNC Plunges 14% As SEC Scores Knockdown Blow Vs. Terraform Labs,"LUNC, the resilient token emerging from the tumultuous aftermath of Terra’s downfall, witnessed a notable 14% downturn, mirroring a substantial legal setback delivered by a U.S. District Court. This judicial decision favored the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in their legal pursuit against Terraform Labs, the entity steering the Terra blockchain, injecting uncertainty into the fate of the beleaguered cryptocurrency. Harking back to the SEC’s assertions in February, the once-mighty stablecoin, LUNA, now lies at the heart of the controversy that unfolded in May 2022. The SEC contends that LUNA transcended the classification of a digital dollar, deeming it a security. Related Reading: Can BSV Hold Its New 2023 Peak? Analysts Watch As Trading Volume Explodes Additional Pain For LUNC Crucially, Terraform Labs allegedly neglected to register it as such. The gravity of the situation intensifies as Do Kwon, co-founder of Terraform Labs, faces accusations of orchestrating the sale of these unregistered securities, placing additional strain on the future trajectory of LUNC. Judge Jed Rakoff’s definitive ruling echoes a harsh reality – both LUNA and MIR, another token within the Terra ecosystem, are recognized as securities. This legal stance paves the way for potential further action by the SEC against Terraform Labs, casting a shadow over LUNC’s future. Source: Santiment The abrupt shift in market sentiment is evident as LUNC’s Weighted Sentiment, a metric gauging market optimism, plummeted to -0.510 post-ruling. This stark transformation from bullish to bearish suggests a loss of investor confidence in the short-term prospects of the token. Social Dominance, reflecting the attention given to LUNC, experienced a surge on December 29th, correlating with the court ruling. However, this heightened interest quickly dissipated, indicating that the initial impact was ephemeral, and traders may have swiftly incorporated the negative developments into their decision-making. LUNCUSD currently trading at $0.000142 territory. Chart: TradingView.com LUNC Price Analysis: Overall Downtrend With Potential For Reversal The chart (below) confirms a downward trend over the past seven days, mirroring the bearish sentiment post-court ruling. However, technical indicators suggest a potential for reversal: RSI: Dipping towards the oversold zone, implying a possible price rebound. Negative Divergence: Hints at an upcoming uptrend, though the legal uncertainty adds complexity. EMAs: The recent 20 EMA crossover above the 50 EMA offers a bullish signal, albeit weak. LUNC seven-day price chart. Source: Coingecko Impact Of Court Ruling: The sharp drop on December 29th coincides with the ruling, highlighting its significant impact. Continued bearish momentum suggests ongoing concerns about the legal and regulatory landscape. Support And Resistance Levels: Support: The $0.00013 area has acted as a barrier, holding price from further decline. Maintaining this level is crucial for bullish momentum. Resistance: Breaking above the $0.00015 level could signal a stronger uptrend, but overcoming psychological resistance may be challenging. Volume And Historical Trends: Low volume indicates investor indecision, possibly due to the legal uncertainty. Comparing to historical trends: Previous support and resistance levels offer limited guidance due to the recent crash. Past volatility patterns might not be reliable given the unique legal context. Overall: The technical indicators present a potential for LUNC reversal, but the court ruling casts a shadow of uncertainty. Closely monitor key support and resistance levels, watch for changes in volume, and remain cautious due to the volatile market conditions.

In the letter, prosecutors suggested a second trial would ""delay"" a ""timely and just resolution of the case.""

The letter puts an end to speculation that Bankman-Fried could be tried on additional criminal charges. Earlier this year, law enforcement in the Bahamas, where Bankman-Fried's companies were based, and the U.S. tussled over which country's prosecutors had the right to try the erstwhile FTX CEO.  In November, a jury found Bankman-Fried guilty of seven counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, among other charges. His crimes, which came to light in 2022, resulted in the loss of billions of dollars worth of FTX and Alameda Research investors' funds, deepening a crypto market downturn that had begun earlier that year.

The departure of Aaron Schnarch, former CEO of Coinbase Custody, has been confirmed by a spokesperson, who also revealed that Schnarch was replaced by Rick Schonberg in August. Per the report, the transition aligns with Coinbase’s efforts to offer services to applicants of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Coinbase Affirms Readiness For Bitcoin ETF Approval Rick Schonberg, who joined Coinbase in 2021, aims to provide experience to his new role, having previously worked at reputable financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, State Street, and Tagomi, according to Bloomberg. Related Reading: Want To Predict Bitcoin Tops And Bottoms? ‘The Rainbow Chart’ Is For You Coinbase on the other hand, has emerged as the preferred choice for custodial services among Bitcoin ETF applicants, including industry giants like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale Investments. Custody services play a crucial role for potential managers of spot Bitcoin ETFs, as investors rely on these providers to securely safeguard their digital tokens. Notably, a Coinbase spokesperson emphasized the company’s preparedness for ETF approval, stating to Bloomberg: We have extensively prepared for ETF approval. Our systems have been designed and tested to handle added trading volume, increased liquidity, and general increases in demand on our systems. Coinbase Custody, operating as a trust company, falls under the regulatory oversight of the New York Department of Financial Services and undergoes auditing by Deloitte & Touche. Countdown To Historic Decision The race to obtain regulatory approval for the first ETF directly investing in the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is entering a critical phase. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) faces a deadline of January 10 to decide whether to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF application submitted by ARK Investment Management, led by Cathie Wood, and 21Shares, along with potentially other similar filings. Overall, the departure of Aaron Schnarch and the subsequent appointment of Rick Schonberg within Coinbase Custody highlight the company’s strategy to the growing demand for custodial services from Bitcoin ETF applicants. With the potential approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on the horizon, the industry eagerly awaits the SEC’s decision, which will have far-reaching implications for the adoption and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: ARK Invest Pivots To Bitcoin As Cathie Wood Expects BTC Price To Explode Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, is currently trading at $42,100, representing a 1.1% decline over the past 24 hours.
