42430387,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPLh,1555450222,"Kraken Exchange Joins Binance, ShapeShift in Delisting Bitcoin SV","Another major crypto exchange is delisting bitcoin SV (BSV) amid an ongoing feud between that cryptocurrency's creator Craig Wright and outspoken members of the bitcoin community.  San Francisco-based Kraken announced Tuesday that it will no longer support BSV, citing both community sentiment and ongoing litigation filed against the exchange by the coin's advocates.  Kraken will disable BSV deposits on April 22, trading will cease on all trading pairs April 29 and, finally, withdrawals will stop May 31.  The move follows announcements Monday by two other prominent exchanges, Binance and ShapeShift, that they were delisting BSV in response to Wright's behavior. Binance's CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), tweeted that Wright is ""poisoning"" the bitcoin community with his threats to sue people who called him a fraud because he has claimed to be bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  But Kraken was already negatively disposed toward BSV long before the kerfuffle started.  In December, during the contentious hard fork of bitcoin cash when it got split into bitcoin cash ABC and bitcoin cash ""Satoshi Vision,"" Florida-based mining firm United Investment Corp. filed a federal lawsuit against a group of defendants for supporting the ABC version, including Kraken and its CEO Jesse Powell. Kraken enabled BSV trading in November.  ""They are suing us, our investors, well-respected and prominent figures in the community, and the community got to the point it’s fed up with it,"" Powell told CoinDesk. ""It’s completely antithetical to what this community is about.""  Community sentiment  On Monday, Kraken launched a poll on its Twitter account, asking people to vote for or against delisting BSV. At the moment of writing, the poll shows that around 70,545 users voted, 71 percent supporting delisting, seven percent opposing and 21 percent not caring.  ""We at Kraken have our own strong opinions, and it’s like a bubble, so putting out a poll was the opportunity to get other people's opinions,"" Powell explained.  If the vast majority of the votes had been in favor of keeping BSV at Kraken, it wouldn't have been delisted, but if the results were indecisive, say 50/50, the coin would still have been delisted, Powell said.  In the past Kraken has delisted other tokens, including Namecoin and Iconomi — the former because of its low volume and the need to support a technically onerous upgrade at some point, the latter because the protocol was changed by its creators.  The feud  The delisting wave started after Wright threatened to sue a pseudonymous Twitter user nicknamed Hodlonaut, known for starting the bitcoin Lightning Torch, and crypto investor and podcaster Peter McCormack, unless they publicly recognized Wright as bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Nakamoto.  ""It looks they keep to use the law system to abuse it, suing anyone who says anything against them,"" Powell said about BSV advocates.  Aside from ShapeShift and Binance, the crypto apps Blockchain, SatoWallet, Phantasma Chain and Bittylicious announced Monday they, too, would stop supporting BSV.  Powell said more exchanges may follow suit.  ""The more players delist them, the easier it becomes to do it,"" he said.  BSV camp responds  Reached late Tuesday, Ed Pownall, a public relations specialist who represents Calvin Ayre, owner and founder of CoinGeek.com and one of Bitcoin SV’s biggest supporters, referred CoinDesk to a newsletter article by Toronto-based investment firm Frnt.io.  ""We believe that crypto and certain actors specifically are setting a dangerous precedent in the delisting of BSV,"" the article said, explaining:  ""Given the impact that trading venues can have on the visibility and price of a coin, such a subjective delisting sets a precedent which has the potential to increase the space's vulnerability to manipulation. If a coin can be delisted due to some[one] not approving of a community/person's legal activities, what's to say that a similar narrative cannot be created in the future simply to support a malicious actor's monetary interest.""  Later, Pownall sent a statement from Ayre, who called the delistings ""a case of people in trusted positions abusing that trust and playing God with which token gets the most volume and market access. In essence, market manipulation.""  Ayre added that the exchanges seemed to be making decisions simply because ""they don’t like one scientist that works on the platform. Craig doesn’t own BSV, not does anybody, so this appears to be very unprofessional. An exchange should just want volume of trading, not picking which horses it wants to win the race.""

42410990,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghlmhn,1555443936,Craig Wright's Fight With a Cartoon Bitcoin Astronaut Cat Explained,"There's a legal conflict brewing between outspoken members of the bitcoin community and the controversial computer scientist who claims to be the cryptocurrency's creator.  It's a complex story to untangle, but it boils down to Australian computer scientist Craig S. Wright – who has claimed to be bitcoin's pseudonymous creator since 2016 – sending out legal letters to those community members that have called him a ""fraud.""  While several news reports, as early as late 2015, identified Wright as Satoshi, and the lead maintainer of bitcoin at the time Gavin Andresen even lent his credence to the unmasking, security experts rebuked the claim, leaving many in the cryptocurrency community unconvinced. Yet, Wright has continued stating that he is Satoshi and those that believe that to be a false claim have continued to call Wright a liar.  The latest mudslinging came after ""Hodlonaut,"" the pseudonymous bitcoin user that created the lightning torch experiment, which promoted bitcoin's layer-two scaling tech for payments, used his newfound influence to castigate Wright earlier this month.  Sometime after the public tweets, Wright sent a letter to Hodlonaut arguing that those calling him a ""fraud"" are libelous and damaging his reputation – warranting legal action.  Yet, the legal threat against Hodlonaut hasn't worked the way Wright probably wanted – with users worried about expensive and timely court cases and so hesitant to post negatively about him.  Instead, though, the threat triggered a wave of community support for Hodlonaut, with many others jumping in to call Wright a fraud.  Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack also pointed fingers at Wright and received a legal letter, asking him to apologize publicly and delete any incendiary tweets or face legal repercussions. On Sunday, McCormack published a three-page, tongue-in-cheek response saying that he would not apologize, would fight Wright in court and again arguing that Wright ""is definitely not the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.""  To lend support to his argument, McCormack argued anyone can claim to be Satoshi.  ""'Hey, I Peter McCormack am Satoshi Nakamoto. I created Bitcoin,' See, I just did it,"" McCormack wrote.  A legal letter was also sent to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, according to a tweet by the firm's CSO, Samson Mow.  What's more, exchanges in the ecosystem seem to be lining up in support of Hodlonaut as well. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also called Wright a ""fraud,"" and soon after, announced the exchange would delist bitcoin SV (Satoshi's vision), the cryptocurrency that Wright supports and which broke off from bitcoin cash late last year after yet another feud involving Wright.  Exchange service provider Shapeshift is planning to do the same, and Kraken launched a Twitter poll Monday seeking input on a possible delisting.  So who is Craig Wright?  Wright first came to fame in December 2015, when publications Gizmodo and Wired published investigative articles detailing how he might be the force behind bitcoin's creation (in the case of Gizmodo, the late Dave Kleiman was identified as a possible collaborator). Those articles were, at the time, the latest effort by the media to identify Satoshi Nakamoto, who disappeared from the scene in late 2010.  Months later, a series of new articles – published by the BBC, GQ and the Economist – profiled Wright and his efforts to prove that he was, in fact, the creator of bitcoin. Wright also published a blog post that notably featured a digital signature tied to the ninth bitcoin block.  Yet this effort was rebuffed by a wave of security and cryptography experts, and Wright was labeled a fraud by many in the bitcoin community.  More recently, Wright became involved in the development of bitcoin cash, which was forked away from the main bitcoin blockchain in 2017. Yet subsequent arguments over changes to bitcoin cash's code led to plans for bitcoin SV (or Satoshi's Vision), setting the stage for last fall's fork.  Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin called him a fraud publicly at a conference last year.  More recently, Wright has issued legal threats to developers of bitcoin cash.  Why is Wright issuing legal letters?  Wright and businessman Calvin Ayre, who has been working with Wright on bitcoin SV, have sent legal letters to a handful of people, including ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and cryptocurrency blog Chepicap, for alleged defamation.  Thus far, McCormack is the only recipient to reveal the contents of his letter to the public. The letter was issued in response to a series of tweets from McCormack that criticized Wright, including one calling him a ""fraud"" and another calling him a ""sociopath.""  The letter  from the law firm SCA Ontier to McCormack states: ""You have … carried out a target campaign on Twitter to harass and libel our client by posting highly defamatory and abusive tweets, knowing they would be read not just by your 52,000 followers, but also by our client.""  It continues:  ""The above publications have caused serious harm to our client's reputation in this jurisdiction and continue [sic] to do so.""  The letter goes on to ask McCormack to delete the tweets deemed defamatory and to issue an apology to Wright.  Okay, but why are people changing their Twitter photos to astronaut cats?  Much of the public outcry against the brewing legal spat has taken place on Twitter, with the contours of the fight being sketched out by supporters of people like Hodlonaut and McCormack and those who are defending Wright and bitcoin SV generally.  A key sign of the battle-lines: a wave of bitcoin enthusiasts have changed their Twitter profile photos to Hodlonaut's picture, which features a grey cat in an astronaut suit.  Going further, some supporters have set up and crowdsourced a legal fund for him, dubbed We Are All Hodlonaut, which raised $20,000 in under 24 hours. As of the time of writing, the fund has amassed in excess of that original goal $28,000 from more than 1,000 supporters, and according to Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, most of the contributions came from lightning payments.  What's more, Preston Byrne, an influential lawyer in the cryptocurrency space, tweeted that he is ""assisting Hodlonaut pro bono.""  Have the legal letters stymied criticism of Wright?  Essentially, no. Despite the legal letters, influential people in the community continue to tweet negatively about him and the Nakamoto claim.  For instance, developer Jonathan Toomin tweeted in parody:  ""I am God. If anyone publicly refutes this assertion, I will sue you for defamation. You will then need to prove in court that I am not God, which you will be unable to do.""  Chaincode bitcoin developer Matt Corallo stepped in on Twitter to say: ""Dunno how British libel suits work,"" but if it helps, he offered to fly to the UK to provide ""expert witness"" and to state ""unequivocally, under oath, that Craig is a fraud.""  At the same time, others in the space want all the drama to die down, arguing that Wright should be ignored.  As Bitcoin Core maintainer Jonas Schnelli tweeted:  ""He seeks attention with insane methods. Ignore. Ignore. Ignore his lawsuit. Don't make him feel important. He is a psychopath.""

42430389,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPNh,1555434613,"Auditor EY Unveils Nightfall, An Ambitious Bid to Bring Business to Ethereum","Big Four professional services firm EY is rolling out free software designed to help corporate clients use the ethereum blockchain – and it’s taken an unusual step to encourage adoption.  Announced Tuesday, EY's protocol, internally code-named Nightfall, has been developed over the last year by the consulting firm's team of over 200 blockchain developers and will be published in May. The protocol was created for such use cases as supply chains, food tracing, transactions between branches of a company and public finance.  Like other enterprise blockchain platforms  , Nightfall takes advantage of a technology called zero-knowledge proofs to allow private transactions on a shared ledger. But unlike most such endeavors, EY's software is intended to run on top of the public ethereum network, not a private variant.  Further setting the project apart is the unusual approach EY is taking to intellectual property. The firm said it will not merely open-source the code – that is, release it with a permissive copyright license – but put it in the public domain, with no license at all.  “We want to maximize adoption and community involvement, we want people to adopt it, and adapt it, and improve it. If we retain ownership, people may not invest that much time and energy in something they might not control,"" EY's global innovation leader for blockchain, Paul Brody, explained at a press briefing. ""The cleanest way to make everybody use it is just to give it away with no strings attached.”  Nevertheless, Brody suggested this was a difficult decision, telling reporters:  ""A year of coding work. This is a million dollars worth of stuff we’re giving away.""  A fine distinction  Stepping back, “open source” and “public domain” are not synonymous.  “The terms are often used interchangeably. Legally, however, they mean different things,” said Preston Byrne, a partner at the law firm of Byrne & Storm.  Open-source, while it allows software to be used without paying royalties, means the author retains copyright and can, in theory, revoke or change the license, although “I haven’t seen this happen in crypto even once, given that the ability to inspect the code and play around with it is a key selling proposition for protocol adoption,” Byrne said.  Public domain, on the other hand, involves a waiver of copyright. This is rarer in software, Byrne said, since “it doesn’t provide a clear licensing framework for later contributions to the codebase,” creating the potential for disputes if, say, copyrighted code is added to a copyright-waived codebase.  But if a company ""simply wants to give away its work, without more, there isn't a ton of risk in releasing to the public domain,"" he said.  SAP, Microsoft, Carrefour  According to Brody, EY's solutions for Nightfall will run in the Microsoft Azure cloud environment and are integrated with enterprise software from SAP, to give clients ""a comfort that this is not new and scary. This is a mature technology backed by the world's leading technology companies.""  One of the solutions already in testing is a system for tracking software license transactions for Microsoft’s XBox video games platform, EY said. Using the solution, Microsoft can monitor its interactions with multiple game vendors and avoid litigation related to royalty payments.  Other important partners include European grocery chain Carrefour, which is using EY's blockchain solution to trace oranges, eggs, and chickens (it’s also a participant in IBM’s Food Trust blockchain); pharmaceutical producer Merck; Italian winery Placido Volpone; and an ""Italian buffalo mozzarella maker"" and ""a big Japanese car maker,"" Brody said.  ""People are very undisciplined in the supply chain industry,"" he said, explaining blockchain's appeal in this area. ""The beauty of non-double spending on the blockchain is that if a vaccine from a distribution center goes to a farm, it has to come out of a distribution center.""  Tokenize this  One of the most important principles EY is advocating with Nightfall is that an enterprise blockchain should deal not with hashes of digitized PDF documents, but with tokens bound to physical goods.  In pursuing this, EY took advantage of the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on ethereum, the most famous example of which is the collectibles known as CryptoKitties. (EY's advisers included William Entriken, the main author of the standard, and the cryptography scholar Mary Maller, one of the leading researchers of zero-knowledge proofs.)  ""We have made a big investment in the token technology,"" Brody said. ""We built a special kind of token, which is ERC 721-compatible, to separate a physical asset from the legal ownership of that asset."" For example, while a car is on a ship on its way to a buyer, the shipping company doesn't own that car.  Further down that road, Brody said, it will be possible to distinguish and tokenize different components of traded goods. ""We can envision a future where a power company owns a battery in your car and you can use it whenever you plug it in.”  Into the great wide open  For more than a year, Brody has been evangelizing the benefits of public blockchains for enterprises, which made EY stand out among an enterprise crowd more favorably disposed to private or permissioned ledgers.  ""Imagine every car maker and any shipment company runs their own private blockchain. A bunch of silos doesn't scale too well,” Brody said. “While private blockchains are useful, they don't solve the problem of a massive, scalable transformation.""  Just as enterprises grew comfortable using public cloud storage, they will also come to embrace public blockchains, Brody believes. And the blockchain they choose, in EY's vision, will most likely be ethereum.  The reason is the vast majority of the money raised in the space has been for companies that built on ethereum, and the vast majority of blockchain developers code on Solidity, the smart contract language written for ethereum.  “That's a kind of developer momentum that makes me believe that, imperfect or not, unless they really screw up, ethereum is the choice,"" Brody said.

42430401,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPph,1555432215,ConsenSys Pitch Deck Forecasts $100 Million Burn Rate for 2019,"ConsenSys believes it can become a valuable company, provided it can get through the next year.  As The Information first reported Monday, the company is seeking approximately $200 million in new investment. However, ConsenSys also projects $152 million in expenses in 2019, with $52 million in revenue, for an estimated $100 million cash burn, according to an investor deck obtained by CoinDesk.  The company is pitching itself to investors as a combination of three significant assets: equity in roughly 134 projects or companies, token holdings from major initial coin offerings and internal operations with significant long-term revenue potential.  With additional funding, ConsenSys expects to do the following through 2020: launch at least 10 blockchain networks, grow revenue to $100 million per year, tokenize 30 percent of activities in its so-called ""mesh"" of projects and help the ethereum community deliver its 2.0 upgrade.  ConsenSys 2.0.1  As CoinDesk reported last year, the company went through a major restructuring in order to focus more on businesses with revenue potential. This year's slide deck gives some clarity about what the company is currently emphasizing.  ""ConsenSys is building the products, platforms and companies to enable the tokenization of the $80 trillion global economy,"" the slide deck reports in its first pages.  The deck describes the ConsenSys product strategy as comprising four ""interconnected layers:"" open platforms, the future of work, decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0.  It highlights several companies at each layer, including Grid+ and Gnosis, as open platforms; OpenLaw and Gitcoin, as the future of work; Trustology and ConsenSys Digital Securities, as decentralized finance (DeFi); and Kaleido and uPort, as Web 3.0.  Beyond those, the document says ConsenSys Labs has incubated 82 projects, its accelerator has worked with 27 and the company has directly invested in 35 companies between ConsenSys Ventures and ConsenSys AG.  Of all the projects, the deck places the most emphasis on four: PegaSys, Truffle, Infura and MetaMask.  It describes PegaSys as infrastructure for enterprise ethereum and ethereum 2.0, with a team size of 60 people. Infura is infrastructure-as-a-service for ethereum, with a team size of 18. Truffle is described as the ethereum development environment, with a team size of 20. Finally, MetaMask is a simple browser extension for using ethereum, with a team size of 17.  Meanwhile, the company holds large stakes (both in the form of equity and tokens) in companies that came up during the ICO boom. It represents its stakes in Gnosis, Grid+ and AirSwap as the most valuable while promising future token launches.  While acknowledging the tokens for these projects have lost a great deal of value, the document argues:  ""We have conviction that our projects are focused on cryptoeconomic networks that will be essential and dominant in Web3 and have long term value.""  Revenue pipeline  The deck saves its strongest argument for last, perhaps suspecting that only real revenue will convince investors at this stage.  ""After building the market and commercial engagement appetite, we refocused our business development efforts to build a broad enterprise and government pipeline across key verticals,"" the deck contends.  The company earned $6.5 million in 2017, $21 million in 2018 and projects $52.3 million for 2019. Most of that revenue has come through services, primarily ascribed to the Solutions division.  Meanwhile, ConsenSys argues its deal pipeline (that is, contracts under discussion) has been growing rapidly, with $125 million in potential deals as of mid-March, and $10 million secured that month.  ""We are shifting from smaller (~$200,000) advisory and proof-of-concept work to large (~$10 million ) product and platform development engagements,"" the deck reports.

42430385,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPHh,1555426211,Startup Arca Seeks SEC Approval for US Treasury Bond-Backed Stablecoin,"Arca is seeking regulatory approval to sell a new type of stablecoin to retail investors.  The Los Angeles-based digital asset manager filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Friday for a bond fund whose shares would be tokenized on the ethereum blockchain. Arca hopes the SEC will approve the product later this year, a spokesperson said.  The Arca U.S. Treasury Fund would be available to the general public, but not traded on any stock exchange or alternative trading system, according to the filing.  However, shares in the fund (referred to as ""Arca UST Coins"") would be represented as ERC-20 tokens, which run on top of ethereum. And Arca is framing the product as a form of stablecoin, or cryptocurrency designed to maintain parity with a traditional asset like the U.S. dollar, although the company cautioned that it may be slightly less stable than other such products on the market.  The minimum investment in the fund would be $1,000, with a target net asset value (NAV) of $1 per share. At least 80 percent of the fund would be invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with the rest in debt issued by various public or private entities inside and outside the U.S.  ""It is therefore anticipated that the underlying portfolio, and the NAV of Arca UST Coins, will have relatively little volatility,"" the document says. ""Accordingly, although holders of Arca UST Coins could experience greater NAV volatility compared to typical stablecoins, such volatility will be relatively limited.""  Investors would receive quarterly dividends from the interest payments, according to the prospectus, although the fund's ""investment objective is to seek maximum total return consistent with preservation of capital."" In other words, stable value rather than big profits.  To buy shares from the fund or from another investor, traders ""must first establish a wallet address through the Arca application and ensure that it is whitelisted with the Transfer Agent,"" according to the prospectus. ""Once an investor’s wallet address is whitelisted, the investor can use the Arca application to transfer money from a linked bank account to the Fund in return for shares of the Fund.""  It is not clear how many of these purportedly dollar-pegged tokens Arca aims to sell; the prospectus says the offering would need to raise $25 million for the fund to have viable operations.

The service provides the product's production date and quality control parameters, as well as storage times and the locations of warehouses. Consumers can even find information on the farmers who supply the potatoes for the product and how the puree is made.  The news marks the first time Nestle has used a blockchain platform to share data with customers, according to the announcement.

42430395,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPbh,1555419622,Digital Asset's Smart Contract Language Now Works on Hyperledger Blockchains,"Enterprise blockchain firm Digital Asset is integrating its smart contract modeling language into the Hyperledger Sawtooth framework.  Announced Tuesday, this is the first melding of code between a project under the umbrella of the 200-member Hyperledger consortium and DA’s Digital Asset Modelling Language (DAML), opening up the latter to a wider range of industries and prospective enterprise customers.  The news also marks the third DA partnership since DAML became open source earlier this month. Last week, DA announced the language would be integrated into the blockchain platform of Dell Computer-controlled software giant VMware, as well as highlighting work being done with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) to bring DA software within the ambit of ISDA’s Common Domain Model (CDM).  Dan O’Prey, CMO at Digital Asset, who is also chair of the Hyperledger marketing committee, said there are several reasons DA chose Sawtooth (contributed to Hyperledger by Intel) as the first point of integration for DAML.  O'Prey told CoinDesk:  “Sawtooth has been getting a lot of traction in markets outside of what has initially been our core focus: financial services and particularly market infrastructures. So this is a great way for us to expand the reach of DAML into other industries.”  Indeed, Sawtooth is the locus of interesting projects such as Grid, announced last year, a supply chain-focused effort being driven by food giant Cargill. More broadly, Sawtooth is the second-largest blockchain within Hyperledger in terms of developer firepower and enterprise backing, after Fabric, developed by IBM.  Another key reason is that DA has been working closely with Blockchain Technology Partners (BTP), which offers developers an easy-to-deploy and cloud-ready instance of Sawtooth via its blockchain management platform, Sextant.  In July of this year, BTP will offer an enhanced version of Sextant with DAML support on Amazon Web Services (AWS), with other cloud providers soon thereafter, noted O’Prey.  'Far and wide'  While Sawtooth is first for DAML, O’Prey said his firm is “having conversations with various others within the Hyperledger framework and other platform providers.”  An obvious next step would be tying up with Hyperledger Fabric and its main platform partner, IBM.  “Our goal is to get DAML as far and as wide as possible and obviously Hyperledger Fabric has a very large user base and community of developers around it. So certainly this is high up on the list of where we would like to see support for DAML,” said O’Prey.  Dan Middleton, chairman of Hyperledger's technical steering committee (TSC) and a Sawtooth maintainer, said the DAML integration shows the importance of “modular architectures that allow for multiple projects to work together,” a key vision for Hyperledger and a design tenet of Sawtooth.  Anticipating more in the way of integration partnerships in the coming weeks, DA has added a special “DAML Integration Kit” into its open source software development kit (SDK) to make it as smooth as possible to bring DAML’s smart contract “rule engine” into other platforms.  As such, smart contracts can be developed using traditional programming languages such as C++ or JavaScript; DAML is only for the smart contracts themselves, not the whole application that runs on the ledger, explained, O’Prey, adding:  “Our goal is to make it as self-service and easy as possible so that anyone can integrate DAML into whatever DLT platform, blockchain platform, database, cloud service or even public chain in the future.”  One of the most prominent players in the enterprise blockchain niche, DA is in the process of replacing the Australian Securities Exchange's decades-old Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) – a multi-year assignment it won under former CEO Blythe Masters.

The new platform is being managed by eToroX, which is regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, the firm announced Tuesday.  Trading in six cryptocurrencies will be offered at launch: bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), XRP, litecoin (LTC) and dash. Also available will be 37 crypto-to-fiat pairs, for example BTC/USD and XRP/GBP.  The firm is additionally issuing eToro-branded tokens pegged to eight fiat currencies, including the eToro United States dollar (USDEX), eToro Japanese yen (JPYX) and eToro Euro (EURX), with others available for pounds Sterling; Australian, Canadian and New Zealand dollars; and the Swiss franc.  The exchange will add more cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and tokens “in the coming weeks,” eToroX managing director Doron Rosenblum said, adding that the firm will also work with other cryptocurrency exchanges to “encourage” them to list its stablecoins.  eToro CEO and co-founder, Yoni Assia, said:  “Just as eToro has opened up traditional markets for investors, we want to do the same in the tokenized world. [...] Blockchain will eventually 'eat' traditional financial services through tokenization.""

42430391,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPVh,1555413659,KuCoin Exchange Traders Can Now Self-Custody Their Crypto Assets,"Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has launched a feature allowing users to custody their own crypto assets while trading.  For the feature, KuCoin has integrated a new technology from Boston-based startup Arwen, which allows traders to maintain control of their private keys while trading on centralized exchanges, Arwen announced Tuesday.  KuCoin president Eric Don confirmed the news, telling CoinDesk:  “This service will enable investors to trade in a centralized platform without worrying about their fund safety.""  Arwen said that, with its technology, trades are executed via a ""layer two"" blockchain protocol that allows traders to benefit from “the full liquidity and speed of the centralized exchange’s orderbook.”  The startup went on to explain that it enables secure trading between parties without the need for trust by relying on the traded cryptocurrency’s native blockchain.  For example, security for trading bitcoin is provided by the bitcoin blockchain, while security for trading bitcoin cash is provided by the bitcoin cash blockchain, it said. “This is in contrast to other approaches ... which require the introduction of a completely new blockchain that traders must trust,"" said Arwen.  As KuCoin's implementation of the tech is launched in beta mode, the service is initially limited. Escrow sizes are limited to about $100 and trade sizes are limited to about $25 as a standard security measure, the company said.  Traders will need a know-your-customer (KYC)-verified KuCoin account to get started with the service, and they should neither be located in the U.S. nor in countries sanctioned by the U.S., Goldberg added.  Don said:  “Arwen and [KuCoin] paid special attention to KYC/AML in this collaboration and we care more about compliance than most existing [decentralized exchanges].”  KuCoin is also planning to build its own decentralized exchange, KuCoin CEO Michael Gan revealed to CoinDesk, saying “the cooperation with Arwen is our first step, realizing fund custody in a decentralized way and ensure the security of users’ digital assets.”  Arwen launched a testnet version of its protocol earlier this year, saying a plan was in place to integrate with KuCoin. The firm said today that it is in talks with other exchanges, as well as hardware wallets and institutional custodians, for similar collaborations.  Singapore-based KuCoin is backed by IDG Capital, Matrix Partners and Neo Global Capital, having raised $20 million in Series A funding last November.

42420842,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWZIGD,1555412434,This Price Hurdle May Pave Way for Bitcoin’s Next Leg Up,"View  Bitcoin’s rally from April 2 lows below $4,200 has stalled near the three-day chart's 100-candle moving average (MA), currently at $5,238.  A three-day close (UTC) above that MA level could invite buying pressure, leading to a sustained move higher toward $5,500 and more.  That bullish close, however, looks unlikely in the short-term, as the cryptocurrency has created a bearish candle on the daily chart, validating signs of bull exhaustion (doji candle) on the weekly chart.  A UTC close below $4,948 today would add credence to yesterday’s bearish candle, opening doors for a deeper pullback toward the 30-day moving average, currently at $4,550.  The stalled bitcoin (BTC) rally could again pick up the pace if a new resistance level above $5,200 is convincingly breached.  The market-leading cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid at lows below $4,200 on April 2 and jumped to 4.5-month highs above $5,300 on April 8, confirming a bullish reversal.  The rally, however, has stalled in the last few days, courtesy of overbought conditions and other factors, as discussed yesterday.  Notably, the three-day chart's 100-candle moving average (MA), currently at $5,238, has been proving a tough nut to crack since April 2. As a result, that lesser-known average is now the level to beat for the bulls.  A convincing move above that MA resistance could bring in more buyers, reviving the prospects of the further rally.  As of writing, bitcoin is trading at $5,080 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  3-day chart  The 100-candle moving average has recently been put to test for the first time since May 2018. Back then, the average was trending north, indicating a bullish setup and was located just above $8,400.  As of writing, it is sloping downwards, representing a bearish bias, and is seen at $5,238. That bearish signal, however, is of little concern to the bulls, as longer duration averages are lagging indicators.  That said, bitcoin has repeatedly failed to secure a three-day close above that average over the last 15 days. A break higher, therefore, may embolden the bulls and allow a sustained move higher toward $5,500.  That, however, looks unlikely in the short-run, as the repeated failure at the 100-candle MA is accompanied by early signs of bearish reversal on the shorter duration charts.  Daily chart  BTC created a bearish outside reversal candle Monday – a pattern that occurs when the day begins on an optimistic note, but ends with pessimism. The candlestick is widely considered a sign of potential trend reversal, especially when it appears after a notable rally, as is the case with BTC.  Traders, however, wait for confirmation in the form of strong follow-through, preferably a close below the candle’s low.  So, a UTC close below $4,948 (Monday’s low) would shift risk in favor of a deeper drop toward the ascending 30-day MA, currently at $4,550. It is worth noting that the 30-day MA served as strong support throughout last month.  A bearish close below $4,948 looks likely, as the 5- and 10-day MAs have produced a bearish crossover, validating the signs of buyer exhaustion seen on the weekly chart (last week’s candle was a doji).  That said, the longer duration outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are trading above $4,236.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Speaking to local financial news source Globes, the firm said it had let go of 15 of its 60 employees – less than had been speculated in the media.  The layoffs come amid a disappointing consumer reaction to the firm's recently launched blockchain phone. ""Sales are not what we expected,"" Sirin told Globes.  The device started shipping in November 2018, and notably features a cold (offline) crypto wallet that is effectively a second device in the same housing as the phone. The firm told CoinDesk in November that the wallet also it has a separate processor and users will interact with it on a second LCD screen for security.  In the Globes report, Sirin Labs also refuted media reports that it has not been paying its staff in recent months. Workers have just been been paid for March and will be be paid Tuesday for April, it said.  The problems at the firm, run by controversial entrepreneur Moshe Hogeg, come as a number of blockchain- and crypto-focused phones are hitting the market.  HTC launched its EXODUS 1 late last year. Initially available for purchase only with cryptocurrencies, the phone was made available for cash buyers in February.  Samsung has also moved to tap the attraction of blockchain features with its latest flagship phone, the Galaxy S10. On sale from early March, the phone features a crypto wallet, distributed app (dapp) partners and a digital signing app.  In January, Sirin's Moshe Hogeg and another firm he founded, blockchain prediction market platform Stox, were reportedly being sued by a Chinese investor for over $4.6 million for allegedly misappropriating some of the crypto millions invested in the firm.  The platform ceased its activity in Israel late last year and laid off all employees, according to Globes.  A number of blockchain startups have been laying off employees over the last few months, with most citing as a cause the effects of the crypto bear market on company holdings and revenue.  Most recently, Indian exchange Unocoin has reduced its employee levels to just 14 from over 100 early last year. According to The Economic Times, the firm had tried unsuccessfully to raise further funding and had to cut costs as a result.  Unocoin intends to soldier on with minimal staff while it awaits a verdict from the country's Supreme Court over a decision by the central bank to block banking services to cryptocurrency platforms, the piece says.

The proof-of-stake based Alogrand was first unveiled by MIT professor and Turing Award winner Silvio Micali in 2017. Over the course of 2018, the initiative netted some $66 million in funding, with backers including venture capital firms Union Square Ventures and Pillar, both of which funded Algorand’s $4 million seed round in February of last year.  Alogorand’s technological approach aspires to create a decentralized system that affords both scalability and security, as well as the elimination of the risk of “forking” or splitting into separate networks, as Micali detailed in a blog post published earlier this month.  According to the startup, the public release follows a private test period in which several hundred users took part. The then-invitation-only testnet first launched last July.  Now, Algorand hopes to attract a wider population of users to “ engage with TestNet and provide feedback on the quality, function, and overall experience of the TestNet protocol,” according to a press release.  “Opening TestNet to the public is a major milestone on our journey to the open source release of the technology, CEO Steve Kokinos said in a statement. “Today marks the latest step forward in our overall mission to enable the broader Algorand community to collaborate, innovate and contribute to the evolution of our public, permissionless blockchain platform.”  Computer cables image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ALGO | BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/16/turing-award-winners-blockchain-opens-test-network-to-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/34a5b91ecd5e9ee67e47a12fcf79655a433fd1df-2560x1825.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430386,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMsPJh,1555387222,Why Coinbase's Move Into Proof-of-Stake Matters,"Is Coinbase going to solve the thorny challenges of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain governance or centralize those systems even further?  That’s the question experts in the space are pondering with the recent announcement that Coinbase Custody will offer staking support for Maker, Tezos and Cosmos. The move means institutional investors will be able to vote on blockchain governance matters directly through their Coinbase accounts.  “We’re hoping to bring online, frankly, the majority of institutional investors,” Coinbase Custody CEO Sam McIngvale told CoinDesk. “We’re growing these three assets under custody and hoping to see an increased turnout of these votes.”  That this is possible is because blockchains like Cosmos, Tezos and Maker use staking to guide their networks.  Staking relies on participants essentially buying into the blockchain’s decision-making council. In addition to backing their votes with deposits – staking their claim with real assets – in Tezos and Cosmos stakers can also earn token rewards for fueling the network’s growth. But, in turn, these networks are beginning to face the same challenge democracies have grappled with for centuries:  How do we incentivize voting?  Lessons from Maker  This Coinbase Custody addition was driven by institutional demand, since few PoS token holders so far are actually participating in governance.  According to Becker, nearly 10 percent of Maker tokens were involved in a recent vote to hike fees related to ethereum-pegged stablecoin loans. While cryptocurrency researcher David Hoffman estimated only 0.58 percent of unique wallets holding Maker participated, Becker told CoinDesk the turnout was high among institutional holders that are able to vote. Indeed, he said the most recent fee-raising proposal had the highest turnout to date with 61 voters.  For many institutional holders, Becker argued, compliance requirements can still complicate the logistics of using tokens to vote.  “If you’re an institution and you represent third-party investors,” Becker explained, “you do need third-party custody as extra protection, to make sure those assets are looked after in a safe manner.”  That’s where the recent move by Coinbase comes in.  On one hand, a Coinbase voting interface could boost turnout by being convenient for the largest Maker holders, including Polychain Capital (founded by Coinbase’s first employee), 1confirmation (founded by an early Coinbase employee) and Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto fund (co-managed by a Coinbase board member).  On the other, Tezos holder and veteran crypto investor Meltem Demirors tweeted that Coinbase Custody could become a “wallet-driven proxy voting platform that influences, gathers, aggregates, and reports on user behavior.”  In response, Coinbase's McIngvale said the custody solution is a business-to-business tool for institutions, not individuals. So there is scant “user behavior” to track.  Plus, he said there aren’t currently any plans to analyze or utilize voting data, adding:  “We are here to provide support, pure infrastructure and services to enable our clients to participate in these networks however they want to. What they’re doing is not really our business. In fact, our business is to protect their anonymity as best we can, and the security of their funds.”  McIngvale said the exchange already custodies roughly 4 percent of Maker tokens, less than the 6 percent Andreessen Horowitz owns by itself. Meanwhile, the Maker Foundation, which employs MakerDAO COO Steven Becker, owns more than 22 percent of the total Maker supply and only sells these tokens to institutions that previous holders like Polychain deem to be committed to participating in governance, according to Becker.  Tendermint Inc director Zaki Manian, co-creator of the Cosmos ecosystem, told CoinDesk each of the three PoS assets Coinbase Custody will support requires a unique approach to governance options based on whether the systems automate changes, like Tezos, or merely show sentiment, like Cosmos.  Either way, governance is often inseparable from politics.  “If a big validator [staker] votes for something early, it gives that proposal a lot more legitimacy,” Manian said, adding:  “I have a thesis that they [Coinbase Custody] are going to have a hard time keeping them [stakers] because … custody is designed not to be a nimble business and staking has to be a nimble business.”  So far, staking votes have appeared to revolve around money rather than infrastructure. Comparable to semi-automated Maker votes about stability fees for stablecoin loans, the first Cosmos vote was an affirmative move toward inflation.  “It’s going to be interesting because part of the dynamics of proof-of-stake is how frequently do people just vote to give themselves more money?” Manian said.  Binance wants in  Coinbase is hardly the only giant entering the game of stakes.  On April 3, Binance’s custody provider Trust Wallet also announced plans to support Tezos staking features by the end of Q2 2019. Unlike institution-centric Coinbase Custody, retail-friendly Trust Wallet will create delegation features on the mobile wallet first, then potentially add voting options down the road.  “We’re already talking to the Cosmos people to bring that [staking] technology to them,” Trust Wallet founder Viktor Radchenko told CoinDesk. “It’s going to be all open source so that any community, like Maker, who would like to come in and have this functionality will be able to do it.”  Radchenko said he believes custody providers and wallets should offer simplified interfaces for users “to be involved in the blockchain itself” when it comes to PoS governance.  From Manian’s perspective, exchange competition will benefit stakers and token buyers.  “Binance and Coinbase are both going real hard on bringing these features to various customer bases,” he said.  Additionally, Manian said the “elephant in the room” is whether exchanges like Binance and Coinbase will offer governance derivatives – the ability to buy votes without owning the underlying assets – to retain institutional stakers as the competition heats up.  So far no exchange has announced any intention to offer such derivatives. To the contrary, Radchenko said that token holders and issuers may be too preoccupied with voting dynamics these days, given how nascent the technology is.  “We plan to bring that functionality [voting] a little bit later just because there’s less usage [than staking],” Trust Wallet’s Radchenko said. “Governance features will come a little bit later, maybe not even this year.”  As for the value Coinbase aims to offer institutional players, McIngvale said:  “We’ll work with our clients to figure out how to grow their impact as they start to participate in more and more governance processes.”  UPDATE (April 17, 13:40 UTC): Added clarifying information about how staking operates for the Tezos, Maker and Cosmos blockchain networks.
