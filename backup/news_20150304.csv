42398251,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT1BC,1425512109,Former Netscape Director Launches Bitcoin Remittance App Abra,"Bill Barhydt, the entrepreneur and former Netscape director who is credited with giving the first TED Talk on bitcoin, has debuted a bitcoin venture called Abra.  The announcement, which came on the final day of Launch Festival 2015, ends seven months of silence for the stealth project. Barhydt previously founded mobile banking startup Boom Financial, which raised $17m in 2012, and WebSentric, one of the first online meeting services.  Speaking at the event, Barhydt explained that the goal of Abra is to attack the $550bn global remittance market by reducing its associated fees. For ease of use, the app uses bitcoin in the back end to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions, but denominates all transactions in US dollars.  Barhydt said:  ""Our mission with Abra is to turn every smartphone into a teller that processes withdrawals. This is not just another bitcoin app. The wallet is a full-fledged digital asset management system, and you don't have to understand it. It's very sophisticated what's going on behind the scenes.""  Barhydt presented the idea to a panel of judges, walking through how the app uses a trusted network of ""tellers"", or users on the network, to facilitate transactions. Users can deposit cash into the app through a teller or by using their debit card, and then send that money anywhere using Abra.  Tellers are then subject to a ratings system in order to ensure trust on the network.  M-Pesa for the world  The entrepreneur described his project in ambitious terms, comparing it to notable mobile money startup M-Pesa, which has become a dominant financial player in Kenya and model for the mobile payments industry.  Enabling this scale, Barhydt noted is that peer-to-peer transfers with digital currency don't bear the same restrictions as those facilitated by a third party.  ""Deposits, withdrawals and transfers are legal,"" he said. ""There is never a party in the middle.""  Barhydt went on to explain how the service will attempt to monetize its user base, while allowing users to earn by facilitating transactions.  ""The teller charges a fee. We take 50 basis points on either side, if the teller doesn't charge a fee, we don't charge a fee,"" Barhydt continued. ""The app actually collects the fee and pushes to Abra. It actually tells the consumers what they're paying, they don't have to understand how to calculate anything.""  To enroll, users need only provide their name, email address, phone number and city and country of residence.  Bitcoin focus  Barhydt has long been active in the bitcoin community, giving the first TED Talk on bitcoin in January of 2012.  The 10-minute presentation aimed to address the potential future of the technology, how the network could be improved and whether it would become more mainstream.  Since then, however, Barhydt has remained engaged, serving in various capacities with companies in and around the bitcoin space.  For example, Barhydt is currently an advisor for bitcoin startup Mirror and bitcoin-friendly startup incubator Boost VC, where he provides mentoring to angel-stage companies.

42378060,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxgL,1425504962,'Masked' Card Lets Online Shoppers Pay Anywhere With Bitcoin,"Online privacy company Abine has announced the launch of Bitcoin Anywhere, enabling Coinbase wallet holders to make bitcoin purchases at any e-commerce site.  Bitcoin Anywhere, currently in beta and invite only, will enable Coinbase users to link their wallet to Abine Blur, a password control service.  When they want to make a purchase, consumers create a privacy-enhancing 'Masked Card', which work in a similar way to pre-paid gift vouchers. They are created on-the-fly and are loaded with US dollars funded from the user's bitcoin account.  Andrew Sudbury, Abine co-­founder and CTO, said:  ""When a user makes a Masked Card, we are issuing a limited-balance, limited-duration credit card for that transaction. When you generate a masked card we charge your funding source.""  Blur then withdraws the bitcoin needed for the transaction from the user's Coinbase wallet. Sudbury confirmed that any remaining funds are refunded back to the user.  When asked about user security the CTO said that user information is ""tokenised and stored in a way that meets or exceed PCI Level 1 Compliance. All public payments communications happens over SSL, and no account numbers are stored directly on our servers"".  He added:  “What we aim to achieve is to assess consumer demand for a purchasing experience that balances innovation, convenience, compliance, and security.""  Abine has confirmed that it has plans to open up the service to other wallet holders in the future. ""We want to give users the choice to fund their accounts and payments in a way that is most convenient for them"", the CTO concluded.

42378054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxbJ,1425502290,MegaBigPower Opens Buyback for Unprofitable Bitcoin Miners,"MegaBigPower has announced that it will begin purchasing preowned bitcoin mining ASICs as part of a plan to acquire as much as 10 megawatts worth of hardware.  Under the buyback program, the US-based bitcoin mining company will purchase certain types of hardware, with an emphasis on models sold by mining manufacturers Spondoolies-Tech and Bitmain.  Founder Dave Carlson framed the program as a simpler alternative for miners looking to sell their equipment online, telling CoinDesk:  “Due to our extremely low power cost, we can still return funds to miners who may have gotten in just before the market fell. Going this route is a lot less hassle than trying to sell on eBay or Craigslist.”  The buyback program comes amid a difficult environment for those in the mining space owing to the combination of falling revenues, growing costs and a rising network difficulty.  Hardware purchases have reportedly plunged, and bad conditions as a whole have resulted in a number of bankruptcies.  ASIC acquisitions  Carlson noted that some types of hardware, including HashFast and Butterfly Labs ASICs, as well as independently designed mining rigs, will not be accepted, as will any machine incapable of being underclocked.  “We are not familiar with all the products out there, but we are willing to look at what people have,” he said.  Interested parties should submit an online form on the company’s website, after which time MBP will review the submission and make an offer if applicable. Shipments, Carlson explained, take place after an offer has been made and a purchase agreement between the prospective seller and MBP is signed.  Sellers will also recoup shipping costs, Carlson said. He added that he hoped the program would enable some former miners the chance to recoup losses they may have experienced as the price of bitcoin fell and profitability dwindled as a result.  “I'm hoping this program will keep enthusiasts and investors involved with bitcoin on a positive note and not leave them feeling burned,” said Carlson.

42378063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxk7,1425497425,Bitcoin Tipping Service Bans User For Attempted Donation to Islamic State,"Though rumors that Islamic State (IS) has been seeking to use bitcoin as a means of payment have persisted in the media, so far, little connection has been made between the notorious rebel group and the digital currency.  Perhaps as a comment on this ongoing media narrative, bitcoin enthusiast and AltMarket developer Bryce Weiner (@BryceWeiner) used bitcoin micropayments service ChangeTip to initiate a $1 tip to a suspected IS account (@vvvv_101) this week in an incident that has since caused controversy.  The tweet  , sent on 28th February, spawned discussion and sometimes humorous banter on Reddit regarding the role of social networks in facilitating free speech, though at least one of the involved entities is taking the matter more seriously.  Speaking to CoinDesk, ChangeTip CEO Nick Sullivan acknowledged the ""facetious"" nature of the original tweet, though he indicated the company has since moved to shut down Weiner's account.  Sullivan said:  ""Our community team saw this tip and we shut down the user's account, canceled the tip attempt and banned their IP address.""  In comments, Weiner painted a somewhat different picture of the events, suggesting that he ""voluntarily asked"" to have his ChangeTip account closed, and noting that his actions were not taken in an attempt to harm the company nor were they affiliated with the startup.  Further, he used the incident as a way to emphasize what were perhaps the political motivations behind his actions.  ""Many of the tools we keep wishing we had to live in a more decentralized future we already have,"" Weiner told CoinDesk. ""The power to disrupt the status quo and the existing narrative is already in our hands and we have only but to use them. I'm not in jail. Nothing bad has happened to me, what does that mean?""  ChangeTip has so far received upwards of $3.5m in funding to facilitate bitcoin tipping over social media networks such as Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. As a means to spread bitcoin adoption, the ChangeTip network allows users to initiate tips to non-users via these forums who then must enroll to receive the funds.  Wake-up call  Though the ChangeTip transaction was apparently stopped, others in the industry suggest that digital currency companies should take the event as a warning against this kind of malicious use.  Carol van Cleef, a co-chair at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP who helps put on compliance and regulatory bootcamps for the industry, indicated that the event is likely to underscore the risk companies face for OFAC violations.  ""The problem with OFAC compliance is that nothing is required. OFAC doesn't require you to have a compliance program, it doesn’t require you to do any checking of names against the so-called OFAC list. It simply does not require any of that, but if you are involved in or facilitate a transaction with someone you shouldn’t be doing business with – you have violated the law,"" she said.  Penalties, she indicated, could include fines or jail time, adding:  ""While there's a lot of pushback in the industry about knowing who's on both sides of the transaction, not knowing can present the real risk of facilitating a transaction in violation of some very serious laws.""  Van Cleef voiced her belief that the most interesting outstanding question may be whether the tweet was what caused the transaction to be terminated, or whether the company was able to detect the action through its own back-end.  ""This helps crystallize the risks companies face,"" she added.  'No OFAC violation'  Sullivan went on to state that ChangeTip will be implementing additional screening methods as a direct response to the incident, as well as preventing tips from being delivered that contain ""blacklisted keywords"".  ChangeTip's service is already unavailable in certain countries blacklisted by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), the divisioin of the Department of the Treasury that administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions.  The company's terms and conditions provide it the authority to block assets, deactivate or cancel offending user accounts or transfer bitcoin from a user's account should they be found in violation of this policy.  Still, Sullivan expressed his belief that no violations took place as the tip was canceled before it was transacted.  ""Our conclusion is that no OFAC violation occurred because the transaction was stopped by us and was never completed,"" he said.  Supporting free speech  In remarks, ChangeTIp head of community Victoria van Eyk stressed that the ChangeTip terms of service clearly forbids certain activities, but that her company intends to continue to support the rights of expression of its users.  ""We support free speech within the confines of the current laws. But, we cannot enable our platform to be used to fund terrorist activities,"" van Eyk said.  Van Eyk was unable to provide additional details on how users may be able to avoid any blacklisted terms, or where such terms might be publicly listed.  Twitter did not respond to requests for comment at press time. Weiner has since deleted the offending Twitter account, while the account of the suspected IS member has been suspended.

42378071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxrf,1425494517,US Bank Regulator: Virtual Currencies Could Be 'Revolutionary',"The head of an independent US agency within the US Treasury that supervises national banks has issued new statements on virtual currencies and their ""potentially revolutionary"" impact on banking.  Speaking before the Institute of International Bankers this week, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Thomas J Curry discussed virtual currency as part of a speech aimed at addressing the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its ability to adapt to new innovations.  In his remarks, Curry referenced the ""serious challenges"" the banking industry faces from terrorist and criminal organisations, and how he believes they can be combated with strong risk management and anti-money laundering (AML) and BSA compliance.  Still, he suggested that the regulation has struggled to adapt to terrorists who now have access to advanced payments innovations.  Curry said:  ""New payment systems are creating greater efficiencies and convenience, and virtual currencies offer the prospect of instantaneous transactions directly between individuals and entities on a global basis. These innovations are potentially revolutionary in their impact, and are advancing at a breakneck pace.""  The OCC chief went on to characterize the BSA as ""rooted in 20th century concepts"", but framed virtual currencies as a potential ally to law enforcement in the fight against terror and criminal activity.  ""It is also foreseeable that, if properly employed, technology can be used by banks and the government to better meet the goals of the BSA, by providing more accurate and timely information to law enforcement and regulators, while simultaneously reducing cost and burden,"" Curry added.  A former director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Curry has served as the head of the organisation since 2012.  Plea to banks  Though not addressing virtual currency directly, Curry went on to hint at some of the operational issues the industry and others have faced when trying to forge partnerships with the traditional financial system.  For example, he noted that US banks have closed the accounts of ""entire categories of consumers"" based on concerns about BSA and AML compliance.  Curry went on to encourage banks to refrain from terminating customer accounts provided they can ""manage their risk appropriately"", asking them to instead think about how they could help lower the risk of certain consumers and companies.  Curry ended his speech by addressing the scope of the challenge and the need for broad cooperation to achieve its goals, stating:  ""To the extent that it can, the OCC is committed to playing a constructive role in the dialogue and working with other parts of the US government to address this important issue.""

42378048,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LxWH,1425479318,BitVC Swaps 'Socialized' Futures Losses for New Risk System,"Futures trading platform BitVC has altered the way it handles forced liquidation risk management, replacing the 'socialized system losses' method that was sometimes unpopular with users.  The platform, a subsidiary of Chinese exchange Huobi, says it will implement a new method called 'automatic counterparty deleveraging'.  A BitVC representative said the system is the first of its kind in the high-leverage bitcoin futures market and, while still not perfect, offers a significant improvement over other risk-management strategies in similar markets.  Automatic reduction of leverage  He went on to describe a situation in which the new method would be effective:  ""When a trader's dynamic equity falls to the forced liquidation trigger level, the system automatically closes his position. However, during periods of extreme market volatility, there may be insufficient counterparty buy or sell orders in the order book, resulting in a failure to complete the forced liquidation at the target price and a negative account balance.""  If such a forced liquidation is triggered and there are not enough counterparty orders to close the position, the system will automatically reduce the leverage of the most highly-leveraged open counterparty positions – by the amount necessary to ensure the liquidation order can be filled at the target price.  This prevents negative balances from occurring, and eliminates the need to socialize losses.  How socialized loss systems work  Socialized loss systems are in place at other leveraged trading platforms such as OKCoin. A method of managing systemic risk while still allowing highly-leveraged trading options, it proportionally allocates system losses from forced liquidations at contract settlement time.  Socialized losses incurred are revealed only after contract settlement, which does not allow for positions to be adjusted.  BitVC hopes automatic deleveraging will affect fewer users, who will be notified immediately if it occurs, allowing time and opportunity to compensate for the reduction in position size.  Unpopular with users  BitVC came under fire from some users in November under its old system, where a particularly volatile week in bitcoin prices saw it take 46.1% of successful traders' paper profits to cover a 3,000 BTC 'system loss'.  The system is designed to ensure the platform remains solvent by making cumulative profits equal cumulative losses when prices are volatile.  Although socializing losses is legitimate under the platforms' terms and conditions, and BitVC agreed to reimburse its users with trading fee waivers, the size of the November loss shocked some and led to questions over whether bitcoin markets were liquid enough to handle more advanced professional trading features.

42378053,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lxa3,1425470523,Andreas Antonopoulos Makes Case for Bitcoin Before Australian Senate,"Bitcoin evangelist Andreas M Antonopoulos has appeared before the Australian Senate as part of an inquiry into the local treatment of digital currencies.      The prominent bitcoin 'guru' made the case for bitcoin, saying that its unique architecture and payment mechanism had important implications for network access, innovation, privacy, individual empowerment, consumer protection and regulation.      Claiming that bitcoin represented a ""unique opportunity in two areas for Australia"", Antonopoulos said:      ""Bitcoin can introduce much needed competition in the retail payments industry, undercutting the expensive systems offered by credit and debit cards, whilst significantly improving security and privacy for consumers.""              ""Secondly, the bitcoin industry can establish Australia at the forefront of the next wave of innovation of financial services. A wave that can extend financial services to more than two billion people throughout Southeast Asia, who are currently unbanked,"" he continued.    Benefits of the technology    The information security expert noted that Australian was already the home of a thriving bitcoin industry, but spoke of its potential to ""become a leader in the region and the world"".      Antonopoulos also compared the centralised banking system to bitcoin's decentralised offering, highlighting the cryptocurrency's security levels:      ""If a bad actor infiltrates a traditional financial network, the network itself and all of its participants are at risk. In contrast, if a bad actor has access to the bitcoin network, they have no power in the network itself and they do not compromise trust in the network.""      He added:      ""Contrary to popular misconception, bitcoin is not unregulated. Rather, several aspects of the bitcoin network and financial system are regulated by mathematical algorithms. The algorithmic regulation in bitcoin offers predictable, objective, measurable outcomes.""              ""Algorithmic regulation provides certainty without nationalist or geopolitical influence. In a time of unprecedented currency wars, mathematical neutrality is a safe haven"", he concluded.    Australia talks regulation  According to ZDNet, the Australian Treasury Department's Kate Preston, who is responsible for advising the government on revenue and taxation policy, told the Senate committee inquiry that the existing tax treatment would suffice whilst bitcoin was still in its early stages.  Preston, general manager at the Department's Revenue Group, was also cited as saying, that in her opinion, there were no issues with the way that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has dealt with the emergence of digital currencies.  She added that ATO would continue to assess the situation, stressing ""that it is an industry, if you like, that is in its infancy"".  Appearing as a witness in the proceedings, Preston was responding to comments posed by committee chair and Labor Senator Sam Dastyari, who put forward the fact that local bitcoin businesses were likely to move offshore so as to avoid the ATO's current tax regime for digital currencies.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Queensland Senator Matt Canavan, said:  ""Regulation is a bit like aspirin, though. We need just the right amount to ensure that commerce flows through our economic arteries, but too much or too little and we can lose the patient.""  Previous guidance  The ATO released its guidance on the taxation of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in Australia last August, saying that ""transacting with bitcoin is akin to a barter arrangement, with similar tax consequences"", unless it was used for business purposes.  ATO's view is that ""bitcoin is neither money nor a foreign currency, and the supply of bitcoin is not a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes"". However, the guidance outlined that ""bitcoin was an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.  The ATO's consideration of bitcoin as a digital commodity, as opposed to a fiat currency as such as the Australian dollar, means that the digital currency is being taxed twice.
