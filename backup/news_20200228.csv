42383398,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vR3R,1582932606,Crypto Firms Tout Dispersed Workforce as Coronavirus Contingency Plan,"Companies are telling employees to stay home. Firms are debating when to shutter the office. Health officials are asking businesses to “dust off” the pandemic playbook. But for some, the coronavirus contingency plan is built in.      A number of cryptocurrency exchanges have favored dispersed workforces since their launch. In an industry defined by the ideals of decentralization, companies like Binance and Kraken say they have been implementing this playbook for years: Most of their employees already work remotely.      And while firms around the world scramble to develop protocols for what is increasingly likely to become a pandemic, and as capital markets plummet on global investors’ fears the worst of the coronavirus outbreak is yet to come, these exchanges say they are going about business as usual.      They don’t need to shut their headquarters; they don’t have headquarters      “The Binance team works in a decentralized way, with team members scattering in different countries and regions,” said Binance representative Cecilia Zhang.      Her exchange is notably fluid when it comes to geography. It’s not always clear where Binance is based or if it even has a “headquarters,” in the office park sense. For the last few years Binance had claimed an HQ in Malta, but just last week the Maltese regulator declared that the so-called blockchain island never had a regulated or registered Binance exchange.      Lacking a headquarters becomes an asset, however, when an inexplicable act-of-god-like event such as an epidemic comes to town. Binance’s Zhang claimed the exchange has “not been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.” Its employees have been working remotely and in clusters for over two years.      The Kraken exchange went a step further. It’s spinning coronavirus into a hiring and publicity opportunity, boasting on Twitter Thursday its decentralized workers are “thriving” despite rising international fears.      “Kraken's global collapse and pandemic survival strategy has been in place since our founding in 2011. Our remote-first, decentralized team of 800+ is thriving right now. Join us,” the firm said.      At peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Hodl Hodl, which says it has no head office, ""we don't prepare ourselves actually,"" said CEO Max Keidun. ""Since day one we've been fully distributed and remote.""    High alert      Not every crypto company has that option. Many remain tied to headquarters and have in recent days rushed to create policies around what could happen if and when coronavirus reaches them.      Coinbase has become the highest-profile company to list a contingency plan, outlining a four-part process where it would shutter offices and have employees work remotely depending on if and how an outbreak might progress in areas where employees live and work.      In China, where the outbreak began, exchanges and blockchain firms have had to cancel networking events, encourage employees to work remotely and delay tech upgrades.      Global Currency Organization (GCO), based in California, is on high alert since a reported case of coronavirus in Sacramento, said David Steinrueck, a representative. The team, which is developing a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency backed by U.S. dollars, is ready to disperse as soon as coronavirus reaches the San Francisco area.      “We are being cautious and actively preparing to move to work from home as soon as that becomes necessary. It certainly seems like it could get worse before it gets better, so we are trying to stay ahead of it and focus on our safety above all,” Steinrueck said.      GCO has canceled all trips to the Asia-Pacific region “until further notice” and limited even domestic travel, he said.      The blockchain sleuthing firm Chainalysis has similarly nixed all “non-essential” travel outside the U.S., according to spokesperson Maddie Kennedy. The firm has hubs in New York and London, but for the next four weeks, no employees working there will be traveling through the Asia-Pacific area, Europe, the U.K. or Ireland.      Chainalysis already had a pandemic response plan, though. It’s in the process of updating it for COVID-19.      “We're keeping a close eye on it,” Kennedy said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/28/crypto-firms-tout-dispersed-workforce-as-coronavirus-contingency-plan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b38f4a29872c535b4476921e77a9284af48a4c66-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383399,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vR2B,1582925753,Chinese Crypto and Blockchain Firms Grapple With Coronavirus Outbreak,"Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges and other blockchain companies are coping with a new reality as the coronavirus outbreak continues to disrupt their daily operations.      While crypto trading, customer service and marketing remain largely intact, the outbreak has taken its toll on technical upgrades, product development, logistics and business travel, according to a dozen executives in China interviewed by CoinDesk.       Following the outbreak, the Chinese government extended its Lunar New Year vacation by one week to Feb.10. Weeks later, a few major Chinese cities remain locked down, and many companies have asked their employees to work from home – including blockchain businesses.       “We encourage our employees to work remotely after the vacation as there are so many people from every part of China coming back to work,” said Aurora Wong, vice president at ZB Group. “The coronavirus is not a regional epidemic, it has been spread across the country and even to other countries.”       The outbreak “has caused psychological stress on people,” Wong said. “While many cities are not technically in lockdown, it is definitely not encouraged to come out for our own health and the whole society to get the epidemic under control.”       Founded in China in 2013, Switzerland-based ZB Group claims its crypto exchange now serves over 10 million users, with $3 billion in average daily trading volume. It has operations across the world including China, Singapore, South Korea and the U.S.       According to Wong, the outbreak is likely to slow the exchange’s technical upgrade to a new version. The upgrade could include front-end mobile apps for users as well as the back-end trading engine.       Before the outbreak, “we were very efficient and fast on upgrading our platform because people across different departments such as the engineering team, product development and marketing could meet and work together to carry out plans,” Wong said.       However, the outbreak has had only a limited impact on daily operations of ZB’s trading platform since the firm keeps a schedule to rotate its staff to maintain the exchange, according to Wong.     Contingency planning    Estonia-based Bibox crypto exchange, which also originated from China, said it has a contingency plan to tackle the operational challenges due to the coronavirus outbreak.       “We might relocate our core engineering team to other Asian countries such as one of our Asian headquarters in Singapore or Vietnam where there are much fewer infected cases,” said Aries Wang, co-founder of Bibox.       According to Wang, Bibox’s trading, marketing and customer service have not been affected much, but new product development and networking events with potential investors have been disrupted to a degree.       “We originally planned a meeting for Chinese crypto funds and private equity firms in London to pave the way for our potential initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in March,” Wang said. “The meeting and IPO would probably be delayed to a later date.”       Further, when Bibox lists new tokens, the product development team needs to work very closely with the engineering team, creating custom services for clients and upgrading its own exchange platform. But this requires face-to-face meetings, which are for now rare.       OKEx, one of the top three crypto exchanges by trading volume, said it’s staying vigilant now that it has resumed business after the vacation.       “We suggested our employees stay where they already are, avoid crowds as much as possible and reduce business trips,” Jay Hao, the CEO of OKEx, said of its headquarters in Hong Kong.      “Our offices have been completely disinfected, and we have also prepared protective equipment such as surgical masks, liquid soap and alcohol-based sanitizer for all of our employees,” Hao said.       The firm has upgraded its IT systems, such as phone and video conference software, to streamline the process of working from home and ensure normal operations throughout its global offices, according to Hao.     Working (and conferencing) remotely    Outside of trading venues, other blockchain startups in the region say they’ve been significantly affected by the outbreak.       B-Labs, a blockchain incubation center co-founded by Canaan Blockchain, OK Group and Yangtze Delta Region Institute of Tsinghua University, has decided to reduce rents for some of the startups that use the space and open a platform for them to apply for subsidies.       Conflux, a Beijing-based blockchain firm, is also coping with the outbreak’s ramifications.      “Coronavirus has affected us in a way that we had to replan many offline events within the Asia Pacific region,” Christian Oertal, chief marketing officer at Conflux, said. “We had to pivot into organizing and participating in online events.”       “As for office work, everyone at Conflux is working remotely from home. The health of everyone in the company should not be put into any risky situation in current times,” he added.      Another part of the blockchain industry which has been significantly affected by the outbreak is mining, the business of running expensive computers that race to solve math problems in order to record transactions and secure crypto networks.      A spate of miner manufacturers, including Bitmian, MicroBT and Canaan, have expected some of their deliveries to be delayed due to slow logistics caused by the outbreak. Some of the mining farms are short of workers to maintain machines, while a few mining farms have been shut down by local governments as part of the measures to contain the epidemic.      The growth rate of mining difficulty, an indicator of the level of competition among bitcoin miners, has been slowing since the coronavirus outbreak, signaling that miners have paused upgrading to newer, more powerful machines.      In the most recent two-week cycle, from Feb. 11-25, this gauge declined for the first time since early December.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/28/chinese-crypto-and-blockchain-firms-grapple-with-coronavirus-outbreak,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fb2449d22c46b709d27011da04a321a57a2a188-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383403,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vR4h,1582923606,Yemen's Civil War Shows the Dangers of Crypto,"The Takeaway:    Yemen, home to what the United Nations calls the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, is in a state of civil war.  Half of the country is controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi militant group, which has developed its own cryptocurrency.  People from Yemen are often wary of being associated with cryptocurrency, in part because of the Houthis’ crypto efforts.  Despite the potential advantages of a trans-national, censorship-resistant cryptocurrency in the country, connectivity issues make it very hard to get bitcoin into this war zone.  “It’s too soon for bitcoin,” one researcher said.    So far, it appears using bitcoin (BTC) in a war zone may be riskier than cash, especially when illicit actors use cryptocurrency as well as civilians.      The ongoing civil war in Yemen highlights the contradictions underlying bitcoin adoption: It’s difficult for civilians to acquire cryptocurrency without heavily regulated infrastructure that makes them vulnerable to coercion and surveillance. Such is the case in Yemen, where the Iran-backed Houthi militia controls the northern half of the country and a failing government controls the central bank in the south.      For most people in Yemen, purchasing bitcoin is nearly impossible. Most international companies avoid doing business in Yemen due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, which aren’t comprehensive like the sanctions against Iran but nonetheless raise compliance questions. This week the United Nations Security Council approved further sanctions against Yemen in an attempt to curtail arms trading between Iran and the Houthis. With the Houthis now functionally governing the northern half of the country, the Trump administration may reportedly suspend humanitarian aid.      “Everyone’s looking at a timeline of a month or two. ... That’s the point at which different [donors] will start to suspend some of the programs,” a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Tuesday.      Plus, peer-to-peer markets are hampered by both cash shortages and a lack of reliable communications infrastructure. Yemeni-American researcher Ibraham Qatabi at the Center for Constitutional Rights said telecom and electricity companies are owned by governments, both foreign and domestic, depending on the region. There’s no need for a warrant if Big Brother already owns the pipes. Plus, Qatabi said, most international money transfers are monitored by local authorities.      “Everything is monitored. They have everyone’s information,” Qatabi said. “If they want to go after somebody, they’ll have access to those files.”      Hamza Alshargabi, a doctor who worked in Yemen until 2012 and briefly mined ether (ETH) after he immigrated to the U.S., agreed it’s “almost impossible” to get a safe and reliable internet or phone connection in most of Yemen. He said in big cities connectivity is “so expensive that it’s unusable,” so he can’t imagine his sister using bitcoin in Yemen. Although someday mesh networks may help bitcoiners transact without reliable internet, there’s hardly any bitcoin to trade on the ground.      Meanwhile, it appears the Houthis are promoting cryptocurrency adoption, just not censorship-resistant bitcoin.      According to a report from the Yemen-focused Sana’a Center for Strategic Studies (SCSS) in December 2019 the Houthi militia instructed civilians in northern Yemen to trade in the internationally recognized bills for “an equivalent amount of e-Rials,” a cryptocurrency developed by the militant group.      As such, some Yemeni civilians and expats are scared to be associated with cryptocurrency, including bitcoin. If protests last year in Iran and Lebanon offered a peek at bitcoin’s limitations, then Yemen is the full picture of bitcoin usage still relying on government infrastructure.    Crypto wars    Cryptocurrency has itself become a weapon in Yemen’s civil war.      By issuing a digital currency, the Houthis strived to establish a circular economy with less dependence on banks hostile to their cause. The group even banned the possession of new Yemeni rial bills.      “They are denying the government the most basic function, printing money,” Alshargabi said. “At least in Iran there is a lot of wealth and oil, commerce they can build around. … In Yemen, there’s nothing to sell.”      This isn’t the Houthi’s first crypto venture. The group has been mining decentralized cryptocurrencies since 2017, according to the cybersecurity company Recorded Future, which declined to comment for this article. It is not clear which currencies the Houthis mined. However, some Iranian military leaders are looking to create cryptocurrency tools in order to circumnavigate sanctions. And, according to the Brookings Institute, “Iran’s influence with the Houthis is growing.”      Perhaps this is, in part, why the Houthis tested a payments pilot in April 2019, using the Houthi-run Yemen Petroleum Company and other public institutions, like the Yemeni Telecommunications Corporation. But the employees protested and refused to accept e-Rial salaries.      “Nine months on, the e-Rial can still only be used to pay limited expenses, such as water and electricity utility bills and mobile phone services,” the recent SCSS report noted. “There is currently no mechanism for using the e-Rial for normal daily economic activities.”      One SCSS researcher, who requested anonymity for safety, said the Houthis started these cryptocurrency experiments to deal with a local cash shortage. He added bitcoin may be caught in a paradigm where, socially, people mostly trust sources a friend or relative personally vouched for. Yet, talking about bitcoin on social media or local phone networks could get that person “targeted.”      (Note that all sources for this article commented from the Yemeni diaspora, due in part to what the SCSS researcher described as a “high level of scrutiny” through local telecommunications networks and “general concerns about monitoring financial activities in the area.”)      That’s why Alshargabi eventually stopped mining ether in the U.S., scared the American government would profile him for additional surveillance. Even if he has no connection to illicit crypto users in Yemen, Alshargabi isn’t confident the legal system would protect a foreign-born Muslim.      “How do I know I’m not going to get a knock on my door someday?” Alshargabi said.      So Alshargabi sends money to family in Yemen the old-fashioned way instead.      “You call your friend and say, ‘You give my mom $200 and I’ll give your mom over here $200.’ There are regular people in that type of business,” he said.    Dangerous public ledgers    This same ad hoc system Alshargabi uses to send his family cash also works for the few civilians in Yemen who want to own bitcoin, not e-Rials.      Since most global cryptocurrency exchanges don’t accept credit cards or bank transfers from Yemen, small groups of crypto-curious Yemenites show personal relationships across the diaspora are the key to accessing bitcoin in times of crisis.      Such was the case for a small group of roughly eight friends around 2018, including computer science student Manal Ghanem. She didn’t buy any herself, just played with simulations and testnets. But a few of her friends with family abroad got bitcoin by using foreign bank accounts on global exchanges. One bitcoiner would shop online for foreign products, then sell it locally for cash, she said, because shipping was the least difficult part of the cumbersome process.      “I do believe with the collapsing financial institutions in Yemen, if people get a bit educated they can leverage bitcoin to their benefit,” she said. “They are eager to create new opportunities but it can be really dangerous to go online and gamble what little you have and then lose.”      Her friend Faissal Alshaabi said he struggled to use exchanges in Yemen because his internet connection was too weak to even load a website. Alshaabi turned to a cloud mining service instead, but American regulators shut it down and he lost his capital.      Despite all these challenges, Alshaabi said he still believes cryptocurrency could be useful inside Yemen.      “It's a fast way to send money and with low fees, so I think people would use it as payment method,” he said.      In the meantime, the most important thing Yemenites can do is establish situations where they can acquire bitcoin without attracting the wrong type of attention. This education requires in-person meetings. Governments may not be able to confiscate your bitcoin, but they can take your life.      “In terms of increasing awareness, that would have to be verbally transmitted,” the researcher said. “It’s too soon for bitcoin.”",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/28/yemens-civil-war-shows-the-dangers-of-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/442ef60d8189bb39b3005ed80a200f5ae68f0a5f-1300x866.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383381,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOUv,1582922498,"As Fed Contemplates Coronavirus-Prompted Easing, Bitcoin Traders Bet on Halving","U.S. stocks continue to reel over coronavirus-related fears, and investors are increasingly betting the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates to stabilize the economy and markets.      But whether those investors turn to bitcoin (BTC) as a crisis hedge remains to be seen.      Such action by the Fed could, in theory, help bitcoin prices since lower rates would likely reduce the appeal of income-yielding assets such as U.S. Treasury bonds, according to analysts tracking the 11-year-old cryptocurrency. So far, the Fed has not said whether it would cut rates, with Chair Jerome Powell taking a ""wait and watch"" attitude.      Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes slid by 0.15 percentage point to a new record low of 1.14 percent, indicating heightened demand; bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields. Rates also fell on government bonds from the U.K. Those from Germany and Japan fell further into negative territory.      “As interest rates decline, you're more likely to tip the seesaw toward assets that don't have yield, such as collectible assets like artwork or gold or bitcoin,” said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, a New York-based cryptocurrency analysis firm.      Bitcoin prices are down 14 percent since Sunday, on track for their worst weekly performance since mid-November. The cryptocurrency slid 2.9 percent on Friday to $8,573, the lowest in a month.      Analysts and traders in the nascent market have debated whether bitcoin should trade as a hedge against malaise in traditional markets, or if it’s more vulnerable to a sell-off alongside riskier assets like stocks and emerging-market currencies when the global economic and market outlooks darken. Some investors say bitcoin is mostly uncorrelated with other asset categories, sometimes trading in sync with stocks and other times in opposition.      Bitcoin was launched by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto in early 2009, in the wake of the last financial crisis, so the cryptocurrency is largely untested in a market meltdown like the coronavirus-triggered panic selling now roiling stocks.    Haven Bet vs. Halving Bet      As a feature of the currency’s original design, the pace of new supplies of bitcoin issued to the decentralized network gets cut in half every four years. The next such event — known as the halving — is expected to take place in May.      That automatic supply tightening, encoded in the software, differentiates bitcoin sharply from human-led monetary-policy easing by central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve. The cryptocurrency’s price jumped 94 percent last year, roughly triple the gains in U.S. stocks; despite this week’s pullback, bitcoin is still up about 19 percent so far in 2020.      For now, the bitcoin market might be too immature for large investors with diversified asset portfolios to use as a hedge against a financial crisis. Indeed, bitcoin’s price drop in recent days — gold has slid, too — might signal most investors are still scrambling into cash when there’s a big market sell-off.      “We see a lot of these global actions having some impact on bitcoin, but there's also things that are happening in the bitcoin network, and that could have a larger impact than the Fed cutting interest rates,” says Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund BitBull Capital in San Francisco. “I’m still bullish for bitcoin for the year, and a major reason is the halving.”    The Fed’s Next Move    The World Health Organization raised its risk assessment of the coronavirus to “very high” from “high,” with Italy now expected to approve emergency measures and quarantines and event cancellations reported in Germany and Switzerland, according to Bloomberg News. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has warned of possible school closings in the U.S.      The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is down 12.5 percent over the past seven days, putting the gauge on track for its worst weekly performance since the 2008 crisis.      That's why investors are betting the Federal Reserve will make a move to help stanch the red ink. According to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures contracts used to bet on the Fed’s benchmark interest rate have shifted in the past two days to incorporate the near-certainty of a cut by the time of the central bank’s next regular monetary-policy meeting, scheduled for March 18. Just a week ago, most traders were expecting no change.      There’s also now a greater than 50 percent chance the Fed will cut rates by at least a full percentage point by December, from the current range of between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent.      U.S. stocks pared losses on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a mid-day statement the central bank was “closely monitoring developments” related to the coronavirus “and their implications for the economic outlook.”      “We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy,” Powell said.      While rate cuts might ultimately prompt bigger allocations to bitcoin, investors in crypto and traditional markets could be so gripped right now by a crisis mentality that they’re indiscriminately selling all assets perceived as risky. Since cryptocurrencies are relatively new and their prices can be extremely volatile, bitcoin is still generally perceived as a risky asset, Cipolaro said.      “Usually in the early stages of a crisis, you're worried about deflation, not inflation,” he said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/28/as-fed-contemplates-coronavirus-prompted-easing-bitcoin-traders-bet-on-halving,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18662c98e8f34a5215760f1f84ee746ec5882867-2117x977.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A former employee stole private information for more than 8,000 users, Christina Comben, who heads Digitex's communications, said Friday.      Comben told CoinDesk the exchange was ""aware of a leak of confidential data,"" continuing: ""We can confirm that this was not an external hack but an internal security breach orchestrated by an ex-employee with a conflict of interest against the company.""      Digitex has not revealed the identity of the ex-employee responsible for the data breach, which is believed to have taken place sometime before Feb. 7.      Based in Dublin, Digitex is a decentralized crypto derivatives exchange, orientated towards retail investors, that provides peer-to-peer trading on perpetual swaps and futures contracts. The platform also includes a margin trading facility and leverage of up to 100x.      Digitex disclosed in a blog post in early February that a ""scheming and highly manipulative ex-employee whose professional interests are now in conflict with Digitex’s success"" had hijacked the exchange's Facebook account and begun publicly posting user email addresses. However, the post received little notice at the time and gave limited detail of the scale of the breach.      The exchange blamed Facebook's ""slow and unresponsive"" customer service team for the delay in regaining control of its page.

Since Feb. 25, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in the rest of the world has surpassed new cases in China, according to the World Health Organization.       Fear the virus’ spread will lead to a pandemic that could slow the global economy is dragging down stock prices; the S&P 500 index is in the red by 10 percent since the beginning of 2020. Bitcoin (BTC) has also taken a hit, with the cryptocurrency trading below $9,000 for the first time since January, although as of Feb, 28 it is still up 20 percent for the year to date.      Meanwhile, cryptocurrency over-the-counter (OTC) trading volume has been on the rise since the virus became a constant part of the news cycle. “We have been seeing a significant uptick in volume over the last 60 days,” said Michael Leon, a trader at Chicago-based Althena Investor Services, which specializes in serving OTC clients. Upticks in week-over-week volume for cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken are also being seen, according to data from CoinGecko.      Globally, the virus’ impact has been varied. Australia, which is closer geographically to Asian economies highly affected by COVID-19, has not seen a significant drop in trading, at least according to one desk. “No noticeable effects here in Australia,” said Tilo Grieco, head of OTC desk at ORTUS, based in Sydney.      One strategy some traders are contemplating to prepare for COVID-19 is not holding volatile cryptocurrency assets unless absolutely needed. That’s what Althena’s OTC desk is doing. “We manage inventory very tight and run a matched book, so the coronavirus hasn’t been a factor,” said Althena’s Leon.       Inventory management for trading desks may be prudent, given the uncertainty that lies ahead, according to Rupert Douglas, head of business development and institutional sales at Koine, which provides settlement and custody for cryptocurrencies.      “While alternative stores of value like gold and BTC have rallied since the start of the year, they haven't fared so well over the last few days. The genie - as in volatility - is out of the bottle, with big swings ahead anticipated in all asset classes,” said Douglas.

CoinDesk now has a masthead.  Click here to view the masthead  When I joined CoinDesk in 2017, one of the first things I noticed was there was no single page listing all our editorial staff members and detailing their roles and contact information. I will be the first to say it was a glaring omission.  For one thing, people pitching stories or lodging complaints (sometimes legitimate) had no simple way to find out which reporters on our staff covered what, which editors managed them or whom to contact about specific topics. Oftentimes pitches would go to the wrong reporter or editor and get lost in the shuffle as messages were routed and rerouted within the team.  “CoinDesk is a black box,” one industry executive complained to us last summer, and not without some justification. That’s certainly not what we want to be. We’re aiming to be more accessible and transparent, and in the coming weeks we’ll be taking additional steps to realize these goals. All CoinDesk, reporters and editors will clearly list the easiest methods of communication in their bios.  Most urgently, we’re also hoping to take the knees out from the scammers impersonating us on Telegram, LinkedIn and potentially other social media platforms. As we previously reported, bad actors have been approaching projects offering the chance to be featured on CoinDesk if they pay a few hundred dollars in crypto.  Sometimes bad actors go as far to copy pages from our site wholesale or send real-looking (but nonetheless fake) newsletters as a way to make their scams seem legitimate. Don't fall for it – the only CoinDesk is at coindesk.com, and referring to our masthead will ensure you're connecting with the right people.  We’ve said it before but it bears repeating: CoinDesk journalists will NEVER accept payment for an article. Anyone who makes such an offer is masquerading as one of us, hoping to take advantage of you.  But now we’ve made it a lot easier to contact us. On this page you’ll find our reporters and editors, the areas they specifically cover and their email, Twitter and Telegram handles. You can click through to their bios for additional information.  This is just the start. In 2020, as we continue our reporting in a space riddled with hype and histrionics, we will make it a priority to be as transparent as possible. You'll see greater efforts to engage with our audiences, online and offline, and invite you to connect with us and air your concerns or questions.  In the meantime, you can continue pitching CoinDesk reporters stories by emailing them directly or contacting news@coindesk.com. Usually, it’s best to contact a reporter about a story within his or her beat directly, and a concise email explaining the project’s background and detailing the news will be more likely to receive an immediate response.  This official masthead for CoinDesk may not be as immutable as a blockchain, but at least now there's something official for guidance on who we are.

42383384,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOYh,1582905010,Ethereum's DAOs Continue to Gain Momentum,"Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are back – at least for dogfooding purposes.      Ethereum’s largest hackathon in North America, ETHDenver, showcased DAOs for event management and more. From coordinating the hackathon’s winners to purchasing meals at Capitol Hill food trucks in Denver’s historic Capitol Hill neighborhood, DAOs ran ETHDenver.      Even the winning hackathon team was a DAO: Coz, a project aimed at being more efficient at distributing aid than non-profits, won the hackathon and $3,000 worth of DAI.      Through interviews conducted with multiple teams at ETHDenver earlier this month, it became apparent that this isn’t 2016’s DAO, (the hacked smart contract that ultimately split the blockchain into ethereum (ETH) and ethereum classic (ETC)).      Although use-cases remained limited in scope, DAO proponents are focusing on the inherent challenges of decentralized coordination with more caution this time around the block. If ETHDenver 2019’s focus on DeFi was an early indicator of that sector’s growth, DAOs could be much more prominent in 12 months’ time.    MetaCartel    Just like the first DAO, many are still about funding open source development for the ethereum network.      MolochDAO, a fairly simple protocol that allows limited groups of friends to pool collective funds for issuing Eth 2.0 money grants, was the face of 2019. Launched in March 2019, the DAO stripped the idea to the basics and raised funds from big-wigs such as ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin.      MetaCartel, a similar concept, followed in May 2019 and showcased its product at ETHDenver.      As Axia Labs Founder and MetaCartel member James Waugh told CoinDesk in an interview, MetaCartel is an experiment on social signaling in the ethereum community compared to Moloch’s focus on Eth 2.0 (the next iteration of the ethereum blockchain based on the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm).      MetaCartel focuses on ethereum values and rewards teams that hold similar values in turn. Although the group’s treasury is small, a vote of confidence behind MetaCartel grants holds merit, particularly given the size of the ethereum community, Waugh said      “The social signal we are able to give when we give a grant is the important piece. If we lose that, then there’s $200,000 in a multi-sig [wallet]. That’s not that interesting. But a functional social signal behind the $200,000 in the multi-sig is really interesting.”      Moreover, it's not about who's in the group but what values the group has chosen to share and act upon, Waugh said. It's hard to disagree with MetaCartel’s vision given the community's oft-criticized devotion to certain founders.      “The experiment isn’t meant to blow something up. It's meant to be small, strategic, prove the experiment and move on from there,” Waugh said. “Signal is 10x the capital.”    DAOstack    It’s not all crowdsourcing apps, though, said DAOstack events manager Felipe Duarte.      A 15-year community organizer hailing from Brazil, Duarte said DAOs are quickly evolving into social organizations that add value to society.      For him, DAOs are akin to the biological. Take bacteria floating in water, he said, which lack direction and purpose when unconstrained. The right limitations spur action, however.      “If you get a container and start approximating the walls, there’s an optimum moment when the bacteria start following in predictable patterns. They form streams of movement that you could put a nano-turbine in and make energy just out of the desire of bacteria to do something,” Duarte said.      DAOstack founded DAOfest, an event team that conducts dozens of DAO community gatherings around the globe based on the Genesis DAO protocol. Duarte said Genesis DAOs can have up to 350 people working within them, identifying problems while working within group guidelines.      Luke Weber, co-founder of Caribbean Blockchain Network, said he has used the tech to organize social-impact events such as beach clean-ups, bringing together people who otherwise would not know each other or have an incentive to confront a community need.      “This, for me, is the perfect metaphor of what the DAOfest is: Trying to find the optimum point between narrowness of focus and space for self-expression,” Duarte said.      Lou Kerner, co-founder and CEO of community VC firm CryptoOracle, said DAOs take out the middleman and solve collective problems for the community.      When asked if Genesis and DAOstack are overpromised, Kerner deferred to Amara’s Law.      “The impact of all new technologies is overestimated in the short run and underestimated in the long run. That will be DAOs. People got very excited and then it broke. That’s what the internet was,” he said.    Legalize it    While ETHDenver’s BuffiDAO, Coz, MetaCartel and DAOstack are looking to overturn the negative stereotype associated with DAOs, one is running headlong into the problem: OpenLaw’s LAO.      First announced at ETHBerlin 2019, the ConsenSys-backed OpenLaw told the ETHDenver crowd it intends to raise $2.5 million for a new DAO venture fund it describes as similar to a limited liability company (LLC).      In a phone interview with CoinDesk, OpenLaw CEO Aaron Wright said the firm has worked hard to address the legal questions presented by the first DAO.      Even before the DAO split the ethereum community in half, the legality of pooling investor funds into a smart contract was questioned. OpenLaw has taken the concerns seriously, having the code audited and seeking legal consultation from multiple outside firms, said Wright.      “What we were able to do is wrap all of this in legally binding agreements. We solved both the security issues related to the original DAO and also the legal issues,” said Wright.      Wright said the firm will continue to spin up LAOs as driven by consumer demand.      The benefits of democratized decision-making with VC funding remains to be seen, however. As crypto lawyer Preston Byrne told CoinDesk at the LAO’s Berlin announcement, the physical benefits of such a financial structure are highly dubious.      “The ‘DAO’ here is not modeled after an LLC. It is an LLC,” he said at the time. “As an investment vehicle for venture funding, I do not find the structure particularly compelling or better for investors than existing methods.

42383382,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOWB,1582902922,Microsoft Updates Edge Browser to Protect Against Illicit Crypto Miners,"With malicious cryptocurrency miners having proliferated over the internet in the last two years, Microsoft has moved to protect users of its Edge web browser from the effects of the malicious software.      In a blog post on Thursday, the tech giant said it had enabled a feature that will spot and prevent the download of ""potentially unwanted applications"" (PUAs) such as cryptojackers or adware.      Cryptojackers utilize code hidden on websites or downloaded onto users' devices to harness computer processing power to mine cryptocurrencies.      Microsoft explained it added the feature after users complained that when downloading free software from the internet, they often had apps ""with a poor reputation"" being installed at the same time.      The new feature – available in Edge versions from 80.0.338.0 on – is off by default, but can be switched on in the Privacy and Services settings panel.      As Microsoft said, PUAs like miners can slow a user's computer. They can also lead to excessive fan noise and overheating while they steal victim's electricity to carry out mining tasks in the background.      While users complained of free software sites being laden with cryptojackers, they can find their way into apparently legitimate sources too. A year ago, eight Windows apps on the Microsoft Store were discovered by Symantec to be hosting a version of Coinhive, a commonly deployed script for mining the monero (XMR) cryptocurrency. The apps were removed from the site after Microsoft was alerted.      A report from Skybox Security in 2018 said crypto mining malware had overtaken ransomware as the cybercriminal's weapon of choice. The firm's figures suggested cryptojacking comprised 32 percent of all cyberattacks at the time.      Referring to its new miner blocking feature, Microsoft said: ""Our goal is to assist users in getting the apps they want, while empowering them to maintain control over their devices and experiences.""",POSITIVE,XMR,MINING | TECHNOLOGY | XMR,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/28/microsoft-updates-edge-browser-to-protect-against-illicit-crypto-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/44d9b472db76d58375f193b2bcafd43d1d33f799-1500x1005.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In a company video released Thursday, Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz said Ripple is working on ""exciting"" new features to broaden the ledger's functionality and allow third-party users to introduce other cryptocurrencies into the XRP ecosystem.      Although Schwartz did not go into detail on what exactly the new features are, he did say they could be used for launching fixed-value tokens on XRP Ledger. ""Stablecoins is the obvious use case, but it's not just stablecoins it's essentially assets pegged to some external value,"" he said.      Similar features exist on other blockchains, most notably Tether, which runs stablecoin layers on multiple networks simultaneously. But Schwartz said asset-backed tokens on XRP would have ""guaranteed"" liquidity because of the ledger's mechanics.      Schwartz previously outlined how a fully collateralized XRP stablecoin could be liquid on his Youtube channel last October. Rather than creating separate markets for each and every digital asset, trades take place in XRP so the stablecoin remains liquid irrespective of its popularity, he explained.      This wouldn't be the first time Ripple has made forays outside of its core settlement business. The company's investment arm, Xpring, acquired decentralized payments platform Logos Network in September. At the time Xpring's senior vice president told CoinDesk the acquisition would help Ripple create financial products on XRP Ledger.      During Thursday's video, Schwartz said Ripple had explored additional use cases before, further suggesting the ledger already has some un-utilized functionalities built into it.      In the ""early days,"" Schwartz said, the engineering team ""started to realize the properties of the algorithms we'd developed allowed us to do things, like a decentralized exchange.""      These had already been put into ""a functional system"" sometime in mid-2012 and included a feature allowing users to issue their own digital assets, he said.

In an email statement, Al Giangregorio – unit chief at the HSI's National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center (BCSC) – shed a little light on the mysterious intel program first mentioned in ICE’s recent FY 2021 budget proposalhttps://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/7_u.s._immigration_and_customs_enforcement.pdf. Without explaining exactly what CIP is or how it works, he said it helps HSI agents whenever cryptocurrency is involved.    “The CIP supports any HSI investigation involving virtual currency or blockchain technology,"" Giangregorio said. ""The program has assisted diverse investigations, including those involving methamphetamine and MDMA dealers, human trafficking, elder fraud, darknet market drug vendors, child sexual exploitation sites and, of course, trafficking in opioids.”      CIP was established by the BSCS, a Vermont-based outpost of the sprawling homeland security apparatus that slowly rose in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The 2001 PATRIOT act criminalized international cash smuggling; the financial crimes-focused BCSC helps ICE’s HSI agents track violators down.      Cryptocurrency was not an legitimate threat when BCSC incorporated in 2009. In the years since, though, crypto has grown into a more prominent criminal vehicle, prompting many federal law enforcement agencies to invest hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars into private-sector investigatory tools.      “Over time, the BCSC has recognized that transnational criminal organizations have evolved and diversified the way they transfer illicit proceeds,” he said.      The increasing shift to digital money also prompted HSI’s anti-cash smuggling experts to build the government the in-house program, according to Giangregorio.      “The BCSC established the CIP to adapt to changing methodologies and technology to target money laundering related to all types of criminal activity,” he added.      Taken in the context of ICE’s FY 2021 budget proposal, Giangregorio’s explanation gives something of a backstory to the otherwise unknown CIP.      The budget proposal described CIP as an unlicensed money services business identifier that crawls across illicit crypto-broker hotspots – peer-to-peer sites, darknet markets, classifieds – to gather intelligence.      It is not known publicly how much CIP cost to establish or run. However, a previous CoinDesk investigation found ICE was one of the largest spenders on blockchain forensic services in the federal government.

42383378,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOSP,1582891325,Coinbase Is Testing Clearview's Controversial Facial Recognition Technology,"Coinbase is among more than 2,000 entities from around the world working with Clearview, a controversial facial recognition technology provider.      Internal documents obtained by BuzzFeed revealed New York-based Clearview AI – a startup facing legal threats from Apple and Google as well as calls for greater scrutiny into its practices – had already shared or sold its technology to roughly 2,200 companies and authorities around the world.      Clearview's software trawls websites and social media platforms to scrape data and match images posted online to persons of interest. Coinbase was among the organizations that had used the software for at least one search, BuzzFeed reported Thursday.      A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed in the article the exchange had tested Clearview's software regarding its ""unique needs around security and compliance,"" but added customer data had not been used in any of its tests.      The exchange tested Clearview AI ""to see if the service could meaningfully bolster our efforts to protect employees and offices against physical threats and investigate fraud,"" the spokesperson said. It hasn't yet committed to using the product, they said.      Coinbase has previously faced criticism about how it deals with user privacy. Last March the exchange had to clarify it it did not sell user data days after its director of institutional sales said a previous analytics provider sold ""customer data to outside sources."" Coinbase had just acquired an analytics firm linked to governments with human rights abuses.    Client claims    Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That previously claimed his company's software was ""strictly for law enforcement"" and, in a statement to BuzzFeed, added it was focused primarily on the U.S. and Canada.      Among Clearview's largest clients are officials from various U.S. regulators. According to the documents, the Department of Homeland Security has registered for more than 280 accounts, with the Secret Service conducting some 5,600 searches.      Yet, Clearview's clients also come from the world of banking and include Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Although a BoA spokesperson said the bank had never been a Clearview client, documents show it had used the software for more than 1,900 searches.      Many clients are also based abroad, including law enforcement agencies across Europe and Asia, as well as entities such as the sovereign wealth fund of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Many had taken advantage of free trials that allow unlimited searches within a 30-day period.      Clearview attorney Tor Ekeland told BuzzFeed there are ""numerous inaccuracies in this illegally obtained information"" and declined to provide any further comment.      In early February, Google, Youtube and Facebook sent Clearview cease and desist orders for scraping images from their platforms. In an interview with CBS News, Ton-That said it was his First Amendment right to collect photos held in the public space.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/28/coinbase-is-testing-clearviews-controversial-facial-recognition-technology,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ac3d722d36e9b5dd1f8c83f7bd9f3422e611cb7-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42383390,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9vOez,1582889654,Bitcoin Closes on First February Price Loss Since 2014,"Bitcoin is close to ending February on a negative note for the first time in six years.      The biggest cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $8,625, representing a 7.5 percent drop from the opening price of $9,339 seen on Feb. 1, according to Bitstamp data. The global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, is also down over 7 percent on a month-to-date basis.      If the loss is held through Feb. 29, it would be the first February decline since 2014. Back then, the cryptocurrency had tanked by 31.5 percent.    Bitcoin has printed gains in February in six out of the last eight years.  The 31.5 percent slide seen in 2014 is the biggest February drop on record. Meanwhile, the biggest February gain of 63.9 percent was registered in 2013.    Bitcoin was widely expected to put on a good show in February, having confirmed a bull breakout with a 30 percent rise in January amid the U.S. Iran tensions and coronavirus fears.      The cryptocurrency did gain altitude in the first two weeks of February, rising to a multi-month high of $10,500 on Feb. 13. Buyers, however, lost impetus in the third week, allowing a pullback to $9,300. What looked like a healthy correction has ended up paving the way for a stronger sell-off to one-month lows near $8,500 earlier this week.      The price drop has invalidated the short-term bullish case, as discussed Thursday, and has poured cold water over the safe-haven argument. Bitcoin failed to draw bids this week despite the coronavirus-led slide in the equity markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 1,200 points on Thursday, confirming its worst four-day performance since the 2008 financial crisis.      Even so, there is some consensus in the market the bullish trend of 2020 is not over yet, according to glassnode insights. The blockchain intelligence firm said in its weekly research note:    ""The present low MVRV Z-Score suggests that BTC is still undervalued, with significantly more room to grow before reaching the next market top. This provides support for many analysts’ predictions that bitcoin will stay above $8,000 for the time being.""    The market value to realized value (MVRV) Z-score measures the deviation between bitcoin’s realized value and market value to identify periods where the cryptocurrency is extremely overvalued or undervalued.      The ratio currently stands at 0.52, that is, well below the red band, which usually indicates market tops. So, there is room to rally, as suggested by glassnode.      Also, in the past bitcoin has set a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of reward halving, but before the event.      If history is a guide, bitcoin may yet rise above the June 2019 high of $13,880 ahead of the May 2020 halving, setting a new cycle top from the bear market low of $3,122 reached in December 2018. Considering the current situation, however, that may look a tall order for the bulls.      CoinDCX exchange CEO Sumit Gupta is staying positive, though.      ""While the price of bitcoin in February 2020 has witnessed some fluctuation, what's more, important is fundamental of bitcoin is stronger than ever with hash-rate of 111 Ehash/sec,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Many developments are taking place on top of the bitcoin network; one of the most noteworthy development is the growth in the lightning network solution.""      As such, Gupta regards the current situation as ""a blip in the larger scheme of things.""      While there are reasons to believe bitcoin will regain its mojo sometime soon, the technical charts are currently painting a bearish picture.    Daily chart    The head-and-shoulders breakdown seen on the daily chart indicates the path of least resistance is to the downside.      The convincing break below $9,075 (Feb. 4 low) has invalidated the bullish higher-lows pattern created in the seven weeks to Feb. 14.      Also suggesting scope for further losses, the 14-day relative strength index is hovering in bear territory below 50, while the MACD histogram is printing a deeper bar below the zero for the fifth straight day.    3-day chart    The MACD histogram has crossed below zero on the three-day chart, signaling a bearish shift in momentum. The indicator has turned bearish for the first time since December, validating the preceding big red marubozu candle.      A red marubozu candle comprises a big body and small or no shadows. The candle indicates sellers were in control from the session's open to its close and is reflective of strong bearish sentiment.      All in all, the odds appear stacked in favor of deeper declines toward the immediate support at $8,213 (Jan. 24 low).      If prices print a UTC close above $8,974 on Friday, the seller indecision signaled by Thursday’s doji candle would be confirmed. That would open the doors for a re-test of the former support-turned-hurdle of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline, currently at $9,462.      The short-term bearish case would be invalidated only if prices find acceptance above the neckline resistance.

OKEx, which says it is based in Malta, has apparently suffered two attacks, one Thursday and one Friday, according to its CEO, Jay Hao. On his Weibo account Friday, Hao said the first attack was of a 200 gigabyte severity, but the second had doubled to 400 GB.      Despite the attacks, the exchange's service is ""largely unaffected,"" he said. OKEx's Twitter account has no warnings of interruptions this morning, apart from a brief interlude for a systems upgrade for its futures and options trading facility.      Apparently more severely affected is Bitfinex, which reported a suspected DDoS attack on Twitter Friday morning (UTC time).      The Hong Kong-headquartered platform's trading services were offline for a period of under an hour, but at press time Bitfinex says services are back to normal.      Bitfinex Chief Technology Officer Paulo Ardoino told CoinDesk later that the ""attacker tried to concurrently exploit several platform features to increase load in the infrastructure.""      ""We use a variety of different prevention mechanisms to guard against such a Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. Still, the huge number of different IP addresses used and the sophisticated crafting of the requests towards our API v1 exploited an internal inefficiency in one of our non-core process queues,"" Ardoino explained.      With the need to react quickly to avert an escalation in damage, the exchange took the decision to go into maintenance. The CTO said it was ""not due to the inability of the platform to resist, rather it was a decision taken in order to quickly bring in the countermeasures and patch for all similar attacks.""      A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm the hosting servers of an online service, using a flood of fake traffic from multiple computers to disrupt normal activity. A severe attack can take a service offline, or may cause slow responses for website users.      It's not clear why two major exchanges have been targeted in this way at roughly the same time, or what the attackers hope to gain.

The Netherlands-based firm said in a blog post the blockchain can offer ways to automate bureaucratic tasks associated with workforce recruitment by handling the ""nuts and bolts"" of day-to-day recruitment activities, making the entire process more efficient.      A recent study conducted by Randstad found that distributed ledger technology (DLT) provided a means to securely preserve customers' personal data while enabling the verification of academic and professional qualifications, as well as birth dates, addresses and IDs, of prospective talent.      The initiative aims to match appropriate candidates with companies seeking immediate role fulfillment such as healthcare services requiring emergency staff after a disease outbreak, without compromising on privacy.      Cypherium CEO Sky Guo told CoinDesk recently clients did not have to store all the data centrally using the network and could employ a database extractor to preserve their privacy.      ""If a job candidate wants to prove that he has the grades and diploma, what they need to do is provide the hash of the diploma and the employer can verify that hash with the hash of the university,"" Guo said.      Cypherium is a blockchain infrastructure platform, specializing in smart contracts, based on a hybrid concept marrying proof-of-work and HotStuff, a relatively new consensus protocol that has been adopted by the Facebook-initiated Libra project.      Google Cloud's G Suite would further offer Randstad a means to monitor and build its human resource platform without the need to maintain and manage its own cloud system.      Frank van der Bijl, global collaboration manager at Randstad, said that a blend of Google Cloud's services and the Cypherium blockchain provide the company with a faster and easier way to verify and match appropriate workforce talent.      “Google Cloud and G Suite already free us from some manual verification tasks, and we plan to use Cypherium’s blockchain to hand off even more,” Bijl said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/02/28/human-resources-giant-randstad-explores-blockchain-to-quickly-match-talent-with-recruiters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fcfde47fed56cf49f854716d04fe9287e0bf93f4-1000x668.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
