42376548,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsRD,1371500566,Avalon accused of mining with customer ASICs,"Avalon, a maker of bitcoin ASICs, has been accused, on the Bitcoin Forum, of using its products to mine bitcoins before shipping to customers. The controversy came to light after a customer of the company reported having examined the configuration of his/her mining devices, and described one as being in a dusty condition and configured to contribute to coins to a bitcoin pool.  Furthermore, after querying the blockchain with the address stored in the ASIC under question, it was found that the device had paid to a bitcoin address that, on April 22, had received a total of 716.40851602 BTC.  According to other forum users, at least one other ASIC company (ASICMiner) openly mines with equipment that has been paid for by customers prior to shipping. If this is the standard form of business and all companies were open about the situation, at least miners would be informed as to what was going on, regardless of how acceptable they found the situation. However, Avalon's Yifu Guo has publicly denied this practice (see here on YouTube), which casts a different light on the contrary evidence.  This raises an important question. Electronic hardware needs to be tested. However, in the realm of consumer technology, it is impractical to test all devices, and so testing is conducted on representative samples. In the case of bitcoin miners, it would seem that companies are test-running every single product.  It could be argued that these are for real-world, ""burn in"" tests. However, the companies can potentially profit from using items that legally belong to the customer. Furthermore, as more coins are mined, the difficulty level of the cryptographic calculations required to mine more coins increases, which arguably devalues the equipment being purchased.  Clearly, more information is needed and we'll report on any information we receive.  Have you received an ASIC miner with suspicious configurations? Please let us know in the comments.

42376536,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsH9,1371473731,"Top nine bitcoin tweets - June 10-17, 2013","Here's a look at the top Bitcoin tweets from the past week, from price checking to BTC prefixes and miner development to the staying power of digital currency.  1. Bitcoin price check      Here's a cool and instant way to check the bitcoin price in USD. http://t.co/K6eaFYwGjK    — BitCoin News (@BTCNews247) June 17, 2013    If you're looking for a quick and easy way to check the price of bitcoins in dollars, then Alternapost can help you. The bespoke page, linked via Reddit, gives a minimalist design with the price in large characters. No fuss, no complicated stats. The page can show the price of Litecoin (LTC) and Peer-to-Peer coin (PPC). You could add this to your browser bookmarks, or if you're on iOS, add it as a shortcut directly to your homescreen.  2. Prefixes    So...where's the switch to mBTC??? http://t.co/7pVQrAXCHC via @Reddit — Bitcoin Reddit Bot (@RedditBTC) June 16, 2013            An interesting discussion appeared on Reddit asking when people would start referring to fractions of BTC with prefixes just as milli-bitcoin (mBTC) or nano-bitcoin (uBTC). Given that bitcoins cost around $100 (USD), the relation to everyday items is in on a different scale to what most people are accustomed to. In order to express BTC in equivalent value, we therefore have to talk about small fractions of bitcoins. As such, it may make more sense to buy a cup of coffee in nano-bitcoins rather than expressing prices to six decimal places where most of the digits are leading zeros.  3. World War Three    Will the next World War be bitcoin-based? https://t.co/OE9w3yESh5 #bitcoin      — Bitcoin Info (@bitcoininfo) June 16, 2013    The topic of discussion on the Bitcoin Forum appears to occasionally move into contemplating World War Three. The discussion linked above was redirected to here in which there was lots of colorful discussion. However, one serious point brought out applies just as much to uprisings in the Middle Eastern as it does to world wars ... that is, the dependency of digital currencies on a functioning internet. If part of the internet is down, then some miners can't verify transactions and the blockchain cannot be synchronized across the whole world.  4. Used miners    Avalon is officially mining with customers' ASICS before delivering them. http://t.co/BgpsA57Cth via @Reddit — Bitcoin Reddit Bot (@RedditBTC) June 17, 2013            A post on Reddit comes from a user, mrtuber, reporting that his Avalon ASIC miners had been used to mine coins before they had been dispatched out to him. From the analysis in the Bitcoin Forum post (linked from Reddit), it is suggested that the mining has been done for ""burning"" testing, rather than as part of a continuous mining operation. However, it raises a serious ethical question as to whether such companies should be able to keep coins mined from testing devices that have been sold or whether any coins mined during testing should be sent to the customer.  5. Staying power    Bitcoin still sticks around http://t.co/7TyPvEClYp      — BitCoin News (@BTCNews247) June 16, 2013    We have an editorial, shared via Reddit, which sings the praises of Bitcoin's staying power, especially in the light of hacking attacks and associations with illegal activities. It goes on to give case studies of how ordinary people are slowly starting to use bitcoins. The story goes on to look at how the Bitcoin community is weathering the storm of US government hostility.  6. Miner development    bASIC BFL Miner Development (4 Chips) https://t.co/XJOBQX8YGQ #bitcoin — Bitcoin Info (@bitcoininfo) June 16, 2013            On the Bitcoin Forum, a user -- allten -- posted photos of the development of his ASIC mining rig. He will be using four ASIC chips cooled by an off-the-shelf CPU air-cooled heat sink and fan. However, he says the system could be expanded to eight ASIC chips with the use of a customized water block. That is, instead of an air-cooled radiator, an eight-chip heat-sink would have water continuously pumped through it to get rid of excess heat.  7. Starbucks urged to get on board    Let's get Starbucks to accept Bitcoin ! http://t.co/UAVeLBGiNo via @Reddit      — Bitcoin Reddit Bot (@RedditBTC) June 16, 2013    The next tweet isn't news, but a case of wishful thinking. Users of reddit have been expressing their wishes for Starbucks to accept payment in bitcoins. Regular patrons of the ubiquitous coffee shop will know that it possible to buy credit with the company, with which food and drink can be purchased. Furthermore, there is a smartphone app that presents a barcode that can be scanned by a sales assistant to complete a transaction. Bitcoin users make payments in a similar way by scanning QR codes. Therefore, one could argue that Starbucks already has at least the customer-facing infrastructure in place.  8. Hardware use post-bitcoin    If Bitcoin dies... what could I do with 50 GPUs? https://t.co/x0TmWSIhRC #bitcoin — Bitcoin Info (@bitcoininfo) June 16, 2013            Another contemplative thread over on the Bitcoin Forum looks at what miners would use their hardware for if Bitcoin were ever to ""die"" or otherwise fall into disuse. While this may not be something that's going to happen any time soon, it raises an interesting point about how much computing power is being amassed that could be put to more altruistic purposes, such as the Folding@home medical research program.  9. Bitcoin hits Miami    Miami's first physical vendor to take bitcoin http://t.co/L2J6qrkvB2 via @Reddit      — Bitcoin Reddit Bot (@RedditBTC) June 16, 2013      Finally, Reddit user SoBeHax reports that a Miami coffee shop, Planet Linux Caffe (their spelling), will soon be accepting payment in bitcoins. If true, this would reportedly make it the first business in Miami to accept bitcoins. From the business's website, we could not verify the claim on the Reddit post. However, the coffee shop will soon be hosting two bitcoin events, which -- if you're in the Miami area -- would be interesting to check out.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,BTC | BUSINESS | LTC | MINING | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/17/top-nine-bitcoin-tweets-june-10-17-2013,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ffd7d8c5bf901ef74a36c11bf931676ed17f9956-460x276.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376542,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsFt,1371464338,Mt. Gox publishes ad in G8 magazine,"Mt. Gox has published a full-page advert in the official magazine associated with the G8 Summit as the event begins today.  The advert in G8 Research Group’s magazinehttp://www.newsdeskmedia.com/files/G8-UK-2013.pdf is a simple sketch that depicts a boardroom discussion between different currencies inviting Bitcoin to the table saying: “Come in and join us.”  The statement on the advert reads:  These days it seems like everyone is talking about Bitcoin, the digital currency that is revolutionising the way people think about money, trade and transparency. Mt. Gox offers a secure and reliable multi-currency exchange so you can trade with the entire world in your local currency. Now isn’t that something worth talking about?  Mt. Gox  republished the ad on Facebook and said:  The 2013 G8 conference is kicking into gear from today, and global leaders are discussing economic issues that affect us all. To get the message out, a couple of months ago we took a big step and bought a full page ad for Bitcoin right in the middle of the G8 Research Group's official magazine with a link to a special landing page.  User feedback varied from one who said:  “Ambitious, these countries would soon see Bitcoin destroyed if they found a way...""  To another who said: ""Their verification process takes far to long before anything can happen and they still owe a lot of people money.""

42376533,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AsDN,1371456799,Could hackers turn your TV into a zombie bitcoin miner?,"Could attackers make your web browser mine for bitcoins? How about your TV? Security flaws in some systems might make it possible, say experts.  German researchers have discovered a flaw in Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) television sets that could allow an attacker to run malicious code, including bitcoin miners, says one report.  These devices are among a growing number of Smart TVs, always connected to the Internet and accessing online services in addition to digital TV, to improve the viewing experience. The research was carried out by Marco Ghiglieri, Florian Oswald and Erik Tews of the Technical University of Darmstadt. Martin Herfurt from Germany consultancy Nruns also explored the Samsung TVs in question. They were found to have flaws that would allow attackers to inject their own content.  This has happened before with other Samsung TVs. Some believe that it is possible to run bitcoin miners on hacked devices such as these.  “It is completely possible, and some Smart TVs have been hacked remotely,” said cryptography and security expert Sergio Lerner, CEO of Argentinian company Certimix, who is involved in testing security flaws in the Bitcoin protocol.  SC Magazine’s report argues that a browser-based JavaScript miner, such as Bitcoin Plus, could be used to manipulate smart TV browsers into mining for coins. This software uses a link to a remote JavaScript file, contained in code that can be embedded into any web page (there’s also a Wordpress plugin). Computers visiting a page with the code will be persuaded to start mining the coins, sending them to the page owner’s address.  We have seen others using the idea of embedded JavaScript to ‘steal’ CPU power from visiting computers. One savvy team of programmers has created Smidge, a technology that divides problems between lots of computers visiting a single web site. They’re using it to solve chess problems now, but a web-based distributed bitcoin miner surely can’t be far away, says one.  Using lots of computers to do your bidding without consent is known as botherding - and a network of these zombie machines is called a botnet. Perhaps we should call the same technique for mining bitcoins bitherding. And such a network would be a bitnet.  “I assume you can use pretty much any system and any hardware to mine bitcoins, it's just a matter of efficiency,” says Claudio Guarnieri, a researcher at security firm Rapid7, who has explored bitnets such as Skynet in the past. These generally involve malware placed on a machine, whereas these ‘attacks’ use JavaScript not to install any malware, but simply to have the victim do some free computation.  The problem with bitherding using CPU power is that you just need so much of it, points out Guarnieri, disagreeing with Nadolny. “Both the cases that you specified are interesting hacks, but they will never be a profitable way to mine Bitcoins: using JavaScript would just be too slow.”  Skynet had between 150,000 and 200,000 hosts, and that was relatively successful, he said. Lerner agrees. “A Smart TV would be a very slow Bitcoin miner and you will need a thousands TVs to earn something meaningful. Not a good source of income,” he asserts.  It would be very slow. An Intel Core2 Duo will deliver around 2.5Megahashes/sec, meaning that you’d need to have 240 of those users visit your site to equal the hash rate of an AMD 7970.  That said, it isn’t outside the realm of possibility to control a GPU with a web page, upping the computing power. WebGL, the web-based graphics language designed for high-performance online graphics, has been used to create hardware-accelerated examples.  You might have more of a chance making this work with a Scrypt-based currency, which is CPU and GPU friendly, and many of which have a lower hash rate. Feathercoin’s current normal hash rate is around 660 Megahashes/sec, making those 240 CPUs far more tractable.  That assumes that these unwitting visitors are not doing anything else with their computer, and stay on your web site. But then, how do you get people to stay on the page? You’d need sustained, constant hit rates, with people keeping the page open, to make the mining work. That’s fine if you’re enlisting a bunch of volunteers (in which case, it isn’t a bitnet, it’s a community). Less so if you’re trying to deceive people into browser-based mining.  You’d need to embed this on a very popular site, and if you’re the type of person to bitherd anyway, you’d probably just infect visitors’ computers with a drive-by download, so that you could have them mine unwittingly even when they’re off the site.  The most appropriate way to mount a bitherding attack would be to compromise a machine directly and have it use its GPU, agrees Guarnieri. “There are tons of botnets dropping bitcoin miners, in most cases they actually just embed a legitimate mining client like the Ufasoft one,” he says.  Alternatively, you’d target gaming-optimised systems that would be more likely to have the kinds of graphics-friendly software well known for high hash rates. This is exactly what the E-Sports Entertainment Association (EASA) did, when it embeddedhttp://paritynews.com/web-news/item/1034-esea-league-stuffed-bitcoin-mining-code-inside-client-software bitcoin mining software inside its client software – allegedly as an April fool’s prank - and irritated its users. The client was designed to stop other players cheating while you were playing online games, but the firm included the bitcoin mining code as a covert extra, before pulling the patch some weeks later in response to user complaints.  In short, then, hacking TVs to mine bitcoins, or maliciously deceiving computers into mining them simply by visiting a web site, is a specious proposition. There are far easier ways to covertly strongarm people into mining your coins for you. But if you wanted to marshall a team of non-technical volunteers into knowingly mining Scrypt-based currencies for a good cause, that idea may just have legs.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | RESEARCH,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/06/17/could-hackers-turn-your-tv-into-a-zombie-bitcoin-miner,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d85fefda8a57940a7d58a039f3948b0941661527-1450x780.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
