42385474,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22Mr,1609365771,Serbia Legalizes Digital Assets Trading and Issuance,"In a reversal of previous policy, the Serbian government will now permit the issuance and trading of digital assets and related services under a law that went into effect Dec. 29.      The draft law was announced in October and local media reported the law was passed by the nation's legislators in late November. The “Digital Asset Law” officially went into effect Tuesday following its publication in the official gazette, and will be applied six months from now.      Under the new specifications, digital asset service providers in Serbia can operate after “obtaining permission from the supervisory authority.” The country’s Securities Commission and the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) are tasked with supervision and applying the law.      Serbia was not always friendly towards crypto. In 2014, the NBS declared that bitcoin was not legal tender in the country.      The new law comes at a time when Eastern European countries, including Romania and Bulgaria, are expanding their tech industries. Serbia is experiencing a tech boom, with the industry accounting for more than 6% of the country’s GDP.      With the new rules, digital assets can be issued in Serbia with or without an approved white paper, though an asset with an unapproved white paper cannot be advertised in the country and there are limitations on the amount of such assets that can be distributed.      When it comes to trading, digital asset exchanges will need licenses to operate, according to the new law. Secondary trading of digital assets issued in Serbia (with an approved white paper), over-the-counter (OTC) trading and use of smart contracts in secondary trading are also allowed.      The provisions of the new law do not apply to digital transactions that are carried out within a limited network of people accepting digital assets “as a form of loyalty or reward, without possibilities of its transfer or sale.” The law also doesn’t apply to miners, who are permitted to acquire digital assets by mining, according to the law.      Read more: Paxful, Turkey-Based BiLira, Cointral to Expand Crypto Offerings in Eastern Europe      However, financial institutions under the supervision of the NSB are still prohibited from engaging with digital assets except in keeping cryptographic keys. They cannot convert their assets to virtual currencies or “instruments associated with digital assets,” provide services related to digital assets or participate in businesses offering such services.

Gaining 7.3% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $26,796.90 to $28,969.90 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC above its 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Another day, another all-time high in bitcoin as the cryptocurrency changed hands as high as $28,969.90, according to data compiled by the CoinDesk 20.      Bitcoin's price began its upswing at around 17:00 UTC (12:00 p.m. ET) Tuesday and barely let up, taking off from $26,400 to the brink of $29,000 in just 26 hours.      According to analyst Alex Krüger, action in the bond market spurred gains in cryptocurrencies. ""Rates came off in the 48 hours leading to yesterday's [Tuesday's] pump,"" he told CoinDesk. On Monday, the U.S. 10-year bond yielded 0.950%. By Wednesday afternoon, it was 0.926%.      Calling Wednesday's action a ""strong market,"" Chris Thomas, head of digital asset at Swissquote, said bitcoin's price was ""being pushed higher by retail flows. We have seen a few [institutional investors] but not too many,"" adding that ""most are on holiday until next Monday.""      And while Thomas said he had expected the market to trade sideway this week, ""the fact that it has moved higher to me suggests we may see a short-term pullback,"" he said.      Read more: Bitcoin Prices in 2020: Here’s What Happened      ""Bitcoin is extending its parabolic uptrend after gapping up at the start of the holiday week,"" said technical analyst Katie Stockton, managing partner at Fairlead Strategies. ""The rally has no new signs of exhaustion from an overbought/oversold perspective, and there is no resistance left to hold back bitcoin.""      Similar to Swissquote's Thomas, Stockton warns a pullback is possible and, should it happen, ""the gap from Monday is likely to be filled in an abrupt reversal.""      Meanwhile, a string of bad news hit XRP as more exchanges announced halts in trading the cryptocurrency U.S. regulators claim is a security. Genesis, owned by CoinDesk parent company DCG, announced it was suspending trading and lending in XRP. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is also suspending XRP trading for its customers, effective Jan. 13. The token was down 3.5% in the 24 hours leading up to publication time.    Trader eyes $5,000 ETH by September    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up sharply Friday and trading around $750. That marks a 3.5% gain in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Despite hitting a multi-year high, trading on ether was lighter than average Wednesday. Just $618 million worth of ether was traded on the eight exchanges tracked in the CoinDesk 20 compared to the previous seven-day average of $726 million.      Yet, at least one trader has sights set on an astounding rally in the months ahead. On Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, someone bought 153 contracts of September 2021 calls with a strike of $5,000 for a premium of around $25 each. That means the trader bet roughly $3,825 that ether will rally sevenfold over the course of the next nine months. Calls give the owner the right, but not obligation, to buy the underlying asset (in this case, ether) at a set price on a set date.      Prices need not come close to $5,000 for the trader to make a profit; a mere spike in volatility or even a relatively modest rally could increase the now-low probability of the options being in the money, albeit by a very small percentage. Still, that could be just enough for the bet to pay off. As of now, though, it has the same risk profile of a lottery scratch-off game.

42385467,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22GZ,1609363143,Democracy Demands a Say in the Future of Money,"The money we use is changing fast, much faster than we recognize. With the convergence of various exponentially accelerating technologies, such as encryption and distributed ledgers, the imminent future of money is digital, direct and democratic.      This winter, bitcoin is once again on a dramatic bull run. At the 2022 Winter Olympics, China will wow the world with its digital yuan used by millions of visiors at Beijing restaurants, hotels and stadiums.      The question between now and then for the world’s democracies, especially the United States, is how does a free society formulate the future of money? Who decides, and how are the decisions made? Right now the gap between U.S. policymakers and the citizenry is wide and unpromising.    The Hon. J. Christopher Giancarlo is senior counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.    If there was any doubt about the division, look no further than the recent U.S. Treasury Dept. proposal about applying know-your-customer (KYC) requirements to private cryptocurrency wallets. As it stands, the new rule would impose government surveillance on transactions by people who store cryptocurrency in their own electronic wallets (rather than using a professional service).      There’s a lot that’s wrong with this idea, but it’s important to take in the whole picture of what led us here, and why it’s urgent to find the right path forward.      The early internet made access to information direct, instantaneous and inexpensive. Today, the internet is promising a future for money that is faster, cheaper and more inclusive. Money has always been as much a social construct as it is a government-supported public good. Now it’s undergoing a phase of profound change led by privately developed currencies called stablecoins that are challenging archaic electronic messaging systems, lowering transaction costs and speeding up global payments and foreign exchange.      Governments are hurrying to catch up. Most of the world’s central banks are now experimenting with some form of central bank digital currency. They are driven by a range of motives from self-strengthening their economies, gaining global influence, widening financial inclusion, sharpening monetary policy tools, performing law enforcement and corralling the enormous amount of personal and transaction data generated by national currency networks.      Last summer I told the Senate Banking Committee that the United States has an ace to play in the movement towards digital money: privacy rights. With traditional American ideals of economic freedom, sound legal and jurisprudential development of constitutional rights of privacy and thoughtful design choices around anonymity, U.S. digital money could well enjoy superior privacy rights over many competing instruments, commercial or state-run. This especially would be the case when compared to digital instruments of non-democracies, which may well be used as an instrument of state surveillance. As it has done before, the U.S. has the opportunity to lead with its finest ideals.      The Treasury’s proposal, however, makes me a lot less sure. The decision to impose KYC rules on private wallet holders is premised on the flawed assumption that all such independent cryptocurrency dealings are inherently illegitimate and undeserving of personal privacy, even if conducted for lawful purposes, as most are. It also ignores the fact that the major cryptocurrencies are structurally more transparent than bank transactions. Worst of all, the proposal grudgingly gives the public 15 days over Christmas and New Year’s to respond, which it argues is a courtesy not required by law.      Many feel the Treasury proposal will thwart further U.S. development of transformational financial services in favor of venerable, accounts-based banking. Such hostility to cryptocurrency innovation coming at the eleventh hour of the outgoing administration is bewildering compared to the boldness three years ago in supporting development of the world’s first, regulated crypto futures market for bitcoin.      Treasury’s 15-day Christmas comment period deprives a wide range of citizens the opportunity to consider and suggest a workable balance between individual rights of privacy and responsible law enforcement. The short window mirrors the broad divide between the private sector’s energy and inventiveness in financial and money innovation compared to the U.S. government’s caution, skepticism and preference for the status quo.      A free society deserves better than to explore the future of money in a truncated, year-end comment period. The Treasury Dept. should extend it. Ultimately, Congress must step up and balance the competing interests of state surveillance and law enforcement versus the economic privacy rights of a sovereign people. Congress is long overdue in shaping a constructive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. Without it, we are squandering our chance to shape a digital future of money that’s worthy of the world’s oldest democracy.

42385483,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22UP,1609360191,Binance US Says It Will Delist XRP on Jan. 13,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance US is suspending XRP trading for its customers effective next month.      The U.S. affiliate of the world's top crypto exchange by volume announced Wednesday that customers will not be able to deposit or trade XRP on the platform effective 10:00 a.m. ET on Jan. 13, 2021, though withdrawals remain unaffected at this time. The announcement does not apply to Binance as a whole.      Binance US is the latest crypto trading venue to suspend XRP support in the U.S. after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple earlier this month on allegations it has been selling XRP as an unregistered security for over seven years. After the news broke, the price of XRP dipped 2.1% to a 24-hour low of $0.199910 but is slowly recovering.      Other exchanges to delist or suspend XRP trading or markets include:    Coinbase  Crypto.com  Bitstamp  OKCoin  Ziglu  Wirex  Bittrex  Swipe Wallet  Crosstower  Beaxy  OSL  Jump Trading  Galaxy Digital  Bitwise  Genesis Global Trading    Most of these platforms have only removed XRP from their U.S. markets or platforms, though a few have suspended support internationally.      According to the SEC suit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ripple, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen have sold some $1.3 billion in XRP since 2013. The SEC alleges that Ripple did not register XRP as a security or seek an exemption for the token, of which it holds nearly 50 billion in escrow.      For its part, Ripple has called the allegations ""unproven,"" and has promised to file a response in court in the coming weeks. The San Francisco-based firm has repeatedly called the SEC's suit an ""attack on crypto"" in the U.S., with CEO Garlinghouse claiming the agency's actions ""directly benefit China.""      A pretrial conference has been scheduled for Feb. 22, 2021, according to public court records, with the parties required to submit a joint letter describing the case and the arguments each side plans to make, potential motions and any potential settlement details the week before.      The SEC and Ripple must also file a joint letter by Feb. 15 stating whether both parties are willing to consent to having a magistrate judge oversee proceedings (rather than a district judge).

42385480,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22PN,1609359077,Coinbase Sued for Allowing the Sale of XRP,"In an interesting consequence of Ripple Labs' battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a Missouri man claiming to be a Coinbase client is suing the crypto exchange for selling the XRP token.      In a complaint filed in the Northern District Court of California, Thomas C. Sandoval, the St. Louis County-based plaintiff, alleges Coinbase knowingly sold XRP as an unregistered security and gained commission on these sales.      The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, argues Coinbase violated California’s unfair competition laws by “[gaining] an unwarranted competitive advantage over digital asset exchanges that only sold commodities.”      “Coinbase sold a token called Ripple (hereafter referred to by its trading symbol: XRP), the value of which was entirely linked to the success or failure of Ripple Labs, Inc. (Ripple Co.) the company that created the token, and the managerial efforts of Ripple Co. executives. Investors in XRP, such as Plaintiff, reposed an expectation of profit in such managerial efforts by Ripple Co. executives and purchased the token in order to make money on their investment,” the complaint reads.      The SEC filed suit against Ripple Labs last week, claiming XRP is a security that Ripple has been selling for seven years without registering it or seeking an exemption, raising $1.3 billion in the process. As a result of the SEC action against Ripple, Coinbase said Monday it would suspend XRP trading on Jan. 19, 2021.      The lawsuit against Coinbase seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and other relief.      Anderson Kill partner Stephen Palley told CoinDesk he sees “a couple of issues” with this lawsuit. He said its allegations of fraud regarding unfair competition laws rest “on ‘information and belief,’ which is the legal equivalent of ‘I think so but am not really sure,’” Palley wrote in an email.      He added that Coinbase has “a pretty good record” of backing itself up in legal matters involving clients through the arbitration clause in its terms of service.      In the grand scheme of things, he concluded, Coinbase has more than client lawsuits to worry about with the SEC breathing down Ripple’s neck.      “This is going to be hard fought in motion practice and will likely end up in private arbitration unless the court finds that a fairly narrow public policy exception applies,” he said about the Coinbase lawsuit. “I’d assess the risk here to Coinbase (and other exchanges) as quite a bit less than that from continuing to list an asset the SEC has targeted and face much more dangerous enforcement action risk.”      Coinbase has not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment.",NEGATIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/12/30/coinbase-sued-for-allowing-the-sale-of-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3adf3e7b640b6c13e729ec712deb478a3d1c9681-1500x1314.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The addition of Binance Pool to the “yes” column means that all the major pools are now on board.      Taproot is a scaling and privacy change that will be the biggest upgrade the digital currency has received in years – and it's far less controversial than the last one.      According to crypto mining pool Poolin VP Alejandro De La Torre, Binance Pool says it will support the Taproot upgrade, clearing up any ambiguity, since the pool was the only one with over 10% of the network that hadn't said ""yes"" to the proposal. Binance Pool represents 11% of the Bitcoin mining hashrate, so its support pushes mining pool support up to about 91% of the hashrate.    See also: Bitcoin’s Future: Exactly How a Coming Upgrade Could Improve Privacy and Scaling    Binance did not respond immediately to request for comment.      De La Torre leads Taproot Activation, an initiative to find out if there is agreement on Taproot as a change. According to the website, a few smaller mining pools, including Lubian.com and BTC.TOP, have not responded about whether they support the upgrade or not.    Signaling for Taproot    This support from miners comes in stark contrast to SegWit, Bitcoin's last major upgrade, which activated in 2017. SegWit was deployed by way of BIP 9, requiring that 95% of mining pools flag support the change before the change would officially activate. To block the change, mining pools simply did not flag,      So far, mining pools have no problem with Taproot. Binance Pool's support is a bellwether sign that the change could activate soon if no one finds some sort of fatal flaw in it.      This news is particularly consequential because if Taproot is deployed by way of BIP 9, then mining pools will need to flag that they're ready for the change before it can activate.      But there's still some debate about this process. The mechanics of Taproot itself are not controversial. Bitcoin's most active developers all but universally agree it's a positive change.      Still, how to deploy the change is still up for debate. Over the last several months, developers have been discussing the best way to deploy Taproot. To oversimplify a complex debate, some think BIP 8 would be better because it doesn't allow mining pools to block the change out of sluggishness or apathy.

42385486,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22YB,1609347600,How DeFi 'Degens' Are Funding the Next Wave of Open-Source Development,"In 2020, decentralized finance was Ethereum's trend of the year – and with that honor came a thousand new terms and even more memes. But more importantly, the success of DeFi proved an essential quality of Ethereum this year: that real high-volume apps are possible on the still-nascent network.      New protocols shipped, new tokens were issued and the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance protocols surged. Ethereum’s culture evolved. People began speaking of degens, short for degenerate gamblers, as thousands of pseudonymous, money-hungry token-holders blindly sought yield in sometimes questionable assets.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Kevin Owocki is the founder of Gitcoin, a project that funds public goods with blockchain-based technology, and he wants you to quit your job to code.    Given how meme-driven this craze was, it was not long before it spread through the whole of Crypto Twitter. Prominent Ethereum accounts tweeted about their favorite degen opportunities and walked back statements after these unaudited projects were inevitably hacked. There was plenty of action to be had though it was hardly fulfilling or sustainable.      As autumn turned to winter, degen finance had run its course. We look back at the period as a pinnacle of debauchery and greed, but the story is more complicated. The growth of degen finance has created a massive increase in TVL in many novel open financial protocols, some with staying power, and has led to the rise of what I call regenerative finance.      Regenerative finance is a cultural preference for the funding of community and the public good over (or in parallel to) projects that are expected to produce a return for the funder. In the startup world, GiveFirst means trying to help anyone – especially entrepreneurs – with no expectation of getting anything back. Regenerative finance is Web 3.0’s answer to Silicon Valley’s GiveFirst.      And it could only have come after this summer’s DeFi degeneracy. Here is what the rise of regenerative financein the Ethereum community summer 2020 looked like:    In August, YFI, one of the most prominent yield farming projects, announced plans to direct a percentage of rewards towards Ethereum development for everyone.  It was announced that Yam Finance directed 1% of its future treasury to Gitcoin Grants’ public goods funding.  In total, over 20 funds, projects, or community members, directed over $2 million to the Gitcoin Grants Multisig in the summer/autumn of 2020. All of this money is slated for public goods funding.    Public goods are an important class of goods in economics – these are goods that are consumed by anybody and everybody. In our physical world roads, bridges, clean air and clean water are public goods. Open-source software is the foundation of our digital infrastructure and the equivalent of a public good in the digital world.      In the blockchain world, open-source software is what powers the infrastructure upon which many tokens are built. Without foundational projects like ETH 2.0 clients, common privacy tools, white hat hackers or other tools by OSS developers, the cryptocurrency technology that is the foundation of your bags would not be secure.      Over the past three years, I have been working on a project called Gitcoin Grants. Think of Gitcoin Grants as Ethereum’s largest crowdfunding platform – a crypto-enabled Patreon that is focused on financing the infrastructure of the new open financial internet. In the past 18 months over $4.5 million in funding has been distributed to public goods on Gitcoin Grants, culminating with $1 million given in the first two weeks of December.      One interesting evolution of regen finance is a recognition of how the foundations of a secure, reliable, transparent and open financial ecosystem relies on more than just funding the coders. Coincenter, a non-profit dedicated to educating policy makers about public blockchains, raised over $300,000 from 335 contributors. After all, everyone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem derives good from policymakers being educated about our technologies.    Regen finance is democratic, not technocratic.    Regen finance is democratic, not technocratic. It is the community using peer-to-peer (P2P) money to fund what the community needs funded. As opposed to the legacy world where billionaire philanthropists get to decide what is worthy of funding, open systems should be funded by the crowd. Over 5,000 cryptocurrency users contributed to the latest Gitcoin Grants Round.      Here is a preference map of the 26,000 crowdfunding contributions during Gitcoin Grants Round 8.      Readers may note that there is no center to this mesh network of funders. This is what decentralized funding looks like – a P2P network of many funding the many. Each one of those contributions was a little vote (and a little donation) to support the future of open source networks.      Gitcoin Grants are powered by Quadratic Funding, a novel mechanism for funding public goods originally proposed in an academic paper by Glen Weyl, Vitalik Buterin and Zoe Hitzeg. Just as the internet of information brought us new ways to browse information, the internet of finance will provide novel mechanisms to finance projects. Quadratic Funding is just one such example.      Regen finance is not all about Gitcoin. There are many other promising projects including WhalerDAO, CLRFund, Commons Stack, Fair Launch, tree.finance, Panvala and more, all working to make the internet a little bit better.      Regenerative finance funds the work that secures your bags and keeps your funds SAFU, but the true wealth is in the culture of regen finance. It’s a culture that thrives on overcoming cynicism, embracing longer term thinking and mutual trust.      See also: $175K Donation to Coin Center Tops Latest Fundraising Push for Crypto Policy Group      How beautiful that this culture of regen finance could spring in the wake of this summer’s wave of DeGen Finance, since they are so dissimilar!    Degen finance is about leveraging the open financial system, with a high time preference, for near-term personal gain.  Regen finance is about leveraging the open financial system, with a low time preference, for everyone’s gain.    As distinct as yin and yang, yet ultimately reliant. As the ecosystem continues to ebb and flow between the bull and bear markets, so, too, will regen finance ebb and flow with the irrational exuberance of degen finance.

42385487,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22Vf,1609344000,CBDCs: An Idea Whose Time Has Come?,"In 1987, Nobel laureate James Tobin proposed the concept of a retail central bank digital currency. The idea was that central banks should create a public payments “medium with the convenience of deposits and the safety of currency.”      It was a novel idea, which is only recently being taken seriously. Public officials first warmed to it in response to declining cash use in some countries. One early example is Sveriges Riksbank Deputy Governor Cecilia Skingsley, who said in a 2016 speech “the Riksbank should carefully consider meeting the general public’s need for central bank money by supplying this in some electronic form.”    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Raphael Auer is a principal economist at the Bank for International Settlements' Monetary and Economic Department.    Spurred into action also by the popularity of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and announcements of stablecoin projects such as Libra (now Diem), many more central bankers have joined since. And certainly, the declining use of cash during the COVID-19 pandemic has added an extra fillip to this debate.      As a consequence, research and development of CBDCs is now taking place around the world. In recent research we have built a database of all publicly announced CBDC projects. As of end of November 2020, 46 monetary authorities are researching and developing wholesale or retail CBDC (see Figure 1).      Looking just at retail CBDC schemes, four pilots are underway: at the People’s Bank of China, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, the Bank of Korea and Sveriges Riksbank. One CBDC project – the Sand Dollar in the Bahamas – is already live.    What lies ahead for 2021?    First, the stance of policy makers towards CBDCs continued to improve throughout 2020 – as highlighted by the increasingly positive tone of central bank speeches (see Figure 2). One cannot overstate just how remarkable this shift of opinion is.      As late as mid-2018, the net stance on issuance of CBDC had been deeply in negative territory (see Figure 2); a March 2018 joint report by the BIS Markets Committee and the Committee for Payments and Market Infrastructures argued that any “steps towards the possible launch of a CBDC should be subject to careful and thorough consideration.”      Underlying this, one reason for this shift of opinion is that policy makers are now more convinced that CBDCs can be issued without adverse side effects on commercial banks. In fact, in October, a key report by the BIS and seven major central banks laid out a kind of Hippocratic oath for CBDC issuance – “first, do no harm” is the premise, and CBDCs are hence seen as evolution rather than revolution.      While the debate on how exactly this can be assured is still ongoing, viable proposals have emerged (see one proposal by Ulrich Bindseil here). On the operational side, it is now evident that “Hybrid” CBDC architectures can give the private sector a leading role in the retail payment system. Thanks to these new perspectives, there is a growing possibility that CBDCs will be part of the future monetary landscape.      See also: What Is a CBDC?      Second, 2021 will also see many central banks continue to step up their development efforts. Figure 2 shows that also CBDC research and design efforts have grown strongly throughout 2020. The European Central Bank (ECB) is intensifying its work on a digital euro, while – as lined out by Governor Lael Brainard – the U.S. Federal Reserve system is in the midst of a number of research projects, among others partnering with MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.      Meanwhile, reports continue to be published by a number of central banks including the ECB, the Bank of England, the Riksbank, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan. And certainly, the People’s Bank of China has continuously expanded its pilot scheme.      Finally, it is unlikely that the new year will see the launch of a live retail CBDC in a major advanced economy. As of now, major central banks – the guardians of stability – are proceeding with great caution. According to research by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in the majority of jurisdictions CBDC issuance would also require a change in the central bank law.      Changing central bank law is a slow process that – if pursued – would take years and a broad political dialogue. For example, going back to Sweden, Bloomberg recently reported the government will start a review process to explore the feasibility of a CBDC, with results expected in November 2022.      However, we will likely see further research, pilots and announcements, as central banks continue to cooperate and learn from one another. So, even if 2021 turns out not to be the year when Tobin’s “medium with the convenience of deposits and the safety of currency” is announced in any major advanced economy, it could certainly bring that day very much closer.

Ripple and the SEC will meet over video call, according to a court order from the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York.      In the order, United States District Judge Analisa Torres asks the parties to reply with a joint statement covering the case’s arguments and legal bases, potential motions and the likelihood of settlement.      The pretrial conference would mark the first meeting between the two sides since the SEC filed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs for the sale of some $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens. This is the first time the regulator is taking a digital asset issuer with its own network to court, though it has sued many Ethereum token issuers in the past.      As with other instruments in its regulatory purview, the SEC views digital tokens under the lens of the Howey Test. The result of a 1946 court case, the Howey Test is a checklist used to judge whether or not an investment contract is a security under the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act of 1933 and 1934.      Under the test, a security is offered if “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”      Since the SEC first announced its suit, multiple popular exchanges have announced they are halting XRP trading. Currently trading at $0.21, XRP is down 56% since the SEC first announced the lawsuit last week.

42385482,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22Rt,1609336800,Blockchain Developers Are Focused on the Wrong Problem,"It was an exciting year for crypto. Decentralized finance (DeFi) took off like a rocket ship, the non-fungible token (NFT) community accelerated forward and great strides were made on blockchain interoperability. The number of projects expanded exponentially, teams rapidly iterated to finding product-market fit and a wave of new talent entered the space to tackle important problems hindering blockchains from breaking into the mainstream.      There was one area, however, that did not receive much attention or improvements at all: scaling. We are not talking about scaling the number of transactions per second or lowering average fees. There are plenty of teams working across layer 1 and layer 2 systems attempting to solve those problems.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Anatoly Yakovenko is co-founder and CEO of Solana. Raj Gokal is co-founder and COO of Solana.    We are referring to scaling decentralization or, more specifically, censorship resistance. The lack of focus in this area over the past few years is puzzling given that censorship resistance is the single most critical property of blockchain networks.      In 2017, Balaji Srinivasan and Leland Lee published a seminal piece titled, “Quantifying Decentralization.” One of the key takeaways from the post was to measure censorship resistance by the minimum number of entities required to compromise a critical component of the system. This is known as the “Nakamoto coefficient.”      Crypto influencers often cite the total number of nodes, geographic diversity and the size of core developer communities as key metrics in determining a blockchain’s decentralization. These are all important. However, the most meaningful factor is the economic distribution between viable nodes in a network. Even a sufficiently decentralized network in terms of the number of nodes could be corrupted if only a few maintain financial control over the decision-making process.      The top three Ethereum proof-of-work mining pools currently control 51% of the hash power. The situation isn’t much better on proof-of-stake chains. Seven out of the 125 active Cosmos nodes control over 33% of the total stake (the threshold to mount an attack). On Polkadot, it’s eight out of 258 nodes.      Viewing the current state of blockchains through this lens clearly shows the community as a whole hasn’t prioritized scaling censorship resistance.      While this concentration of power may not affect bitcoin for the store of value use case, it is definitely problematic for popular use cases on smart contract blockchains. For example, those three Ethereum mining pool operators have complete control over the ordering of all transfers going in and out of heavily used contracts like Uniswap.    We need to scale censorship resistance.    They may not be abusing their power today, but giving a small cadre of network participants the ability to extract value from one market maker over another, or one exchange over another, completely undermines the reason why blockchains are useful in decentralizing finance. The current distribution of power will not work once trillions of dollars in price discovery are being pushed onto public blockchains in the near future.      And, no, sharding doesn’t solve the problem. Breaking up a chain into individual shards does not improve the system’s overall Nakamoto coefficient, and it’s very unclear if random rotation can improve the security of a network.      The reason for surfacing these bleak statistics is not to disparage other blockchains. The reality is the same for Solana, where the eight largest Solana validators control 33% of the total stake.      The purpose is to highlight the need to innovate in order to improve censorship resistance before it’s too late. Rapidly increasing crypto prices and the growth of our ecosystems are raising the stakes and will attract the attention of skeptical governments, adversarial corporations and swarms of incentivized hackers. Our chains’ censorship resistance will be tested to levels not yet experienced.      In order to allow DeFi products to attract billions of users and devices, we need to scale censorship resistance. In order to bring blockchain-based games to a global audience, we need to scale censorship resistance. In order to defend our networks against the vast spectrum of future attacks, we need to scale censorship resistance. It is the single most important problem to be solving, and our entire motivation for building Solana.      See also: Belarus News Media Are Testing Decentralized Tech to Resist Censorship      As an industry, we need to innovate to incentivize network participants to care and contribute, instead of concentrating capital into small groups of validators.      It’s time to refocus on the core issue facing blockchain adoption and sustainability.

42385462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22Cn,1609333954,Russian Oil Drilling Giant Opens a Crypto Mining Farm Run on Gas Energy,"Gazpromneft, the oil subsidiary of Russian natural gas giant Gazprom, is getting into a different kind of exploration.      The company opened a venue for cryptocurrency mining on one of its oil drilling sites in Siberia, unlocking the power of Russia’s oil and gas resources for the needs of bitcoin mining.      Gazprom, a company that counts the Russian government as a shareholder, is the country’s gas monopolist and world’s 10th-biggest oil producer. The company has been spearheading several mega-projects of cross-border gas pipelines such as the Nord Stream and the South Stream, which bring Russian gas to Europe.      Gazpromneft is a direct subsidiary of Gazprom and one of the very few government-owned companies in Russia that has openly expressed interest in the crypto mining industry. Earlier this year, CoinDesk reported that Rosatom, Russia’s nuclear power monopolist, is opening up its energy supplies for miners, too.      Read more: A Russian Nuclear Plant Is Renting Space to Energy-Hungry Bitcoin Miners      The venue, located in the Khanty-Mansiysk region of northwestern Siberia, is using the associated gas from its oil field as an energy source and has its own power plant transforming the gas into electricity.      The CO2 that gets freed during the oil drilling is normally a liability for oil companies as they have to burn it into the atmosphere, which results in fines. However, there are ways to utilize it instead of wasting it, and electricity generation is one of them.      In cryptocurrency mining, one of the greatest costs is for the electricity needed to power the mining rigs. By locating mining operations at oil drilling sites where there's abundant gas to provide virtually free electricity, both miners and the oil companies benefit.

Vekus placed a shipping container housing 150 units of Bitmain’s Antminer S9 ASICs on the site, Gazpromneft announced via the Russian crypto news outlet Forklog, and in one month the machines mined 1.8 BTC using 49,500 cubic meters of gas.

42385485,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22ZR,1609331400,Valid Points: A Year in Review by Your Ethereum 2.0 Staking Experts,"In less than 48 hours, 2020 will be behind us.      It almost seems too big a task to recount all that has happened in this world, in this industry and in our own personal lives but our colleague Brad Keoun, editor of CoinDesk’s daily cryptocurrency markets newsletter, First Mover, offers an excellent start to summarizing 2020. He writes:    ""This year saw the biggest drop-off in economic activity since the Great Depression, the biggest money-printing episode in the Federal Reserve’s 107-year history, an epochal shift toward remote working, negative prices for crude-oil futures and the first real signs the global financial system might be migrating toward fast-growing markets for cryptocurrencies and digital assets.”    2020 also saw an explosive growth in the total value locked and user activity for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Ethereum. We witnessed the genesis of Ethereum’s primary scaling solution with the launch of Ethereum 2.0 and the emergence of an entirely new use case for ether through staking.      Where do we go from here? For today’s special, year-end edition of Valid Points, we've gathered commentary from the industry’s most well-known Eth 2.0 staking experts. They’ll be illustrating through charts what caught their attention most this past year and what they’ll be watching closely for in the next.    Ethereum: A year in review  Tim Ogilvie, Staked, on gas usage    Our first contribution is from Tim Ogilvie, the founder and CEO of Staked. Staked helps investors earn yield from staking and DeFi without taking custody of their crypto assets.      “My favorite Ethereum chart shows the daily gas usage. I love it because it’s one part of the great story that I expect will propel ETH over the next few years. There are three legs to the stool:    Our chart. People are using ETH with increasing frequency, driving increased gas demand.  EIP-1559, introducing Fee Burns. This is an upcoming Ethereum improvement that will take all of the gas demand and use it to burn ETH. The more ETH gets used, the more ETH supply gets burned.  Eth 2: Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake, allowing for low issuance of new supply while providing strong security guarantees.    “Bitcoin has an amazing story as an asset with a fixed supply of 21 million BTC. Ethereum’s story has the potential to be even stronger. If gas usage exceeds supply issuance, you’ve now got a digital asset with a steadily declining supply.      “My 2021 prediction: This becomes the dominant story around ETH’s valuation and it drives significant price appreciation.”    Jun Soo Kim, stake.fish, on Ethereum's staking ecosystem    Next, we have the head of strategy and operations for stake.fish, Jun Soo Kim. With support for over 10 different blockchain networks, Jun Soo and his team are working to secure and contribute to an exciting new staking ecosystem and enable users to stake with confidence.      “By far my favorite chart of Ethereum 2.0 is how consistently the participation rate has been averaging at above 98% after the first few days of the Beacon Chain launch. The participation rate shows how well the active validators are doing to stay online and conduct their attestation duties. If the participation rate was any closer to 66%, we would need to be seriously concerned about the network health. But at the current levels, we have a nice big buffer that alleviates any concerns for network finality halts.      “There is also another takeaway from this data. While there are many professional staking service providers running validators on Ethereum 2.0, there is a bigger number of individuals who are operating validators themselves. These independent validators have been contributing to the high participation rate. From this, we can infer that Ethereum 2.0 has achieved its goal of making sure anyone can run validators on their own without having to rely on specialized technical knowledge or hardware. This provides hope that while staking services and exchanges will grow, the number of independent validators will grow as well. Independent validators are key in ensuring Ethereum 2.0 remains decentralized and I hope we keep seeing improvements to the experience of running validators.      “We haven't even seen the beginning of Ethereum 2.0 integration with DeFi. Tokenized staked ETH and how they become a part of the existing DeFi stack will be a key theme in the first half of 2021.”    Chandler Song, Ankr, on staking growth    Our penultimate contribution comes from Chandler Song, CEO of Ankr. Ankr Network is a San Francisco-based Web 3.0 infrastructure provider working at removing entry barriers and opening Ethereum 2.0 staking to everyone with Stkr decentralized protocol.      ""This chart represents the number of ETH sent by validators to the Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract since it went live on Nov. 4. To launch on the planned Genesis date of Dec. 1, 524,288 ETH had to be transferred until Nov. 24. This threshold was met only hours before the activation deadline.      “We see that early on the community was hesitant to stake their ETH. The fact that the staked funds are locked and essentially illiquid for an indefinite period made the progress slow in the first weeks. We think that one of the important factors that helped break the momentum was staking-as-a-service solutions going live with synthetic assets that solve early Ethereum 2.0 liquidity issues.      “We are going to see the growing popularity of liquid bond tokens representing ETH 2.0 stake. These assets have two functions: turn illiquid ETH into a tradable and liquid asset and allow investors to participate in building trust to grow the Ethereum network.""    Mike Garland, Alchemy, on Eth 2.0 adoption    Last but not least, our final chart comes from Mike Garland, product manager for Alchemy. Alchemy is a blockchain developer platform powering 4 million users and $7.5 billion dollars of transactions in 99% of countries worldwide.      “Our favorite ETH 2 graph of 2020 is one which shows the 35,300% increase in global adoption we've seen of the Beacon Chain since just before the Dec. 1 launch.      “We've seen great developers and teams pouring in to pick up and start using ETH 2.0 and all signs point to even greater adoption going into the new year.      “The ETH and ETH 2.0 ecosystems are only as good as the developers and users that drive them, so seeing this kind of growth so early for ETH 2.0 has us super excited for the year ahead.”      We’ll soon be incorporating data directly from CoinDesk’s own Eth 2.0 validator node in our weekly analysis. All profits made from this staking venture will be donated to a charity of our choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.

42385468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB22E3,1609316538,Bitcoin Sets New All-Time High Above $28.5K; Bulls Back in the Driver's Seat,"After seeming to take a couple of days to catch its breath following its record-setting run over the weekend, the price of bitcoin (BTC) once again resumed its torrid upward pace, setting a new all-time high $28,579.59 early Wednesday morning.    BTC topped the previous high-water mark of $28,352.63 set less than 72 hours earlier, before dropping back to $27,772.99, up 4.14% in the last 24 hours. The price of BTC has risen more than 295% year to date.  Institutional investors are perceived to be driving this record-setting run. Among them: Anthony Scaramucci’s Skybridge Capital ($25 million in December); MassMutual ($100 million in December); and Guggenheim (up to 10% of its $5 billion macro fund).  With the end of the year looming, some fund managers may also be buying BTC so they can brag next year about being smart enough to get in in 2020 while neglecting to say at which price they had done so.  In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, has been printing money with abandon, trying to stave off the worst economic effects of the pandemic as U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing Congress to pass an even bigger relief package to allow for larger stimulus checks. These actions are viewed by many as potential catalysts for inflation and bad for the U.S. dollar, both of which could be positive for BTC.
