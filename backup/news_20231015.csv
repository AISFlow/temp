18882878,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555435,1697407218,Best Time to Buy Ethereum Could Be Soon: Last Cycle Suggests,"Ethereum has been in a descending channel against Bitcoin since August of last year, meaning Bitcoin has been the better investment over this time. However, historical trends show the tides could be changing soon, with Ethereum possibly on the brink of entering an accumulation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To Reach $170,000 in 2025 – Mathematical Model Predicts Ethereum Price Action Ethereum is trading at $1600, marking a 22% decrease from its price last August. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is 8% up over the same period. This is a common trend that happens during bear markets. Coins with larger market capitalizations tend to be more resilient against price decreases as investors become more risk-averse and look to preserve their capital. While Ethereum isn’t short at a market capitalization of $187 billion, it’s still considerably lower than Bitcoin at $525 billion. During bull markets, coins with lower market capitalization outperform Bitcoin again as investors lean towards assets with greater potential returns. Ethereum Price Compared Against Bitcoin When comparing ETH’s value to BTC, it’s evident that Ethereum has been trading within a descending channel since last August. This pattern, characterized by its lower highs and lower lows, often indicates a bearish trend in the market. ETH's valuation against BTC over time. Source: ETHBTC on TradingView The chart above highlights three other distinct phases: Accumulation phase: During this phase, price tends to stabilize, hinting at an upcoming change in momentum Ascending channel: Here, the price experiences a significant reversal, often on a parabolic trajectory, characterized by highs and higher lows. Distribution phase: In the final phase, the price ceases its upward movement. Investors typically use this phase to capitalize on their gains and liquidate their positions. The accumulation phase is typically the best time for investors to convert their Bitcoin into Ethereum. This phase is marked by price holding on at the bottom and then showing signs of reversal. Ethereum is still forming lower lows against Bitcoin, so it has not entered the accumulation phase yet. However, the last cycle shows that this could be changing soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Action in October: A Probabilistic Overview Last Cycle Reflecting on the last cycle, Ethereum was in a descending channel against Bitcoin for 17 months. The accumulation phase then occurred from September 2019 up until February 2020. Based on the four-year theory, which suggests similar phases in the market occur every four years, this shows that the accumulation phase should also be approaching very soon in this cycle. Yet, while the last cycle offers valuable insights, it’s important to note that no two cycles are the same. In the current cycle, ETH’s price action has not seen as much of a drop as in the previous cycle, which could be attributed to changing fundamentals and asset maturation. Final thoughts While an accumulation phase for Ethereum has not been confirmed yet, there remains the potential for its price to drop even further relative to Bitcoin. However, if the previous cycle is anything to go by, we could enter the accumulation phase soon. This phase typically presents prime buying opportunities for Ethereum.

18878491,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555460,1697400036,"ApeCoin (APE) Set For Upcoming Token Unlock, Bearish Pressure To Worsen?","ApeCoin (APE) will undergo a token unlock valued at $16.69 million. This development comes amidst the token’s bearish price action, which has led to it losing half its market value in Q3 2023. Related Reading: Apecoin Weakens Grip In Last 30 Days – Should Investors Get Worried? 15.60 Million ApeCoin (APE) Set To Flood The Market Next Week According to data from TokenUnlocks, ApeCoin’s next token unlock is set to occur on October 17, during which the ApeCoin DAO will release 15.60 million new APE tokens into circulation. This will mark the tenth APE token unlock in 2023, as this event occurs on the seventeenth day of every month. Based on more information from TokenUnlocks, the newly released APE coins will be allocated to five major parties. These include Yuga Labs and its founder, the ApeCoin DAO Treasury, charity, and the project’s launch contributors, i.e., early investors in the token before its official launch. Upon release, tokens are expected to form 4.23% of APE’s circulating supply. ApeCoin was launched in March 2022, with a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens, of which 54.25% are currently unlocked. However, only 367.59 million APE are part of the token’s circulating supply. APE’s Bearish Form To Continue? Generally, token unlocks are usually accompanied by concerns of an incoming downward trend. This is because the sudden availability of large amounts of tokens may prompt some investors to sell and take profit, which puts downward pressure on the said token’s price. As earlier stated, APE already finds itself stuck in a long bearish market. Although the token is only down by 2.79% in the last month, its overall performance in 2023 has been largely negative. Related Reading: Apecoin Weakens Grip In Last 30 Days – Should Investors Get Worried? According to data from CoinMarketCap, APE has lost 70% of its value in 2023 compared to its market price as of January 1. APE could soon record more losses with the token unlock set for next week. However, that may not be the case. Based on historical data, token unlocks do not always result in a price loss, as notably seen with Aptos in January, in which the APT gained by 50% following its monthly token release. Moreover, there have been some interesting developments surrounding ApeCoin in the last week. On October 11, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Narwal proposed on the ApeCoin DAO the development of an exclusive layer 2 solution for ApeCoin, known as “ApeChain.” Currently, APE is based on the Ethereum Network, and it functions as the governance asset of the APE ecosystem, which consists of NFT projects launched by Yuga Labs, such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). However, creating ApeChain could enable Apecoin to achieve a higher level of scalability, which, in turn, could positively affect its adoption and market price. APE trades at $1.06 when writing, with a 1.47% gain in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily volume is down by 16.96%, valued at $19.32 million.

18874021,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555450,1697392815,On-Chain Tracker Notices Major Difference Between Bitcoin And Ethereum Whales,"As earlier reported, Bitcoin holders have steadily held on to their coins in the past few months. Bitcoin whales, in particular, seem to be doubling despite the current uncertainty in Bitcoin’s future projection. Long-term holders add an average of 50,000 BTC to their wallets every month, as indicated by the HODLer Net Position Change indicator provided by Glassnode. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Bitcoin To Surpass Gold And Silver Within A Decade On the other hand, whales of Ethereum, the second largest crypto in the world, appear to be on a different trajectory. On-chain data has shown that while Bitcoin whales hoard their coins, Ethereum whales appear to be dumping their holdings in recent years. Bitcoin Whales Buying More, Ethereum Whales Selling Bitcoin whales, meaning the largest holders with 1000 BTC or greater, have been steadily accumulating more BTC since 2018, according to data from on-chain analytics firms. However, there have been sell-offs, either through extended bear markets or during profit-taking after a strong bullish uptrend. A research analyst for Cryptoslate named James Straten posted on social media that Ethereum whales with more than 1,000 ETH have been selling since the same period. While sharing a Glassnode chart, he shared a correlation between the whales of the blockchains. On-chain data shows ETH whales have offloaded 20 million ETH since 2022, with 12 million ETH being sold off this year alone. Possible Explanation For The Contrasting Whale Activity The story these on-chain metrics tell provides insight into the prevailing mood among large crypto holders of different blockchains. Although the amount of ETH held by whales might indicate they have sold or moved their funds to other cryptocurrencies, a better possibility is that these whales transferred their ETH into Ethereum smart contracts. Since Ethereum version 2.0 kickstarted its journey in December 2020, the number of tokens in the staking protocol has grown significantly. ETH 2.0 requires validators to stake 32 ETH in its deposit contract to validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. At the moment, the contract now has 31.2 million ETH worth $48.6 billion locked. This seems consistent with on-chain data, which shows that the percentage of supply tied in smart contracts overtook the supply in addresses holding 1000+ ETH in late 2020. Crypto research analyst André Dragosch shared this correlation on social media platform X. The correlation buttresses that the Glassnode data doesn’t consider the ETH tied in smart contracts for its whale supply metric. With a domination of 17.8% over the whole cryptocurrency market, the Ethereum blockchain continues to solidify its position as the undisputed leader of smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin whales, bullish ETH whales are not just HODLing but employing techniques to maximize their crypto gains.

However, the latest on-chain revelation suggests that investors continue to show significant faith in the premier cryptocurrency and its prospects. Bitcoin Addresses With 10+ BTC Reach All-Time High: Santiment According to a recent report from the blockchain data tracker Santiment, there has been considerable growth within a particular class of Bitcoin investors. The on-chain analytics platform highlighted that the number of shark and whale addresses holding at least 10 BTC has notably increased since early 2022. The report disclosed that an additional 11,806 addresses hold more than 10 BTC, reflecting an 8.12% increase in the past 20 months. Based on data from Santiment, are currently 157,400 wallets holding at least 10 Bitcoin, surpassing its record high set in 2019. Related Reading: Bitcoin Path To $70,000? Analyst Shows What This ‘Head And Shoulders’ Pattern Reveals Another recent Santiment report has strengthened the Bitcoin accumulation argument even more. The number of addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC witnessed its largest spike in a single day since February 2022. 🐳 #Bitcoin‘s whale numbers had another huge accumulation day. 16 more wallets now hold between 100-1K $BTC, and they correlate with smaller wallets ‘graduating’ to the next tier. As key stakeholders grow, the argument for a #bullish future gets stronger. https://t.co/DOvRLpGspw pic.twitter.com/EQW8jZsTtn — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 14, 2023 The October 14 report revealed that 16 additional addresses 100 to 1,000 BTC. Sentiment noted that this particular scenario goes in tandem with the accumulation trend of smaller wallets (addresses with at least 10 BTC). Ultimately, these significant on-chain developments indicate a steady accumulation of Bitcoin despite price fluctuations and market instability. Meanwhile, Santiment pointed out that the case for a bullish trajectory becomes more apparent as key Bitcoin investors grow. BTC Price – Overview As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $26,901, with negligible price movement in the past day. However, a broader look at the BTC price chart shows that the cryptocurrency has struggled in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, Bitcoin experienced a 3.7% price decline in the last seven days. After failing to breach the $28,000 mark, the premier cryptocurrency saw its price crash towards $26,500 for the first time in October.

18865477,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=555449,1697378630,How Ripple’s Rumored Token Burn Could Affect The XRP Price,"XRP has struggled to regain bullish price momentum this month, with the crypto going on six days of red candle close last week. The XRP community appears to be feeling the effects of this lack of momentum, as speculations have begun to circulate about a potential catalyst for the next XRP price surge. Related Reading: What To Expect This Month For XRP Price According To Historical Data Word on the street now is that Ripple plans to burn the 41.9 billion XRP tokens they have locked up in escrow. Although this hasn’t been confirmed yet, some say this move could send the value of XRP skyrocketing. The Potential Impact Of A Full Escrow Token Burn Ripple, the company behind the XRP cryptocurrency, currently holds billions of XRP in escrow. As of the time of writing, Ripple has 41.9 billion XRP locked up, with 1 billion XRP released from escrow each month. This huge stockpile of XRP has led to criticism that Ripple could flood the market at any time and crash the price. However, rumors are swirling that Ripple may burn all of the XRP in escrow, potentially spiking up the price of XRP. If Ripple eliminated all of the escrowed XRP, it would significantly decrease the total supply of XRP and could positively impact the market price. The rumor was started on social media X by the account @realXRPwhale and has elicited a response from community members. Although unverified, the account posted the update of Ripple, burning the “50 BILLION $XRP.” While some have shown enthusiasm regarding the price effect if this happens, others have dismissed it as just a baseless rumor. What’s Next For XRP? Ripple has never acknowledged or refuted rumors that it will destroy all of its tokens held in escrow, but this is not the first time that such a rumor has emerged suggesting that the technology company will do so. But the possibility of this happening is not completely out of the question, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse mentioned in a 2021 interview. Other factors that could drive up XRP prices include major partnerships by Ripple and a clear outcome of the ongoing case with the US Security and Exchange Commission. However, one thing that’s going so well is the increased recognition of XRP after a US judge declared that the token isn’t a security. Related Reading: Road To $1? Analyst Forecasts 1,500% Price Rally For Dogecoin At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.4863 and is within a range as it looks to break above $0.5. According to an analyst, the price of XRP could get a boost from a blooming altcoin season if Bitcoin’s dominance continues to decline. Research has shown that October has historically seen more losses than gains for XRP.

18857273,http://blokt.com/?p=1045,1697364035,How Do I Buy or Sell Bitcoin?,"Back in 2017, Bitcoin underwent a meteoric rise in value, from around US$700 to above US$18,000. Then in 2021, Bitcoin started its ascent to a new high of over US$62,000, a record high which was then broken one year later in 2022. Some analysts predict that a single Bitcoin will one day be worth more than US$500,000. Bitcoin has proven itself as one of the hottest assets on the market. Perhaps you’re interested in buying Bitcoins to hold as a long-term investment, or as a way to invest in other so-called “altcoins” that can only be purchased with Bitcoin. Historically, the process of acquiring Bitcoin has required some technical know-how, a gap that has traditionally kept many interested parties from investing in Bitcoin. As cryptocurrency has risen in popularity, however, many reputable and user-friendly options for buying and storing Bitcoin have come onto the scene. Bitcoins cannot be stored in a bank (with the exception of Revolut), and their safety is ultimately in the hands of the user who holds them. Therefore, it is imperative to research the tools that you use to interact with your Bitcoins to ensure their security. In this post, we’ll discuss the different methods that can be used to buy, sell and store Bitcoins securely. If you live in the UK, then read our UK-specific guide here . Method One: Purchasing or Selling Bitcoins on an Online Exchange Buying or selling Bitcoins on an online exchange is the easiest and most popular way to trade them. When choosing an exchange, it’s important to keep a few things in mind. What kind of reputation does the exchange have? How long has this exchange been operating successfully? What type of security does this exchange utilize to protect users’ personal information and assets, and has this security ever failed? While all of these exchanges have the capability of storing Bitcoins, it is not recommended to keep Bitcoins (or any other cryptocurrency, for that matter) stored on an exchange long-term. See our in-depth guide to safely storing your cryptocurrency here . Coinbase Coinbase is an extremely user-friendly option for newcomers to cryptocurrency. It is both an exchange and a versatile wallet that has online, mobile, and desktop interfaces. Currently, Coinbase can be used to buy, sell and store Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin; it supports payment via bank transfer or credit/debit card. Photo ID must be provided to become a registered Coinbase user. While Coinbase is a very convenient option, it must also be said that many users have had poor experiences with Coinbase’s customer support. Additionally, Coinbase’s fees are a bit higher than the industry average. Kraken Kraken is a European-based exchange that allows Bitcoin to be traded for USD, JPY, EUR, and GBP. Kraken has low trading fees, but the verification process required to become a functioning user can take as long as several weeks. Kraken protects its users’ accounts with 2-factor identification and PGP encryption. Changelly Changelly is an online exchange that has also been noted for its user-friendliness. Unlike Coinbase, Changelly does not offer a mobile or desktop wallet, but Bitcoin can be stored. Changelly supports the use of bank cards to buy Bitcoin with USD. Changelly charges a 0.5% fee on each transaction within its network, on the higher end of the industry average. Method Two: Over-the-Counter Trading Over-the-Counter Trading is a way of buying or selling Bitcoins without going through an exchange. Instead, Bitcoin trades are arranged on a peer-to-peer basis. The advantage of this is that there are no fees charged by a third party. Of course, there is a bit of a risk involved in Over-the-Counter trading, as you must trust that the person who is selling Bitcoins to you will indeed send them. To ensure that the person you’re trading with is trustworthy, use a platform like LocalBitcoins.com , which provides users with trustworthiness scores. Storing Your Bitcoins Safely: Who Holds Your Private Keys? Although Bitcoins have become quite valuable assets, they are essentially an abstraction–you cannot see, smell, touch, taste, or own a physical Bitcoin. To hold a Bitcoin, you must be in possession of that coin’s private key. A private key is a series of numbers that allows a Bitcoin to be sent. If you hold a Bitcoin’s private key, you also maintain the ability to spend (or hang on to) that Bitcoin. Private keys are the things that enable access to transfer Bitcoin from a Bitcoin wallet. Private keys always start with the number five, and they look like this: 5Kb8kLf9zgWQnogidDA76MzPL6TsZZY36hWXMssSzNydYXYB9KF Private keys must not be confused with public keys, also known as public addresses–a public key is an address that is used to receive Bitcoins. Public keys always start with the number one, and look like this: 1EHNa6Q4Jz2uvNExL497mE43ikXhwF6kZm When it comes to private keys, different wallets distribute the responsibility of keeping them safe in different ways. Some wallets, like Coinbase and Exodus, keep your private keys for you. You will never have access to them; instead, they are stored on the wallet’s private server. While this may (in theory) alleviate the personal stress of worrying about keeping your private keys safe, choosing this kind of wallet also means that you are entrusting your Bitcoins into someone else’s care; if that private server gets hacked or otherwise compromised, your Bitcoins could be lost. While you would likely be hoping for some compensation, you would probably be out of luck. Other kinds of wallets, like paper wallets, put you in charge of your private keys. This means that you are solely responsible for the fate of your Bitcoins . If you lose access to the private keys, you lose access to the Bitcoins. Choosing a Bitcoin Wallet Once you have decided whether you want your Bitcoins’ private keys to be in your own hands or under the responsibility of a third-party company, there are a few different types of Bitcoin wallets : hardware wallets (i.e., Trezor, Ledger, Keepkey) desktop wallets (i.e., Exodus, Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Multibit, Armory, Coinbase) mobile wallets (i.e., Coinbase, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Copay, Airbitz) paper wallets (can be created at Bitcoinpaperwallet.com) online wallets (i.e., GreenAddress, SpectroCoin) Online wallets are thought of as the least secure kind of Bitcoin wallet because of their susceptibility to hacking. While there are some independent options for online wallets, most are associated with online exchanges (i.e., Poloniex, Bittrex). Desktop wallets are downloadable pieces of software that can be used to store Bitcoins. Different desktop wallets have different sets of features. For example, Bitcoin Core is a “full-node” wallet that stores the entire Bitcoin blockchain, which allows for more private use; on the opposite end of the spectrum, Exodus is a “light” desktop wallet that has a built-in exchange. Mobile wallets are an option for users who are looking for user-friendly wallets that can be accessed on-the-go. Some mobile wallets, like Coinbase and Copay, have built-in exchanges that can be used to buy and sell Bitcoin and other kinds of cryptocurrency quickly. Paper wallets are a great, low-cost option for keeping your Bitcoins in “cold storage” (offline). While storing your Bitcoins in a paper wallet means that they are not susceptible to hacking, they are vulnerable to all of the things that paper is susceptible to: fire damage, water damage, biodegradation; even just getting lost. When you create a paper wallet , make sure that you print multiple copies that can be kept in various secure locations. Protect the copies with plastic bags or lamination, and use an offline printer that cannot be hacked when you are printing your paper wallet. Hardware wallets are considered to be the most secure kind of cryptocurrency storage. They store Bitcoins offline in cold storage, and have options for regeneration should they be destroyed. Hardware wallets are encrypted and protected with varying levels of security, including pin codes, password, and multi-signature sign-in. Becoming a Savvy Crypto Investor What the world of cryptocurrency is experiencing right now is a crucial time in its history–it is just beginning to make the leap from being a “fringe” movement to a mainstream fintech revolution. Undoubtedly, there is a lot of money to be made; some early adopters have already reaped massive benefits. Unfortunately, for just as many great crypto opportunities that are appearing nearly every day, there are many “scam coins” and other kinds of crypto-related schemes. Therefore, when entering the cryptosphere as a first-time investor, it is imperative to learn how to protect yourself from malicious scammers.
