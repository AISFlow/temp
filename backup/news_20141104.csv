42377762,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Uwd,1415126801,Money20/20 Day 2: Automated Economies and the Internet of Value,"Money20/20's (Bit)coinWorld track resumed for a second day of action on Monday, delving more thoroughly into the nuances of the technology.  Interestingly, given the comparatively advanced subject matter, attendance at the bitcoin-themed seminars on Monday appeared higher than day one, with lines forming outside of the session room several times during the afternoon.  Beyond the seminar, bitcoin was an audible and frequent discussion topic among conference attendees, many of whom seemed eager to discuss the potential impact the technology could have on their respective industries.  The Internet of value  The first session brought together Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam. Moderated by TechCrunch senior editor Jonathan Shieber, the seminar took a broad view of digital currency, placing the topic in context of global payments, finance and commerce.  In opening statements, both men struck a tone critical of bitcoin's existing infrastructure, but framed the technology generally as a powerful way to transmit value or develop what Allaire called the ""Internet of value exchange"".  “I think we know a better way – the path of the Internet,” he said. “Its core values, its core DNA, its core distributed systems that are built on the public commons, its deep respect for personal freedoms and privacy.”  Ehrsam, meanwhile, noted that one of the most significant aspects of digital currency is that it puts the transaction and assets in question under full control of the user. This, he said, carries its own associated benefits and risks, but nonetheless represents a big departure from existing payment vehicles.  “Bitcoin fundamentally rethinks [what we have today] as you are ultimately in control of your money and all transactions are final,"" he added.  During a discussion segment that followed, both Allaire and Ehrsam shared their thoughts on the potential for bitcoin to be adopted by larger institutions, including banks.  Allaire said that he believes banks are a few years away from integrating parts or all of the technology underlying bitcoin, explaining:  “I think banks are reluctant to get into this market until they have a better understanding of the obligations under existing laws and regulations. I think they are reluctant to work with other companies if they are directly involved until they have that clarity.”  A legacy disrupted  A session entitled 'Legacy Disruption and Mainstream Integration' aimed to predict how bitcoin could be implemented within the broader financial system.  Hosted by Business Insider analyst John Heggestuen, the panel looked at both the transformative and disruptive impact digital currency can have on the world’s payment and finance ecosystems.  The session featured Will O’Brien, CEO of BitGo; Halsey Minor, founder and CEO of Bitreserve; Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain; and Cedric Dahl, CEO of Buttercoin.  While all the participants presented their own vision for how digital currency integration could happen over the next few years, all agreed that the technology will be most beneficial when most consumers don’t even know they’re using it.  “I think, in hindsight, bitcoin will be seen as one of those transformative technologies,” Minor predicted.  O’Brien noted that he believes bitcoin “will become the backbone of finance”. Ludwin suggested that some consumers will be more aware than others that bitcoin is being used to facilitate their transitions, while Dahl added that, in the future, it will be “impossible” to identify all the areas in which blockchain-based transactions are happening.  Panelists urged finance institutions, including technology firms, to get involved with bitcoin even in an informal way. Ludwin said this sector has an interest in understanding the blockchain, ending with a call to action:  “Now is the time to start experimenting with building for bitcoin, with your platform.""  Winklevosses pitch for automatic economy  One of the final keynotes of day two was given by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the leaders of VC firm Winklevoss Capital and two of the most significant bitcoin investors. During the speech, the Winklevosses pitched what they see as both the future of money and of economic activity – the blockchain.  After walking through a truncated history of money and value exchange, the presentation moved into a conceptual framework for an automated economy. This, the brothers said, would include self-driving cars, delivery and commerce kiosk networks, and even forms of artificial life underpinned by blockchain behavior.  The framework proposed pushes the 'crypto 2.0' concept – that next-generation digital projects will be powered by programmed transactions – to cover almost every aspect of what the Winkelvosses called a sector of automated business, with agents behaving and creating economic activity all on their own.  Funding these mechanisms, they suggested, would be public campaigns that collect the microtransactions needed to fuel these “autonomous agents”.  As the two concluded:  “If we fix money, the computer bits are the limit.”  Images via CoinDesk; Andrew Zarivny / Shutterstock.com",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/04/money2020-day-2-automated-economies-and-the-internet-of-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd7ac81531b4792a926ba94f257f73d16a2e4b73-2560x1724.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UgH,1415120763,FTC Granted Approval to Sell Off Butterfly Labs’ Bitcoins,"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has secured the authority to begin converting Butterfly Labs’ bitcoin holdings into cash reserves.  The motion was granted by the US District Court for the Western District of Missouri on 29th October and marks the latest update in the case that began when the FTC filed a lawsuit against the company for fraud and misrepresentation this September.  At the time, Butterfly Labs was closed pending trial, although it has resumed limited business operations under court receivership. The designation means that a court-appointed receiver has been in control of the business, and that this individual will now be able to “manage and administer” the company’s finances.  The latest filing suggests that the receiver will seek to cover potential refund liabilities the company may incur by liquidating the company's bitcoin assets.  The court filing reads:  “In this respect and under the supervision of temporary receiver, the following actions may occur immediately [...] conversion of receivership defendant’s substantial bitcoin holdings to cash on a systematic and reasoned basis.””  The FTC receiver may now hire independent professionals or contractors to ensure the safe transfer of the company’s bitcoins to the court-controlled wallet.  The agency responded to requests for comment, but declined to elaborate further on its latest proceedings in the case.  Managing bitcoin assets  Although a largely procedural update in the ongoing case, the motion may be notable due to the fact that Butterfly Labs is likely to have carried out substantial portions of its business operations in bitcoin.  Butterfly Labs is alleged to have generated bitcoins by conducted extending testing of the bitcoin mining machines it manufactured before delivering the units to consumers, while former employees have been accused of profiting by using products returned by customers for personal use.  An early market leader, Butterfly Labs supported the bitcoin ecosystem through partnerships, and accepted bitcoin as payment for its bitcoin miners – even selecting emerging bitcoin startup BitPay as its exclusive online payment processor for sales of its then-new ASIC miners in 2012.  Butterfly Labs selected BitPay over online payment services provided by Dwolla and PayPal, which lead to record processing figures for the startup.  Court case ahead  Pursuant to the case’s original filing, Butterfly Labs will now move toward an eventual court case.  In the original filing, the FTC sought to secure relief on behalf of the consumers, seeking the authority to refund consumers and sell off any illegally obtained.  Butterfly Labs continues to be preserved as a legal entity and could eventually resume operations, depending on the outcome of its court case. Company executives have previously spoken out about the actions taken by the FTC, asserting that the agency overreached when closing its operations and that the firm will be vindicated in court.  The US District Court for the Western District of Missouri told CoinDesk that the case is still in its earliest stages and that no upcoming court dates have been set.

42377751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Uk3,1415120219,CFTC Commissioner Calls For Flexible Regulation of Digital Currencies,"A commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Mark Wetjen, has spoken out in favour of flexible bitcoin regulation in the derivatives space and beyond.  His statements came in the aftermath of a CFTC webcast, organised last week to discuss a number of questions related to digital currencies.  On the day, more than 5,000 people across the world tuned in to watch the event, which was by far the largest online audience attracted by a CTFC meeting to date. Notably, more of the viewers were from Guangzhou, China, than Washington, DC, according to the commission.  Wetjen has now penned an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, explaining why the meeting had proven so popular and what sort of message the commission had hoped to send.  Disruptive technology  In the article, Wetjen said that the viewers’ comments sent a “clear message” to regulators that they need to take notice and plan for the expansion of blockchain technology that underpins digital currencies. Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrency technologies, he added, have the potential to act as disruptive innovations and leave their mark on the derivatives markets.  Wetjen quoted venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who argued that bitcoin technology could be used to reinvent the entire financial system, decentralising it in the process.  Although he did not share Andreessen's optimism, Wetjen indicated there is a need to seriously consider regulating the new technology:  “That sort of revolution may be a long way off, but bitcoin ... merits serious regulatory consideration. The virtual currency is important to the CFTC because a number of merchants who now accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services have expressed the need to hedge exposures to fluctuations in its value.”  The CFTC was recently presented with bitcoin swap contracts by one registered trading platform, according to Wetjen. Although he did not name the platform in question, the CFTC approved the first bitcoin derivatives offered by TeraExchange in September.  However, TeraExchange will not be alone for long. Wetjen confirmed there are several other trading platforms that intend to list bitcoin derivatives contracts in the future.  Responsibility to markets  Wetjen explained that definition of a commodity under the CFTC’s authorising statute “could be read to include bitcoin”, therefore, he said, the commission would have authority to take action against anyone who attempts to manipulate the digital currency.  “The CFTC certainly has a responsibility to ensure to the greatest extent the integrity of the derivatives markets, including those for bitcoin swaps and other virtual currencies,” said Wetjen.  Regulators should work quickly to understand how these new technologies work and how they can affect different regulatory jurisdictions, he said. The ultimate goal should be to create a flexible regulatory framework and boost public confidence.  Wetjen explained:  “Creating a flexible and rational regulatory framework also is the best way for regulators to respond to previous incidents such as Mt Gox, Liberty Reserve or Silk Road ... That will lay the groundwork for future innovation in virtual currencies.”  While Wetjen admitted that bitcoin’s market cap represents just a tiny fraction of the US financial system, he argued that bitcoin has the potential to provide “tremendous benefits” to unbanked and underbanked users in emerging markets, especially those who using mobile payment systems.  “Bitcoin or similar technologies can be used as platforms for financial innovation in the digital transfer of currency, securities, contracts and sensitive information,” said Wetjen. “To realize these benefits, though, federal regulators and the industry must address the challenges that bitcoin has faced in its brief existence.”  US Capitol Building image via Shutterstock; Mark Wetjen image via CFTC",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/04/cftc-commissioner-calls-for-flexible-regulation-of-digital-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c46c6a74e431b9a620ead285d40e671ad5c3335c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UhX,1415112633,Bitwage Now Lets Any Employee Get Paid in Bitcoin,"Bitwage has announced the beta launch of a new service that allows employees and independent contractors to receive part of their paycheck in bitcoin, even if their employers don’t offer the option.  Called Bitcoin Payroll for the Individual, or BP(i), the launch from California-based startup follows a notable announcement from its competitor BitPay, which revealed that payroll service providers Zuman and Incoin had integrated its payroll API yesterday.  In an interview with CoinDesk, chief strategic officer Jonathan Chester emphasized how the BP(i) product brings a new twist to existing bitcoin payroll solutions landscape, noting the broad reach of Bitwage's solution when compared to the available alternatives.  Chester suggested, however, that the main value proposition for bitcoin payroll services remains the same across the industry. While many merchants have adopted bitcoin processing services, he explained, it remains difficult for bitcoin users to obtain bitcoin in an easy and secure way.  Chester said:  ”One of the good things about the system is that, unlike a lot of other wallet providers and exchanges, you’re trusting them to hold on to their bitcoins. We’re just a conduit to make it so USD will flow into whatever wallet you chose.”  Furthermore, Chester added that the Bitwage service would appeal to individuals whose employers may not be open to the idea of paying wages in bitcoin or offering it as an added service through a bitcoin-friendly payroll provider such as Zuman or Incoin.  The BP(i) is the second formal product from Bitwage, following its employer payroll service, which allows employers to extend bitcoin payroll as an incentive to workers. The company said both solutions are now available to W-2 and 1099 workers in all 50 US states.  Next-day delivery  To enroll in the service, Bitwage users need to first contact their employer or payroll provider to list Bitwage's corporate account as a secondary account for wage payments. Users thereby authorize part of their paycheck to be transferred to Bitwage, converted to bitcoin and sent to their wallet of choice.  “What users are doing is ... setting the percentage of what they want to be in one bank account versus the other,” said Chester. “They can say they want 10% or 50% of their paycheck in bitcoin, and then pick their wallet of choice.”  On payday, Chester explained that funds are sent via direct deposit from the employer to the employee’s designated account for Bitwage. From there, a wire transfer is sent to Bitwage’s partner marketplace, Centralway Ventures-backed Buttercoin.  These funds stay in US dollars on the exchange until the next day, at which time the funds are converted to bitcoin and distributed. Bitwage will allow employee and employer users to receive capital gains reports through the firm's partnership with Gocheto Financials, a New York-based bitcoin advisory firm.  A full overview of Bitwage's terms of service can be found here.  Refining the service  Chester suggested that Bitwage is still seeking to perfect its product and already has a plan in place to improve the speed of the service. Several factors hold up the process, he explained, including the slow speeds of the automated clearing house (ACH) payment services it relies on to move funds from traditional bank accounts.  To offset the chance for volatility during the delay period, Bitwage is offering its service for free while in private beta. Although this will change with the formal launch, Chester indicated the firm will seek to keep fees low once the service does monetize through partnerships that allow Bitwage to obtain competitive pricing.  “In the future we will be partnering with more than just one exchange, to go with the best exchange rate for our clients off of all those exchanges,” Chester said.  Additionally, Bitwage may seek to cap the fees for users of its individual payroll service, although he stressed that any plans for the monetization of the offering are in their early stages.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that users connect their own bank account to Bitwage's service. Users must instead add Bitwage's corporate account as a secondary bank account with their employer or payroll provider.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377746,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73UcV,1415104240,UK Treasury Issues 'Call for Information' on Digital Currencies,"The UK Treasury has issued a 'Call for Information' on digital currencies in order to weigh the risks and benefits offered by the new technology.  The request is intended to provide the government with the information necessary to fully understand digital currencies, as well as to solicit feedback and opinion from all interested parties.  The Call for Information will be open for one month to allow individuals, businesses and other organisations to submit their comments on a wide range of issues.  The document asks 13 questions, ranging from basic information on the potential benefits of digital currencies, through government involvement and regulation, to new services made possible by block-chain technology. The potential non-monetary uses of the block chain are also addressed.  Notably, the Treasury describes the block chain as an innovation that “could represent a fundamental change in how payment systems can be made to work”.  The UK Digital Currency association said it welcomed the Treasury's consultation on digital currencies, adding:  ""We regard this as a positive step for cryptocurrencies and the process is an example of the UK government's forward-thinking approach towards FinTech and technological innovation generally. We anticipate that the UKDCA will be actively involved in supporting the Treasury with comments and feedback throughout the process.""  Promoting innovation and competition  UK Member of Parliament and Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Andrea Leadsom, discussed the issue in a government blog post, entitled Digital currencies: 5 reasons we’re calling for information.  Prior to her election, Leadsom spent 25 years working for British banks and financial institutions. She also served on the Treasury Select Committee from 2010–2014.  The first point outlined by Leadsom is the need to promote innovation and competition in the financial sector. Leadsom explained that the government wants to ensure payments technology “works better” and serves the people that use it on a daily basis.  Leadsom notes that an estimated 20,000 Britons now hold bitcoins and approximately £60m-worth of bitcoins are in circulation in the country. She added that new cryptocurrencies are being developed and that new digital currency businesses are setting up in the UK.  As a result, the government wants to know more about the benefits of digital currencies for users and the economy in general, she says.  In the Call for Information document, the Treasury says it intends to examine the benefits of digital currencies and the barriers faced by businesses in the space. Based on the information gathered through the initiative, the government will decide whether or not action is required, the department says.  Notably, the Treasury also makes a clear distinction between digital currencies and virtual currencies:  “The government considers that virtual currencies differ from digital currencies, in that they are issued and usually controlled by their developers, and used and accepted among the members of a specific virtual community. Virtual currencies as defined are therefore out of the scope of this Call for Information.”  Risks and regulation  In addition to the benefits of digital currencies, the Treasury is also interested in any potential risks. Security and vulnerability in comparison with traditional payment services is one of the concerns, along with use of digital currencies for illicit or illegal purposes.  The Treasury listed a number of risks and criminal activities that could benefit from digital currencies, but at the same time pointed out that outright crime risks may be ""limited"" due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of digital currencies and their reliance on a distributed public ledger.  Potential risks faced by consumers and merchants include security, volatility, lack of international regulation and lack of consumer protection, the Treasury notes.  Leadsom argued that the “safety net” provided by a regulator can give firms and consumers assurances that their interests are protected, thus attracting even more businesses and consumers to the digital currency industry.  Liberal stance on cryptocurrencies  Britain’s overall position on digital currencies can be described as liberal and progressive. London is Europe’s biggest financial hub and, in the past, the government has tried to stay ahead of the curve in terms of regulation and business-friendly policies.  In August, Chancellor George Osborne announced a new initiative to explore the potential role of digital currencies in Britain’s economy and also commissioned a report on the risks and benefits of embracing digital currencies.  Additionally, a recently published FinTech manifesto, backed by more than 150 companies and venture capitalists, urged the government to adopt bitcoin-friendly legislation. And, in June, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced Project Innovate, an scheme designed to support positive developments in FinTech, including digital currency development.  Two British Crown dependencies, such as the Channel island of Jersey and the Isle of Man, have already adopted bitcoin-friendly policies in an effort to attract more digital currency businesses.

42377747,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73Uf1,1415097682,Lawsky: BitLicense May Exempt Non-Financial Blockchain Projects,"New York's proposed BitLicense regulations were not designed to cover second-generation projects and other 'crypto 2.0' blockchain technologies, according to answers from Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) superintendent Benjamin Lawsky.  Questions on how the NYDFS viewed innovations not primarily concerned with currency or exchange of value were put to Lawsky first at a recent presentation on BitLicenses in New York, and then again yesterday by CoinDesk's Stan Higgins at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas.  Work is being done in this area, Lawsky said.  Crypto 2.0 question  This raises questions over whether other forms of value and information transfer not directly emulating that of 'currency' as we know it could, or even should, be regulated in the manner of today's financial products, according to a senior financial industry adviser on compliance issues.  Angus Champion de Crespigny, a New York-based anti-money laundering (AML) expert and senior manager in regulatory compliance technology at a global consulting firm, asked Lawsky for some clarification on the issue at New York's Cardozo School of Law a couple of weeks ago.  Champion de Crespigny then discussed the answer in an article on Consumers' Research, writing:  ""I asked him how the use of second generation non-currency applications would be viewed in the eyes of the BitLicense, considering that the exceptions for personal use only apply to the use case of blockchain technologies as a currency.""  The regulation was not intended to capture or halt businesses working in that area, Lawsky replied. He acknowledged that small amounts of ""currency"" may be transmitted along with non-currency value like information and asset transfers on some crypto 2.0 platforms, but appeared to regard such amounts as insignificant and said the NYDFS was ""still working out how to address that"".  Lawsky's level of technical knowledge appeared impressive, Champion de Crespigny said, and it appeared the NYDFS had done a lot of research into the emerging blockchain technologies and understanding how they work.  No other official or body has yet produced an effective solution on how to regulate these new kinds of instruments, he added, writing:  ""We haven't before had the ability to so easily create new assets that could be stores of value and representations of ownership, computing power, namespace, or any of the other applications that are possible through the block chain.""  Value could soon be transmitted in many different forms, he said, adding that regulators could struggle to keep up. Financial regulation in the past has been ""product based"", and far lighter regulation or monitoring may be more appropriate from here on.  Defining crypto industry  The latest NYDFS answers come as several representatives from the crypto 2.0 community, such as the Mastercoin Foundation and Counterparty team denied claims they had received information requests from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC itself, however, has not commented.  Platforms like NXT Asset Exchange, Counterparty or colored coins could distribute non-currency value in the form of shares or assets, while others like Maidsafe (safecoin), Ripple (XRP) and Ethereum (ether) were proprietary currencies used to drive those networks' primary functions.  Champion de Crespigny's role involves advising on financial regulatory issues, AML and even bitcoin and other digital currencies.  He became interested in emerging blockchain technologies through his own background as a software engineer and 'white hat' hacker. He also set up his firm's cross-competency Digital Finance task force, which is tasked with researching the potential of blockchain and other new consensus technologies.

The new exchange, which has been operating live for two weeks now, allows Malaysians to link local bank accounts for both deposits and withdrawals in the local currency, the ringgit.  In keeping with BitX's goal to provide local services with local staff, customer support is also available in the country's official language, Bahasa Malaysia.  BitX  CEO Marcus Swanepoel told CoinDesk that Malaysia is a ""very tech savvy market"", with bitcoin trading already active at its fringes.  ""[We're] seeing some good trading activity on other platforms (LocalBitcoins, WhatsApp groups etc), so it's always been a key target market for us.""  Offering features at scale  One existing service, btc.my, provides simple buy-sell options with withdrawals to two banks and to date has been the only bitcoin buy-sell platform available online in Malaysia.  BitX Malaysia promises to provide API access, an integrated wallet, a transparent market with full order books and limit orders, and an innovation pipeline. Users will have the usual two-factor authentication and offline 'deep freeze' storage for their bitcoins.  The difference is, Swanepoel added, that BitX is able to supply these features at scale, even if volumes and user numbers increase. This is the main benefit an international operation like BitX provides over smaller independent exchanges in such markets, he believes.  He said:  ""Our API is great to stimulate tech innovation and entrepreneurship in Malaysia, and this is a key growth area for them. So we would like to play strong role going forward.""  The Singapore-based firm announced in April it aimed to open bitcoin exchanges in 12 emerging markets around the world, with local staff in each country.  So far, it has a globally-available wallet service and functioning exchanges in South Africa, Namibia, and Kenya.  Volumes low, awareness building  While overall trading volumes in those locations remain low, Swanepoel said, they are within BitX's expectations and there are positive signs bitcoin awareness and acceptance in each are increasing.  Malaysian companies like electronics retailer i-Pmart and Taximonger are already accepting bitcoin and there are plenty more interested in joining in, Swanepoel said. BitX could provide value to the Malaysian market with its payment processing tools by hedging out bitcoin price volatility.  At the grassroots level, there is also plenty of bitcoin interest in Malaysia. A weekly meetup group gathers at the bitcoin-accepting Capital Nasi Dagang cafe, and there are four active chat groups on messaging app Telegram, with over 199 members.  In August, BitX announced it had sealed a SGD$1m ($824,000) seed funding deal that included Ariadne Capital, Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Opportunity Corp (BOC) and Palo Alto-based financial innovation investor, Carol Realini.
