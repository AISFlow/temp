42379240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWQh,1487798415,Zcash Prices Sink Below $30 in Market First,"The price of the privacy oriented digital currency zcash traded below $30 on most of its major exchanges yesterday, a first for the publicly traded blockchain token launched last October.  The cryptocurrency, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKS, has spent more than 16 hours below $30 today and fallen to as little as $27.83, CoinMarketCap data reveals.  At the time of report, zcash was trading at $27.93, a roughly 6.5% drop in the 24 hours.  Zcash first tested $30 on 13th February, falling to as little as $30.11. However, traders soundly rejected this attempt, causing zcash prices to reach $30.66 that day.  Since then, more tests have been made by traders, though none have been successful in pushing the price through the $30 mark.  Relative price stability  The latest price decline fits into the broader narrative of the cryptocurrency, which launched with sky-high expectations late last year and is still very much seeking to build an initial batch of users and a supporting market.  Overall, the privacy oriented digital currency's price has been relatively stable over the last few months, following a period of wild volatility when the currency went live in late October.  Zcash tokens surged to roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2m) on some exchanges around that time, though this was due to their initial scarcity and slow release.  The price fell below $100 within a month, and has since dropped below other key levels such as $50, following a slow downward trend.  Depending on how long zcash remains below $30, it could build resistance at this particular price level.

42379228,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWBb,1487793262,Cryptsy Class Action Lawyers Launch New Claims Site,"The legal team behind the class action lawsuit against defunct digital currency exchange Cryptsy has launched a new site in a bid to locate potential claimants.  The site, CryptsySettlement.com, details the process by which affected customers of the exchange can submit a claim or to request an exclusion – an option potentially preferred by those hoping to launch their own litigation related to the exchange. Potential claimants have until 17th May to file, with a fairness hearing scheduled for 2nd June.  According to David Silver, one of the attorneys working on the class action suit, the settlement fund has collected over $1m. In October, plaintiffs in the case settled with Lorie Ann Nettles, the ex-spouse of CEO Vernon, who they claimed had benefited from funds received during the operation of the exchange.  That said, any potential payout would need to be approved by the court in Florida. As the site statement explains:  “The Court in charge of this case still has to approve the settlements with the Settling Defendants. Payments will be made if the Court approves the settlements and orders that the settlement funds be distributed, and if any appeals of the Court’s approval of these settlements are resolved in Plaintiffs’ favor. Please be patient.”  The launch comes more than a year after Cryptsy, following months of growing complaints over site problems, withdrawal delays and concerns about its insolvency, abruptly closed its doors after claiming it had been hacked two years prior. The class action lawsuit was filed a day before Cryptsy shut down.  The situation became messier as the months progressed. Court documents obtained by CoinDesk indicated that Cryptsy’s downfall was foreseen by CEO Paul Vernon, who fled to China following the collapse of the exchange. In past comments to CoinDesk, Vernon said that Cryptsy’s insolvency was kept hidden to avoid a “panic”.  In April, following a request from the class action plaintiffs, a Florida court pushed Cryptsy into receivership, setting the stage for customers to seek recourse for the funds they lost.  Settlement site aside, the legal process shows no sign of abating. Late last year, the class action lawyers filed suit against Coinbase, alleging that the digital currency exchange startup was used to clear millions of dollars in illicit proceeds.

42379235,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWHt,1487786703,Danish Police Claim Breakthrough in Bitcoin Tracking,"Danish police are claiming to have developed software for tracing bitcoin transactions that has led to successful drug convictions, according to local reports.  As reported by Berlingske, a new toolkit has reportedly enabled law enforcement officials in Denmark to press forward in cases involving the digital currency. The Danish National Police Cyber Crime Center (NC3) is said to be the department responsible for developing the tracking software.  According to the report, NC3's new breakthrough has attracted interested from the FBI and Interpol.  The cases involved Danish individuals buying large amounts of methamphetamine, ketamine and cocaine via darknet markets and shipping narcotics through the mail. Authorities intercepted the packages prior to the defendants receiving them.  The mailing addresses were then reportedly used to trace the bitcoin transactions.  Kim Aarenstrup, head of NC3, told the publication:  ""We are pretty much unique in the world at this point, because there are not others who have managed to use these tracks as evidence. Everyone looks towards Denmark in this field, and we are in close dialogue with a number of other countries right now, so we can further develop methods and teach them how we do it here.""  The digital currency – and its use among criminal elements – has been on the Danish police's radar as a strategic threat since as early as 2015, public records show.  According to a loose translation, officials expressed concern in an assessment from that year that the tech could enable money launderers to both obscure the source of funds as well as operate outside of a more strictly hierarchical criminal structure.  Outside of that, there is evidence to suggest a possible merit to the claims.  Experts have long sought to make known that bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that identities on the network itself as tied to addresses rather than names or other kinds of personal information. Concerns about transaction tracking have spurred interest in privacy centric currencies like monero (XMR) among the world's dark markets.

42379237,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWMv,1487783123,West Virginia Lawmakers Want to Make Bitcoin Money Laundering a Felony,"Legislators in West Virginia want to make it a felony to launder money with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  West Virginia House Bill 2585, introduced yesterday, updates the state's money laundering statutes in several ways, including the addition of a definition for ""cryptocurrency"", which it then includes in the state's definition of a ""monetary instrument"".  While stopping short of deeming it money, the inclusion is a notable one given the recent push among state legislatures to draft new laws around the technology.  As the bill states:  ""'Cryptocurrency' means digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, and which operates independently of a central bank.""  Those convicted of money laundering in West Virginia face as many as 15 years in prison depending on the charge, as well as thousands of dollars in fines.  Public records indicate that the measure has strong support among members of the legislature, with a total of 11 sponsors and co-sponsors signed on, according to data from LegiScan. The bill has been sent to the West Virginia House Judiciary Committee for further deliberation.  Representatives in Arizona, North Dakota and other US states have pursued a raft of proposals since the start of the year, though the West Virginia bill is the first recent one to focus directly on money laundering.

42379257,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWCr,1487775633,Poland’s Financial Ombudsman Calls for Bitcoin Exchange Regulation,"Poland’s Financial Ombudsman has called on the country’s Ministry of Finance to regulate the local cryptocurrency industry.  The official, Aleksandra Wiktorow, told local radio broadcaster Polskie Radio that her office has filed an official letter to the ministry in which it said that Poland’s cryptocurrency market is experiencing rapid growth and should be subject to regulations that would protect customers of cryptocurrency exchanges.  Wiktorow pointed out that, currently, the sector is not subject to any regulations in Poland. The finance ministry should evaluate and compare the best practices from those countries that have regulated cryptocurrencies, and implement the best instruments, she said.  However, she added the caveat that the regulations “should not be excessive”.  The Financial Ombudsman’s office is planning to publish a report in Q2 of 2017 on the impact of new technologies on financial services, including cryptocurrencies. The report may include the institution’s recommendations for potential regulations that could be applied to the sector.  Wiktorow’s statement is the latest in a number of recent efforts to bring regulation to the Polish cryptocurrency industry.  Last October, the lower chamber of Poland’s Parliament hosted the country's first public consultation that was devoted solely to cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech.  The conference was accompanied by the launch of a working paper that called for the Ministry of Finance to release a tax interpretation covering cryptocurrencies and to issue relevant regulation for startups.

42379229,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWAL,1487773213,Major Banks Use Blockchain Prototype for Live Oil Trade,"Two major European banks have released the initial results of a blockchain prototype focused on oil trading.  The project, called Easy TradING Connect, was unveiled last month as part of a broader blockchain proof-of-concept push by Dutch financial services company ING, and was developed collaboratively with French banking group Société Générale.  The platform was later used to conduct a live oil trade with commodities trading firm Mercuria.  According to the firms involved, the prototype results in a reduction in the time and cost required to process a commodities trade. Specifically, they said that the amount of time it would take a bank to process its end of a trade was reduced from three hours to less than half an hour.  Alistair Cross, Mercuria’s global head of operations, commented on the trial in a statement, saying:  “We are very pleased with the success of this initial test. The blockchain technology allows for access to real-time data and key details of the transaction all in one ecosystem, creating an improved and more flexible user experience.”  While the test marks Mercuria’s first publicly acknowledged work with blockchain, the company’s chief executive Marco Dunand has previously remarked that the tech could result in a significant reduction in operational costs – a statement that seems to have been confirmed by the trial results.  Both ING and Société Générale have explored various blockchain concepts in the past.  ING has made no secret of its work with blockchain in both solo and in collaborative initiatives. SocGen, among other initiatives, is involved in a wide-ranging trade finance project with six other global banks.

42379233,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uW6Z,1487770216,Ethereum Economics Gets Spotlight in Vitalik Buterin EDCON Keynote,"In a new speech this week, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin gave a spotlight to the study of so-called 'cryptoeconomics', the union of cryptography and economics at the heart of public blockchain R&D.  At the ethereum developer conference EDCON 2017, held over two days in Paris, Buterin used his talk to provide a big picture overview why he considers the study of the subject core to his work on ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain by market capitalization.  Topics included how cryptographic puzzle pieces (such as proof-of-work, hashes and more complicated tools like zk-SNARKS) can be paired with forms of economic engineering including incentives and privileges.  While the subject may have seemed educational at first, the talk served to highlight the intellectual backdrop for some of ethereum's more necessary (and contested) ideas for how to improve its protocol.  For example, Buterin noted that the field is likely to inform its highly-anticipated proof-of-stake protocol and possibly lead to the building safer oracle systems that feed ethereum smart contracts outside data.  Before diving in, however, Buterin began the talk with his own definition of the emerging concept.  He told the audience:  ""Cryptoeconomics is about using a collection of cryptographic and economic building blocks in order to build systems that have some desirable informational security properties.""  The importance of punishment  Buterin went on to explore how he is using cryptoeconomics to analyze where blockchain-based systems can go wrong, often referring to bitcoin as a key example and reference point.  Though the main reason that ethereum is pursuing proof-of-stake is because it could prove to be a greener, fairer alternative to bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism, Buterin went as far as to argue that proof-of-stake might also be a more secure, at least in some ways.  Proof-of-work, he argued, is vulnerable to something along the lines of a P + epsilon attack, a way that miners can fool the system.  ""This is one of the reasons why people want to push over to proof-of-stake,"" he said.  The comments come months after ethereum first revealed its plans to switch to a new consensus mechanism, and an outstanding question remains whether this experimental R&D can keep pace with user and developer expectations.  Despite the claims that proof-of-stake works better, it's worth noting that proof-of-stake hasn’t been deployed on a large-scale network, and some technical experts still doubt that it will work.  Still, Buterin's point was that cryptoeconomics can be the frame of mind for finding new solutions.  Together cryptography and economics can be used to goad actors to act the right way, he said. One way to do that is to punish actors who are doing wrong — to push them to act in a way that benefits everyone. Usually that means taking away their money.  ""Notice that this is a deviation from Satoshi and the holy book,"" he said.  Awaiting use cases  Buterin went on to explain how ethereum researchers are applying the subject to invent new properties that Casper, its planned proof-of-stake algorithm, needs.  Borrowing from traditional distributed systems theory, he calls one feature that it needs ""auditable safety,"" which is to be able to prove that one-third of the validators are faulty.  Once it proves that, the system can ""kick them again and again,"" as Buterin put it, referring to the negative incentives a protocol can establish.  In other words, the protocol can snatch up a ration of the security deposits that the misbehaving actors originally stored on the network.  The second property that it needs is ""plausible liveness,"" or confidence that the protocol won't stall or come to a stop, he posited. In terms of ethereum, that means that the network needs to continue moving so that transactions and smart contracts can continue to go through.  Beyond that, there are other areas he highlighted for further research.  Ultimately, he ended his talk with a list of open technical problems, including censorship resistance and scalable validation, both of which could emerge as obstacles on its planned proof-of-stake rollout.

42379236,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWLf,1487755540,P2P Bitcoin Lender Bitbond Raises $1.2 Million in New Funding,"Peer-to-peer bitcoin loan market Bitbond has raised $1.2m in new funding.  The web platform, which connects lenders and borrowers to facilitate the distribution of loans denominated in bitcoin, received the new funding largely from a group of angel investors, some of whom already have stakes in the startup.  The round was led by Şekip Can Gökalp, founder of Mobilike, a Turkey-based mobile ad network formed in 2009, and that was acquired last year.  Other investors include Janis Zech and Andreas Bodczek, who founded ad tech startup Fyber, and Alexander Graubner-Müller, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based online lender Kreditech.  According to Bitbond representative Chris Grundy, most of the funding will be devoted to business development and expansion. Bitbond, which is based in Berlin, has raised more than $2m to date.  Radoslav Albrecht, Bitbond’s CEO, added in a statement:  “The additional resources will help us to continue realizing our mission which is to make lending and borrowing globally accessible. We are happy to have such experienced investors supporting us on this exciting journey.”  The funding comes during a time of change for the broader bitcoin peer-to-peer lending market.  BitLendingClub  announced in early December that it would, over the months ahead, begin closing down parts of its business, citing an unfriendly regulatory environment.  When reached for comment at the time, CEO Kiril Gantchev cited contacts with the Bulgarian government – and pending regulatory requirements – as the major impetus behind the site’s decision to to close. BitLendingClub is expected to completely halt services sometime in August.  Fellow P2P bitcoin market BTCJam, also citing regulatory concerns, moved to exit the US market last year.

42379241,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7uWRx,1487739647,Northern Trust Goes Live With IBM-Powered Private Equities Blockchain,"Northern Trust revealed today it has been discreetly running what may be the world's first functioning private equities blockchain.  Custom built for Switzerland-based management firm Unigestion, the platform was co-developed by Northern Trust and IBM using Hyperledger's Fabric code base. Notably, the distributed ledger features an active node that is already providing real-time data to a European regulator.  However, the increased transparency and speed are just part of the reason why the bank with $6.7tn assets under custody decided to build the platform.  According to bank president Peter Cherecwich, the most significant business advantage the blockchain solution offers its clients is an accelerated time to market for a new crop of high-tech private equities funds.  The president of Northern Trust’s corporate and institutional services, Cherecwich called the shorter time to market a ""huge advantage"" for customers.  Cherecwich said:  ""The biggest benefit for the clients, and for the ultimate investor, is this whole process will make the time to market for a new fund much faster. Those dollars that are today sitting on the sidelines waiting to be invested will be invested a lot quicker.""  According to the parties involved, development on the blockchain implementation started last year when Northern Trust contacted IBM to explore how the technology might simplify private equity, a known pain point with relatively few, but highly complicated transactions.  Instead of high-frequency transactions that have tested blockchain’s ability to scale, the private equities industry, worth an estimated $4tn, consists of large investments from a few parties over long periods of time.  ""It's labor intensive,"" said Cherecwich. ""And it really seemed like this would be a very good problem to solve with this new technology.""  A living blockchain  While both IBM and Northern Trust have previously announced proofs-of-concept, today's announcement of a functioning blockchain is a first of its kind.  Specifically, counterparties in Unigestion's blockchain-based private equities fund will each power their own node, including investment managers, general partners, limited partners, fund administrators, auditors and regulators.  The regulatory node itself is being overseen by the UK-based Guernsey Financial Services Commission, which regulates 2,000 licensees from the banking sector and other financial services around Europe.  Though nodes run by regulators will have broad access to the data, it will be the same type of information they already have, but on a real-time basis.  ""If you're a part of the Guernsey Financial Services Commission, your membership will allow you to see more of the ledger because you've been granted permission,"" IBM fellow and vice president of blockchain technology Jerry Cuomo told CoinDesk.  Access to those regulatory nodes and other nodes on the network is secured via IBM's hardware security modules (HSM), offered as part the company's high security business network custom-built for blockchain users.  ""We run this ultra high-security blockchain network by taking the Hyperledger Fabric and melding it into this ultra-secure environment,"" Cuomo said, adding:  ""It doesn't only leave cookie crumbs if your keys have been tampered with, actually, the hardware implodes on itself.""  Blockchain bottom line  With only a single client at the time of launch, Cherecwich tells CoinDesk transaction volume on the blockchain so far has been ""obviously small"".  However, the aim is to create more complex products in the future, and to attract new clients with the quicker time to launch, helping its customers both make and save money.  Traditionally, changes to a private equity fund might be initiated by the administrator's lawyer, who then contacts each participating fund's lawyer, a process that can involve between 10 and 30 individuals, said IBM partner and blockchain vice president, Kevin Pleiter.  On average, Pleiter estimates a change to a private equity can take as long as six months, and account for 10% of total value put into a fund.  ""Today, the way the private equity market works is the lawyers sit in the middle,"" Pleiter told CoinDesk.  ""They become the trust of the parties. What blockchain has done is said, we don’t need to transact through people.""  Call to action  But additional participants will likely be waiting at least a few more months before being admitted to the blockchain.  According to Cherecwich, his company is conservative at its core, in spite of the push into blockchain solutions, and as such, its planned growth trajectory is equally reserved.  Cherecwich points to the bank’s minimal headlines leading up to today’s announcement as evidence of a discreet strategy.  He said he's in no rush to add the second and third clients to the service, calling the process for choosing new users ""selective"" in a statement.  Prior to adding additional clients he says the bank intends to spend the next two or three months collecting data on what works and what doesn’t.  Cherecwich concluded:  ""Like my mom told me, one step at at time. Let's launch this, and make sure the client’s happy.""
