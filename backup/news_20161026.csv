42427120,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPph,1477503301,"A Lower Block Time Could Help Bitcoin Scale, But Will It Work?","A small tweak to bitcoin could have a big impact.  This has been the central point of contention in bitcoin's ""block size debate"", a long-running dispute over whether to lift a hardcoded limit on the amount of data that can be included in each block of transactions.  One side sees increasing the block size as an easy way to boost the number of transactions processed on the network, potentially expanding bitcoin’s user base. Those opposed to the move worry about the consequences (think centralization and instability) of such a change, or at least question the need to lift the block size in the near-term.  There are other pieces to bitcoin that can be changed or moved around, and any change can make a big difference for the overall health of the network – good or bad.  One data-heavy presentation from the developer conference Scaling Bitcoin earlier this month explored how changing parameters can affect the network, like how a tweak to the frequency at which blocks are created might be one way to easily grow transaction capacity.  Using data pulled from their open source simulator of a proof-of-work blockchain (bitcoin and ethereum are two such blockchains), researchers from ETH Zürich argued that bitcoin could securely reduce its block time from 10 to 1 minute.  The idea is that the change doesn't impact security negatively, but still boosts the possible number of transactions on the network. So, the argument goes, it's better overall.  Arthur Gervais, a PhD student in the Institute of Information Security at ETH Zürich, told CoinDesk:  ”According to my research the one-minute block interval seems like the most plausible. I don’t mean that it provides sufficient security, but that it would provide the same security as bitcoin has today.”  How does this approach grow capacity? The logic is simple: More blocks mean more transactions.  The research effort joins a number of other ideas focused on increasing bitcoin’s transaction capacity, including SegWit, Lightning, and other proposals from Scaling Bitcoin, such as Schnorr signatures and the ambitious plan to reshuffle bitcoin via client-side validation. Alternative bitcoin implementations, including Unlimited and Classic, seek to scale by raising the block size cap.  The 'block time' debate?  Tweaking a parameter to boost capacity – does that remind you of anything?  Bitcoin’s block size, mentioned before, has long been discussed as a way to expand capacity. So, does this mean that we’ll be moving on from the “block size debate” to the “block time debate”?  Not according to Gervais. He sees his project more as a way to compare blockchains with objective measures, and to gauge how changes could affect bitcoin, so that developers can make clearer decisions.  “If people want to scale without sacrificing security, they have several options. I think it’s always good to have the choice. That’s why we’ve been doing this work,” he said.  Gervais continued:  “There has not been a sufficient understanding of the implications of changes to the – not only block size or block time – but security provisions in general. People are creating all these new altcoins and blockchains and I think we first need to take a step back and see what can be done with the current systems.”  Others also had a cautious attitude toward a lower block time interval.  “From my perspective these are propositions that are high risk while having uncertain rewards,” said Alexandre Bergeron, who consults for bitcoin companies. “It is one of those proposition that may sound good on paper yet have considerable impact network wise and come with unintended consequences.”  He argued that the combination of game theory and financial incentives holding bitcoin together is a ""balancing act."" It’s another lesson in measuring tradeoffs; developers think that the network requires a specific mix of settings and parameters, or security of the overall network might be compromised.  ""We still have a long way to go until we can be comfortable with our assumptions about the incentives already in place,” Bergeron added, concluding that these sorts of changes are a ""long-term venture.”  Gervais maintains that it's a possible way to help to scale bitcoin, but he isn't necessarily pushing for the change.  “We have no public opinion on what should or shouldn’t be done,” he said.  All possible cases  Besides some vague notion that it will leave funds safe, what does blockchain security mean in cryptocurrency?  If conditions aren’t right, weird behavior that makes the network less secure can become more prevalent. These events include double spending (a user’s ability to spend their bitcoins more than once) or selfish mining (when a miner can cheat to earn more bitcoins at the expense of other miners).  The ""stale rate"" represents how often miners find blocks that aren’t ultimately added to the blockchain. Too many stale blocks can potentially lead to increased mining centralization and can make the blockchain easier to attack.  So, by looking at the stale block rate, engineers can determine how well it would affect the blockchain’s security. If this number is higher, that’s a point of insecurity.  That's what Gervais and the rest of the Zurich-based research team did to determine that a one minute block interval is the most feasible.  “We simulated all possible cases,"" Gervais said.  The experimental results show how the team measured block sizes from 0.1MB to 16MB and block intervals going from 0.5 seconds to 25 minutes, looking to see how the stale block rate changed at each and every level.  But still, as with many other blockchain setting changes, the story is complicated.  Bitcoin Core contributor Greg Maxwell was skeptical, advocating for a longer block time on reddit. He argued that the block time question is tricky, because if it's too low, then the network could see a quick drop-off in security.  ""Since we can only get it approximately right, we should strongly prefer being slightly too long vs slightly too short,"" he said. Maxwell also highlighted how, in some cases, it takes longer for blocks to propagate across the network – something a higher block time can help with.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | RESEARCH,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/26/a-lower-block-time-could-help-bitcoin-scale-but-will-it-work,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b549de4c5310e2997aea44e9c549989758f12674-1500x470.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42427104,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPJh,1477499948,AT&T is Seeking a Patent for a Bitcoin-Powered Server,"US telecom giant AT&T is seeking a patent for a kind of home subscriber server that utilizes a blockchain.  The application, filed on 6th April and published on 6th October, outlines a “decentralized and distributed secure home subscriber server device”. It was filed by Roger Piqueras Jover and Joshua Lackey, both of whom worked as researchers at AT&T before being hired as security architects for Bloomberg LP.  A home subscriber server performs authentication and media delivery functions for those who, for example, have a television subscription. According to the application, AT&T wants to boost the security of these multimedia delivery networks by distributing the nodes that store and transmit the information – that’s where the blockchain comes in.  AT&T is seeking to patent both the proposed device itself as well as the method of using it. Perhaps both notably, the application outlines how it would be preferable to leverage the bitcoin blockchain as opposed to an internal, private network, though this approach is outlined in the application as well.  The authors explain:  “.... in cases where the decentralized and distributed secure home subscriber server system utilizes the bitcoin blockchain, advantage can be taken of the plethora of nodes contributing and maintaining the security of bitcoin transactions.”  The application goes on to cite how a high number of nodes within the proposed network would allow it to continue operating under attack conditions.  “...in the event of a node (e.g. base station device) being down or overwhelmed by an overloading attack, the disclosed distributed secure home subscriber server system operation would be unaltered and only mobile devices under the coverage of a victim base station device would be affected,” the authors explain.  The patent represents the first known application of the technology by the US telecom. Last month, social media observers spotted a job listing for a ""senior blockchain developer"", though that listing was not available online at press time.  AT&T declined to comment when reached.

42427124,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPrh,1477491732,Swift Fights to Stay Relevant in A Blockchain World,"Can Swift stay relevant in a world of blockchain?  Swift, founded in 1973 with the aim of standardizing how cross-border payments are sent, is the epitome of a middleman. It sits between many of the banks worldwide, making money off the fees it charges when its members sent transactions between one another.  Since its founding, the number of Swift member banks has grown from 239 to more than 11,000. Last year, the ""cooperative society"" sent 6.1 billion financial messages on behalf of its members, earning €710m in operating revenue.  Then came the blockchain, and in many ways, all that money is up for grabs.  By providing a shared platform for exchanging transactions in real-time, the technology has led some industry middlemen to reevaluate their roles.  Swift isn't planning to go down without a fight, according to those on the front lines working to help ensure the payment network remains relevant. Yet that doesn't mean it's unwilling to change.  The organization is spearheading a new payments initiative, led by some of the world's largest banks, that approximates the functionality of blockchain. Swift has also pursued a broad collaborative effort alongside startups, looking to adapt to both the technological and cultural winds of change that are shaping finance today.  A new foundation  At the heart of this effort is a plan to reinvent how Swift functions at its core.  Released as a pilot last month, the Global Payments Initiative is aimed at boosting transparency and speeding up the time in which it takes to complete a transaction.  In September, Swift CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt told an audience of 8,000 people at Sibos that his company was looking at blockchain as a way to further enhance the GPI.  One of the 10 global banking executives leading Swift’s GPI Vision Group, which is tasked with laying out the long-term goals of the platform, says that his team is working to anticipate the potentially disruptive — and beneficial — forces of blockchain.  BNY Mellon Treasury Services head of global product management Tony Brady told CoinDesk:  ""While we’re addressing the problems with cross-border payments with the technologies that are already available, that we already know are scalable, secure.... We want to start to evaluate whether emerging technology helps us in some way.""  According to Swift, the GPI is being designed to reduce transaction completion times from as long as five days to a single day or less. Potential areas of improvement include an even more transparent fee structure and, in some cases, near-instantaneous settlement times. More than 80 global banks are set to use the new platform when it goes live next year.  Yet working with the existing leaders in the financial industry will only go so far – especially when the competition itself is increasingly coming from the startup space.  Beyond legacy banks  On 23rd September, Marcus Treacher, the former chairman of Swift’s corporate advisory group announced that his company had successfully tested a way to conduct cross-border transactions.  The only wrinkle: he was no longer working for Swift.  Treacher is now the global head of strategic accounts for Ripple, a distributed ledger startup that had just formed an alternative payments network comprised of seven existing Swift members.  With the promise of real-time payments and 100% fee disclosures prior to transaction, the message to Swift was increasingly clear: innovate, acquire or disappear.  As Swift continues to take steps towards refining the GPI and recruiting new users, the payment platform is tapping into the same startups culture that might one day disrupt it. In fact, it’s Swift’s culture itself that is perhaps most in need of change if it is to remain relevant, according to Kevin Johnson, the payments firm’s head of innovation programs.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Johnson said it was no coincidence that there were more startups present at the Sibos event in Geneva than ever before.  ""It’s something that we, Swift, want to bring into our own corporate culture,"" said Johnson, who also co-hosted the Kickstart Accelerator for another group of startups at Sibos. ""We’re engaging with the startups to learn some of that culture and bring some of that inside as well.""  Schooled by startups  Swift isn't just inviting startups into the room – it's actively supporting their efforts.  In addition to a startup village populated by 25 local fintech startups, Johnson’s Innotribe, a startup accelerator hosted within Swift, paid for the 10 winners of its startup challenge and three winners of its first-ever industry challenge to attend.  Tasked to help Swift use blockchain technology to build a better bond, the three winning startups were awarded $100k contracts based on their early-stage work. But in exchange for that cash, Swift took no equity in the companies. Instead, Johnson said what his company hoped to gain from the blockchain winners was insight into their company culture.  The winner of one of those contracts is Sergey Nazarov, the founder of SmartContract.com. Nazarov built a smart bond service that he argues could serve as a bridge between Swift's old way of doing business and a new future.  Nazarov's proof-of-concept uses a smart contract to calculate its own LIBOR rate and create a bond payable in real time with a Swift message instead of a cryptocurrency. The bond then keeps track of its own history, in a sense, in a similar way that every bitcoin preserves its entire provenance.  He argued that handing over some of Swift's ""core services"" could save it money in the long run.  ""[Smart contracts] are cheaper because instead of a bank shuttling data between three departments across six to 10 databases, involving a ton of people, you write into the contract, that you will get this data from this place, you will compute this operation,"" he explained. ""When it does that, all the parties can look at it and rely on it for their internal systems to do the one small thing they need to do.""  What 'efficiency' really means  In reality though, the line between disruptor and disrupted is a blurry one indeed, especially when these upstarts partner with the legacy firm.  Thorsten Peisl, the founder of Rise Financial Technologies, was another recipient of a $100k Swift contract. The former blockchain lead at State Street’s emerging technology division is currently building a permissioned distributed network for multi-asset and multi-currency settlement across borders.  Peisl argued that ""it’s naïve to think"" Swift or any other legacy infrastructure providers will sit on the sidelines while being potentially boxed out by a new technology.  After all, Swift isn’t really a middleman at all. It’s actually 2,328 middlemen employed by the firm – all with a vested interest for it to survive.  Peisl argues that when a new technology like blockchain arrives, the resulting gray area leads to ""shifting jobs"", but not necessarily lost jobs. Even if banks can someday transact instantly with one another, he believes Swift's role as the gatekeeper for a closed, highly regulated network will always be necessary.  ""If we succeed or someone like us succeeds then clearly the role of Swift is evolving and will change,"" he said. ""But there will always be a role.""

42427109,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzPTh,1477489426,"Singapore Central Bank Inks Blockchain Deals With India, South Korea","It’s been a busy week on the blockchain front for Singapore’s central bank.  On 22nd October, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) signed an agreement with the government of Andhra Pradesh, a coastal state in India, to collaborate on blockchain development projects.  According to statements, the partnership will include a specific focus on digital payments, as well as the creation of educational resources related to the tech. MAS and the Andhra Pradesh government committed to broader discussions over regulation focused on “innovations in financial services”.  The goal, the two institutions said, is to spur the development of a new fintech startup hub in the Indian state.  J. A. Chowdary, a technology advisor to the Andhra Pradesh government, said in a statement:  ""The knowledge exchange between the startups in Singapore and Visakhapatnam will not only create high quality job opportunities in FinTech but also help provide market access for implementation in both countries. We see this association as the first step towards creation of the FinTech story of the country.""  Two days later, the MAS finalized a deal with the government of South Korea, drawn along similar financial technology lines. At the heart of the agreement is the plan to develop “joint innovation projects” focused on mobile payments and data management.  “This agreement lays the groundwork for deeper FinTech collaboration between Singapore and South Korea,” Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer for the MAS, said in a statement.  Singapore’s central bank has played an active role in developing blockchain applications since as early as last year, when it unveiled a $225m fintech investment plan that included funding for technology projects. At the time, it said it was working to create a new kind of recordkeeping system that uses blockchain.  The MAS also began pushing for new regulations for bitcoin startups earlier this year. In August, the institution said that it was looking to create a “flexible” framework for startups working in the space.
