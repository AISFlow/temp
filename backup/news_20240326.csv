Some analysts have shared their predictions and thoughts on LINK, suggesting keeping an eye on the token and its long-term performance. Related Reading: Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst What Is LINK’s Next Steppingstone? Recently, Chainlink announced its partnership with blockchain platform Avalanche and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum blockchains using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). As reported by NewsBTC, the partnership aims to facilitate the “access, trade, and seamless settlement of tokenized assets across networks in different currencies in a process called Delivery vs. Payment (DvP).” The crypto community appeared to receive the news well. X users expressed their positive sentiments towards the collaboration and Chainlink’s token. The sentiment has seemingly translated to LINK’s performance, as the token’s price soared 9% in the last 24 hours. Crypto analyst and trader The Lord of Entry shared his prediction for LINK. In the X post, the trader highlights that the token’s performance in the past day had been strong as it broke above the $18.5 resistance level. Chainlink’s LINK unsuccessfully tested the resistance zone over the past week after falling below it on March 18. $LINK 4hr – #LINK has been strong today, but now banging into some resistance – if it can flip this into support your next big target is around 28#LINKusdt pic.twitter.com/YlCDRDOFTq — @TheLordofEntry (@thelordofentry) March 26, 2024 The token continued the upward trajectory throughout the day after successfully rising above the $18.5 price. In the early hours of Tuesday, LINK surged above the $20 mark but faced resistance near the $20.5 range. According to the trader, if the token can break above this level and turn it into a support zone, the next big target for LINK would be the $28 price range. As of this writing, LINK tested this new resistance level, which has been rising above it twice in the past hour. The token reached $20.6 in the first attempt and briefly surpassed the $20.7 price range during the second attempt. However, the token momentarily failed to flip the resistance zone and fell below $20.5 again. Chainlink’s “Very Strong” Long-Term Performance Despite the failed attempts, LINK’s price surged 9% in the past 24 hours. Interest in the token has seemingly risen in the same timeframe as its market activity increased by 55.19%, reaching a daily trading volume of $539.9 million. Its market capitalization also increased by 8.16% in the past day, reaching $12.02 billion. Chainlink is the 14th-largest cryptocurrency by this metric, according to CoinMarketCap data. Moreover, LINK has shown a remarkable 182.6% performance in the last year. As a result, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared some notes on LINK, suggesting that it shouldn’t be actively traded. Sherpa stated that the token is a better fit to “buy and hold” as it is a “safe coin that is going to do strong numbers.” $LINK: A few notes w. this one- -you shouldn't be actively trading this.

Ultimately, Sherpa predicts the price will “consolidate for a bit longer before its next move.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Momentum Reignites As The Bulls Aim For $4K Chainlink hits $20.6 in the 3-day chart chart.

Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Will Reach $6 Pseudonymous crypto analyst Mikybull has been bullish on the XRP price for a long time, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to, once again, reiterate their stance that the altcoin is going to do well.

However, like the rest of the crypto market, XRP ended up dipping as the Bitcoin price crashed from $73,000 to $61,000. But now that the market is starting to recover, the crypto analyst believes that the altcoin is primed for a big move. Over the course of March, Mikybull has consistently talked about this prediction, especially as the price retested various resistance points. Then, on Monday, March 25, the crypto analyst shared another chart showing that the XRP price has completed its retest and is ready to move upward. $XRP It has concluded its retest and it’s now preparing for an explosive upward move🚀 🎯Targets: $1-$6 https://t.co/3Vsr67s32z pic.twitter.com/Dbdu2kVhpa — Mikybull 🐂Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) March 25, 2024 Mikybull shared that the targets for this move lie between $1 and $6, with the upper end of this target being an 833% move from its current price. When Will The XRP Price Hit This Target? While Mikybull does not present a particular timeframe in their analysis, the charts shared provide some insight into when they expect this move to occur for XRP. Just like in 2017, the crypto analyst expects the rally to take place in the same year as the breakout from the symmetrical triangle, which means it could happen this year.

Crypto Expert Predicts Where Price Is Headed Next The breakout could happen toward the middle of the year and this would mean that it would happen after the Bitcoin halving is completed. This is not surprising given that the Bitcoin halving is regarded as the ultimate bull signal and altcoins rally once Bitcoin’s price picks up. Presently, the XRP price is showing a lot of strength after rallying 11.73% in the last week. It is currently trading at $0.648 at the time of writing, with a market cap of $35.5 billion, which makes its the 6th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

42391118,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXTv1,1711489362,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Airdrop 'Points'","Who doesn't want free money?  Points, the quasi-loyalty programs meant to incentive use of blockchain applications by offering scrip that might in time be redeemed for something valuable, tap into something primal in our reptilian brains: our hardcoded desire for gambling.  0xRooter is the founder of Solend and Suilend protocols.  The dopaminergic system helped our ancestors take risks that brought us to today. Without high-risk-high-reward actions, we wouldn't be in this golden era of technology (which we use to flip meme coins at 1,000 TPS).  Stories of Regular Joes earning life-changing money prompt an internal monologue of ""what if?"" When ""everyone is getting hilariously rich and you're not,"" we FOMO.  Airdrops have been rewarding for many. But projects have caught onto the growth-hacking potential and recent trend of ""points,"" and the process is already being abused. Developers know what they're doing, we know what they're doing, they know we know what they're doing. Points today are predatory, lazy and are really just gambling.  See also: As Crypto 'Points' Farming Grows, So Does Risk of Vague Promises  The history of incentivizing crypto adoption  To understand points, it's important to understand how they came to be.  Liquidity mining was pioneered by Compound, a move which kicked off the “DeFi Summer” of 2020. Lending and borrowing on Compound was incentivized via COMP tokens. Soon, a dozen projects offered similar incentives with their own twist. One of them, Sushiswap, incentivized liquidity provisioning (LP) positions with its own token, SUSHI, to “vampire attack” Uniswap, which hadn’t yet launched its own governance token. This pressured Uniswap to launch UNI, which it did with a retroactive airdrop for early users. (Some joked it was the ""stimulus for Ethereum"" since it was bigger than a COVID stimulus check.)  The widespread reach of the UNI airdrop was a huge catalyst for decentralized finance, attracting hordes of new users. This same process of airdropping tokens has been copied by numerous different protocols on numerous different chains since — with varying degrees of differentiation.  Then came Blur in 2022, the pioneer of points. Users could earn points by trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on its marketplace. By keeping earning criteria opaque, farming could be resisted in favor of real usage. With the incredible success of Blur, it wasn't long before every project had a points program.  A common misconception is that points in DeFi are an evolution of loyalty points that airlines, hotels and cafés offer. Just because DeFi projects and cafés both call them ""points"" doesn't mean they're the same thing. They have major differences in history and usage, making them separate taxonomies. One is a low-stakes loyalty program, the other intentionally preys on hype to pump metrics and farm fees.  Points today  The current points meta is predatory. There's no known reward, no timeframe and changes can be made arbitrarily. Rewards could be valueless or never be distributed (what some call “forever points” because they’re never redeemed for valuable tokens). Goalposts can continuously be moved back. All at the expense of users who pay real fees and opportunity cost.  Projects are running wild with false advertising, promoting black boxes in a world where transparency should be paramount. And they're pushing things beyond what the pioneers did. Blur launched their token within five months, but there are projects now that have been milking their users for over a year now.  How points should be designed  The issue with points is not points themselves, but how they're being used to prey on users. However, it's possible to design a points program that is beneficial to both the project and users.  The main changes that need to be made are disclosing rewards upfront, communicating a timeframe and committing.  See also: Solana's Biggest DeFi Lender Almost Got Rekt  Solend, the project I founded, did this with ""Points Season 1,"" where a minimum rewards pool (which could only be increased) was disclosed and a timeframe was communicated. The rewards pool started with 100,000 SLND tokens and was later increased to include 100,000 PYTH (the governance token for Pyth Network) and 10 Tensorians (the NFT collection launched by Tensor, the leading NFT marketplace on Solana).  Path forward  The path forward for points requires a commitment to transparency and fairness. By being upfront, projects can deliver the dream of transparent, decentralized finance rather than building the systems we took issue with in the first place. By prioritizing ethics, we can transform points from a speculative gamble into a useful tool for engagement, retention and rewards.

Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) March 26, 2024 Did Ripple Favor Select Institutional Investors? One of the assertions made in the SEC document and pointed out by XRP community lawyer Bill Morgan was a key revelation that Ripple engaged in discriminatory pricing practices, offering substantial discounts on XRP tokens to a select group of institutional investors. This practice, the SEC alleges, created an uneven playing field, benefiting certain “favored” investors at the expense of others. Related Reading: Top Analyst’s Bold Prediction: XRP Set To Skyrocket 1,500% XRP community lawyer Bill Morgan provided a summary of this aspect, highlighting the potential damage to Ripple’s standing in the eyes of institutional investors. “The SEC’s brief is a possible problem for Ripple beyond this case. The SEC is able to argue that there were two groups of institutional sales investors (it calls them favored and unfavored) and Ripple offered one group significant discounts in XRP price over the other group that did not receive them,” Morgan noted via X (formerly Twitter). He further delved into the SEC’s claim that such practices harmed the “unfavored” group of investors to the tune of $480 million, a figure based on assumptions that Morgan suggests need thorough examination. “The evidence of causation of this alleged harm seems thin,” he added. The SEC’s filing goes on to argue that Ripple’s sales tactics, specifically the discounted sales to certain investors, directly contributed to downward pressure on the overall market price of XRP. This point is not just a matter of regulatory compliance but also raises the specter of legal action from those institutional investors who may feel aggrieved by not being privy to the same discounts. Related Reading: Is Ripple Behind The XRP Price Crash? Massive Selling Spree Sparks Concern Morgan also touched upon the ramifications of these actions being classified as investment contracts by the SEC, saying, “As these sales to institutions were found to be investment contracts, it means that this offering of discounts to some but not other institutions is the very disclosure according to the SEC that should have, and would have been made to the institutions, if the sales to institutions had been registered.” He further noted that these claims by the SEC are also not great for the reputation of Ripple. “Not sure this revelation is great for Ripple’s reputation with institutional investors,” Morgan remarked. Ripple CLO Alderoty Responds Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, also issued a broad response to the SEC’s filing via X, vehemently disputing the narrative presented by the regulatory body. Alderoty stated, “Our response will be filed next month, but as we all have seen time and again, this is a regulator that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.” He further attacked the SEC for its illegitimate reasoning, stating: “They stayed true to form here. Rather than faithfully apply the law, the SEC remains bent on wanting to punish and intimidate Ripple – and the industry at large. We trust the Court will approach the remedies phase fairly.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.64365.

42391125,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXUa3,1711486631,The Bitcoin Halving Could Accelerate Consumer Adoption of BTC,"As the world gets into a frenzy around the coming Bitcoin halving – and the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} as a result – it’s important to take a moment for a reality check.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin “halving” in April 2024.  David Bailey is chief marketing officer for Azteco.  The halving is a non-event for the vast majority of the world. At its core, it’s a simple evolution in how much the people who process bitcoin transactions get paid. All electronic payments, whether made via credit card, Venmo or the tap of a phone, require some kind of processing.  Bitcoin transactions are no exception.  On-chain bitcoin transactions are processed by the vast network of so-called “miners,” who validate and record transactions on the blockchain. To date, these miners receive two types of rewards: a block reward, paid by the bitcoin network, and a network transaction fee, also paid in bitcoin by the person making the transaction.  The coming “halving” reduces the first reward by half. There’s nothing surprising in this. Rather, the halving is a predetermined part of the system, designed to regulate the supply of new bitcoins in a predictable manner until the maximum of 21 million bitcoins have been issued. Sometime in the next century, given current trends, the block reward for processing bitcoin payments will halve until it goes toward zero.  But the result of the decrease in the block reward has a substantial impact on the second, the network transaction fee. The increase in transaction fees is a stark reminder that the supply of bitcoin is, by design, limited. Once 21 million bitcoins have been issued (as block rewards), there’s no way for anyone to create more bitcoins or alter the supply, as governments often do with their own fiat currencies.  This is why some people liken bitcoin to “digital gold.” It’s not a bad comparison but there are two important differences to remember: First, the supply of bitcoin is fixed at 21 million bitcoins. The supply of gold is finite, but it’s not fixed and known. After all, who knows what vast gold reserves might be discovered tomorrow?  Second, bitcoin is infinitely divisible. As bitcoin gets more valuable, people will transact subdivisions of value (for example, there are 100 million satoshis in one bitcoin). Gold is physical and you can’t subdivide it infinitely as it gets more valuable, though new digital gold entrants are attempting to make gold act more like, well, bitcoin.  The halving reminds people that the supply of bitcoin is truly limited and that demand is increasing, driving up the price of bitcoin in the long term. As something becomes more valuable, more people will want to use it, and so the cycle continues.  In the near term, the largest everyday impact of the halving will be a broader consumer shift to processors with lower-cost transaction fees. Enter the Lightning Network, a second-layer network that bitcoin transactions outside of the main blockchain. The Lightning Network processes peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions almost instantaneously, just like on the main blockchain.  The difference? The Lightning Network’s transaction fee is just a few cents. For regular people – those making small transfers or using a bit of bitcoin to purchase goods and services – this will become the preferred mode of transacting; it’s fast and it’s cheap. The relative ease of transacting with the Lightning Network may also accelerate consumer adoption.  See also: Exploring Bitcoin's Lightning Network  On-chain transactions won’t go away, of course. People will continue to use the blockchain to document large transactions – the same way that you’d use a wire payment, not a debit card, to purchase a car or house.  As on-chain network transaction fees continue to increase, network congestion will be offset by the shift to second-layer networks, which will in turn encourage a greater volume of transactions, some of which will happen on the main blockchain, which will push up processing fees. Ultimately, even with the rise of second-layer networks like Lightning, the net result will most likely be a steady increase in network fees as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted.  And that’s a good thing.  The more bitcoin acts like other currencies, the more comfortable people will be using it. While most of us are not miners, many of us are currently financially disenfranchised: Today there are more than a billion adults in the world who have a smartphone but no bank account. These people are digitally connected to the rest of the world, but lack the benefits of participating in a global financial system.  For them, bitcoin is a strong solution for their daily spending or personal savings – but only if it’s fast, reliable, inexpensive and accessible. The halving, by spurring the adoption of second-layer networks like Lightning, makes bitcoin just that.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MINING | BTG,David Bailey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/26/the-bitcoin-halving-could-accelerate-consumer-adoption-of-btc,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3153a17e10c183660977d80768ba12e78775506-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391124,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXUUv,1711484772,House Republicans Demand SEC Explain What's Up With Crypto Platform Prometheum,"Influential House Republicans are demanding answers from Gensler on how ETH could legally be treated as a security by Prometheum.  A total of 48 members of Congress signed a letter to Gensler, expressing concerns about how listing ETH as a security could threaten the crypto industry.  As Prometheum Inc. nears an unprecedented moment in U.S. crypto history by beginning a custody operation that intends to hold customers' Ethereum tokens {{ETH}}, the industry's friends in Congress are demanding the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) explain what it means to do about this first U.S. special purpose broker-dealer (SPBD) for digital assets.  ""We are faced with an alarming scenario in which a SPBD has announced that it intends to offer custodial services for ETH under a regime that does not permit such activity,"" the Republican chairmen of the House Financial Services and Agriculture committees wrote in a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, also signed by 46 other members of Congress. ""This action, if allowed to proceed, could have irreparable consequences for the digital asset markets.""  Prometheum had announced a plan to begin custody of ETH as a customer asset. The initial plan was to start in the first quarter of this year, though the launch is now likely to happen next quarter, a spokesman said on Tuesday.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Rep. Glenn ""GT"" Thompson (R-Penn.), the chairmen of the two committees, and the other Republican lawmakers – many of whom have been staunch supporters of the crypto industry – argued in Tuesday's letter that ETH is not a security, making the asset illegal to handle by a securities firm like Prometheum.  The lawmakers also slammed Gensler's unwillingness to directly say ether is a security.  ""Your unwillingness to clarify the treatment of ETH only exacerbates the confusion and uncertainty regarding ETH’s classification as demonstrated by the Prometheum announcement,"" the letter said.  An SEC spokesman declined to comment, saying Gensler would ""respond to members of Congress directly,"" and the spokesman for Prometheum said company officials are still reviewing the letter.  ETH has represented a tug-of-war between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has openly declared ETH to fit into its commodities jurisdiction, much like bitcoin does. While the SEC in earlier days seemed to agree, agency officials later suggested the decision on ETH isn't yet clear, especially after the Merge, a 2022 code update that shifted Ethereum from a so-called proof-of-work consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake one. Meanwhile, ETH futures products have traded on CFTC-regulated platforms, and the SEC approved ether futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to begin trading last year.  The SEC has reportedly been probing the nature of ETH and the firms tied to it, potentially readying an answer to whether it's a security or not in the regulator's eyes.  Read More: Ethereum Foundation Faces Inquiry From a Government; Fortune Says SEC Investigating ETH  Prometheum itself also represents a potential turning point in the U.S. treatment of the crypto sector. Gensler has more than once offered up Prometheum as an example of a firm seeking to leap through the necessary regulatory hoops to handle crypto legally in the U.S. If the SEC allows Prometheum to operate as a custody provider and trading platform for tokens the firm concludes are securities, it undermines the industry's core argument that it's impossible for crypto firms to do business under existing SEC rules. If the SEC instead puts a stop to Prometheum's business, it could demonstrate that the agency's request for crypto firms to come in and register was hollow.  ETH is not registered as a security with the SEC, which the lawmakers suggest make it impossible to handle as a security for Prometheum. The company's leaders, though, have argued in the past that it's not their job to register the assets that'll be held and traded in their business.  Congress has been working on legislation to better map the regulatory road for crypto in the U.S., but while some legislation has moved closer to floor votes in the House of Representatives, the Senate has been more sluggish.  ""Allowing one market participant and regulation by enforcement to dictate the future of digital asset regulation is unacceptable,"" the lawmakers argued in their letter.

Worldcoin’s Compliance Under Fire According to a Reuters report, the CNPD’s suspension specifically targets the Worldcoin Foundation, a memberless entity based in the Cayman Islands, described on its website as the sole member and director of World Assets Ltd, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands responsible for issuing Worldcoin tokens to sign-up participants. The CNPD cited an alleged “high risk” to citizens’ data protection rights as the main reason for its urgent intervention. The regulator expressed concerns about the “unauthorized” collection of data from minors, the lack of information provided to data subjects, and the inability to delete data or withdraw consent. The halt order also noted that over 300,000 individuals in Portugal had provided their biometric data to Worldcoin, leading to numerous complaints being lodged with the CNPD. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Can Bulls Pump It Again To $0.75 Jannick Preiwisch, the data protection officer at the Worldcoin Foundation, responded to the CNPD’s order by stating that Worldcoin is “fully compliant” with all laws and regulations about biometric data collection and transfer. Preiwisch emphasized the company’s zero-tolerance policy for underage sign-ups and its commitment to addressing any reported incidents. Worldcoin has recently transitioned to “Personal Custody,” aiming to give users control over their data, including options for deletion and future use. The CNPD’s order to stop data collection is considered temporary, allowing for additional due diligence and analysis of complaints during the ongoing investigation. Privacy Storm Engulfs Worldcoin The Regulatory scrutiny of Worldcoin extends beyond Portugal. As NewsBTC reported, Spain’s data protection watchdog issued a three-month ban earlier this month in response to privacy complaints, and Kenya suspended Worldcoin’s operations in August 2023. Moreover, the Bavarian State Regulatory Authority, acting as the lead authority in southeastern Germany, is currently investigating Worldcoin under European Union data protection rules due to the presence of a German subsidiary owned by Tools For Humanity, the company behind Worldcoin. As the investigation into Worldcoin’s data collection practices continues, the project faces significant challenges in addressing regulatory concerns and maintaining public trust in its ambitious vision. According to its website, the project claims to have garnered over 4.5 million sign-ups from individuals in 120 countries. Regulatory Hurdles Fail To Dampen WLD’s Performance Despite the recent regulatory challenges faced by Worldcoin, the decentralized cryptocurrency has managed to maintain its gains of 12% over the past seven days. After reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $11.95 on March 10, the project’s native token, WLD, experienced a sharp drop to $7.24 but has since recovered. Currently trading at $9.01, WLD has capitalized on the overall market rebound and its seven-day uptrend, surging by almost 9% in the past 24 hours. The trading volume for WLD in the last 24 hours is $416,136,329, indicating a significant 65.10% increase compared to the previous day, suggesting renewed interest in the token. Related Reading: Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High, Will The Bitcoin Decline Continue? Looking ahead, the $9.5 level is expected to provide the nearest resistance for the WLD token, followed by the $10.14 mark, should the rally continue. On the downside, the $8.36 level is the closest support on the daily chart. In a potential downtrend, failure to hold this support level could decline toward the $8 mark, with the next significant resistance at $7.93.

This has raised the possibility of the flagship crypto rising to a new all-time high (ATH) of $75,000 soon enough. BTC Held On Coinbase Drops Significantly According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin balance on Coinbase dropped to a nine-year low of 344,856 on March 18. This suggests that Bitcoin investors are choosing to move their holdings off exchanges and hold for the long term rather than sell anytime soon. A move like this reduces the short-term pressure on Bitcoin and could spark an upward trend in BTC’s price. Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? Meanwhile, the drop in BTC held on Coinbase looks to be a trend, with data from market intelligence platform Santiment showing a drop in the total amount of Bitcoin held on centralized exchanges (CEXs). This data is also supported by the fact that these exchanges have recorded more outflows than inflows lately. Further data from Santiment also shows that the supply on exchanges as of March 22 stood at just over 836,000 BTC compared to the 18.82 million BTC that resides out of these CEXs. The decline in the number of BTC held on exchanges is undoubtedly a welcome development, considering how the flagship crypto token has recently been plagued with a wave of profit-taking. Before now, the bearish sentiment surrounding BTC was further strengthened by JPMorgan’s theory that Bitcoin was overbought and that the crypto token could experience further price declines soon enough. However, with BTC back over $70,000, there is the belief that this is just the beginning of an upward trend that could see it reach new highs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Net Inflows BitMEX Research revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a combined net inflow of $15.7 million on March 25. This represents a positive turn of events after these funds recorded negative flows throughout last week. The wave of profit-taking by these Bitcoin ETF investors contributed to the BTC dip that occurred during that period. Related Reading: 7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week The crypto community will no doubt keep their eyes on the flows recorded by these Spot Bitcoin ETFs this week as they could give an idea of whether or not the outlook towards BTC has become bullish again.

42391133,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXV4p,1711479544,'We've Seen Breakdowns of Trust': Nathan Schneider on How to Democratize the Web,"To a large degree, crypto’s primary value proposition is that it gives users more control over their lives. Over their money, data and social connections. This is because crypto is a fundamental rewrite of how internet services are built: Instead of the client/server relationship that defined the pre-blockchain era, there is now a way for individuals and collectives to “own” their side of the equation.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The idea of “community ownership” is something that Nathan Schneider has been taken seriously for a long time. A media studies professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, he was an active participant in the Occupy Wall Street protests that sprang up around the time the general public was first getting introduced to Bitcoin (2011).  Over the course of his career, Schneider has developed a theory that many of the internet’s most intractable problems arise from the choices society has made. The thing is, we can often make better choices — whether that means running a company like Twitter/X collectively or experimenting more as entrepreneurs.  The same core idea is at play in Schneider’s latest and fourth book, “Governable Spaces: Democratic Design for Online Life.” While all of his books have to some extent been about political theory, “Governable Spaces” is arguably Schneider’s most focused meditation yet on how to bring the ideals and practices of self-governance online. There isn’t any one answer, but blockchain can help.  “In other areas of our lives, we solve the vast majority of problems through local self-governance: school boards, city councils, local clubs, etc. We know that one-size-fits-all solutions don't work, and top-down solutions will always make at least half of the world really mad,” Schneider told CoinDesk in an interview.  CoinDesk caught up with Schneider to talk about how blockchain can help expand democratic control online, where DAOs are falling short and what he means by the “implicit feudalism” of today’s internet.  Why do you think the early web fostered top-down models of governance?  Well, it starts with this pattern that I call implicit feudalism that goes back to the earliest social spaces online. When people started designing systems for communities, they used the same logic, the logic where whoever controls the computer or server has essentially total control over the community. This extended from those early online spaces even before the internet was widespread in the 80s and 90s, and became the kind of dominant paradigm for how we design social spaces today in global platforms.  In many ways, it’s a kind of unquestioned logic that the admin or moderators — whoever controls the system, whether it's a company or at the level of a Facebook group chat — that there's this absolute power. We’re starting to see a way out of that with blockchains; they're a kind of network design that doesn't rely on that single server. Because of that, governance has become a space of exploration in ways that we've never seen before on the internet.  Just because you brought it around to blockchain, do you think DAOs today are properly governed?  If I ask people building DAOs today, the answer I get is usually “no.” We're still figuring it out. In some respects, this reveals just how new this challenge is. We've always relied on the power of the admin and moderator to govern for us, and I think we're having to learn the hard way how challenging any act of self-governance is. We're kind of reinventing the wheel in the context of DAOs. People started out with the “one token, one vote” model, where every single decision is a proposal for all token holders. We don't run any other kind of organization that way, because it's really inefficient. But DAOs are learning, and more appropriate models are becoming the norm, from “soulbound” tokens to vote delegation to reputation systems based more on contributions than wealth.  But in other respects, DAOs are having to co-govern online spaces under contexts that previous human institutions have not had to worry about, like anonymity and speculation — it's a more challenging environment. We can't simply import old habits of self governance. Nevertheless, what has excited me about DAO-world is that, at least in this context, there is a kind of creativity and experimentation with different voting mechanisms and ways of representing identity that I think the rest of the world needs to know about and see.  There isn’t a one size fits all solution to this, but how do you think we could import some of the lessons from real life democratic situations to online spaces?  The first step is creating the groundwork for it and in many respects that is taking place. A few years ago, my collaborators and I proposed a concept called modular politics, which is a framework for how to design online spaces. In the same way that we expect different kinds of features of our computer to be modularly composed, we can put together different apps — you know, plugins for a WordPress website or bots on Discord — to govern online spaces. If you look at tools like Aragon, you start to see how that modular logic is already taking hold.  The other thing that is critical outside of technical infrastructure is the financial side. A lot of DAOs, as soon as they start doing something interesting, get an offer they can't refuse from venture capital firms. Often that financial capture ends up re-centralizing these allegedly decentralized DAOs. A real priority if we want to protect collective governance is to make sure we have tools for financing promising projects that are compatible with collective ownership and that protect that collective ownership as a value. Variant, for instance, is an investment firm that has really tried to walk that line.  Given the priority that the crypto industry places on market solutions and finding efficiencies, will it always conflict with democratic governance?  The question is: Efficient for what purpose? We have to recognize that there are certain ways in which market solutions are actually not efficient for the kinds of things that we need in the world. For instance, token based voting is very efficient for somebody who has a lot of tokens and wants to control a project unilaterally. But if the goal of the project is to draw collective intelligence for many people, that's actually a very inefficient system.  See also: Code Is Not (Always) Law  A couple of years ago I was working on a book and having an ongoing conversation with Vitalik Buterin where I raised questions about the limitations of relying entirely on financial mechanisms for governance and whether this could actually end up backfiring in some important ways. I've been gratified to see over the years how Vitalik and many other people in this industry have recognized the limits of financial mechanisms alone, particularly. Like soulbound tokens and things like that are not financial.  I'm also really interested in projects like Decidim, which is a platform developed through the city of Barcelona to enable citizens to have more forms of input and co-governance in their city. Financialization is not at all involved. And still, there's a lot of creativity. The fun thing for me is to see the different directions people are experimenting with digital governance. That said, the creativity of economic incentives that have emerged in the context of crypto is a valuable contribution to solving certain problems.  Do you think we need persistent digital identity to solve the problems of co-governing online?  Identity of some sort is important, but we don't necessarily need to rest on one identity. You know, we've tended to for the last few 100 years rely heavily on a universe in which you have one national identity in which every piece of land on Earth belongs to some country (or no country). Networks invite us into a different kind of citizenship—what the indigenous scholar Glen Coulthard calls nonexclusive sovereignties. I think this is a very powerful idea for how to think about digital citizenship in different kinds of spaces. We might become part of DAOs or use social media apps. In some cases, it might make sense to have a very visible identity attached to other contexts. Or it might make sense to be more anonymous. The real adventure here is to be able to try and carry different forms of self presentation in our online spaces. Proof of personhood is going to be important and something we should expect. Relying exclusively on the nation state for one's identity is a profoundly limiting tool.  Do you think online governance adds too much friction, limiting what makes the internet valuable: being able to jump around websites without switching costs?  Great question, I think about it a lot. It's actually the topic of the first research paper I did after finishing this book with some collaborators in Metagov. We've been imagining what would it look like if we won — if democratic governance were available all over the internet and across our lives? How would we possibly have time to participate in all this stuff? Wouldn't that actually be a drag?  It’s about balance. There are some spaces where I love participating in governance for — like I'm part of a small Mastodon server of a few hundred people. I really like the people in that community, and I like participating in governance with them. On the other hand, I rely on a credit union for financial services. That is fairly large and complex. I am allergic to spreadsheets. I am so glad I don't have to participate in the governance of that. But there are still mechanisms in the background of that system of that credit union that help make sure it's accountable to me.  We can develop forms of governance that are actually appropriate to the degree of connection we have with our various communities and tools and networks. In Europe there are citizens assemblies, where you grab a random group of citizens — 50 or 100 people out of millions — and pay them to spend two weeks really studying an issue and helping to develop a proposal for how best to move through that issue. This has been really successful for cutting through legislative log jams. It could be really relevant to addressing governance in an online context that requires very few people to be involved at any given time while still opening the door for essentially anyone to participate.  I've heard leaders of DAOs complain that people are not voting on their proposals very much, they're getting very small levels of voting. And, you know, I think they should listen to that and recognize, hey, wait, there seems to be something off about the way this system is set up. How could this system be designed better to make sure the goal is not just more tokens voting, but getting better information. Every participant should feel that there is some accountability to them, while at the same time ensuring the obligations being asked of them are reasonable.  What's your most and least favorite things about running a Mastodon server?  It has made me love social media again. I'm logging into a real community, not to a company that is trying to take something from me. The downsides, you know, have to do with the fact that decentralized social media, particularly Mastodon, has rejected venture capital — it's just so under invested in. We still have such a long way to go to bring a truly kind of public goods approach to social media  This might tie into one of your earlier ideas that you wrote about: cooperative economics.  It really is. But it's easier said than done. I know it's possible because I've studied the history of cooperative business and financing. Here in Colorado, where I live, there's a $130 billion cooperative bank that lends to agricultural cooperatives. The rural electrification system in the United States enables essentially limitless capital to cooperatives in rural areas to deliver power and now broadband to communities. So we have done cooperative capital and financing at scale. The problem is, we haven't updated those legacies for the online economy.  See also: Consensus Rewind: DAOs for Humanity  One thing I'm really focused on now is trying to build alliances between this cooperative legacy and people in crypto who are committed to decentralization to try to make this case that it's not enough to just decentralize the technology, we also have to build the tools for decentralized and democratic finance.  Anything else you wanted to mention about the book?  As I've argued in CoinDesk before, I think it’s really important for people in the crypto ecosystem to recognize that every time you write code, you're engaged in regulation — a type of governance. The other day I was talking with an Ethereum protocol engineer, and he was telling me about the latest proposals they're making for changing the protocol. And I said, “That’s a nice piece of financial regulation you're doing.” He was kind of taken aback and denied a financial regulator. But every time we write something into a protocol, we’re creating governance. We're creating a kind of law. It's just a question of whose priorities are involved and who is accountable to whom. In particular, I would love to see this sector take on more responsibility for users.  We've seen all these breakdowns of trust — disasters like FTX and all the rest. It's been shocking to me how few resources this ecosystem has for addressing problems and how little people have stood up to demand the tools to prevent abuses. Some people are investing their savings in these systems; there needs to be some attention on economic justice, some sense of labor rights.  There are all kinds of things that humans need to have a healthy economy that we haven't even begun talking about in the context of crypto. We've remained parasitic on the rest of the world to take care of those problems. Instead, for this industry to really grow up we need to take those questions much more seriously. What should a better kind of fiscal policy look like? What would it look like to have basic protections, so that people who are participating in this economy are not at a dire risk of losing their livelihoods?  This begins with recognizing that we're doing governance already.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/03/26/weve-seen-breakdowns-of-trust-nathan-schneider-on-how-to-democratize-the-web,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/64a83f8923fab99c32700b83092bfae944db89d1-1808x1017.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stifel has a buy rating on the Toronto-listed company headed by Mike Novogratz with a C$20 price target. The stock was trading 5% lower at around C$13.67 at the time of publication. The shares have risen over 30% year-to-date.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Now Points To “Extreme Greed” The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator made by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. This index represents the sentiment as a score between zero and hundred. To calculate this value, the indicator takes into account the data of these factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top In Yet? What The Legendary MVRV Ratio Says When the indicator has a value of 46 or less, it means that the average investor holds a sentiment of fear right now. On the other hand, a value of 54 or more implies the market shares a majority mentality of greed. Naturally, the region in-between these two (47 to 53) corresponds to the neutral sentiment. Now, here is what the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index looks like: The index appears to have a value of 81 at the moment | Source: Alternative As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is at 81 right now, meaning that it’s deep into the greed region. In fact, this value is so deep that it’s inside a territory known as “extreme greed.” Extreme greed occurs when the index hits values higher than 75. Fear also has its own extreme region; this one occupying values under 25. Historically, these two sentiments have proven to be particularly significant for the market. BTC and other assets in the sector have often tended to move in the opposite direction from what the majority expect. In the territory of the extreme sentiments, this expectation is naturally the strongest, and hence, the probability of a contrary move taking place is also the highest. Because of this reason, major tops and bottoms in Bitcoin’s price have typically taken shape when the cryptocurrency has been inside the respective extreme zones. Earlier in the month, the Fear & Greed Index had assumed especially high extreme greed levels, as the asset’s rally towards new all-time highs (ATHs) had occurred. Two of the major tops in this period, including the current ATH, coincided with peaks in the indicator, implying that the overheated sentiment may have once again played a role. Looks like the value of the metric has turned around in the past day | Source: Alternative With the recent drawdown in the asset, though, the sentiment also cooled off and exited out of the extreme greed territory, as is visible in the above chart. In bullish periods, the sentiment retreading back to the normal greed region can be a positive sign for fresh upward moves to start. And indeed, this has followed for the cryptocurrency this time as well, as its price has made notable recovery over the past couple of days. With the coin making a return back towards $71,000, the sentiment has also heated up again, hence why the index’s latest value is pointing at extreme greed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests Resistance: Here’s The Level A Break Could Lead To The aforementioned tops from earlier in the month occurred at Fear & Greed Index values of 90 and 88, respectively, suggesting that the current extreme greed value of 81 may not be too high for another peak to be probable.

Marsh, which has over 45,000 staff and is part of professional services giant Marsh McLennan, said the new insurance product will support organizations with digital assets held offline in cold storage, as well other custody solutions such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), where cryptographic keys are split into shards, Marsh said.  Crypto insurance has traditionally been thin on the ground, with many exchanges and large trading firms simply holding enough crypto to cover their own losses if necessary. Marsh, with its connection to the Lloyd’s of London insurance market, was a trailblazer in crypto, securing cover in the hundreds of millions of dollars for the likes of Crypto.com, via partnerships with firms such as Ledger and Lloyd’s underwriter Arch Insurance. The new crypto cover facility was developed by Marsh Specialty’s Digital Asset team in New York and London.  “Marsh’s facility provides custodians with protection for the key operational risks they face in the management of digital assets; we look forward to supporting clients globally in aligning their risk financing and evolving commercial strategies, as they focus on building their operational resilience and market presence in this fast-growing sector,” said Jacqueline Quintal, Global Digital Asset Leader, Marsh Specialty in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/03/26/insurance-broker-marsh-introduces-825m-crypto-custody-cover,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/93235b1e067150b485512041b07c08193b790715-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391130,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXUuZ,1711470321,Hong Kong Likely To Allow In-Kind Creations for Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Bloomberg,"Hong Kong's financial regulator is likely to approve in-kind creations and redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs.  This could potentially pave way for a massive investor base across China to enter the crypto market.  Several firms have applied to launch a spot bitcoin ETF on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Hong Kong’s financial regulator, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), is likely to allow in-kind creations and redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs in the second quarter of this year, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence.  In January, Chinese asset manager Harvest Global applied for a spot bitcoin ETF and another firm, Venture Smart Financial Holdings, also said it would submit a filing after the SFC said in December that it was ready to consider such products.  Though no spot ETF has yet been approved, it seems likely that it's just a matter of time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Rebecca Sin.  In addition to those approvals, Sin reports that the SFC will also allow in-kind redemptions, an important distinction from the cash-only redemptions for the U.S. spot-based products.  In-kind redemptions are the more frequently used method by ETFs as the underlying asset doesn’t actually have to be sold. It's therefore preferred by investors and issuers for cost, tax and liquidity reasons.  Cash redemptions, on the other hand, mean ETF shares can be exchanged only for cash, which generally means costlier tax and trading considerations.  If Hong Kong indeed approved in-kind redemptions for spot bitcoin ETFs, it would be ""huge,"" said Noelle Acheson, author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter.  “The Asian crypto market is much larger than the U.S. crypto market in terms of volume,” she said. “This could either suggest that there's less 'new money' to come into the ecosystem or it could suggest that there is deeper familiarity with crypto assets in the region, and listed ETFs in Hong Kong could channel a significant amount of money into 'approved' portfolio allocation.”  “Even a tiny percentage of Chinese investors finding a legal way [to invest in bitcoin] would be significant,” Acheson said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/03/26/hong-kong-likely-to-allow-in-kind-creations-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs-bloomberg,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6ba24e4d9cb54970fed2b3aa45aa6799e3b49d17-5517x3679.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24828969,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599739,1711468818,Ripple CEO Responds To SEC’s Shocking $2 Billion Demand,"In a rather shocking development, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has demanded a $2 billion sanction against Ripple. Responding to the startling demands, Ripple’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Brad Garlinghouse has taken a firm stance against the agency’s demands, determined to expose the true nature of the SEC. Ripple CEO Criticizes SEC’s Demands Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) of Ripple recently disclosed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the US SEC has petitioned a Judge for $2 billion in fines and penalties against Ripple. According to the Ripple CLO, the SEC is in a relentless pursuit to “punish and intimidate Ripple,” rather than faithfully applying the law. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $50,000 Or $80,000? Crypto Expert Predicts Where Price Is Headed Next Challenging the SEC’s $2 billion penalty, Garlinghouse emphasized that the agency has consistently operated beyond the bounds of law in various enforcement actions. He disclosed that Judges have also taken note of the SEC’s actions, previously admonishing the agency for its extensive abuse of power entrusted to it by Congress. The Ripple CEO also criticized the SEC’s penalty demand, arguing that it lacks precedent and justification, particularly given the absence of any allegations, findings of fraud or recklessness in the case. As a result, Garlinghouse has vowed to expose the SEC for its conduct, emphasizing that Ripple will vigorously respond to the SEC’s action. Notably, Alderoty has disclosed that the company’s legal team will be addressing the SEC’s demands in a filing scheduled for next month. Offering his perspective on the SEC, the Ripple CLO characterized the agency as one “that trades in statements that are false, mischaracterized and designed to mislead.” SEC Actions Hurt XRP Holders The Most In its lawsuit against Ripple, the US SEC accused the payment company of violating securities laws by selling XRP in unregistered securities offering to investors in the US. According to the agency, the company and its executives had allegedly failed to protect its investors, depriving them of adequate disclosures of XRP. However, members of the Ripple community argue that the SEC’s enforcement actions against Ripple have not protected investors but caused even deeper challenges and financial losses for XRP holders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Remove A Staggering $2.3 Billion From Exchanges, Is It Time To Buy? A popular XRP enthusiast, identified as XRPCryptoWolf has asserted that it should be the SEC, not Ripple, paying billions to XRP holders. “The SEC asking for $2 billion in fines and penalties is ridiculous when they’re the ones who financially hurt XRP holders the most.

42391131,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXUzh,1711466411,New Hampshire Has a Better Approach to DAOs,"The world’s legal systems are straining to adapt to transactions facilitated by smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and other developing blockchain technologies. One of these innovation — commonly known as “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” or “DAOs” — offers potentially revolutionary mechanisms for conducting governance and transactions among participants.  Keith Ammon is a four-term elected Representative in the New Hampshire State Legislature. Bill Ardinger has practiced law in NH for almost 40 years, representing businesses on tax and transactional matters and seeking policy improvements. Both served on the New Hampshire Commission on Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets.  New Hampshire is considering legislation (HB 645) to enact a new legal entity law for DAOs. This essential legal innovation, which was recommended by the 2022 New Hampshire Commission on Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets (on which the authors served), would not “piggyback” on other legal entity laws, such as laws for “limited liability companies,” as some other states have done. Instead, it proposes a new form of legal status for DAOs listed on a public registry, including granting the enterprise legal personhood and limited liability for its participants.  Traditional centralized legal entities and true DAOs  Traditionally, legal entities such as corporations operate by delegating decision-making power from more diverse participants (e.g., shareholders) to centralized executive authorities (e.g., officers or agents) that determine and execute entity operations.  DAOs offer a different approach. from these more traditional forms of community-delegated actions. DAOs are enterprises that enable a diverse group of participants to conduct transactions as a coordinated unit according to software code implemented on a public blockchain (e.g., smart contracts) without the need for delegations to a board, officers, or other centralized executives. Once actions are approved through distributed governance, they can be executed automatically (“autonomously”) by the code without further executive action by centralized executives.  The lack of limited liability is the death knell for robust development of DAO technologies  While some DAOs are subject to control by a limited group of developers or participants and continue to rely on the traditional model of delegated authority to centralized executives, other genuinely decentralized autonomous organizations represent a potentially revolutionary innovation in how governance and economic decisions are made. Blockchain technology, with its unique attributes of flexibility, transparency, auditability and security, can be deployed to empower widely diverse groups of humans with shared values to accomplish common goals at the worldwide scale of the internet. We remain at the very earliest stages of development of the potential for widely-distributed DAOs to impact our societies and economies.  HB 645 aims explicitly to promote this “genuine” DAO model, limiting the new enterprise form only to DAOs that satisfy standards for diversification and transparency.  Uncertain legal status for DAO participants  While technical innovations for DAOs continue, the legal system remains lodged in the world of traditional centralized entities. The lack of appropriate legal rules for DAOs creates uncertainty and risk that hampers innovation and undermines the ability of DAOs to operate in the traditional world.  The most significant legal risk is that DAO developers, administrators, and participants are subject to joint and several liability for losses realized by a DAO. In contrast, shareholders of corporations (and other legal entities) enjoy “limited liability.” That is, if a corporate shareholder invests $100, the shareholder (in most cases) is only exposed to losing that investment due to corporate activities, and the rest of the shareholder’s assets are protected. This limited liability for shareholders, first adopted for general corporations by New York State in 1811, is a legal innovation that has powered today’s Western economies.  The risk to a participant's non-DAO assets is not academic. In September 2022, the CFTC took enforcement action against Ooki DAO, treating the DAO as similar to an unincorporated association and asserting that active members are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations, liabilities and debts of the DAO. The lack of limited liability is the death knell for robust development of DAO technologies.  Another legal uncertainty for DAOs is their lack of recognition as a “legal person” who can engage in transactions in the traditional world. A corporation can own assets, sue in its own capacity to enforce a contract and may be sued if it violates a law or contract. Under current laws, DAOs do not have similar legal clarity. If a DAO engages in transactions, it may not be able to enforce rights in court or before a regulatory authority.  Other legal uncertainties exist for DAOs (for example, securities, antitrust, tax). However, the conceptual starting point should be to enact a legal framework that recognizes DAOs as legal entities and grants its participants limited liability.  New Hampshire’s answer: HB 645  As stated in the Final NH Commission Report, New Hampshire intends to become a leader in establishing sound and flexible rules governing the legal status of DAOs. Following the Commission’s recommendation, Representative Ammon introduced House Bill 645, which would establish the “New Hampshire Decentralized Organization Act.” The NH DAO Act would recognize a registered NH DAO as a distinct legal entity and grant limited liability protection to its developers, participants, administrators, and legal representatives.  First introduced in 2023, the initial version of HB 645 implemented the COALA Model Law. This choice signaled an intent to create an entirely new legal entity that reflects the unique characteristics of DAOs as opposed to trying to jury-rig an existing approach for traditionally centralized entities (as other states have done by extending their LLC statutes to DAOs). The House Commerce Committee recommended an amendment to the bill that adopts some more traditional legal entity provisions (such as name and registered agent requirements) while preserving the creative, “DAO-unique” aspects of the COALA Model. On February 6, 2024, the full House voted to approve the amended bill by a bipartisan 340-33 vote. The Senate will now review the bill, with hearings before the Senate Commerce Committee during April.  Key aspects of the bill  While it is beyond the scope of this article to provide a detailed description of the bill, the following highlights are essential:  (1) Legal Personhood and Limited Liability. As noted, the Act would acknowledge legal personhood and grant limited liability to NH DAOs listed on a public NH DAO Registry.  (2) Public NH DOA Registry. The Act would require the Secretary of State to establish and oversee a registry of NH DAOs that satisfy certain “listing” requirements. The Act directs the Secretary of State to engage a qualified Registry Administrator and directs the Administrator to undertake reasonable efforts to maintain the Registry as a blockchain system.  (3) Registry Listing Requirements. The Act would require a NH DAO to satisfy 11 “listing” requirements. These include being deployed on a permissionless blockchain, using open-source software, having public, plain language bylaws that accurately reflect the rules of the software code that govern the NH DAO, providing evidence of quality assurance testing, and having decentralized networks and governance.  (4) Authorization of Agents. The Act would expressly recognize the legal positions of “administrators,” “developers,” “participants,” and “legal representatives,” authorizing an NH DAO to designate such persons to perform off-chain functions and operations on behalf of the NH DAO.  (5) Governance and Economic Rights. The Act would require NH DAO bylaws to specify the rules for determining participants' governance and economic rights and responsibilities. While the bylaws must address such material rights, the Act emphasizes that its policy is to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract and to recognize that rights of participants will be determined by the governing software code (the “intent of code is law”).  (6) Indemnification and Waiver Powers. Similar to laws establishing other legal entities, the Act expressly empowers NH DAOs to indemnify and limit liability for participants, administrators, and other persons.  (7) Flexibility. Following the COALA Model approach, the Act would allow significant variability and flexibility in the structure of particular NH DAOs. The public registry approach seeks to take advantage of DAOs' public, open-source nature and avoid filing requirements typical for traditional legal entities.  New Hampshire’s motto “Live Free or Die” celebrates independence, freedom and individual rights. Our state has a well-deserved reputation for supporting innovators and entrepreneurs with flexible and modern legal systems. By attracting successful creators with sound laws, New Hampshire continues to enjoy diverse economic growth that benefits our citizens and their communities. Consistent with the recommendations of New Hampshire’s 2022 Commission, the Legislature is making significant progress in enacting a unique legal entity statute specifically built for DAOs.  The authors encourage readers to contribute to this vital effort to enact legal innovations that support this critical blockchain technology's further development and growth.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Keith Ammon, Bill Ardinger",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/26/new-hampshire-has-a-better-approach-to-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/afd45448a82ee34baa66b3ebc30ef9c4b26baf1b-2115x1417.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Darren McCormack called KuCoin ""an alleged multibillion-dollar criminal conspiracy.""  KuCoin’s native token {{KCS}} dropped by 5% after the announcement.  U.S. federal prosecutors charged crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders with violating anti-money laundering laws on Tuesday, saying the exchange operated in the U.S., lied to at least one of its investors about operating in the U.S. and failed to both register with U.S. government entities and maintain an anti-money laundering program.  The U.S. Department of Justice said in an indictment that KuCoin and founders Chun Gan and Ke Tang operated KuCoin as a money-transmitting business with over 30 million customers but did not implement a know-your-customer (KYC) or AML program until 2023 – and even then, its KYC program did not apply to existing customers. Neither Gan nor Tang were arrested, the DOJ said in a press release.  The DOJ indictment said that KuCoin did not register with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network as a money services business.  Because it did not implement any KYC or AML programs, KuCoin ""made itself available to be used, and in fact was used, as a vehicle for laundering the proceeds of suspicious and criminal activities, including proceeds from sanctions violations, darknet markets, and malware, ransomware, and fraud schemes,"" the indictment said.  The indictment pointed to allegations that KuCoin ""indirectly received a total of more than $3.2 million worth of cryptocurrency from Tornado Cash,"" a sanctioned crypto mixer. KuCoin was mentioned in criminal filings against two of Tornado Cash's developers, Alexey Pertsev (whose trial in The Netherlands began earlier Tuesday) and Roman Storm (who's set to go on trial in the U.S. later this year).  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a suit against KuCoin Tuesday, alleging the company, which offers both spot and futures trading services, did not register as a futures commission merchant, swap execution facility or designated contract market. Its suit also charged that KuCoin didn't implement the CFTC's equivalent of a KYC program.  The CFTC is seeking monetary penalties, trading and registration bans and an injunction, while the DOJ is seeking forfeiture alongside criminal penalties.  In a statement, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Darren McCormack called KuCoin ""an alleged multibillion-dollar criminal conspiracy,"" noting it was one of the largest crypto exchanges.  U.S. Attorney Damien Williams said in a statement that KuCoin actively tried to hide that ""substantial numbers of U.S. users were trading"" on its platform.  ""Indeed, KuCoin allegedly took advantage of its sizeable U.S. customer base to become one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency derivatives and spot exchanges, with billions of dollars of daily trades and trillions of dollars of annual trade volume,"" he said."" As alleged, in failing to implement even basic anti-money laundering policies, the defendants allowed KuCoin to operate in the shadows of the financial markets and be used as a haven for illicit money laundering, with KuCoin receiving over $5 billion and sending over $4 billion of suspicious and criminal funds.""  KuCoin’s native token (KCS) dropped by 5% following the announcement. Bitcoin's {{BTC}} price dropped 1% but has been volatile throughout the day and is trading around $70,000.

Yield-bearing stablecoins have mushroomed recently, offering an alternative to incumbent stablecoins USDT and USDC.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Angle unveiled its new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin on Tuesday, which aims to pass on yield from its real-world asset (RWA) backing and revenue from DeFi lending.  Angle's USDA is backed by U.S. Treasury bills and tokenized versions of T-bills, and token holders who stake their USDA on the Angle Protocol can automatically earn rewards derived from the token's reserve assets yield and revenue from the protocol's lending platform. This way, the target yield for USDA stakers is at least 5%.  The development came as yield-bearing stablecoins have mushroomed recently, with new offerings seeking to lure funds from market-dominating stablecoins. USDT and USDC do not pass the yield earned on their backing assets to holders. Latest entrants such as Mountain USD and Ethena's USDe raked in $300 million and $1.3 billion in deposits, rwa.xyz data shows, while asset management giant BlackRock also entered the market recently with its tokenized fund represented by the dollar-pegged BUIDL token aimed for large, institutional clients.  With its new offering, Angle also aims to establish a blockchain-based foreign currency (forex) hub with seamless conversion between euro and dollar without fees and slippage. Angle already offers a euro-pegged EURA token with a $22 million supply. It received $5 million in venture capital funding led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) in 2021 to develop its stablecoin-focused DeFi platform.  ""The forex market represents trillions of dollars of daily volume. However, today it’s difficult to find a DeFi protocol offering on-chain currencies trading at true forex rate,"" said Pablo Veyrat, CEO of Angle Labs, the development organization behind the protocol.  To boost liquidity for USDA, users will also be able to convert Circle's USDC stablecoin to USDA and back without incurring fees or slippage.  USDA will start a beta testing phase in the next few days, pending approval by the Angle Protocol's governance, with plans for a broader roll-out in April.

24827242,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599771,1711465228,"Chainlink Facing Strong Rejection From Profit-Taking, Will CCIP Recharge Demand?","One analyst on X notes that Chainlink is facing a tug-of-war between bullish momentum and strong upside resistance from profit-taking traders. For bulls to add to their longs and extend the uptrend, the existing oversupply must be moped, paving the way for more gains above immediate liquidation levels. Profit Taking Slowing Down LINK Bulls Looking at the LINK price action in the daily chart, it is clear that buyers have the upper hand. Bulls have been relentless since the token bottomed out in September 2023. Related Reading: Triple-Digit Gains: Ondo Finance (ONDO) Explodes 138% — Should You Invest? Since then, LINK has doubled, even breaking above the psychological round number at $20. At press time, buyers are still in control, snapping back to trend despite the market-wide cool-off after Bitcoin crashed last week. LINK is within a broader range, with clear caps at around $17.9 on the lower end and $21.7 on the upper end. After protracted expansion from September, the emergence of a ranging market could suggest that traders are exiting their positions, slowing down the uptrend. This has been confirmed by on-chain data that the analyst tagged, explaining the recent slowdown. Indeed, on-chain data suggests investors have been cashing in on the recent expansion. As a result, the excess supply needs to be absorbed by the market before LINK Bulls builds enough momentum to drive the coin to new 2024 highs above $21.8. Chainlink CCIP Adoption To Recharge Demand? Despite the short-term headwinds, Chainlink bulls are banking on the widespread adoption of the Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) as a demand catalyst. CCIP is critical for blockchain interoperability. The solution allows secure communication between smart contracts of linked blockchains and external data sources. CCIP has been adopted by, among others, Metis, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Circle, the issuer of USDC, a stablecoin, is also leveraging the platform to enhance interoperability. Related Reading: Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst Recent data shows a surge in CCIP revenue, pointing towards increased adoption of this multichain bridging platform. As of March 26, Dune Analytics data shows that the CCIP has generated over $484,000 in revenue. This figure will likely increase as CCIP finds adoption and Chainlink integrates with even more protocols, businesses, and blockchains.

42391121,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXUKf,1711464436,The Future Is Open Finance,"Put simply: the structure of finance today prevents billions of people from accessing baseline financial services and economic opportunity.  Centralized institutions are designed to serve a disproportionate percentage of the population. Consequently, the underserved masses are limited in their access to capital, credit and services. Key, but decades-old, infrastructure like SWIFT and ACH that guide the activity of financial institutions, markets and payment networks around the world are not helping those who could use it the most.  Mo Shaikh is co-founder and CEO at Aptos Labs, and Nicole Valentine, is the fintech director at the Milken Institute.  Slow, costly money movement, coupled with limited access to capital markets, holds millions of people back from financial well-being. This is exemplified by the global remittance market. According to the World Bank and the United Nations, about one in nine people globally are supported by the estimated $656 billion sent home as remittances by migrant workers. The global average cost of sending $200 of remittances is 6.5%, twice the 3% target outlined in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, collectively costing the world’s most vulnerable billions of dollars.  Even in regions with robust fintech ecosystems like the United States, gaps in access to banking and finance persist. According to the FDIC, 4.5% of American households still lack a bank account, which costs those roughly 5.9 million Americans roughly $230 million in fees on non-bank financial services, like check cashing and money orders. However, we have the technology to speed up and reduce the costs of global financial services, to open finance to these struggling communities and lift all boats in the process.  Leveraging open financial data is the first half of the open finance equation. Policies like open banking have cut though the financial sector’s opacity, enabling opportunities to make systemic improvements, upgrades and overhauls.  A shift toward stablecoins ... offers evidence of a transformative shift in the global movement of money.  The adoption of open banking in the U.K. allowed consumers to securely share their banking data with regulated third parties operating financial apps, products and services that are faster, cheaper and more agile than traditional banks. As of February 2023, more than seven million U.K. customers are using open banking services — at the same time, brick and mortar banks are closing across the U.K.  Recognizing the value open banking can offer consumers in the U.S., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra said, “a shift toward open and decentralized banking can supercharge competition, improve financial products and services, and discourage junk fees,” in a statement on the bureau's proposed rules to jumpstart open banking. As open banking has moved from academic halls into real practice, it has catalyzed the modernization fundamental to repairing or replacing financial infrastructure.  However, open finance means more than open banking; data needs to be married with new innovative technology to build financial access and inclusion. One such technology is stablecoins. As noted by the Federal Reserve, in addition to offering stability through pegging crypto transactions to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are offering a real-world, low-cost, near-instant global payments solution that almost entirely circumvents legacy infrastructure. These cost advantages are already being realized in the global remittance market.  For example, stablecoin issuers like Circle have identified remittances as a key driver of stablecoin use, especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America. A shift toward stablecoins offers more than an answer to digital currency volatility; it offers evidence of a transformative shift in the global movement of money.  See also: Circle Highlights Surge in USDC Use for Asia Remittances  To realize the global potential of open financial systems and to convince both legacy financial institutions and regular people to explore them, we need to introduce networks that are secure and accessible on day one. This is where open financial protocols come in, offering innovative features that decentralize finance without sacrificing security or performance. In parallel, traditional financial institutions, credit agencies and banks are embracing open banking APIs (think: Venmo connected to banks like Wells Fargo via Plaid).  This is all to say: The tech, infrastructure and consumer interest in more accessible financial instruments, payment networks and money movement systems is there.  Open finance is the future. Blockchains are not only providing the infrastructure layer for decentralized finance (DeFi) today, they will prove to be a core driver of progress toward open finance in the decades to come. And while mobile is powering transactions in underserved communities worldwide, Web3 will be the vehicle for true financial access and independence.  But we cannot truly succeed until exclusive forces keeping financial institutions closed make way in favor of expanding value sharing, access and innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | APT,"Mo Shaikh, Nicole Valentine",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/03/26/the-future-is-open-finance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bb99d763522db2a59fdad4ead952f31bc8ff6231-2400x1350.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

24825554,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599765,1711461612,Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Pre-Halving Retrace Echoing Troubling 2020 Trend,"Rekt Capital, a cryptocurrency expert and enthusiast, has identified a similar pattern between the recent Bitcoin pre-halving retrace and the one that took place in 2020 before the crypto asset witnessed an upsurge to its previous all-time high. Bitcoin Pullback Is Almost Identical With 2020 Pre-Halving Retrace Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset, is presently demonstrating momentum, rising over $70,000 and recovering from a recent downward trend. Following the recovery, Rekt Capital believes that the pullback might be over, citing a similarity to the 2020 pre-halving retrace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Reclaims $70K And Signals Fresh Surge To $75K Given the uncertainty of the crypto market, the analyst is not sure if the recent upsurge marks the end of the pre-halving retrace. However, if that is the case, then Bitcoin would have nearly matched the pre-halving correction from 2020. According to the analyst, the digital asset has recorded a pullback of over 18% in this cycle. Meanwhile, in the 2020 cycle, it retraced by over 19%, suggesting the potential of the asset mirroring the 2020 movement this cycle. A further dive into the correction made by the analyst reveals that Bitcoin has been trapped inside the Weekly range (black-black) ever since it retraced by over 18%. Both the upside-wicking 2021 peak and the candle-bodied 2021 peak combine to create the weekly range that Rekt Capital has indicated. Thus, he claims that BTC reclaiming the $69,200 ‘range high’ as support, which has already played out, could signal the conclusion of the recent decline. In addition, this demonstrates that Bitcoin is poised to move over its weekly range and soar higher. With the 2024 Bitcoin halving drawing closer, the cryptocurrency is having difficulty in reclaiming its most recent peak of $73,000. However, there are rumors that today’s increase could mean the pre-halving decline is coming to an end. Considered Catalysts For BTC’s Strength This Cycle As of the time of writing, BTC has rebounded to around $70,806, indicating a daily increase of over 5%. Its market cap and trading volume are also showing strength, rising by 5.49% and 47.82%, respectively, in the past day. One of the main drivers of Bitcoin’s growth this cycle is thought to have been the approval of spot BTC ETFs in January 2024. With the acceptance of the product, investors now have a convenient way to profit from Bitcoin’s value without actually owning any of it. Related Reading: Bitcoin is “Overheating” For The First Time Ever Before Halving Since then, the crypto asset has witnessed increased adoption from industry leaders and a massive inflow of capital, propelling its price as well. The BTC price has increased from $46,000 to a peak of $73,000 since the ETFs were approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Another catalyst considered to have impacted the coin’s price is the anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bitcoin Halving set to occur in April. In the past, these kinds of events have led to notable price upticks. Due to this, investors will shift their attention to BTC to position themselves for significant gains following the halving event.

42391129,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69beXUpR,1711458000,AI Bot 'Syntax' From Spectral Labs Could Help Non-Coders Write Ethereum Apps,"Spectral Labs, a crypto development firm focused on artificial intelligence, wants to make it easier for non-programmers to build on blockchains. On Tuesday the company will launch Syntax, an AI app that can help anyone – coders and non-coders alike – spin up smart contracts for Ethereum and dozens of other blockchains.  While Syntax represents an impressive technical achievement, Spectral still faces the hurdle of convincing users to entrust AI with their precious digital assets.  Those familiar with Chat GPT and similar chatbots will be at home on Syntax interface, which is powered by a crypto-specific large language model (LLM) and can carry on SMS-like conversations with users.  In addition to answering blockchain-related queries, like ""what is the circulating supply of ETH,"" the web app can turn prompts from users into production-ready Solidity code – the programming language used by Ethereum and other blockchains based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) standard.  ""Syntax users can compile, debug, and deploy AI-generated solidity code,"" Spectral Labs said in a statement, adding that NFTs, arbitrage bots and rollups are among the tech's possible use cases.  ""Say I want to code an ERC-20 token called 'ABC' with 100 million supply,"" Spectral Labs CEO Sishir Varghese told CoinDesk in an interview. ""Syntax would generate all of the code for the user. The user would be able to compile, test for vulnerabilities, test for gas efficiency and code optimization, and then deploy the app directly on-chain right from the interface.""  AI-powered coding assistants are nothing new: Engineers have been using ChatGPT to generate code for the past year, and GitHub Copilot, Microsoft’s AI-powered coding whiz, has become a mainstay of the modern programming arsenal since its release in 2021.  ""I would say there hasn't really been an LLM, fine-tuned for Solidity,"" said Varghese.  In addition to being tuned specifically for Solidity development, Syntax is novel in that it plugs straight into EVM-compatible blockchains, meaning users can press a button to instantly deploy their Syntax-made ""agents"" to blockchains like Ethereum, Arbitrum or Coinbase's Base.  The app can be configured with private keys and other data to give the agents control over real crypto funds, which means the agents – depending upon what they're programmed to do – can be let loose to buy, sell and trade tokens as if they were actual humans.  When it comes to using LLMs, there's always the tricky matter of ""hallucinations"" – where AI can make things up or, in the case of coding, create correct-seeming code that is error-prone or behaves unexpectedly. When the code generated by an AI is tasked with handling real money, hallucinations become an obvious problem.  ""We tried to put in some safeguards around vulnerability detection and code efficiency,"" said Varghese. ""All those are kind of built-in already. Plus, there will be some pre-built agents that will also help with vulnerability detection.""  Syntax was trained on a specially curated set of audited smart contracts, security reports and developer docs, he added.  ""Creating a quality data set is pretty crucial because that's what you want the LLM to reproduce in terms of code,"" said Varghese. ""If you just took everything that ever existed, you won’t really get good results.""  The Spectral Labs CEO allowed that using an AI tool like Syntax will inevitably carry some risks: ""I think skilled developers are still pretty apprehensive about all of the copilot stuff – except in Web2. For Solidity, this is going to be a brand-new experience, to be honest.""  Varghese expects that retail traders, rather than experienced programmers, will be Syntax's main users.  ""I don't foresee them jumping in and trusting it,"" he said in reference to skilled developers. ""I think the cooler thing is that a retail person who's never deployed a contract or even generated Solidity code before, he's gonna be able to do this quite seamlessly and easily.""",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/03/26/ai-bot-syntax-from-spectral-labs-could-help-non-coders-write-ethereum-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05811e58b437ddc72bee42585099e72e9361044a-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The group's second report on the topic says funds should be able to hold tokenized assets as well as settle transfers on-chain.  A technology working group backed by the U.K. government is urging firms to execute tokenization strategies in collaboration with their peers in a new report published Tuesday.  Tokenization is the digitization of real-world assets mostly through the use of blockchain technology. Financial institutions around the world are experimenting with tokenization and related settlement systems to improve the efficiency of traditional markets.  Based on industry feedback, the working group says the focus needs to be on on-chain fund settlement with digital money. It also said funds must be able to hold tokenized assets and utilize public permissioned networks that allow verified users to access the blockchain.  Members of the Technology Working Group include the U.K. government's finance arm and the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the country's finance sector, including crypto. This new report builds on the group's November report where it urged regulators to establish clarity for tokenization as firms continue to take an interest in it.  The report also said that the tokenization of money market fund units used as collateral could help ""accelerate the relevant settlement process increasing the opportunities for this use case.""

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The London Stock Exchange will roll out a market for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) exchange-traded notes (ETN) on May 28, it said on Monday. The stock exchange will accept applications for trading crypto ETNs starting on April 8. The market will be subject to the approval of the U.K. regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, the notice said. ETNs are similar to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in that they are designed to mirror investments tracked by an index or benchmark. They differ because an ETN functions more like a bond. They are unsecured debt notes. The FCA said earlier in March that it would not turn down requests from recognized investment exchanges to create a listed market segment for ETNs. The products will be available to professional investors only.  The Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin (BTC) ETFs registered inflows totaling $15.4 million on Monday, ending a five-day run of outflows, according to provisional data published by investment firm Farside. Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflows, collecting $261.8 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which amassed $35.5 million. Other funds like BITB, BTCO, EZBC, and BRRR received between $11 million and $20 million each. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s ETF (GBTC) continued to bleed money, losing just over $350 million. Last week, the ETFs saw a cumulative outflow of $887.6 million, as a result of withdrawals from GBTC.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked a New York judge to impose a nearly $2 billion fine on Ripple Labs, according to court filings. On Monday, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Labs’ chief legal officer, posted on social media that the SEC was asking for such a fine and that redacted versions of the court documents would be made public by March 26. The SEC's proposal asks the court to order Ripple Labs to pay $876 million in disgorgement, $198 million in prejudgment interest, and $876 million civil penalty, amounting to a total of $1.95 billion.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the 24-hour change in the number of active bitcoin options contracts at various strike levels on Deribit.  Open interest has increased notably in call options at $90,000 and $105,000 strikes, signaling expectations for a continued price rally into six figures in the coming months.

24823003,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599738,1711456217,"Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High, Will The Bitcoin Decline Continue?","Crypto investment products have finally registered a week of outflows after seven weeks of consecutive strong inflows and two weeks of breaking records after records. In fact, data has shown that these investment products have now set a new record for the most outflows in a week, extending the run of record creation. According to data from CoinShares, investors pulled out $942 million from crypto investment products last week to wipe $10 billion off total assets under management (AuM). Interestingly, a larger part of this outflow came from Bitcoin, as Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US registered outflows every day. Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High CoinShares’ weekly report on digital investment funds has revealed crypto investment products have been witnessing an influx of money for the past two months. Consequently, these products registered a seven-week run of inflows totaling $12.3 billion. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, received most of these inflows, which helped push its price to a new all-time high. Related Reading: 7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week However, last week told a different tale for Bitcoin’s investment products, as Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US registered a weak $1.1 billion in inflows which was unable to offset Grayscale’s significant $2 billion outflows. As a result, Bitcoin investment products witnessed outflows of $904 million throughout last week. Short Bitcoin products also witnessed minor outflows of $3.7 million. The negative sentiment flowed to other investment products such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and multi-asset products witnessed outflows of $34.2 million, $5.6 million, $3.7 million, and $7.3 million, respectively. On the other hand, Litecoin, XRP, and Polkadot saw an increase in their respective inflows of $2 million, $1.2 million, and $5 million. Lastly, the total trading volume fell to $28 billion, two-thirds of the prior week. In terms of region, the USA had the most outflows of $860 million. Sweden and Switzerland followed with $36.9 million and $25.2 million respectively. According to CoinShares, the reversal into a poor sentiment was largely due to hesitancy from investors. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Interestingly, last week’s outflow from Spot Bitcoin ETFs coincided with a drastic drop in the price of Bitcoin with the cryptocurrency falling to as low as $61,370. This shows how much influence these funds now have over the price of Bitcoin. Last week’s actions show investors seem to be hitting pause on their enthusiasm for spot bitcoin ETFs. Whether that pause lasts for weeks or longer remains to be seen. Related Reading: Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today? However, sentiment can shift quickly in the cryptocurrency market and recent price action shows the industry might be returning to bullish mode. According to data from BitMEX Research, Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a day of net inflows yesterday. Net inflow recorded was $15.7 million, the lowest inflow day since January 26. Bulls have now taken over to push the price of Bitcoin by 5.38% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $70,676 and could reach $73,000 again very soon.

42408582,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamMJt,1711456004,"BlackRock’s New Tokenized Fund Brings TradFi, Crypto Closer: Bernstein","BlackRock last week unveiled its first tokenized fund on a public blockchain.  The investment manager has involved key institutions from both the TradFi world and the crypto sector.  On-chain funds could be a new category of growth for asset managers, Bernstein said.  The launch of BlackRock’s (BLK) first tokenized fund on a public blockchain is significant because of the way in which the asset manager has brought in key ecosystem partners from both the TradFi world and the crypto sector, broker Bernstein wrote in a research report on Tuesday.  As part of a growing trend of digitizing mutual funds and securities on the blockchain, the investment giant last week officially unveiled its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum network,  Bernstein notes that while tokenized money market funds are not new, the launch of the BlackRock USD Institutional Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) is significant in the way the investment manager has “brought in key ecosystem partners from both the traditional world and the crypto world.”  “This would facilitate interoperability between both sides and would comfort more traditional customers to adopt on-chain funds, without major friction points,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote.  The fund is represented by the blockchain-based BUIDL token, and is fully backed by cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements, BlackRock said.  The investment manager said Securitize will act as a transfer agent and tokenization platform, while TradFi institution BNY Mellon is the custodian of the fund. Anchorage Digital Bank NA, BitGo, Coinbase, and Fireblocks will also participate in the fund’s ecosystem.  This is the first major test case for institutional holders to experience the benefits of 24/7 instant settlements on a blockchain, with increased transparency and capital efficiency, and at a lower cost, the authors wrote.  The decision to use Ethereum as the public blockchain instead of using a private blockchain “allows for a wider design space for interoperability and programmability,” the report said, adding that tokenized fund redemption could occur on-chain with stablecoin integration.  On-chain funds could develop into a new category of growth for asset managers, and “crypto asset management could evolve from simple crypto accumulation via exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, to building on-chain multi-asset products with its own distribution and unit economics,” the report added.

42408592,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamMqx,1711455140,"Soaring U.S. Debt Has Potential to Replay U.K.'s 2022 Market Shock, CBO Warns","Unattended mounting U.S. debt concerns means potential for a Liz-Truss style market chaos, Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office told Financial Times.  Debt concerns may have helped bitcoin and gold rally to record highs amid elevated interest rates worldwide, analysts said.  In 2022, former U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss announced radical economic measures, including deep tax cuts and billions of pounds of spending even as surging government debt called for fiscal prudence. The result was market chaos, with the British pound (GBP) crashing to record lows against the U.S. dollar (USD) and the collapse of Truss' government, the shortest in the country's history.  Now, the U.S. faces a similar risk if the government continues to ignore mounting debt concerns, according to Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  “The danger, of course, is what the U.K. faced with former Prime Minister Truss, where policymakers tried to take an action, and then there’s a market reaction to that action,” Swagel said in an interview with the Financial Times.  Swagel added that the U.S. is not yet in the same position, but higher interest rates could raise the debt servicing cost to $1 trillion in two years, and bond markets could ""snap back.""  A pound-like crash in the U.S. dollar, a global reserve currency with an outsized role in international finance, could boost demand for alternative assets with a haven appeal like bitcoin and gold. Trading volumes in bitcoin-pound pairs spiked during the U.K. crisis in September 2022.  Both bitcoin and gold may already be pricing in a crisis scenario. Despite elevated interest rates and bond yields worldwide, the two so-called zero-yielding assets have rallied to new record highs above $70,000 and $2,000, respectively. Both have surpassed their previous peaks set in 2020-21, when interest rates in the U.S. and other parts of the world were pinned near or below zero.  ""Rising debt levels and geopolitical turmoil may have contributed to offset the impact of higher yields on both assets,"" Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko said in Monday's edition of its newsletter.  U.S. federal debt totaled $26.2 trillion at the end of 2023, about 97% of gross domestic product, according to the CBO. The non-partisan, independent agency expects the debt-to-GDP ratio to rise past the Second World War high of 116% by 2029 and reach as high as 166% by 2054.  The bigger the debt, the greater the pressure to keep real – or inflation-adjusted – interest rates and bond yields artificially low. Higher rates and higher debt levels push the government's interest expenses higher, aggravating debt concerns.  Negative real rates often lead investors to move money out of fixed-income investments and into high-risk, high-return assets like technology stocks, cryptocurrencies and havens like gold, as seen in 2020-21.  ""In a highly indebted economy, negative real [inflation-adjusted] rates and financial repression are a necessary condition to keep the system running, and fiat currency debasement remains the escape valve,"" the founders of newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said in Monday's edition, explaining debt concerns as a macro tailwind for bitcoin and gold.  According to the founders, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's recent decision to stick to forecasts of three rate cuts in the coming months despite continued labor-market strength and a renewed uptick in inflation shows the central bank is now ""focused on the U.S. debt spiral.""  ""Gold continues to signal that the macro sands are shifting. Should net ETF inflows turn positive this week, don’t be surprised if Bitcoin catches the macro winds and accelerates to new highs,"" the founders noted.  The Nasdaq-listed spot ETFs accumulated over $15 million in Monday, snapping a five-day streak of outflows. Bitcoin changed hands at $70,780 at press time, representing a 5% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, added 5.5%.

EGRAG, known for his bullish XRP stances, is calling for a potential 90% surge in the near future, with a target price of $1.20.

This audacious forecast is rooted in his meticulous analysis of XRP’s current moving averages juxtaposed with those observed during the remarkable price surge of 2017. Drawing parallels between the two periods, EGRAG highlights the uncanny resemblance, hinting at the potential for history to repeat itself with a resurgence akin to the explosive growth witnessed in the past. He underscores the importance of considering historical patterns and market dynamics in shaping his optimistic perspective, indicating a belief in XRP’s capacity for substantial growth over the coming months. Bitcoin is now trading at $71.123. Chart: TradingView Complex Market Dynamics However, analysts urge caution when interpreting such technical indicators. While historical patterns can offer valuable insights, they are not guarantees of future performance. The cryptocurrency market remains notoriously volatile, and unforeseen events can drastically alter price trajectories. Further complicating the picture is the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit’s outcome holds the potential to significantly impact XRP’s price. A favorable ruling for Ripple could pave the way for wider adoption and a subsequent price increase. Conversely, an unfavorable verdict could cripple investor confidence and send XRP tumbling. XRP seven-day price action.

It's dark and delicious,"It's not only Sonny the Cuckoo Bird, but traders these days cannot get enough chocolatey goodness. Supply shortages saw cocoa futures ( CC1:COM ) surge well past the $9,000 per ton level on Monday as a record rally that started in early 2023 shows no sign of letting up. In fact, cocoa beans are not only now more expensive than other popular commodities like copper, but recent returns also outpace popular investments like Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) over the past month (+47%) and on a year-to-date basis (+130%). Snapshot: Cocoa production has been dented by severe weather and crop disease in Ghana and the neighboring Ivory Coast, which together are responsible for 70% of global output. Farmers in Guana also sell their cocoa to the government under fixed contracts set at the beginning of the season, so smuggling is expected to take advantage of the higher prices. Problems surrounding forex reserves can also arise as the Ghana Cocoa Board - known as Cocobod - stands to lose access to a key funding facility due to a shortage of beans, which will further restrict seedlings and fertilizers to farmers. ""Adding complexity is the EU's upcoming deforestation regulation that could limit output if farms don't comply,"" writes SA analyst Weather Wealth , stating that investors should avoid these three stocks as cocoa prices soar. Comments on the same article warn that the run-up could also be attributed to speculation , similar to ""European gas after the war in Ukraine"" and ""thanks to the illiquidity of the contract and the lack of sellers."" ""Here it seems the replay of that movie,"" remarks Mktneutralhedger . ""We know how it will end, but when?"" What to watch: Spending on candy and chocolates will drop this Easter, according to the National Retail Federation, as manufacturers pass on rising costs to consumers. Meanwhile, companies could continue cutting down on packaging and bar sizes, or promote varieties with other ingredients. There's already an explosion of cocoa butter equivalents on the market, as well as substitutes for cocoa mass and artificial flavors, and expect some clever marketing in the near future like ""I Can't Believe It's Not Chocolate!""

The BITI ETF aims to provide the inverse performance of Bitcoin, allowing investors to also hedge against potential losses. Even though Bitcoin may face a correction shortly after the upcoming halving event, I believe there's enough potential for growth in the longer term. Getting the full picture of the risks and opportunities of a particular investment is crucial for making a wise investment decision. Several days ago I published this bullish article about a spot Bitcoin ETF where I mentioned the upcoming Bitcoin halving event as a major potential growth driver of the BTC price. But what if I am wrong in my assumptions? What exactly can go wrong? In this article, I'd like to present an opposite opinion to my bullish thesis. In my view, it's an excellent exercise any investor should practice. If you're bearish on Bitcoin, then ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITI ) may suit your needs to play out a possible, though not probable decline in Bitcoin price. Also, the BITI ETF may be a decent option to hedge your Bitcoin exposure. In this regard, I give the BITI ETF a ""Hold"" rating. BITI ETF Overview According to the fund's description , ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks daily investment results that correspond, before fees and expenses, to -1x the daily performance of the Bitcoin price. Simply put, if the BTC price goes down, the BITI ETF shares go up. At the same time, it's important to note that the BITI ETF does not directly short Bitcoin . Instead, the fund invests in Bitcoin futures and swap agreements that provide an inversed effect relative to the BTC price. It's also not recommended for investors to hold the BITI ETF shares for the long term due to the nature of inversed and/or leveraged ETFs like the BITI. Given that the fund tracks the daily performance of the BTC price, the high volatility of Bitcoin may seriously erode your returns if you keep the BITI ETF shares for a long period. In the table below you can check out what returns should you expect in a span of a year depending on the ETF performance and assumed volatility of Bitcoin. ProShares, BITI ETF Prospectus Therefore, the BITI ETF is best suitable when you have a really high conviction about a potential crash in the Bitcoin price. TradingView As for the returns, the BITI ETF -32% year-to-date result is unsurprisingly poor given the recent rally in Bitcoin. Should we expect a massive reversal in Bitcoin rally anytime soon? Let's find out. Unmeaningful Halving There's been a lot of buzz about the upcoming halving event, which is usually associated with a period of strong growth shortly before and one year after the halving event happens. To avoid repetition, I'd suggest reading my recent article where I discuss potential growth amid the halving. The first counterargument to my bullish thesis is that, unlike previous halvings, this and subsequent Bitcoin halving events affect a substantially smaller share of Bitcoin supply. Coindesk Thus, the overall effect from this and all future Bitcoin halvings may be less significant and probably insufficient to cause another wave of growth in Bitcoin. The second counterargument is that from a statistical viewpoint, three previous halvings aren't a large enough sample to rely on in forecasting the future performance of Bitcoin amid the next halving. Strictly speaking, I think this is a fair point, though we still can't fully dismiss the existing track record of previous halvings. ETF Flows And Options Positioning According to Bloomberg, a group of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs faced the biggest weekly outflow since these ETFs debuted on January 11, 2024. Bloomberg Even though the massive outflow is not an unambiguous signal of Bitcoin reversal, it definitely demonstrates a change in the initially bullish sentiment we observed at the beginning of this year. In the meantime, options traders actively bet on a deeper decline in the BTC price amid the nearing options expiration. The share of put options relative to call options is getting increasingly higher, another sign of a changing mood towards crypto among investors. According to Bloomberg citing data from crypto options exchange Deribit, the strike prices of put options are concentrated around $45,000-50,000. Amberdata Such a background is definitely not positive for Bitcoin. However, we shouldn't forget about higher-level macro inputs that are essential for Bitcoin's future performance. Macro Considerations Despite the aforementioned counterarguments, I still think that in the medium-to-long term, the BTC price is skewed to the upside rather than the downside. Regardless of how ""effective"" the upcoming halving will turn out for the Bitcoin price, the key variable that, in my opinion, defines BTC's growth potential is financial liquidity. After a period of monetary tightening in 2022-2023, the world is about to gradually move to a softer, normalized monetary policy. Global Liquidity, the pool of cash and credit moving around financial markets, is on track to cyclically reverse . Financial Times While the Fed isn't in a hurry to cut rates, the Fed's Chair Jerome Powell has already hinted about slowing down the pace of quantitative tightening . Against such a background, I see a lot of potential for further Bitcoin growth post-halving. Another factor investors should take into account is the United States' binge on fiscal spending. Even though the US economy shows seemingly healthy GDP growth , the US government runs an outrageously high budget deficit . Tax Foundation The US budget spending getting more and more detached from tax collections isn't the only problem. The current trend of debt borrowing shows that the US government debt may exceed 200% of GDP by 2050. Congressional Budget Office, U.S Government Accountability Office I don't believe that the facts above mean an inevitable and irreversible decline of the US dollar as a world reserve currency. However, such a combination of factors, in my opinion, ensures a long-term upside for Bitcoin simply because it's much easier for governments around the world to create more financial liquidity rather than tighten the monetary and fiscal conditions. More liquidity means more money floating around the financial markets that may end up being allocated to Bitcoin if there are suitable market conditions to do so. The Bottom Line In the near term, I leave open the possibility that the Bitcoin price may face a severe decline let's say to $45,000-50,000, where the majority of put options strike prices are currently located. As we've seen this January, positive events like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs sometimes are followed by huge sell-offs , and the upcoming Bitcoin halving may be not an exception. In such a case, the BITI ETF may serve well as a tool to benefit from a hypothetical correction. Nonetheless, macro conditions are still favorable for the long-term performance of Bitcoin, in my opinion. As long as the US and the world in general aren't in a recession, continuously increasing excess liquidity will be absorbed in one way or another by asset classes like crypto, making Bitcoin a sensible option for long-term investors.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680414-biti-time-to-short-this-bitcoin-rally?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/24817772.jpeg

Whale investors, known for their significant holdings and market influence, have been accumulating ONDO at a substantial clip. Data from on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain reveals that three whale wallets recently withdrew over 9 million ONDOs, worth around $9 million, from various exchanges. This behavior suggests a long-term bullish outlook on the token’s potential, potentially inciting a follow-the-leader mentality among retail investors. Whales are accumulating #RWA token $ONDO!

This influx of new investors, likely influenced by the whales’ actions and the overall hype surrounding tokenization, has further fueled the token’s price rally. Total crypto market cap at $2.5 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com The recent surge in ONDO’s popularity coincides with a broader trend within the DeFi space. Last week, global investment giant BlackRock announced the creation of a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing investors to earn US dollar yields through a decentralized platform. This move underscores the growing interest in tokenization, which involves representing real-world assets like securities, currencies, and real estate on a blockchain. TVL Not Impressive Despite Weekly Rise However, amidst the celebratory atmosphere surrounding the token’s price surge, a curious detail emerges. Despite the significant increase in ONDO’s value, the platform’s total value locked (TVL), a metric reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited in its DeFi protocols, has remained relatively stagnant over the past week. While the reasons behind this discrepancy are unclear, it could be a cause for concern for some investors. A stagnant TVL might suggest that the recent price increase isn’t necessarily translating to increased usage of the Ondo Finance protocol itself. Related Reading: Social Media Storm Gives Dogecoin 14% Price Boost – Details Overall, the past week has been undeniably positive for Ondo Finance.

24815704,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599679,1711440345,"Bitcoin Price Surges Past $71,000: 4 Key Reasons Behind The Rally","The Bitcoin price has soared past the $71,000 mark. In the past 24 hours alone, the price of Bitcoin surged by 6.5%, climbing from just below $65,500 to reach $71,491. This remarkable rally can be attributed to a combination of factors that have collectively contributed to the upward trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Here’s a closer look at the four key reasons behind Bitcoin’s latest price surge. #1 Futures Market Influence The futures market has played a pivotal role in driving Bitcoin’s price upwards. According to data from Coinglass, the past 24 hours have seen the liquidation of 64,480 traders, with total crypto liquidations amounting to $184 million. Specifically, for Bitcoin, shorts worth $56.9 million and longs worth $16 million were liquidated. Byzantine General, a crypto analyst, noted the significant increase in open interest, suggesting that leverage has been a major factor propelling Bitcoin’s price higher. He stated, “I can’t help but have the feeling that BTC is trading like someone knows something. A billion $ in open interest got added in the past couple hours. It’s mostly this leverage that pushed us higher I think.” Related Reading: To Infinity And Beyond: Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin To Hit $100,000 In High-Speed Furkan Yildirim, another analyst, cautioned about the sustainability of this rally, pointing out the over $1.7 billion in open interest built up since yesterday as a sign of overleveraged positions. “The whole truth is that over $1.7 billion in open interest has been built up since yesterday. We are increasingly seeing the use of overleveraged positions again,” he remarked, raising questions of the sustainability of the move. #2 Bullish News For Bitcoin The rally was further propelled by a series of optimistic news. Notably, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) announced its plan to introduce a market for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded notes (ETNs) by May 28. This decision opens the door to professional investors in Europe and signifies the growing institutional acceptance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top In Yet? What The Legendary MVRV Ratio Says Moreover, the news of Peruvian Nilam Resources expressing intent to purchase 24,800 Bitcoins (worth $1.7 billion) “at a discounted rate relative to current market prices” through an acquisition strategy involving MindWave, a special purpose entity, has injected a dose of exhilaration and skepticism into the market, given Nilam’s microcap OTC stock status. #3 Bitcoin ETFs And Coinbase Premium Another critical factor influencing Bitcoin’s price rally was the dynamics surrounding Bitcoin ETFs and the Coinbase premium. The Coinbase Premium Gap turned positive again yesterday, as observed by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, indicating a robust demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. Guess who's back? Bitcoin: Coinbase Premium Gap is positive again https://t.co/0C7YyyFe2T pic.twitter.com/b73XbSygbl — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) March 25, 2024 Given Coinbase’s custodianship of approximately 90% of Bitcoin ETF assets, the premium emerges as a pivotal indicator of institutional demand for Bitcoin. This was further evidenced by the positive ETF net inflows yesterday, amounting to $15.4 million after last week saw five consecutive days of net outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC had $350 million in outflows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC started picking up last week’s slack with $261.8 million in inflows. Blackrock had another weak day with only $35 million in inflows. Nonetheless, the Coinbase premium was once again a good indicator.

The successful retest of the strong resistance zone (red zone) has confirmed the breakout’s legitimacy, leading to a more than 7% increase in Bitcoin’s price. This technical movement has bolstered the confidence of traders and investors alike, contributing to the momentum that has driven the price past the $70,000 threshold.

Inflows could gather pace as the quarter draws to a close, one analyst said.  The Nasdaq-listed spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered inflows totaling $15.4 million on Monday, ending a five-day run of outflows, according to provisional data published by investment firm Farside.  Fidelity’s FBTC led the inflows, collecting $261.8 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT, which amassed $35.5 million. Other funds like BITB, BTCO, EZBC, and BRRR received between $11 million and $20 million each. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s ETF (GBTC) continued to bleed money, losing just over $350 million.  Last week, the ETFs saw a cumulative outflow of $887.6 million, thanks to large withdrawals from GBTC.  Nearly a dozen spot ETFs debuted in the U.S. on Jan. 11, allowing investors to take exposure to the leading cryptocurrency while bypassing the hassles of owning and storing the digital asset. These ETFs invest directly in bitcoin and eliminate the need to rollover positions, a key feature of futures-based ETFs that went live in October 2021.  Since the spot ETFs began trading, bitcoin has risen over 50% to $70,750. On Monday, prices rose just over 4%, briefly topping the $71,000 mark.  Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said quarter-end flows could be stronger than usual, lifting the cryptocurrency’s price to new highs.  “Bitcoin ETF flows turned around magically on Monday as Fidelity suddenly found $262m of buyers, compared to $18m, $3m, and $13m during the previous three sessions. Flows on Tuesday (30%) tend to cannibalize flows from Thursday (16%) and Friday (12%), while Monday and Wednesday (each 21%) see their fair ‘20%’ share per weekday,"" Thielen said Tuesday’s edition of the newsletter.  “With bitcoin above $70,000, we can imagine that flows on Tuesday could also be positive again. With the quarter end, flows might be stronger than usual,” Thielen added.  Thielen stressed that spot ETF inflows and issuance of dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) need to pick up for bitcoin to chart another aggressive move higher, or else the burden of the rally would fall on futures traders’ shoulders. Tether, the world’s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, is widely used as a funding currency in the crypto spot and derivatives markets.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/26/bitcoin-etfs-snap-outflows-streak-accumulate-154m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/40f1012940bf361db32ed41501410d2c062d4281-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408590,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamMdj,1711438356,Crypto Traders Dismiss Waning ETF Inflows as Bitcoin Holds Steady Over $70K,"Bitcoin briefly surpassed $71,000 on Tuesday, boosted by sentiment around possible new bitcoin-based institutional product offerings.  The London Stock Exchange approved a marketplace for trading BTC and ETH exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in May, which led to strong upside momentum for BTC, traders said.  Projects linked to Coinbase Ventures recorded the most gains, with an average 10% increase, while the CoinDesk 20, an index of the biggest tokens, rose 4.47%.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} briefly topped the $71,000 mark early Tuesday before retreating as market sentiment grew on new bitcoin-based institutional product offerings and demand from traditional desks.  Crypto markets started rising on Monday as the London Stock Exchange approved a marketplace for trading bitcoin and ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in May, as reported. The LSE will start to accept applications from April 8.  Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Telegram broadcast there was “strong upside momentum” for bitcoin after the development, with asset managers also continuing to add BTC allocations as a “portfolio diversifier.”  “Anecdotally, wealth desks at major banks have been pleasantly shocked at the tremendous demand from clients for bitcoin spot ETFs and requests for structured products,” the firm added.  Bitcoin jumped nearly 5% in the past 24 hours, leading the rally among crypto majors, data show. Ether, Solana’s SOL, and Cardano’s ADA rose over 4.5%. Near Protocol’s NEAR and Internet Computer’s ICP jumped over 10% to post the most gains among alternative tokens.  Projects linked to Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the prominent crypto exchange, recorded the most gains as a category with an average 10% bump. Such gains came as sentiment and on-chain activity on the closely related Base blockchain grew over the weekend.  The broader CoinDesk 20, an index of the biggest tokens minus stablecoins, rose 4.47%. Data shows that open interest in crypto-tracked futures jumped nearly 8%, indicative of money flowing into the market—which usually precedes volatility.  The rise helped erase losses from last week amid record outflows from the Grayscale bitcoin ETF (GBTC). Inflows to other bitcoin ETFs dropped in tandem, giving rise to concerns of a spot-driven selloff.  Some market analysts said the waning inflows were not a sign of concern, however, as long-term investors could have partially profited from their positions.  “We also do not see the state of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs as any cause for concern,” Bitfinex analysts said in an email “Even though negative ETF outflows featured heavily last week, all of it is from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), as investors both switch out of the higher fees demanded by GBTC and also take profit, especially as many of these investors are long-term holders who entered during the bear market.”  “GBTC investors are not the only sellers in the market. Whale wallet activities have also indicated significant profit taking,” they added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/03/26/crypto-traders-dismiss-waning-etf-inflows-as-bitcoin-holds-steady-over-70k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7ff55341a367ce82cd7b71e995a16ce75024b654-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408588,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gamMh2,1711435579,Base Blockchain Transactions Jump on Meme Coin Led Frenzy,"Crypto traders are capitalizing on the Base blockchain, which has seen a surge in activity and funds locked due to a meme coin-led frenzy for tokens on the network.  Base, developed by Coinbase on OP Stack, has experienced a significant increase in transactional activity, unique addresses, and funds locked, with direct access from Coinbase potentially making it the first network used by new retail users.  The popularity of meme coins on Base has led to high gas fees and network congestion, with trading bots contributing to the issue.  Crypto traders are seeking profit opportunities on the Base blockchain amid a meme coin-led frenzy for tokens issued on the network, several metrics show.  Base, built by crypto exchange Coinbase on OP Stack, went live for developers in August and initially saw muted growth. However, that has changed in the past few weeks, with funds locked on the network rising to nearly $1 billion on Tuesday from $450 million at the start of this month.  Blockchain scanners show that transactional activity is up threefold to over 1.5 million a day from an average of under 500,000 a day in the past few months. The number of unique addresses has doubled to 65,000 wallets.  Some market observers say direct access to Base from Coinbase’s exchange and wallet applications could make it the first network that retail users use, instead of the several other options – fueling a frenzy.  Prices of tokens such as cat-themed toshi (TOSHI), thank you base god (TYBG), normie (NORMIE) and brett (BRETT) have risen as much as 1,300% over the past week, data shows, crossing over $1 billion in cumulative trading volumes.  Tokens of technical projects such as decentralized exchange Aerodrome’s AERO and Seamless’ SEAM rose as much as 90% in the past week, CoinGecko data shows.  That has generated the network $1.8 million in fees over the past 24 hours.

The SEC asked the Court to consider how easily actors, particularly in the crypto asset space, can today engage in the same sort of conduct as Ripple’s.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked a New York judge to impose a nearly $2 billion fine against Ripple Labs, according to court filings.  On Monday, Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Labs’ chief legal officer, posted on social media that the SEC was asking for such a fine and that redacted versions of the court documents would be made public by March 26.  The SEC's proposal asks the court to order Ripple Labs to pay $876 million in disgorgement, $198 million in prejudgment interest, and $876 million civil penalty, amounting to a total of $1.95 billion.  The case began in December 2020 when the SEC filed suit against Ripple Labs and its executives, alleging that they violated federal securities laws by selling XRP to both institutional and retail customers. Last July, New York Judge Analisa Torres' ruled that the sale of XRP on exchanges and through algorithms did not violate U.S. law, only Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP did.  “The SEC asks the Court to consider how easily actors, particularly in the crypto asset space, can today engage in the same sort of conduct as Ripple’s and send a strong message that such abuses will not be tolerated,” the filing said.  Alderoty criticized the SEC and wrote that the company will file its response to the SEC’s motion next month. The SEC filing said that the “Defendant’s response shall be filed no later than April 22, 2024.”  Read More: Garlinghouse Says SEC to Press Judge for $2B in Fines and Penalties in Ripple Case",NEGATIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP,Amitoj Singh,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/03/26/sec-seeks-195b-fine-in-final-judgment-against-ripple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3dc23c6d5f298590e36fcac0df3704fb0a87afce-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The new demand from Bitcoin spot ETFs drove prices sharply upwards, but a potential correction is typical before and around the halving. Sentiment and seasonality indicators suggest a short-term pullback, but long-term bullishness remains with a potential price target of USD 100,000 and higher. The stock market rally still demonstrates a lot of momentum, with the S&P 500 ( SPY ) showing a year-to-date return of 7.11%, Furthermore, the market's focus on the tech sector, with AI-related companies like Nvidia ( NVDA ) experiencing substantial revenue growth and stock price increases, is not waning yet. Besides Nvidia, however, the star of 2024 is without a doubt Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Additionally, there are signals from the US central bank hinting at rate cuts, sparking hopes for even more sustainable gains in stocks and crypto. Review As expected, the launch of all those new Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC, BITO , ARKB, BITB, HODL, BRRR, EZBC, ARKW, BITX, BITQ, WGMI, BTCW, BTF, STCE and BETH in early January initially led to a swift pullback of approximately -21.5%. However, and not as anticipated, the crypto bulls quickly regained control starting from January 23rd. Initially rather slow but accelerating from February 7th onward, demand from the new Bitcoin spot ETFs went through the roof and drove prices sharply upwards. New all-time high at USD 73,794 Breaking through USD 50,000 ignited an impressive surge in prices. Bitcoin euphorically surged past all resistances, reaching a new all-time high of USD 73,794 on March 4th. This marks a staggering +91% increase from the low on January 23rd in just seven weeks! Since the low of USD 15,479 on November 22nd, 2022, Bitcoin has seen an even more sensational increase of +376.7% within just thirteen and a half months. In hindsight, we had completely underestimated the demand from those new Bitcoin spot ETFs and mistakenly anticipated a more prolonged correction or consolidation period primarily below the all-time highs and the 61.8% retracement level at USD 48,500. Instead, the new ETFs turned everything upside down, sparking a spectacular Bitcoin rally. Only since the new all-time high at USD 73,793 did we witness a significant pullback of -17.66% a week ago, reaching an initial low point at USD 60,760. While the rally has been slightly shaken, overarching sell-signals have not yet emerged. Rather, Bitcoin quickly recovered to around USD 68,250 and has recently been fluctuating around the USD 65,000 level. Bitcoin Halving, as of March 9, 2024. (Pantera Capital) Bitcoin - Potential correction despite ETFs and Halving The next ""halving,"" expected to occur on April 15th, 2024, could potentially intensify buying pressure in the coming weeks. With mining reward automatically decreasing from 6.25 Bitcoin per block to only 3.125 Bitcoin per block, this reduction in supply is likely to have a medium-term impact on price discovery. Major financial institutions are now investing in digital assets, as of March 21, 2024. (Amphibian Capital) Immediately before and after the halving, however, Bitcoin tends to weaken for approximately 15 to 45 days. Considering that major financial institutions, with combined USD 36 trillion of assets under management, are just beginning to invest in digital assets and build Bitcoin allocations in client portfolios, the supply/demand balance may increasingly shift. Higher Bitcoin prices thus seem inevitable in the further course of the year. Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows, as of March 21, 2024. (Bitmex) However, in the short term, Bitcoin is approaching the ""pre-halving danger zone,"" during which, historically, pullbacks ranging from 20% to 40% have been observed 14 to 28 days before the halving. It is noteworthy that ETFs, likely due to consistent liquidations of positions in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ), recently recorded a cumulative weekly outflow of approximately USD 94 million. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart - Only a weekly closing price below USD 57,000 would decisively alter the picture. Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of March 23rd, 2024. (Tradingview) Since the low at USD 15,479 on November 21st, 2022, Bitcoin prices have soared by a sensational +376.7% to a new all-time high at USD 73,794 within just 13.5 months. Thus, the bear market is unequivocally over! While the entire rally until mid-October 2023 proceeded relatively smoothly, it was the anticipation, approval, and eventual trading launch of the Bitcoin spot ETFs that triggered a nearly vertical price surge. Vertical price hikes are a dream for invested traders, yet they also increase the risk of significant pullbacks. After all, rallies are born in panic and always end in total euphoria and exaggeration. From this simple perspective, Bitcoin prices around USD 70,000 should be approached with healthy grain of caution. On the weekly chart, the vertical price surge to USD 73,793 has recently resulted in a sharp, yet so far manageable pullback to USD 60,760. However, this has generated a sell-signal on the weekly stochastic. The broad resistance zone between USD 58,000 and USD 69,000 could potentially keep Bitcoin occupied longer than many currently anticipate. At the same time, the rally remains intact as long as the USD 57,000 mark is not breached on a weekly closing basis. In summary, the weekly chart remains bullish. Nevertheless, first sell-signals are creeping in. We suspect that Bitcoin will likely oscillate in a pretty volatile manner within the upper half of its uptrend channel between USD 57,000 and USD 77,000 throughout spring and early summer. Daily Chart - Building a base above USD 60,000 Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of March 23rd, 2024. (Tradingview) On the daily chart, the anticipated head & shoulder formation turned out to be a clear misjudgment. With the breakout above USD 50,000, prices surged unstoppable upwards, reaching a new all-time high at USD 73,793. The pullback since March 14th marked the first clear sell-signal from the stochastic since January 11th. This sell-signal remains intact thus far. The oscillator has not yet fully entered its oversold zone, suggesting the possibility of further short-term weakness. Additionally, the rapidly rising 200-day moving average (USD 41,588) is well below the current price action and probably a bit too far away to justify current rather lofty price levels. Overall, the daily chart is currently bearish, indicating the continuation of the correction or consolidation in the short term. However, new lows below USD 60,760 are not yet foreseeable, especially since the daily stochastic has almost reached its oversold zone. A volatile back-and-forth between approximately USD 61,000 and USD 67,000 could be sufficient to build a base and to then generate a new contrarian buying signal within a few days. Sentiment Bitcoin - Excessive optimism initiates pullback Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of March 20th, 2024. (Lookintobitcoin) With 88 out of 100 points on March 14th, the ""Crypto Fear & Greed Index"" reached its highest level since February 21st, 2021. Thanks to the recent pullback, this significantly excessive optimism has receded considerably. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index as of March 20th, 2024. (Coinmarketcap) CoinMarketCap's ""CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index"" further highlights the exaggeration of recent weeks. Perhaps the pullback has already initiated a significant adjustment in sentiment, suggesting that the entire crypto sector could face some challenging weeks, possibly even months ahead. Overall, sentiment has been overly optimistic lately. It's only when sentiment values return to neutral that contrarian buying opportunities arise. Seasonality Bitcoin - Favorable seasonality until early June Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of March 21, 2024. (Seasonax) Between mid-March and mid-April, Bitcoin has historically traded sideways. According to seasonal analysis, a new uptrend should only be expected to start in the second half of April. However, the statistics indicate that the next significant buying opportunity for Bitcoin may not occur until September or October. In summary, seasonality remains neutral until mid-April. Only after that, and until the second week of June, will the signs turn green or bullish again. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of March 23rd, 2024. (Tradingview) At prices of USD 65,250 for one Bitcoin and around USD 2,165 for one ounce of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), you would currently need approximately 30.13 ounces of gold to acquire one Bitcoin. Conversely, an ounce of gold costs approximately 0.033 Bitcoin. As a result, gold as well as the SPDR Gold Trust ETF ( GLD ), the iShares Gold Trust ETF ( IAU ) and the Sprott Physical Gold Trust ( PHYS ) have once again had to yield significantly against Bitcoin over the last two months. Overall, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio has increased by 279.4% in favor of Bitcoin since November 22nd, 2022. Instead of 9 ounces, one now needs more than 30 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin! However, the ratio has not yet reached its peak of 37 ounces from October 18th, 2021. While the steep price increase of recent weeks seems to call for a healthy pullback, there is no sign of an end to Bitcoin's outperformance against gold. Should there be a larger pullback, the area around 24 seems poised to act as a support level. This area also coincides with the upward trendline since October 2023. Overall, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio appears somewhat ""toppy,"" and a healthy pullback would be appropriate. At the latest, the ratio should find support in the range between 23 and 25. Macro Update - Sticky inflation continues to fuel the crack-up boom S&P in USD, daily chart as of March 23rd, 2024. (Tradingview) Since its low on October 27th, 2023, the American stock index S&P500 has surged by a whopping 1,165 points, or over 28%. The hype surrounding artificial intelligence, along with hopes of interest rate cuts, has fueled an incredible rally, adding around USD 10 trillion in market capitalization. This ""currency"" created ""out of thin air"" keeps inflation high because rising stock portfolios also reignite consumer spending. However, only one in four Americans owns and trades stocks. The remaining 75% of the US population, on the other hand, is facing constantly rising prices and a struggling real economy in many areas. The situation is even worse in Germany, where only about 17.6% of the population aged 14 and older are invested in stocks, while the country has slipped into a recession. This means that only one in six, if at all, has been able to participate in the rally in the DAX to new all-time highs (18,233 pints). However, approximately five million German citizens also hold Bitcoin. This disparity between winners and losers in terms of inflation continues to widen. The markets are in a speculative frenzy Given the significantly increased markets, further interest rate cuts are unlikely for now. Instead, the US Federal Reserve is trying to keep the markets happy with promises, without actually taking concrete action. It's hard to gauge how long this will last in light of the ongoing banking crisis and the persisting problems in the US commercial real estate sector. Only an increase in the unemployment rate above the forecasted 4% for 2024 and wage growth below 4% would likely lead to an immediate easing of US monetary policy. Obviously, the markets are in a speculative frenzy and party mood. Nvidia may even reach the psychological milestone of USD 1,000, but the valuations of some tech stocks have become quite steep. In any case, the favorable seasonal window is slowly but surely coming to an end in the next six weeks. After that, the old adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes into play because generally, stock markets tend to be subdued between May and September. After the mega-rally, a breather over the summer would be healthy. Given the new dominance of the Spot-ETFs, Bitcoin is unlikely to sustainably avoid such a correction or breather in the stock markets. After all, the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq has increased significantly over the last six months. Bitcoin - Potential correction despite ETFs and Halving Together with the overbought condition, the extremely high recent optimism levels, and the likely upcoming correction/consolidation in the stock markets, we see good chances that Bitcoin will become significantly cheaper once again. Overall, however, the crack-up boom continues. Theoretically, a brief pause in the markets during the summer could already put pressure on the Fed, as market participants are currently so spoiled that even a 5% to 10% pullback in the stock markets could potentially cause panic. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Potential correction despite ETFs and Halving After the extreme rally of the past two months, Bitcoin has reached a short-term top at USD 73,793. There are increasing signs that this could be an important medium-term peak. While the first test of support around USD 60,000 held up solidly, a second attempt is likely to break through to the downside. After all, the USD 60,000 mark represents only the absolute minimum Fibonacci retracement (23.6%) of the entire rally from the lows of USD 15,479 in November 2022! Therefore, the bulls must avoid any approach to this round psychological level. Different scenarios, but Bitcoin above 100k at some point very likely! A more likely scenario would be a typical retracement to the 38.2% retracement level, which awaits around USD 51,500 USD. And a still entirely normal pullback towards the 61.8% retracement could even lead Bitcoin back to approximately USD 38,000. Very bullish scenario for Bitcoin in USD, 2-week chart as of March 23rd, 2024. (weslad on Tradingview) Of course, we must first wait to see how demand from ETFs will develop in conjunction with the ""halving"". Furthermore, rapid spikes towards and above USD 70,000 are still possible at any time. However, we doubt whether the forces will be sufficient for significant new all-time highs above USD 75,000 to USD 77,000 by summer. Bitcoin in USD, potential cup & handle-scenario, as of March 23rd, 2024. (Tradingview) If the correction or consolidation would unfold as a ""cup & handle pattern"", the entire correction/consolidation process could take about three to nine months. This would result in a potential time projection towards September or October 2024 with a potential price target of USD 51,500 for the final low. Of course, this would be an outstanding buying opportunity before Bitcoin should head towards USD 100,000 and higher.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680372-bitcoin-potential-correction-despite-etfs-and-halving-btc-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/24809601.jpeg

24807558,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599642,1711422052,"Solana (SOL) Breaks Through Key Resistance, Analyst Forecasts $250 Price Target","Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable resurgence in its bullish momentum, with a rebound of over 9% in the past 24 hours. This notable performance has outpaced the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. The latest surge in SOL’s price has allowed it to surpass its resistance level on the daily chart at $184. The remaining hurdle of $201 now stands as the final barrier to prevent further gains for the cryptocurrency. However, industry experts and crypto analysts suggest that SOL’s price action indicates a potential continuation towards its previous all-time high of $259, achieved during the market’s bullish run in November 2021. SOL Price Expected To Breakout And Target All-Time Highs One analyst, “Jelle,” highlights SOL’s successful transformation of the last significant resistance level into support, suggesting a positive outlook for the token’s future. The analyst predicts that the SOL price will continue to rise and potentially exceed $250 by the summer. Related Reading: Bitcoin is “Overheating” For The First Time Ever Before Halving Similarly, another analyst using the pseudonym Mikybull points out that SOL is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern on a daily timeframe. According to the analyst, a breakout from this pattern is expected to trigger an “explosive” price movement, aiming to reach its previous all-time high levels at around $255. Supporting SOL’s renewed bullish momentum, CoinGecko data reveals a significant increase in trading volume, with $4,514,426,127 traded in the last 24 hours. This represents a 74.20% surge compared to the previous day, indicating a notable surge in market activity. Solana Metrics Demonstrate Growing Investor Interest According to data from Token Terminal, Solana’s key metrics further highlight the use and adoption of its blockchain among investors. Starting with market capitalization, the fully diluted market capitalization is $99.32 billion. This figure represents the total market value if all tokens were in circulation. The fully diluted market capitalization over the past 30 days has increased by 70.0%. On the other hand, the circulating market cap, which only considers the tokens currently in circulation, is valued at $77.05 billion. It has witnessed a 30-day growth of 71.3%. Examining fees generated through transactions on the Solana network, the 30-day fees amount to $51.46 million. This represents a notable surge of 220.7% within 30 days, highlighting increased network usage and demand. When annualized, the fees reach $626.15 million. Related Reading: 7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week In terms of revenue, Solana has seen positive growth. The 30-day revenue is $25.73 million, reflecting a significant increase of 220.7% over the past month. When annualized, the revenue amounts to $313.08 million, showing the sustainable income generation within the Solana network. It remains to be seen if these metrics and bullish momentum will sustain SOL’s path to its current all-time highs.

The Bitcoin price surge led to many short positions being liquidated, causing notable financial repercussions across various trading platforms. Bitcoin’s Sudden Rebound And Liquidations The data from Coinglass provide a clearer picture of the impact, showing that around 60,388 traders and counting faced losses exceeding $200 million in just 24 hours. The distribution of these liquidations varied among the major exchanges, with OKX traders experiencing the highest losses at $81.19 million, narrowly surpassing Binance’s $80.40 million in liquidations. Bybit and Huobi also reported significant figures of $18.98 million and $17.05 million in liquidations, highlighting the widespread effect of Bitcoin’s unexpected rally. The resurgence of Bitcoin to over $69,000 was particularly noteworthy, given its position below $66,000 in the early hours of Monday. While the exact catalyst for this abrupt rise remains uncertain, it puts Bitcoin a few dollars in value away from reclaiming its previous all-time high of $73,000. Analysts and traders are now closely watching the market for signs of Bitcoin’s next move, with speculation about the potential for new record highs in the near term. Looking Ahead: Bitcoin Bullish Prospects Crypto analyst Cryptoyoddha has provided an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin’s future, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of entering a new phase of its cycle that could see it reaching unprecedented heights. According to Cryptoyoddha, Bitcoin’s historical pattern of accumulation, followed by a parabolic surge, sets the stage for what he terms “Cycle IV,” a period that could potentially elevate Bitcoin’s value to $150,000 or more. According to the analyst, factors such as increased institutional investment, evolving regulatory clarity, and growing public acceptance of digital assets are key drivers of this bullish sentiment. #Bitcoin The real pump will start after the halving next month. pic.twitter.com/eV5FWkzkxX — Yoddha (@CryptoYoddha) March 23, 2024 Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra recently updated their forecast for Bitcoin’s year-end price, elevating it from an initial $80,000 to $90,000. This adjustment was prompted by notable factors such as the robust inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs and earnings from mining activities, which have contributed to a more optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s valuation. Additionally, they maintained that Bitcoin is on track to reach $150,000 by mid-2025, attributing this anticipated growth to several elements, including the impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which they expect to drive a significant upswing in the cryptocurrency’s price.

24804388,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=599615,1711414800,AVAX Soars 9% As Avalanche And Chainlink Announce Partnership For Global Asset Circulation,"According to a recent announcement from blockchain platform Avalanche (AVAX), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has partnered with Chainlink (LINK) Labs to explore the potential of on-chain digital assets for global movement and settlement. Using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), the collaboration aims to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains to enable uninterrupted delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets across networks in multiple currencies. Tokenized Asset Transaction Across Avalanche And Ethereum Using Chainlink ANZ, a provider of banking products and services to millions of customers in nearly 30 markets, has reportedly taken an unusual approach to exploring the world of on-chain digital assets. By leveraging Chainlink’s CCIP, ANZ is validating how customers can access, trade, and settle tokenized assets across multiple networks and currencies using Delivery vs. Payment. This approach aims to improve settlement efficiency and risk management for digital assets that fall under the classification of “securities” and their transactions. Related Reading: Social Media Storm Gives Dogecoin 14% Price Boost – Details According to Avalanche, Chainlink’s CCIP has been “crucial” in abstracting the complexities of moving tokenized assets across various blockchains, ensuring “atomic” cross-chain Delivery vs. Payment settlement. Notably, within the collaboration, ANZ simulated a transaction where a customer used ANZ’s Digital Asset Services (DAS) portal to purchase tokenized ANZ-issued New Zealand dollar stablecoins (NZ$DC) on Avalanche. Subsequently, the customer purchased tokenized Australian nature-based assets issued as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), denominated in tokenized ANZ-issued Australian dollar stablecoins (A$DC), on Ethereum. Furthermore, ANZ facilitated the FX conversion between the two currencies, while CCIP provided the necessary infrastructure to transfer tokens and data between Ethereum and Avalanche. ANZ Harnesses Avalanche’s Evergreen Subnet Monday’s announcement also revealed that ANZ used its Avalanche Evergreen Subnet for the project, leveraging its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, permissioning, and custom gas token features. The Evergreen Subnet allowed ANZ to explore new use cases and business models using customizable networks like Avalanche. ANZ’s collaboration with Chainlink and Avalanche showcases how traditional financial institutions embrace blockchain technology to enhance capital markets. Ultimately, Avalanche revealed that the initial results of the test transactions were promising, and the initiative could change how the financial services industry approaches tokenized assets. The next steps include deploying the solution on blockchain mainnets and extending the workflows to include communication between different blockchain networks for different use cases. AVAX Nears 22-Month High At the time of writing, Avalanche’s token AVAX has been on a steady uptrend, resulting in a remarkable increase of over 60% in the last 30 days. Currently, the token is trading at $58.31, just below its 22-month high of $65 set on Monday the 18th. Within the last 24 hours, AVAX experienced a 9% increase after the announcement of the collaboration with Chainlink and ANZ Group. This surge allowed the token to break through the $55 resistance level. However, the $60 level is expected to be another obstacle that could lead to a consolidation period between $55 and $60 should the bullish momentum fade.

Amid this ambitious pursuit, the digital asset faces a significant challenge that could influence its trajectory: scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite this potential regulatory hurdle, some analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s prospects. A detailed analysis by Captain Faibik, a market watcher, highlighted a bullish pattern in ETH’s four-hour candlestick chart, suggesting that the $4,000 threshold is within reach. Related Reading: Market Alert: Ethereum Faces Potential Downfall As Dencun Upgrade Looms – Here’s Why Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Milestone This optimism stems from a descending wedge pattern observed by Faibik, indicating an end to Ethereum’s consolidation phase and signaling a possible price breakout.

This decline saw ETH trading below the $3,500 mark, with a significant dip to $3,070 on March 20, amid reports of the SEC’s increasing interest in classifying Ethereum as a security. Particularly, reports indicate that the commission has been seeking financial records from US companies engaged with the Ethereum Foundation, intensifying the debate over Ethereum’s classification. Such regulatory scrutiny casts a shadow over Ethereum’s path to $4,000, introducing uncertainty into its future. ETF analyst James Seyffart suggests that the SEC’s stance could lead to the denial of spot Ethereum ETF applications by May 23, 2024. He cites a lack of engagement on Ethereum specifics, contrasting with the approach taken for Bitcoin ETFs. My cautiously optimistic attitude for ETH ETFs has changed from recent months. We now believe these will ultimately be denied May 23rd for this round. The SEC hasn’t engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics. Exact opposite of #Bitcoin ETFs this fall. https://t.co/TyAzAOrAC5 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) March 19, 2024 Ethereum’s Network Activity: A Silver Lining Despite these challenges, Ethereum’s network has witnessed notable growth, with increases in daily active users and transaction volumes signaling a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. An upsurge in network activity typically indicates heightened demand, a positive sign for Ethereum’s price potential. From January 3, the number of daily active Ethereum addresses surged by over 46%, coinciding with a significant price rally. This increased activity and price appreciation period highlights Ethereum’s resilience and potential for growth, even in the face of regulatory uncertainties. As Ethereum navigates through these regulatory and market challenges, the coming weeks will be critical in determining its ability to breach the $4,000 mark. The juxtaposition of technical bullish signals against the backdrop of SEC scrutiny presents a complex scenario for ETH.
