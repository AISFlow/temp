42426144,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjHrh,1414707395,MintPal Vows to Fight Former Moolah CEO in Court,"The owners of the troubled digital currency exchange MintPal are moving to take legal action against former Moopay LTD CEO Alex Green.  Green, who was once known as Ryan Kennedy, is accused of stealing as much as 4,000 BTC ($1.3m at press time) in user funds from MintPal following its failed relaunch and the subsequent collapse of Moopay (more commonly known as Moolah), which assumed control of the exchange this summer. Much of the stolen bitcoin was held in cold storage under the control of Green, according to the MintPal leadership.  In the past two weeks, numerous allegations tying Green to past fraudulent behavior have emerged. Green has denied engaging in unlawful behavior, but has admitted to changing his name from Ryan Kennedy to Alex Green.  CoinDesk spoke with Ferdous Bhai, a major shareholder and director of the holding company that owns MintPal.  Bhai has released a document detailing his and partner Mike Chu’s involvement with Green and their subsequent plans to recover customer funds. To this end, he said he is working with UK-based law firm Selachii LLP, the firm representing the syscoin developers in their legal fight against the former Moolah chief.  Bhai said that the team is focused on both bringing legal action against Green in the UK and, in the long-term, providing restitution to users who lost bitcoin following the closure of MintPal.  He said:  “How messy [the process] gets really depends on how cooperative Ryan is. The altcoins that didn't migrate to MintPal V2 – we estimate that to be around 1,000 BTC worth – we can return to users. The other missing amounts, including missing bitcoins, are still with Ryan and hopefully we can get him to cough up those as well. Then, we can return the bitcoins to customers and rebuild, rebrand from there.”  CoinDesk reached out to Green for comment but had not received a reply by press time.  Promising start gives way to chaos  According to the document shared by Bhai, the partners saw promise in the original MintPal platform and the team at Moolah working under Green. Given MintPal's troubled security history but past success in building trading volume, the opportunity seemed legitimate.  He wrote:  “At the time, [Green] was one of the 'good guys' in my book. I had participated in Moolah’s crowdfunding, donated to his charities and I was looking to invest more in cryptocurrency space. I believed that MintPal had the potential to be one of the top businesses in the cryptocurrency space and we had the opportunity to acquire it relatively cheaply. So I jumped at the opportunity.”  Chu and Bhai were set to own 65% of the company, with the remainder afforded to Green and Moolah developers working on the MintPal V2 project. The failed relaunch and the turmoil surrounding Moolah created an environment that, according to Bhai, gave Green an opportunity to begin moving customer funds out of cold storage.  Bhai's account of the affair included a Skype exchange he had with Green, during which time the now-ex Moolah CEO blamed the MintPal leadership for the loss of customer funds. Bhai was later compelled to pay off Moolah’s unpaid server bills, which nearly resulted in the loss of roughly 1,000 BTC in customer funds that failed to migrate during the switch from the original platform to the new one.  Bhai said that as of today, Green remains in control of the cache of bitcoins, the amount of which he says is difficult to estimate. He cited activity under a LocalBitcoins account presumed to be owned by Green as evidence that most, if not all, of the funds held by Green have already been sold.  Bhai added that, if true, this means Green is in violation of an injunction granted Monday by the UK High Court against him and Moolah.  Recovery just beginning  Bhai conceded, both in his statement and in conversation with CoinDesk, that MintPal’s future as a digital currency exchange is far from certain. What comes next, he said, is an effort to bring charges against Green and regain control of the funds previously held in cold storage.  He wrote in the statement:  “At this point, we have enough evidence of identity theft, fraud and theft to bring Ryan to justice and perhaps recover the stolen funds for our customers by liquidating Ryan’s assets, but I have already depleted my financial resources by now to support the ongoing legal costs personally.”  Bhai explained that the team hopes to crowdfund $25,000 to help pay for the legal effort. According to Bhai, digital currency trader Jordan Fish, known more commonly by his Twitter handle CryptoCobain, will hold control of any funds raised.    Let's help @ferdousbhai with legal fees to take down ""Alex Green"". Read full story and details: http://t.co/8y8v6YaTkH      — CRYPTO CO฿AIN (@CryptoCobain) October 30, 2014    Fish later suggested that Andreas Antonopoulos could help manage control the funds, and several community members have since pledged support for the project.  Bhai said that the legal effort to get the funds is the MintPal team’s top priority. Funds raised to help support their suit will be returned to donors if the bid is successful and Green is held liable for both the missing bitcoins and the legal fees associated with the case.

42398042,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFEBD,1414704201,Boost VC Demo Day: Meet Tribe 4's Bitcoin Startups,"It’s the final day of Tribe 4's tenure in Boost VC’s startup accelerator, and things have been busier than ever.  The accelerator, perhaps most famous for its CEO Adam Draper’s promise to fund 100 bitcoin startups by the end of 2017, has been housing 16 bitcoin startups in its San Mateo, California, headquarters since the beginning of July.  The group, colloquially referred to as Tribe 4, has been gearing up for the startup world’s equivalent of a graduation ceremony: Boost’s Demo Day. Today, each of the startups will present a 3–4 minute pitch of their company to a room filled with hundreds of potential investors – an equal mix of venture capitalists and angels.  CoinDesk spoke at length with Draper and many of the Tribe 4 startups leading up to Demo Day. Together, they helped paint a picture of what it’s like to be part of a program that was built with a primary focus on bolstering the bitcoin ecosystem.  Their stories tell of an atmosphere that benefits immensely from collaboration and a vast professional network, but ultimately requires that the companies themselves put in the hard work.  “The two things we focus on giving our startups is a network and as much relevant advice as we can provide. That’s all we can completely control,” said Draper.  Whatever they’re doing, it seems to be working.  Boost’s acceleration  Boost has built a reputation on the breadth and depth of its alumni: it has accelerated startups such as BitPagos, Gliph, snapCard and Vaurum, to name a few.  Applications for Tribe 4 were up 40% from Boost’s previous startup batch. Less than 4% of the 700 applicants were accepted to the program – a figure that speaks to the quality of entrepreneurs in this latest Tribe.  Most of the startups in Tribe 4 are working with bitcoin or the block chain, the technology's underlying ledger. There’s ZapChain, the first social network built for bitcoiners; Hashrabbit, a software platform built to secure and monitor mining hardware; and CoinHako, a company hoping to make bitcoin buying and selling more convenient in Asia.  The diversity of the startups highlights the public’s growing interest in bitcoin and block chain technologies, Draper said, adding:  “What bitcoin has really done is make FinTech sexy. All of the best engineers are now attracted to the sector, so the level of talent is just through the roof.”  Only the beginning  Demo Day marks the culmination of the months of hard work, learning and iterating that the Tribe 4 startups have endured, but it’s not the end of the road for the company founders.  When asked what their plans are for the future, post-Demo Day, many of the accelerator's entrepreneurs expressed a similar sentiment: growth.  “Fundraising, hiring and growing,” said BlockCypher CEO Catheryne Nicholson.  “We're still furiously building product and planning the full launch of our marketplace in early 2015. We're also hiring,” Matthew J Martin said of his company Blossom.  “We’re introducing a new feature that will make it even easier for our users to network with other bitcoin professionals,” said ZapChain’s founder Matt Schlicht.  Wherever the future takes them, the new graduates of the startup accelerator can always count on having a partner in Boost VC (in line with industry standards, Boost takes a small percentage of equity from each company in which it invests).  Draper said:  “This is just the beginning. We’re invested forever, and we want the startups to feel like we set up a solid foundation for them to build a great company on.”  Here are the bitcoin startups that graduate today from Boost VC's Tribe 4:  BlockCypher  Founders: Matthieu Riou and Catheryne Nicholson  What does your company do?  BlockCypher  is like Amazon Web Services for block chains. Our web services enable developers to easily build block chain applications.      ZapChain  Founders: Matt Schlicht and Adam McKenna  What does your company do?

Coinmotion  Founders: Teemu Päivinen, Tom Hämäläinen and Kasper Parviainen  What does your company do?  Coinmotion  is a super easy way to buy, store and use bitcoin in Europe.      Blossom  Founder: Matthew J Martin  What does your company do?  Blossom  is a peer-to-peer financing marketplace for Muslims. Blossom connects small businesses with interest-free financing options using a profit-sharing model.      Palarin  Founders: Brian Gamido, Lester Forteza and Marciano Aguila  What does your company do?  Palarin  is transforming remittances using bitcoin technology, starting with the Philippines.      Hedgy  Founders: Matt Slater, Juan Pineda, Warren Anderson and Tim Olson  What does your company do?  Hedgy  does price risk management for bitcoin.

42398033,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE2M,1414695664,Bitreserve Launches With Real-Time Transparency Data,"Bitreserve, the latest attempt to introduce bitcoin to the mass market, opened for business today. The platform lets users store their bitcoin and convert it to a number of different currencies. It also promises users total transparency in the form of a balance sheet updated in real-time.  The platform has been operating in beta since May, but its promised transparency options have only now become available to users. At launch, a new status page has gone live, detailing Bitreserve's assets and its obligations to its users.  At press time, Bitreserve's assets stood at $166,091 and its obligations were $113,025. According to those figures, the firm's assets cover its obligations by 147%.  Further transparency data, including information to trace a transaction to the bitcoin block chain, and a dataset showing all transactions between Bitreserve and its users, is also available to download. The company calls the block chain traceability data the Reservechain, while its feed of transactions with its users is called the Reserveledger.  Bitreserve promises external audits of its accounts every 90 days in order to verify the accuracy of the data contained in its Reservechain and Reserveledger. It hasn't announced who it has engaged as auditor.  Delayed launch  The Bitreserve launch was intended for mid-October but the company suffered a two-week delay because of compliance issues, according to a public relations executive representing the company.  The founder of Bitreserve is Halsey Minor, who started CNET in the 1990s before going on to invest successfully in technology companies like Salesforce.com and Grand Central, which was acquired by Google and incorporated into Google Voice. He also faced recalled loans and other financial setbacks in the wake of the 2008 crisis.  In June, Minor gave CoinDesk a preview of the platform while it was still in beta. The launch version looks almost identical, with a few cosmetic additions like the ability to select a 'theme' on the platform's home page.  However, as we noted in our review of the service then, Bitreserve relies on a 'bitcoin in, bitcoin out' system. This means users can only purchase items from merchants who already accept bitcoin, or from merchants who have joined Bitreserve and will accept payments denominated in fiat on the platform.  Bitreserve currently recommends users look for bitcoin-accepting merchants on useBitcoins and it has not yet announced that any retailers have joined its platform.

42398029,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDyQ,1414688100,Report: Millennials and the Wealthy Most Likely to Use Bitcoin,"A new study suggests that 'millennials' and more affluent consumers see the most promise in digital currencies like bitcoin. The research further suggests that these groups could be the driving force behind mainstream adoption of the digital currency in the future.  Data from technology research firm Accenture collected insights into the digital payment preferences of more than 4,000 US citizens, and found that while only 8% of participants currently use digital currency, 18% foresee using the technology by the year 2020.  Individuals in the millennial generation – corresponding roughly to individuals between the ages of 18 and 34 – reported more enthusiasm for digital currency than the overall survey group. Thirteen percent of respondents in that category reported that they already use digital currencies on a daily basis, and 26% said that they would likely use them in the future.  Of consumers most likely to use digital currencies, both today and in the future, wealthy respondents showed the most enthusiasm: 19% of affluent participants use digital currencies today and 32% said that they expect to use them by 2020.  The Accenture report highlights that consumers see the cost, security and privacy benefits of digital currency, but stops short of guaranteeing the success of the technology, noting:  “Despite projected growth in use of digital currencies in the coming years, there is work to do to influence consumer awareness and adoption, particularly among people age 35 and over. Current users cite the protection of personal identity via anonymous transactions as the leading benefit of digital currencies.”  The results also suggest that a general apprehension shared among consumers regarding digital currency stems largely from a lack of information.  Benefits seen by consumers  According to Accenture, consumers are growing more aware of the advantages of using digital currency over both bank and non-bank payment options. The report indicates that digital currencies were cited by survey participants as the most promising payment technology on the market today, even though questions remain about the risks involved.  The report notes:  “This debate will likely continue as digital currencies mature, but it is not stopping consumers from using them. Among all payment instruments included in the Accenture survey, respondents expect the biggest boost in usage from today to 2020 to be in digital currencies.”  Thirty-six percent of respondents said that the pseudonymity and transaction protections offered by digital currencies were the most attractive characteristics of the technology. Twenty-one percent cited low-cost transactions as a major benefit, and 20% said that the lack of a central government or regulatory body made them interested in digital currencies.  Consumers also highlighted the ability to send transfers across borders cheaply and the fact that digital currency transactions are irreversible, with 15% and 7% of the group citing those advantages, respectively.  Concerns driven by information gap  Past studies have shown the general unease among consumer regarding digital currencies is driven in part by a lack of information. Accenture’s results echo those sentiments, with 38% of survey participants indicating that they have a poor understanding the technology and need more information.  Other participants focused on the functionality and legality of digital currencies as reasons for their reluctance to use them. A quarter of the survey group said that the inconvenience of conducting digital transactions is an issue, while 14% suggested that the ability to use the technology for fraudulent uses is problematic.  Accenture adds that, in order for digital currencies to see more widespread use over the next few years, the benefits need to be explained clearly and demonstrated to the broader public.  “For any digital currency to go mainstream, consumers need to be educated and become confident in it as a trusted and easy-to-use payment instrument,” the report concludes.

Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck will take over immediately as its newly appointed executive director, while Matonis' board seat will be filled in a January 2015 election that will also appoint new members to positions vacated by Peter Vessenes and Gavin Andresen.  Matonis has served as the head of the bitcoin industry's oldest trade organisation since July 2013, when current Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation Peter Vessenes resigned as executive director at the nine-month-old foundation. Matonis served as a board director and secretary for the group from its 2012 inception to the time he assumed the executive director position.  In statements to CoinDesk, Matonis voiced his hope that the Bitcoin Foundation will remain a powerful advocate for bitcoin, and expressed his personal gratitude to those who have been involved with the organisation.  Matonis said:  “Leading the Bitcoin Foundation has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Merging the diverse interests of the bitcoin community has been intellectually and professionally stimulating and now its time to pass the baton.""  Matonis intends to continue to work professionally in the bitcoin community through private-sector initiatives. He will continue to hold the title of founding member due to his early involvement in the group. The Bitcoin Foundation is currently seeking to fill the role of general counsel, which has now been vacated by Murck.  Matonis previously held positions at investment management and digital payments consulting company Lydia Group, encrypted messaging startup Hush Communications, authentication services pioneer Verisign, and international credit card giant Visa.  A graduate from George Washington University, Matonis holds a BA in Economics, and also studied at the University of Maryland.    The time has come for me to resign as Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation. Thank you for all of your passionate support! More soon.      — Jon Matonis (@jonmatonis) October 30, 2014      Tenure marked by controversies  Although his appointment was originally greeted with enthusiasm by the community, Matonis' tenure at the Bitcoin Foundation has not been without its share of controversies, the most notable coming earlier this year when two other members of the board of directors resigned amid accusations of criminal wrongdoing outside of the foundation.  Former BitInstant CEO and current advisor at Payza Charlie Shrem was the first to abdicate his post in January, stepping down from his seat after he was arrested in connection with enabling commerce on the online black market Silk Road. Shrem subsequently pleaded guilty to unlicensed money transmission and is awaiting sentencing.  Similarly, Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles vacated his post in February, resigning as a director at the foundation ahead of the company's highly public collapse.  The Bitcoin Foundation faced criticism from the community at the time for its handling of both incidents. The group would later again face criticism in May, as members exited following controversial appointments resulting from the group's voting process.  Expanding international focus  There were numerous accomplishments during his tenure, as well. As executive director, Matonis also sought to expand the international reach of the Bitcoin Foundation, launching its first international chapters in December and overseeing the relocation of the group to London to align with these global goals.  In the subsequent months, the Bitcoin Foundation would add 10 international groups, including new chapters in Australia, Mexico and most recently France.  Matonis further led the organisation's attempts to bring new standardization to the technology, championing such initiatives as establishing a three-letter currency code (XBT) for bitcoin, and later a Unicode-approved bitcoin symbol.  Matonis also remained a visible figure in the bitcoin community, engaging community members at major conferences, contributing posts to the Bitcoin Foundation blog and writing opinion pieces for CoinDesk, where he continues to serve as a contributing editor.  His work has appeared in American Banker, Forbes and PaymentsSource, among other publications.

42398032,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE1N,1414675670,Ex-SEC Chief: Bitcoin Companies Need Compliance To Succeed,"The former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Arthur Levitt discussed the evolving regulatory landscape for bitcoin companies and the commission's ability to keep up with fast-paced technological changes in a wide-ranging interview on Bloomberg TV yesterday.  Levitt, who is the SEC's longest-serving chairman, became one of the highest-profile figures from the world of financial regulation to enter the cryptocurrency space when he announced that he was joining BitPay and Vaurum as an advisor two days ago.  In the Bloomberg TV interview, Levitt said he had been approached by six bitcoin companies before deciding to join BitPay and Vaurum. He said he had become ""fascinated"" by bitcoin as he learned about it and he highlighted the ""irreverent"" and ""smart"" entrepreneurs leading the bitcoin startups he's advising.  The former SEC supremo, whose eight-year tenure there began in 1993, underlined the importance of regulatory compliance for bitcoin companies as a legal framework developed around digital currencies in the US:  ""I think the reason they approached me is because, I think, number one, they think having a former regulator probably looks good. But I also believe that a company that has transparency and passes regulatory scrutiny is going to do much better than a company that is fighting regulators ... So I don't buy the libertarian argument that we don't need any regulation.""  Lawsky 'has right balance'  Levitt praised New York State's Superintendent of Financial Services, Ben Lawsky, for the way he has handled the BitLicense proposal.  Lawsky recently won a positive response from the bitcoin community after he declared software developers and miners generally exempt from the regulatory framework being devised in New York, although many still have doubts about some areas of the proposal.  Levitt pointed out that Lawsky's move, along with his call for public comments on the BitLicense, showed that he understood the ""fine line"" between protecting the investing public and allowing new technologies the time and space to flourish.  Levitt said:  ""There are regulators and there are regulators. By that I mean a really good regulator is one who understands the balance between protecting the public and stifling an exciting and different new technology. I happen to think that Ben Lawsky has the balance right.""  Levitt currently sits on the board of financial media heavyweight Bloomberg LP and online stock brokerage Motif Investing. He is also an advisor to top investment bank Goldman Sachs, trading giant Knight Capital and compliance firm Promontory Financial Group.  Benefits of bitcoin  The potential of bitcoin's block chain to reshape contracts and national currencies, as well as its ability to facilitate low-cost global transactions, was also given airtime by Levitt.  Levitt pointed to Argentina, which is experiencing a rapid devaluation of its peso in relation to the US dollar, as an example of a place where bitcoin could show its full potential.  He said:  ""If you're in Argentina today and your currency is being devalued by the second, virtually, and you can't send money out of Argentina, you can use bitcoin electronically to transmit it over the web from Argentina to New York or to Berlin. So for third-world countries or countries with uncertain currencies, it's a tremendous opportunity for them.""  The biggest risk for bitcoin's success, Levitt said, was its extremely high volatility. The former top financial regulator said mass adoption of bitcoin wouldn't happen while wild fluctuations in the price of a bitcoin remained.  ""The greatest problem that bitcoin has today is its volatility. Unless they address that volatility, it's going to be difficult getting people to have trust, and that is essential to any good monetary system,"" he explained.  Regulators playing catch-up  Levitt also discussed the SEC's ability to stay on top of technological progress in general, in the wake of a new study from the University of Chicago that found certain institutional investors could obtain company filings before the general public using high-speed data feeds. These investors can then profit from the information by feeding it into computerised trading algorithms, the study found.  Regulators would always be ""slightly"" behind ""wrongdoers"" or those seeking an advantage over other market participants, he said, and there is nothing alarming about that state of affairs. However, when the regulator is too far behind, that's when a serious problem has arisen.  Levitt said:  ""You have to first assume that the wrongdoers or people who want an edge are always going to be slightly ahead of the regulators. When they're way ahead of the regulators, then the system is out of kilter. But things like this happen.""  Over his eight years at the helm of the SEC, Levitt developed a reputation as a champion of the man on the street. As chairman, he warned of the possible problems arising from auditors who also did consulting duties for clients, and he was proved right by the collapse of Enron and Worldcom, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.  Levitt alluded to his interest in defending everyday investors when he described the problems the markets could face if the SEC didn't address the unfair technological advantage some investors held over others:  ""The individual will think that the big guy, the big institution, has every advantage and we, the individual investor, have to take a backseat to everybody else. And that's bad. If we don't have markets that are trustworthy, we don't have markets.""

42398039,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE9F,1414666944,Bitcoin Exchange Kraken Launches in Japan,"Bitcoin exchange Kraken will launch in Japan today, aiming itself at the nation's large number of active traders and finance professionals.  In its announcement, the company highlighted the strength of Kraken's security and engineering team, as well as its high trade volumes and reputation for compliance.  Gaining public trust is a high priority for any bitcoin business planning to establish a Japanese base, given the local media's tendency to highlight the digital currency's association with Mt Gox and Silk Road.  The new managing director of Kraken in Japan, Ayako Miyaguchi, told CoinDesk the company's ability to handle larger volumes will be the main drawcard for Japanese users, especially professional traders who may not have experimented with bitcoin yet.  ""That's what we can do better than the smaller exchanges,"" she said.  Kraken's proven history operating from the US also gave it confidence when establishing essential relationships with banks and local regulators such as the Financial Services Authority (FSA).  Now is a good time to open a new exchange in Japan, Miyaguchi added, since businesses are in need of an exchange they can trust and regulators simply want to avoid another Mt Gox-like situation.  She said:  ""We have a proven history in places like Europe, so we're not just saying we're good, we actually have been successful ... We can be a model, we can lead the industry.""  The Kraken team, especially Miyaguchi, have been instrumental in forming Japan's new bitcoin industry group, the Japan Authority of Digital Asset (JADA), and have met with government representatives on several occasions.  Launch delays  Kraken's launch in Japan has been a while coming, with a few false alarms along the way.  While the company has always intended to set up shop in the world's third-largest economy, the length of time it took to realise that ambition highlights the fact that setting up a bitcoin exchange in a new market is no simple process.  The initial plan was to launch in Japan at the beginning of the year, but the Gox debacle forced a postponement. Japan's society simply wasn't ready at that point, and there was a need to build trust, the exchange indicated.  CEO Jesse Powell has also highlighted the struggle Kraken and other bitcoin companies have faced with banks in the past. Notably, his company has just this week reinstated USD deposits and added GBP deposits and withdrawals after losing its US banking partner in February.  With the new Japanese operation and availability in the UK, Kraken will focus on two potentially lucrative markets.  The US, however, remains problematic for bitcoin exchanges. Though based in San Francisco, the company considers the US a ""low priority"" and has focused instead on overseas markets, particularly the Eurozone, where its trade volumes are highest. Its new banking partner in Luxembourg also handles deposits in USD and GBP.  Bitcoin making gains  Bitcoin growth in Japan is looking healthy despite the early image setbacks, with a number of companies opening for business in the past few months.  Current bitcoin exchanges in the Japanese market include the simple brokerages BtcBox, BitFlyer and Pay-Bit, plus the pan-Asian trader-focused exchange Quoine, which operates a Japanese language site. Together with payment processors Coincheck and Bitbank, they all allow deposits and withdrawals for Japanese banks.  However, Japanese consumers can be conservative and have high customer service expectations, Miyaguchi said, making it essential to offer both the exchange's online services and customer support in the native Japanese language.  Kraken received $5m in Series A funding from Hummingbird Ventures in March. Later that month it produced one of the world's first cryptographically verifiable proof of reserves audits showing it held 100% of the bitcoins its records claimed.
