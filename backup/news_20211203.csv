13221832,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=478086,1638575993,IOTA to Release Smart Contract Network ‘Assembly’ And Distribute ASMB Token,"The ledger IOTA aims to become &apos;a fully decentralized, feeless multi-asset ledger&apos; by launching Assembly in 2022, a governance layer one for permissionless smart contracts, along with the native token ASMB that will open the doors for the network&apos;s main stakeholders, who would be democratizing Assembly. IOTA&apos;s founders say the ledger is a &apos;public permission-less backbone for the Internet of Things that enables interoperability between multiple devices.&apos; It aims to provide decentralized transactions accessible for everyone, without the need for miners or blocks, offering solutions for the cost fees, increasing scalability, and staying secure by using the Tangle network. As the Shimmer network was released only two weeks ago along with its own token -with real monetary value, most likely to be traded on crypto exchanges- to stake, some skeptical users questioned the actual need for Assembly, but enthusiasts have compared to a scalable Ethereum without imposed fees. Smart contracts will be allowed to run for free, but there is an option to put a price when high computing power is needed, in which cases supply and demand will determine prices. Smart contract chains can be fully run from Assembly&apos;s own network, which is the reason for all activities to be anchored to the IOTA Tangle to provide trust by &apos;making them fully immutable and secure&apos;.

The three new currencies replaced Aave, The Graph and Uniswap, reversing a trend earlier in the year, in which listings of DeFi assets on major centralized exchanges propelled them into the CoinDesk 20 and remade the list.  The CoinDesk 20 is a list of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by volume, as measured on a select list of trusted exchanges. The list is reconstituted quarterly, using data observed over the prior two quarters. The full list is here. A full description of the methodology can be found here. Volume data is provided by Nomics.  All three of the new currencies are related to Web 3, a category of cryptocurrency projects aimed at providing globally decentralized and permissionless computer networks. Here’s a brief introduction to the new assets in the CoinDesk 20:  Solana trades under the ticker SOL. It’s the native currency of a project by the same name that aims to deliver a faster, more cost-efficient Web 3 platform for decentralized applications. As such, it is a competitor to Ethereum.  Atom trades under the ticker ATOM. It’s the native currency of Cosmos, a project that looks to provide Web 3 developers with tools to allow interoperability between blockchains. It is sometimes referred to as an “internet of blockchains.”  Internet Computer trades under the ticker ICP. It’s the native currency of a project by the same name that aims to provide a network of cloud computing providers accessible via the ICP token – essentially a decentralized version of Amazon Web Services. Internet Computer was formerly known as Dfinity.  The three replaced assets are all DeFi-related:  Aave is the native currency of a lending application that sets interest rates and serves depositors and borrowers.  The Graph is a decentralized data indexing service that manages data from Web 3 projects. It is widely used by DeFi applications.  Uniswap is among the largest decentralized exchanges by volume and its native token is one of the top DeFi currencies by market cap.

42396406,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT390n,1638567563,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Extends Losses While Traders Remain Bullish on Ether,"Cryptocurrencies were mostly lower on Friday aside from a few standouts such as Terra’s LUNA token, which was up about 9% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin was trading at the lower end of its weeklong trading range around $53,000 at the time of publication, which is below its $1 trillion market capitalization.  BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up about 2% over the past week compared to a 7% gain in ether and a 13% gain in Solana’s SOL token over the same period. The dispersion in weekly returns suggests that alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are starting to outperform.  Latest prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $53,528, -6.2%  Ether (ETH): $4,218, -7.2%  S&P 500: -0.9%  Gold: $1,783, +0.8%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.36%  Headwinds for risk assets  Some analysts are paying close attention to the slower pace of global monetary easing, which could reduce investors’ appetite for speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies and equities.  “In our view, the speed with which global liquidity contracts is the most important factor for cryptocurrency performance in the weeks ahead and possibly even into early 2022,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients on Friday. The U.S. crypto exchange noted that overall market performance could be mixed heading into the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14-15.  “The steady unwinding of monetary accommodation in 2022 points to both lower returns for equities and losses for bonds, and greater volatility than over the past 20 months,” MRB Partners, a global investment research firm, wrote in a Friday report.  Ether takes a breather  Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to struggle below its all-time price high of $4,865. The current pullback in ETH could stabilize around the $4,000 support level, although the price rally since the July low around $1,740 is starting to fade.  On a relative basis, ether is poised to outperform bitcoin if a breakout above 0.08 in the ETH/BTC ratio is confirmed next week. Charts still show significant resistance, which preceded downturns in ETH/BTC during the 2018 crypto bear market.  “This [pending] breakout is essential because it represents a resistance line going back to the 2017 top when one ETH was 0.15 BTC. The monthly close of the ETH/BTC chart was the highest bullish close in 45 months,” Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, chief product officer at Bitpanda, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  For now, the options market remains bullish on ether. The chart below shows the largest number of calls with an exercise price of $5,000 ETH.  Altcoin roundup  Terra’s LUNA token surges to new all-time high after big week of gains: The token of the Ethereum competitor surged to an all-time high price of $69.91 Friday afternoon after starting the week at around $49. The token climbed to become the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassing the token of another Ethereum competitor, Avalanche, and meme coin shiba inu, according to data from CoinGecko.

The company aims to make it more straightforward and user friendly by adding NFT functionality directly into its wallet.

42396405,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT38yp,1638567525,Bitcoin Confined to Familiar Range as Stocks Rise Ahead of Payrolls Data,"Bitcoin continues to trade in a familiar range as traditional markets exhibit improved risk appetite, with investors eyeing the release of the U.S. monthly employment report.  The top cryptocurrency was trading near $57,000 at press time, extending a three-day-long consolidation in the range of $55,800 to $59,300.  European stocks traded higher, tracking an overnight bounce on Wall Street, which saw the S&P 500 index surge 1.4%. However, gains were moderate, at best, with COVID concerns dominating the sentiment. Australia reported the first case of the Omicron variant early Friday despite having travel restrictions in place. The U.S. also registered the first case early this week.  The U.S. nonfarm payrolls data scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC on Friday is forecast to show the world’s largest economy added 550,000 jobs in November after 531,000 additions in October. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.5% from 4.6%, while the average hourly earnings is forecast to increase 0.4% month-on-month, according to FXStreet.  The dollar could resume its recent uptrend, putting downward pressure on bitcoin and asset prices, in general, if the payrolls data bolsters bets of faster normalization of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed).  “Another 500,000+ increase in the headline number, a decline in the unemployment rate and an increase in hourly earnings should all keep short-dated U.S. rates supported on the view that the Fed could exit super-loose policy more quickly,” ING analysts noted in a blog post.  “Any sharper-than-expected drop in the unemployment rate (3.8% has been suggested as a metric for full employment and the start of tightening) or sharper rise in average hourly earnings (e.g. more than 0.4% month-on-month) could drive the dollar higher today,” ING analysts added.  Thanks to inflation running hotter than expected, fears of faster Fed rate hikes have gripped markets in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell retired the word transitory from inflation discussion and said that the central bank might consider speeding up the unwinding of asset purchases in December. On Thursday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told the Financial Times that the Omicron variant could fuel soaring inflation in the U.S. by further pressuring supply chains and worsening worker shortages.  Bitcoin’s bull run has lost steam in recent weeks, allowing a more than 15% pullback from record highs.  The cryptocurrency is now looking to break out of a falling channel represented by trendlines connecting Nov. 10 and Nov. 15 highs and Nov. 6 and Nov. 19 lows.  A weaker-than-expected payrolls figure would raise questions on the Fed’s ability to taper more quickly, perhaps pushing bitcoin, stocks and other risk assets higher. “Bitcoin’s correlation with S&P 500 increased amid the general market sell-off, strengthening our hypothesis that more sophisticated investors are currently not looking at bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, but as a risk-on asset,” Arcane Research’s weekly note published Tuesday said.

42396392,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT38oz,1638566179,Warren Targets Bitcoin Miner Greenidge’s Environmental Footprint,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned the environmental footprint of Greenidge Generation’s (GREE) bitcoin mining operation in New York state in a detailed letter dated Thursday to the publicly traded company’s CEO, Jeffrey Kirt.  In the letter, Warren told Kirt that she is concerned about the company’s energy usage and impact on the environment and consumers.  “Given the extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining, mining operations at Greenidge and other plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment, on local ecosystems and on consumer electricity costs,” she wrote, asking for a detailed response by Dec. 17.  Greenidge’s New York mining facility received lots of criticism earlier this year. Environmentalists objected to the power station burning natural gas to mine bitcoin as well as to its cooling system’s alleged impact on a local lake. In May, the company announced that it would counteract the emissions that its rigs produce with carbon offset credit purchases starting on June 1.  Bitcoin miners use massive amounts of energy to power their operations. To combat this narrative, miners have recently been opting for more sustainable power sources.  A recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry forum, found that sustainable power has grown to about 58% of the total used by the industry worldwide during the third quarter from 3% in the second quarter. The increase is partly due to the rapid expansion of North American mining amid an exodus from China, and the shift to sustainable energy and better mining techniques.  Yet Warren said that energy consumed by bitcoin miners matched that of Denmark, Chile, Argentina and Washington state. “Bitcoin’s estimated annual power consumption increased more than threefold between the beginning of 2019 and May 2021,” she wrote.  The letter marks the first time Warren has requested information from a miner about its operations. “Dresden plant’s greenhouse gas emissions increased nearly tenfold from 2019 to 2020,” she wrote referring to the New York operation. “In 2020, it sent over 220,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – equivalent to the emissions of 50,000 cars,” she added.  Greenidge bills itself as the “first and only carbon neutral, vertically integrated power generator and bitcoin miner of scale in the United States” on its website. The company is also building mining operations in Spartanburg, S.C., where it expects to start mining later this month or early next year.  “We look forward to providing a detailed response to the Senator’s questions, sharing how the facility meets all of New York’s nation-leading environmental standards, is bringing economic opportunity to an underserved area of the state, and is a model for crypto mining with widespread local support,” a Greenidge spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday morning.  On Wednesday, Greenidge Generation said it plans to sell $35 million in senior notes, due in October 2026, which comes after the company raised $55.2 million in senior notes with similar terms on Oct. 13.

42394337,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc8TX,1638565256,Miami’s Multiple Money Visions,"The excellent collection of essays compiled for CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week began with a perfect summation of where money is going by podcaster Laura Shin: “It’s going to get a lot weirder.”  Having just spent a few days in the madhouse of the non-fungible token (NFT) scene at a series of events on the sidelines of Art Basel in Miami, that prediction seems spot on.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  I’m pleased Laura used the comparative “weirder,” because the truth is money has always been weird.  Regardless of what gold bugs might tell you, all money – whether it’s based on a shiny rock, a piece of paper or bits and bytes – is an imagined phenomenon. Yet, to function, money needs us to collectively believe that is far more lasting and real than something we’ve just conjured out of thin air. Belief is everything.  What makes the current moment weirder and the future weirder still is that this collective belief process is being fragmented. There isn’t just one common expression of money anymore. There are now countless, competing imaginings of money and of new concepts for assets, value and property.  Look at some of the headlines from our Future of Money collection of articles: Daniel Kuhn making “The Transhumanist Case for Crypto,” David Morris arguing that “Memes Are the Future of Money” and Edward Oosterbaan asking the question, “What is Money in the Metaverse?” Taken together what they tell us is that, when it comes to money and value, people’s minds have broken free of the constraints of the traditional, nation-state-led legal framework we’ve worked under for centuries.  This is all possible, of course, because blockchains resolve one of the core problems that any system of money needs to overcome before it can become trusted by the community it serves: the problem of double counting. You don’t need a trusted government to enforce the system and prevent counterfeiting; the protocol does it for us.  Just because people are imagining and deploying multiple new forms of money doesn’t mean, however, they are all going to succeed as lasting, sustainable models. You can imagine something new and put it out there, but to succeed, a big enough community needs to glob onto and use it.  In Miami this week, the excitement and passion around new ideas for NFTs was palpable. But as artists, developers, entrepreneurs and all manner of gold diggers constantly pitched me new ideas for metaverses, games, ticketing solutions, music sharing, you name it, it was hard not to draw parallels with the dot-com bubble or crypto’s own version that phenomenon, the initial coin offering bubble of 2017.  To paraphrase a classic meme of this NFT moment: “We’re NOT all gonna make it.” (wNagmi?)  Still, it’s also true to say that change is also inevitable. There is a Cambrian explosion of innovation underway. A powerful force of rapid evolution has been unleashed. Even if governments and other institutions wanted to maintain the dominance of the old system, they can’t. This is unstoppable.  Get ready to embrace the weird.

42417104,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4pIL,1638563484,"Universal Stablecoins, the End of Cash and CBDCs: 5 Predictions for the Future of Money","With the rise of bitcoin, stablecoins and decentralized finance, the last 10 years have been an incredibly crazy time for those of us who write about money. Many of the innovations we’ve seen since Bitcoin debuted in 2008 are going to endure for the rest of our lives. Some of them will be unwound as embarrassing mistakes. Here are my five predictions about the future of money.  J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  1. Decentralized finance won’t eclipse centralized finance. Eventually, they’ll just blur together.  Many of the features that decentralized finance, or DeFi, brings to the table will be copied by regular finance in the future. For instance, there’s no reason that regular finance can’t copy the automaticity and programmability that DeFi offers, without bothering with the blockchain part.  Even as regular finance copies the useful bits from DeFi, DeFi will emulate regular finance by pulling itself into the same regulatory framework. That is, DeFi tools will become compliant with anti-money laundering/know your customer (AML/KYC) rules, Securities and Exchange Commission-registered or licensed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  And not necessarily because they are forced to do so. (It’s hard to force a truly decentralized protocol to do anything.) Tools will comply voluntarily. Most of the world’s capital is licit capital. Licit capital wants to be on regulated venues, not illegal ones. To capture this capital, DeFi has no choice but to get compliant.  The upshot is that over time DeFi and traditional finance (TradFi) will blur together. People won’t know or care whether the financial products that they are consuming are, under the hood, decentralized or regular finance.  But there’ll always be a small wild edge, true DeFi, which avoids regulations and does what it wants. That’s where the outsiders, hobbyists, activists and criminals will all congregate.  2. El Salvador won’t be known as a watershed moment. It’ll be known as a reality check.  For many bitcoin fans, El Salvdor’s adoption of bitcoin in 2020 was a watershed moment. First El Salvador, then the rest of Central America, next South America and then the United States. By 2030, the entire world will have been “hyperbitcoinized.”  In the future, El Salvador’s bitcoin moment will be seen as a reality check.  Regular people don’t like to use volatile things like bitcoin to make payments. Folks who already own bitcoin prefer to keep holding it in hopes that it makes them rich. Folks who don’t own bitcoin probably don’t want to accept it as payment because they see it as dangerous.  In short, bitcoins stall out as generally accepted payments media.  Which means that all of the resources El Salvador has spent building a bitcoin-based payments infrastructure will have been wasted. Other countries on the verge of adopting bitcoin are watching El Salvador’s monetary experiment. When they see that it isn’t working out, they will put their own plans on ice.  That being said, it will remain stylish for nations to “adopt” bitcoin. But only ceremoniously, as a marketing trick. All-out bitcoinization attempts like El Salvador’s won’t spread.  3. Cash will fade away. So will CBDCs.  In the Bitcoin Age, central bankers have gotten jealous. “We can do cool money stuff, too!” And so they’ve trotted out the idea of central bank digital currency, or CBDC.  A few major Western central banks will try CBDC, but they’ll find citizens don’t have an appetite for a KYC’ed electronic version of the dollar or euro – their existing bank or fintech fill most of their needs, thank you very much. Seeing how tepid the demand is for CBDC, other central banks watching from the sidelines will retire their CBDC aspirations.  With their dreams of CBDC dashed, central banks’ lone connection to regular people will be old-fashioned banknotes. But usage of physical banknotes in commerce will continue to decline, too, with ATMs getting as rare as phone booths. By the late 2020s, what was once a standard service offered by all bank branches – cashing out a bank balance into paper money – will be a fairly exotic transaction. If millennials don’t know how to write a check in 2011, Generation X won’t know how to use cash in 2031.  Central banks fear this moment. They’ve always liked being at the front and center of the payments system.  But they have nothing to worry about. We rarely think about the sewer system. We don’t interact directly with water mains or care how treatment plants work. But ultimately our entire lives depend on these unsexy bits of infrastructure.  The same will happen with central banks. With cash and CBDC dead, we’ll never directly interact with central banks. But unbeknownst to us, every single financial tool relies on core central bank settlement. And that’s fine.  4. If governments don’t force KYC across the entire internet, MasterCard and Visa will.  In the future, most bits of online content will be vetted and linked back to a verified creator. The card networks will be a big driver of this.  Many failed to notice that in October 2021, Mastercard brought in a new rule. It required all sites that host user-generated porn to adopt identity verification rules. They must also vet all content for illegal material. The penalty for noncompliance is to be dropped from the Mastercard network. Since losing card access means commercial death, most sites have fallen into line.  In the future, card networks will migrate their porn rules over to all sites that host user-generated material. YouTube, Rumble, Twitter, Facebook, not to mention countless smaller sites will be required to verify the identities of their users and set up real-time content moderation, or be cut off from the card networks.  Card networks don’t necessarily want to be the internet’s censors. The problem is that processing payments for illegal online goods constitutes money laundering. To avoid a potential conviction, Visa and Mastercard have no choice but to keep their networks clean.  5. Along comes a universal stablecoin standard.  But the card networks’ domination of online commerce will eventually run into a solid competitor.  Over the next few years the stablecoin industry will experience multiple rounds of failure, growth and mergers, eventually leaving just a few big stablecoins.  Because it will be confusing for the public to deal with several different stablecoins, issuers will ally together to build an interoperable stablecoin standard. Each of them will accept the other’s stablecoin at a 1:1 ratio, effectively fusing them into a single universal stablecoin.  This alliance having been formed, stablecoins will leave the closed-loop speculative universe of DeFi and crypto exchanges and enter the real world to attack the card networks.  To break the Visa/Mastercard stranglehold, the stablecoin alliance will have to find ways to encourage consumer adoption. Their first big win will be to negotiate with Amazon to add a “stablecoins accepted here” payments option. Because stablecoins will be cheaper for Amazon to process than cards, the stablecoin alliance will be able to convince Amazon to offer a 1% on all stablecoin purchases.  Will a 1% stablecoin discount be enough to unseat the card networks? Who knows?, But at least it’ll offer some competition.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,JP Koning,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/03/universal-stablecoins-the-end-of-cash-and-cbdcs-5-predictions-for-the-future-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/989164f217c723de795e7def7af57ed0ae29fa3c-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin UTXO Age Shows Mid-Term Holders Sold Their Coins In November As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, mid-term holders seem to be behind the decline in BTC&apos;s price during the month of November. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the &apos;UTXO Age.&apos; UTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output; you can think of it as a Bitcoin mechanic that keeps track of coins on the chain. The UTXO age metric measures how long it has been since a coin on the BTC blockchain was last transacted.

42394351,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvc9Ip,1638555894,CBDCs for the People? Where the Current State of Digital Currency Research Leads,"While much attention focuses on the retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) ruminations of China, Europe and the United States, smaller jurisdictions are leading the way. For example, Uruguay, the Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Nigeria and Jamaica have each launched pilot CBDCs over the past three years.  The potential benefits of CBDCs are numerous – from automating certain tax payments to preserving a nation’s monetary sovereignty – if only theoretical at this stage. The idea is to revamp a crucial part of society, how money is issued and flows through an economy, and so, even small design choices can have substantial effects.  So central banks are proceeding carefully, but given the amount of intellectual effort being expended, it’s likely CBDCs will have a place in the global financial system.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Overview of the CBDC landscape  According to our CBDC Tracker, at least 64 central banks are exploring a retail CBDC, of which 20 have been launched or tested or are in the very advanced exploration stages. We say “at least” because our count is based on reliable public sources (almost all from the central banks themselves). However, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), 58 of the 65 central banks surveyed at the end of 2020 were exploring retail CBDC. In any case, the growth in the number of retail CBDC explorers has been remarkable.  It is important to be clear about what is and is not a retail CBDC. The BIS defines a retail CBDC as a broadly available general purpose digital payment instrument that is denominated in the jurisdiction’s unit of account and that is a direct liability of the jurisdiction’s monetary authority. There is also a “wholesale CBDC,” which is limited to a set of predefined user groups, typically financial institutions. That’s not what we’re talking about here. Also the “direct liability of the monetary authority” condition precludes the Marshall Islands SOV and Cambodia’s Project Bakong.  There are six jurisdictions that have either fully launched (Bahamas) or have started pilot programs (China, Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Jamaica, Nigeria and Uruguay). Another 14 are in the advanced stages of retail CBDC research, of which six have started or soon will start proofs of concept (Bhutan, Ghana, Japan, Korea, Sweden and Ukraine). Proofs of concept differ from pilot programs in that proofs of concepts take place in a laboratory setting (e.g., among central bank staff) and pilot programs involve “real world” testing, typically among limited populations.  The vast majority of central banks studied are in an exploratory stage, typically consisting of desk research and perhaps some reaching out to technology platform providers. Some in this group may actually belong in the “advanced” group, but we have no direct evidence of that based on central bank communication.  Motivations  For emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) countries, some of the main motivations for launching or testing a retail CBDC are financial inclusion and payment system efficiency, including reducing the costs/risks of managing physical cash and higher payment system resilience/safety. Fighting illicit activities is another key theme. Protecting monetary sovereignty, whether it be pushing back on dollarization or the encroachment of private digital currencies such as the Facebook-initiated diem project, is a common theme among both EMDE and advanced economy (AE) central banks.  For China and some other advanced economy central banks that haven’t yet started pilot programs, reducing the monopoly powers of private payment systems (e.g., AliPay and WeChat Pay in China) is one reason to explore a retail CBDC.  Design choices  Retail CBDC design choices depend on policy objectives and country specifics, but among those retail CBDCs that have launched, there is much in common.  Business models  In a single-tier model, the central bank performs all the tasks involved, from issuing and distributing the CBDC to running user wallets. In multitier models, the central bank issues and redeems the CBDC, but distribution and the operation of payment services are delegated to private-sector payment service providers (PSPs). Which model to adopt will depend on country specifics, such as the breadth and depth of the country’s financial sector, financial integrity standards, compliance, the availability of financial market infrastructure and supervision capacity.  All retail CBDCs that have been launched or tested run on multitiered business models of the “intermediated” variety, as described in a recent BIS paper. In this variation, PSPs back the CBDC they distribute in wholesale accounts at the central bank, which has no direct record of individual CBDC holder balances. The central bank, however, maintains a backup copy of individual balances it would use to restart payments should a PSP fail. Presumably, the PSP’s CBDC wholesale account is legally ring-fenced from the PSP’s other operations and immediately available to the central bank in such an event. So far, no central banks have opted for a “hybrid” model, where the PSPs are merely agents on behalf of the central bank.  Holding/transaction limits  Central banks face a CBDC design trade-off between satisfying user preferences for privacy and giving authorities access to user identities and transaction data to mitigate the risk of illicit financial activity. Privacy preferences may be driven by fear of spamming and identity theft, and of being stalked or robbed. Also, a fully transparent CBDC might raise concerns about digital surveillance, especially in jurisdictions where trust in public institutions is low. Such a CBDC might also exclude those who lack an ID. Most central banks, however, are effectively obligated to meet the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing (AML/CFT) standards.  Almost all central banks that have launched retail CBDC have taken similar approaches to applying “proportionality” to their compliance with FATF AML/CFT standards by allowing for more privacy on low-value holdings/transactions.  For example, China’s eCNY users are identified only by their mobile phone SIM cards for the lowest tier of access (a holding limit of ¥10,000, and transactions are limited to ¥2,000 up to ¥5,000 per day). However, by providing full names, addresses and phone numbers, and by linking the CBDC wallet with their bank accounts, users see their limits increase substantially (¥500,000 holding, ¥50,000 per transaction and ¥100,000 per day). Jamaica is the exception, in that there are no limits on CBDC holdings or transactions, but all holders face full-blown know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. Also, central banks typically have access only to pseudonymous data, but in some cases can reveal data or a person’s identity if they can show probable cause to do so (e.g., with a court order).  Other design choices  In terms of the main design features of retail CBDCs that have been launched and tested, none of them pay interest, charge transaction fees or incorporate smart contracts capabilities. So far, only the People’s Bank of China seems to be experimenting with totally offline retail CBDC payments and programmability of payments. However, the Bahamas sand dollar can effectively be used by users when they are abroad through a Mastercard prepaid card, but receivers get their own national currency as payment, not sand dollars.  A diversity of technical platforms, both centralized and distributed ledger technology (DLT) based, have been deployed, although those adopting distributed ledger technology have opted for the private permissioned network variety, mainly based on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source blockchain framework hosted by the Linux Foundation. The Hyperledger Fabric technology allows for control over platform participants and their access to the platform, and role-based oversight and visibility of transactions. Private permissioned platforms also ensure that the central bank retains full control over money issuance and monetary policy. Again, Jamaica is unusual in that its retail CBDC doesn’t use centralized or decentralized ledger technology. Instead, it is a digital bearer instrument without a ledger.  What’s in the pipeline  Most of the 12 central banks that are known to be in the advanced stages of retail CBDC deliberations view retail CBDC as a contingency plan. For example, Bank of Canada officials have said that a digital loonie could be introduced if cash usage continues to decline or stablecoin usage accelerates, or both. The European Central Bank (ECB) has a similar view on a digital euro.  Although the U.S. Federal Reserve is conducting a major retail CBDC research program, Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed’s board of governors, has described a digital dollar as a “solution in search of a problem.” As CoinDesk columnist J.P. Koning points out, for several advanced economy countries, “everything that a CBDC is supposed to fix can already be achieved by another existing process or institution – and these alternatives are typically cheaper and less risky.”  And even if central banks in some advanced economies move in the direction of issuing a retail CBDC, the road will be long and ponderous. The Bank of England has said that if the results of its development work “conclude that the case for CBDC is made, and that it is operationally and technologically robust, then the earliest date for the launch of a U.K. CBDC would be in the second half of the decade.” The ECB has said that a digital euro could come in 2026 at the earliest.  Nevertheless, central banks in advanced economies are so transparent in their deliberations, compared with the stealthier central banks in emerging markets and developing countries, we know a lot about what might be coming down the retail CBDC pipeline.  Also part of Future of Money Week:  7 Wild Scenarios for the Future of Money - Jeff Wilser  The Downside of Programmable Money - Marc Hochstein  Ethereum in 2022: What Is Money in the Metaverse? -Edward Oosterbaan  The Future of Money: A History - Dan Jeffries  Remunerated retail CBDC  Some academic research advocates paying variable interest rates to CBDC holders to modulate demand or provide a new monetary policy instrument. For example, an interest-bearing retail CBDC could enhance the transmission of monetary policy by increasing the economy’s response to policy rate changes. Such a CBDC could be used to break the “zero lower bound” on policy rates to the extent that cash was made costly. Also, an ECB working paper has suggested a tiered remuneration system with relatively attractive interest rates on small holdings, and lower rates on large ones, to mitigate the risk that the CBDC disintermediates the private banking system.  Offline access  According to a 2020 Bank of Canada note, a resilient and inclusive retail CBDC should serve people without smartphones, support online and offline transactions, and be able to operate for long periods on a local power source. To meet these requirements, the bank is investigating the idea of a “universal access device” (UAD) that could take the form of a card or mobile wallet app on which prepaid values are stored locally. Rohan Grey adds that such devices could also be designed to maintain the same transactional freedoms and functions in the digital space as physical cash in the traditional economy. The concept isn’t completely new – several such devices were introduced in some advanced economies a few decades ago (e.g., Mondex and VisaCash), but they failed to develop much customer acceptance. However, a UAD could be of interest for emerging markets and developing economies where large segments of the population are excluded from the formal financial sector or don’t have internet access.  Smart contracts  A 2020 Bank of England paper discusses how smart contracts may enable the development of programmable payments to automatically execute terms of an agreement and initiate related transactions without human intervention. Potential applications here include paying sales taxes directly to tax authorities at point of sale and integration with physical devices or internet-of-things (IoT) applications. Embedded smart contracts could also be used to implement targeted aid payments that can be spent only on predefined goods and services. The People’s Bank of China, however, suggests that smart contracts could undermine the CBDC’s legal tender status, and, in the worst case, reduce the CBDC to a form of negotiable security that may affect its free usability.  What’s next?  We will likely see more central banks in emerging markets and developing economies than in advanced economies testing and launching CBDCs, with many of the emerging markets/developing economy CBDCs coming seemingly out of the blue from among the 44 central banks that we have labeled as being in the exploratory stage. That is because the benefits of introducing CBDCs are typically more obvious in an emerging market or developing economy, where the upside seemingly outweighs the risks. For example, increasing financial inclusion and decreasing cross-border payments costs are priorities in emerging markets and developing economies.  Central banks in richer countries, on the other hand, take a more cautious approach. They are mostly in the process of investigating the potential benefits of a CBDC and studying risks carefully. In particular, they assess risks to the financial sector in detail, as central banks place a high priority on preserving financial stability. They will likely continue their more transparent, but slower, efforts, and it’s no sure thing that many of the CDBCs will be put into circulation.  One exception is China. Here, a CBDC will likely be introduced in the first quarter of next year, right on time for the Winter Olympics in Beijing. From an economic perspective, the Chinese CBDC will provide essential insights for decision-makers in advanced economies who still aren’t sure whether to issue a CBDC.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,"John Kiff, Jonas Gross",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/03/cbdcs-for-the-people-where-the-current-state-of-digital-currency-research-leads,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e5e80445018e7491525b55ee83059607fc18c67-776x489.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394361,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDgf,1638553686,"Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht, Who Proved the Case for Bitcoin, Can Do So for NFTs","Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road online marketplace that hosted everything from children’s books to ketamine, is selling a non-fungible token (NFT) with the proceeds going to his legal fund and children of incarcerated parents.  Founded in 2011, Silk Road is often cited as the first true “use case” of bitcoin. It proved that fully decentralized digital money could be used reliably and without being censored. The marketplace became something of a media curiosity – drugs were being sold quite openly – and was shut down by the feds.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Ulbricht is now serving two consecutive life sentences, plus 40 years, without the option of parole. He’s risen to a near-mythic status within the crypto community for putting his life on the line to make the libertarian case that individuals should be able to decide who to interact with and what to buy – a similar aim of the Bitcoin network.  Now, his latest auction might demonstrate the same utility for NFTs. At heart, NFTs are a way to prove the uniqueness of particular digital items. They are mostly used for in-game items and art, but have applicability across the internet. Like with bitcoin, the idea is that anyone can use, own or trade these assets.  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving | The Node  A jaw-dropping amount of wealth has been generated in NFT markets, which is quickly forming its own identity apart from the general cryptocurrency economy. They have permeated into mainstream culture – with celebrities and corporations alike hawking their projects – as both a tool for freedom and something of a joke.  Charitable efforts, too, have caught on. On the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the New Yorker magazine issued an NFT series with proceeds going to victims. Given the harrowing cause, I look at that auction as a sea change; NFTs are serious, and they are likely here to stay. New York’s toniest magazine wouldn’t besmirch the legacy of survivors with a fad.  Ulbricht’s series has similar potential by showing that this is a powerful tool even for causes you may personally object to. That’s important. For whatever else crypto may be now or may become, it’s vital to have a digital form of money you can use like cash. (Visa and Mastercard have made online shopping a breeze, but they are the ultimate gatekeepers of what you can buy.)  Auction of the Ross Ulbricht Genesis Collection, which compiles original artwork, political statements, poetry and animations produced by digital artist Levitate into a single token, began yesterday at an Art Basel event in Miami and will run until Dec. 8. The token lives on the Ethereum network, and the art can be viewed and purchased on the curated NFT marketplace SuperRare.  Ulbricht is no doubt a complicated and controversial figure. He was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. There’s a strong case that the criminal justice system has failed him – laying out an unconscionable sentence in a misguided attempt to make an example out of him – and thousands of other people. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the average sentence for a drug trafficker is 77 months. He’s not a hero, but he deserves justice.  At this point, his mother Lynn Ulbricht, and his defense organization have basically run out of legal options. In his own words, “Decades of incarceration stretch out in front of me.” He found God, found purpose and is now an advocate for the countless others done wrong by the U.S. penal system.  See also: No Visits, No Parole: Ross Ulbricht Is More Alone Than Ever During COVID-19  “As I face that future, my eventual old age and death in this cage, I find myself looking for meaning and purpose. Why am I here? What good can I do with the time I have left and from where I am? I hope that helping my fellow prisoners through my art is one way,” he wrote in a Medium post announcing the NFT launch.  The series has already drawn a tremendous amount of attention and support, though some uppity bitcoin-only crypto investors – once his most vocal and generous supporters – have criticized the project. It doesn’t matter what they think. Their worldview is already irrelevant, if they cannot see how closely most of crypto advances their cause toward credibly neutral platforms.  Current bidding stands above 250 ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, worth about $1.1 million. That money may not free Ross, but it could go to good use. Money should be free, and (most) people, too.

While some countries have implemented favorable laws for bitcoin, others have gone the route of trying to stop the digital asset. The United States skews towards the latter.

42394372,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcEQp,1638550784,The Big Miss in the Biden Administration’s Stablecoin Report,"With due respect to Jamie Lee Curtis, Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, the best piece of cinema ever made about financial markets is not “Trading Places” but “The Big Short.” It opens with a quote about the limits of knowledge: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.”  Whether you agree with that explanation for the financial crisis, there is a double irony in that opening quote. The movie attributes it to Mark Twain, without evidence. Instead, the quote, or something close to it, first appeared in a book about the history of Persia published in England in 1747, and was later bowdlerized by a different and less famous mid-19th century humorist, Josh Billings.  Tom Brown is a partner at Nyca Partners. This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  The unintentional irony of starting a movie about the limits of knowledge with a misattributed quote about the limits of knowledge has been on my mind of late as I watch the fight about stablecoins play out. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the President’s Working Group’s recent stable commentary echoes the response to the financial crisis.  Bank regulators are, rightfully, obsessed with a repeat of the 2008 meltdown. The prevailing view among bank regulators and the more progressive lawmakers about the cause of the financial crisis is twofold: (1) financial innovation made something that should be easy to understand, a 30-year mortgage, too complicated for consumers to understand; and (2) bank regulators failed to protect consumers from taking out loans they had no ability to repay, which let risks build up to the point that they nearly swamped the global financial system.  Viewed from that perspective, the sudden interest by the Federal Reserve and the Biden administration in stablecoins makes sense. For years, consumer interest in cryptocurrency was safely ignored, until a bridge between the crypto economy and the banking system appeared.  Stablecoins are that bridge, and they create two types of risk for the banking system. First, stablecoin reserves are often held in the form of bank deposits. Second, when they are not held by banks, those reserves are often held in the types of securities that banks and other systemically important financial institutions also hold – i.e., Treasury bonds and short-term corporate paper. Stablecoins, thus, create a risk that a sudden drop in the value of crypto assets could affect the real banking system.  The obvious solution to the problem posed by stablecoins is to eliminate intermediaries: Rather than create an instrument that is a digital proxy for a dollar, just create a digital dollar. Unfortunately, the response proposed by the President’s Work Group to these potential risks doesn’t make as much sense. They recommend Congress pass a law giving banks a monopoly on stablecoin issuance.  Banks in the United States have had a monopoly on enabling firms and households to use money to pay their bills or make investments – what’s sometimes called the “convenience premium.” Technology has been whittling away at that premium for decades. Crypto is an example, but hardly the only one. PayPal, Square Cash and other peer-to-peer (P2P) money movement systems allow people to make and receive payments without having those funds touch a bank account.  As Matt Harris pointed out in a recent piece for Forbes, the technologies perfected by these companies is very quickly enabling firms and households deploy capital instantly and cheaply around the world. This makes it difficult for bank regulators to ensure that firms and households keep their wealth at banks.

But, like Matt, I believe that in between those payments, assets will move across a range of investment opportunities.  Some of those opportunities are likely to be denominated in dollars, but others won’t. Rather than trying to use the law to force the toothpaste back into the tube, bank regulators in the United States should be preparing themselves and their regulated institutions for a world where firms and households can choose to earn to 0% on their capital in exchange for being able to pay their bills or pursue risk-free returns elsewhere.

42394363,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvcDqv,1638550370,Capitalism Misallocates Resources. Web 3 Tech Can Help,"Look at a map of Africa. It’s no miracle that so many of the borders are straight lines, and it’s no coincidence that these random straight lines have caused untold political complexities. In that way, African nations are like money: a fiction imposed on the entire globe by a few decision-makers.  In short, money is a collective fiction, a cultural technology used for the reallocation of resources, a way to draw borders around everything. This is a relatively new concept in human history – (capitalism is only a few hundred years old) – but it’s already an outdated paradigm. And at this point, despite the gifts it’s given humanity, it causes more harm than good.  Eventually money will be replaced by something else. That sounds controversial, but it’s a simple truth that everything humans invent is replaced by the next invention. The only question is how quickly humanity can transition to better solutions, or perhaps, if we can transition fast enough to avoid unspeakable disaster.  The cryptocurrency industry is exploring what that might be. However, by and large, the addictive quality of money has drugged the most intelligent people in the industry into believing they are making revolutionary changes when, in fact, they are barely scratching at the surface of what is possible.  Grace Rachmany is a DAO consultant with DAOleadership. This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.  Road to nowhere  So far, the cryptocurrency industry has primarily accelerated and exaggerated the worst aspects of money: volatility, centralization of capital in the hands of the few, imbalance of financial versus productive capital and waste of electricity.  In some ways, crypto is better than fiat money: It’s not debt-based and it’s not intrinsically tied to governmental power. But after more than a decade, it’s fair to say that blockchain has made no more than a tiny nick in addressing the problems of inequality or accountability. It’s a good first try, but not much more.  Euphemistic definitions of what money is litter the first stretch on the road to nowhere. Contrary to traditional economic thought, money is not a store of value or a transfer of value. The money stored in billionaires’ accounts will never be released into the economy, so it’s not really storing anything except status. Paying someone below-sustenance wages to do work they hate is not transferring value, at least not the values most people hold.  Before re-engineering money, let’s cut the euphemisms and identify the primary function of money:  Money reallocates resources  We use money to coordinate large-scale activities and secure basic needs. We also use it as a proxy for recognition, appreciation, trust, relationship, societal support and a few other things. For the purposes of engineering a replacement for money, let’s focus on reallocation of resources.  When you think of money as a tool for redistributing resources, it often appears ineffective and convoluted. Take the backlighting of your keyboard: All of the components in the backlight of the keyboard and the electricity drawn upon – that’s all reallocated capital. When you think of all the reallocated resources due to all the keyboard backlighting in the world, it’s hard to justify.  When it comes to reallocating resources, in a world where there’s no shortage of basic nutrition or education, no shortage of clothing, no shortage of consumer goods and no shortage of people to care for one another, money is doing an unsatisfactory job of reallocating resources. In a world where there is a shortage of clean air, clean water and ecosystems to support life, money is doing a disastrous job of reallocating resources.  It could be different  When money was invented, it was impossible to accurately measure everything that went into making a product and even more impossible to display that information to everyone who ever came in contact with that product. Now it is technologically possible to record, track and report much more information than our computers can process.  Certainly we could do better than a monetary system in terms of recording how we reallocate resources (or exchange and transfer value, if you insist).  The ability to create new forms of “money” is just the starting point for the blockchain industry. Money is measuring something, but it’s hard to define just what that “something” is, which is why people use “value” as a euphemism.  The big question is: What should we be measuring? Below I give one example of what we could be measuring as a starting point for thinking about how the replacement for money could more accurately represent value. The example would be useful if the purpose of the economy were to optimally redistribute the resource commonly known as “food.”  Reallocation of food  Money allows us to measure the funds spent on poverty reduction, income per person or family, amount spent on food, cost of feeding a family and monetary value of food wasted. None of that is really a measure of hunger.  New “currencies” might track:  How many people went without a meal each day, based on region, town and neighborhood.  Distance food traveled. Distance could be a proxy for ecological impact, nutritional value and support for local producers.  Amount of food wasted in any given region.  Amount and location of food nearing its expiration date.  Crops that will go unused/unharvested for any reason (market forces, weather, shortage of labor).  Empty space in people’s cars traveling the route from the food about to expire to where people went without a meal yesterday.  Communities and nations could optimize these types of measures to reduce hunger. Imagine if it were simple to find out if there was a family on your route to or from work who regularly was short of food and that your office cafeteria usually had leftover food on Tuesdays. Imagine if your town were competing with other towns in the region to eliminate empty plates and reduce wasted foods.  Imagine if a country where everyone already had food was working to reduce the distance between people and their food supply. The impacts would be profound on nutritional value preserved, the environment and the relationship between people and the soil.  Indicating wealth  The example of food is dramatically simplified, but it’s something everyone could understand and any society could measure. Daniel Schmachtenberger, in his recent appearance on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, mentioned low addiction rates as a general indicator of the satisfaction and happiness of the population. Neither addiction nor food-on-plate is a perfect indicator, but both are much better indicators of the health of a society than gross domestic product (GDP). Likewise, they are easy to understand and measure. Finally, they are better than GDP as indicators of appropriate corrective actions.  A Web 3 wrap  We are at a moment in history when many people don’t trust governments with managing these types of complexity. Fortunately, if you are reading this, you’re someone in the world of Web 3. It’s fairly easy to see how a combination of distributed ledger technology, self-sovereign identity, zero knowledge proofs and supply chain transparency could be combined to create a suite of measures that are simple yet indicative of the outcomes that people truly want in their economies.  While it’s not obvious how society outgrows money, it is obvious that we need to re-calibrate our value-measurement and resource-reallocation systems. Blockchain offers us the opportunity. Will we take advantage of it?

A community vote among stakeholders in Aave Arc, a KYC-compliant and institutional-grade version of the DeFi lending platform, will take place over the weekend (a similar process to when Fireblocks sought to become a whitelisted custodian).

He also made clear Securtize’s work to make DeFi palatable to institutions will be completely open-source and strive towards interoperability between other platforms and blockchains.  “We can share an attestation on the blockchain that is completely anonymous, saying this wallet is OK for your protocol, according to the protocol rules,” Domingo said. “It’s a decentralized way of sharing identity information but done in a privacy-preserving manner.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/03/aaves-push-for-institutional-defi-gets-second-kyc-provider-proposal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eb851f3ea0190bff2b27e0d9ee83737c99adb75a-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Our idea of digital assets and their ownership has experienced (and is still experiencing) rapid evolution. Very few people would have boldly predicted a public tweet selling for $2.5 million or a there-for-all-to-see clip of Lebron James dunking selling for $200,000.

Several other digital assets have been sold as NFTs in a very short time. Every passing day suggests that the NFT train or &apos;NFT craze&apos; will not disappear anytime soon. So, if you&apos;re still thinking about joining the NFT movement, stop thinking and start acting.

Avoid Getting Rug-pulled With These Tips,"Cryptocurrency has captured the world&apos;s attention after the pandemic, and notorious scammers have taken notice too. With the rising popularity of altcoins and meme tokens, there will be an upsurge of new crypto scams taking place on Telegram. What is a Scam? Scam, rug pull, you name it. They&apos;re everywhere: Telegram chats, groups, fake communities. But what exactly is a rug pull? The next level. They happen when developers create a token paired with a valuable cryptocurrency, list the token on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and then pull out all the funds. In simple words, a crypto rug pull occurs when the developers abandon a project after cashing out investors&apos; capital. Consider the recent &apos;Squid Game&apos; scam where the developers created a &apos;Play-to-earn&apos; SQUID token, drew in buyers, inflated the prices and made off with $3.38 million, according to Gizmodo. How to spot a Rug Pull? Though seasoned scammers create the Rug pulls, it is easy to spot them if the investor pays close attention to the following signs. Low Liquidity Low liquidity means it is difficult to convert the tokens to cash as the developer had limited funds to create the token. It is easier for the developer to manipulate the token&apos;s price when the liquidity is lower. The best way to check liquidity is by looking at 24hr trading volume, which should be at least 20% to 40% of the coin&apos;s total market cap.

The proposed tax would have levied a 20% tax on crypto gains made in a one-year period over KRW 2.5 million (US$2,122), starting Jan. 1, 2022.  Lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties are trying to appeal to voters in their 20s and 30s, who are more likely to be cryptocurrency investors and therefore against the proposed tax, ahead of the presidential election in March, local analysts have said.  It is common to see resistance from industry and investors over tax plans, Harold Kim, director of the Korea Blockchain Association (KBA), told CoinDesk. But it is “not common” to see lawmakers and financial authorities in dispute over proposed taxes, and to eventually have the plan postponed.  Many crypto investors, and the KBA director, have compared the planned tax for cryptocurrency gains to the proposed levies on stocks, and conclude that they were being treated unfairly.  Stocks investors would only pay taxes for gains over KRW 50 million (US$42,450), whereas crypto investors would have to start paying when they reach $2,122 in capital gains, Kim said. In addition, investors could carry over stock losses for five years but could not carry over crypto losses at all. On top of that, the virtual assets tax was set to come into effect a year ahead of the stock gains tax, according to the KBA director.  Read more: S.

Another hack came to life this week, and early reports have stated that the hack was a front-end compromise that led to users being tricked into approving unwanted transactions. The news comes after a $35M DeFi hack of the Vee Finance protocol in recent months, and our team at NewsBTC reported around mid-year that crypto hacks and fraud were on pace for a record year. This week&apos;s BadgerDAO compromise is one of DeFi&apos;s biggest yet. BadgerDAO Hack: What We Know The protocol cited &apos;reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds&apos; on late Wednesday, and proceeded to pause all smart contracts on the protocol: Badger has received reports of unauthorized withdrawals of user funds. As Badger engineers investigate this, all smart contracts have been paused to prevent further withdrawals.
