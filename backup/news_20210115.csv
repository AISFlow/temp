The halt, which goes into effect Jan. 30 at 1 a.m. UTC, only affects Kraken clients residing in the U.S. Those residing elsewhere will be unaffected.  With the halt, Kraken becomes the latest exchange to suspend or end trading in XRP, the cryptocurrency at the heart of a SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs claiming the token is really a security.  Kraken had been a holdout.  The move follows Grayscale Investments' dissolution of its XRP Trust earlier this week. Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.

The startup announced Friday that OVM is now live, at a time when gas fees have reached near all-time highs for decentralized finance (DeFi) traders. Indeed, the cost to send a single Ethereum transaction has hovered in the low single-digit dollars for the last month – a bit steep for the “internet of money.”      First on the docket is DeFi exchange Synthetix, which has been working on an integration for some weeks now. The platform allows traders to exchange Ethereum-based synthetic contracts of real-world assets including oil futures.      The transition will roll out in four phases to limit risk to the platform, Synthetix co-founder Kain Warwick wrote in a Jan. 14 blog post. Staking the platform’s native token, SNX, is now possible on OVM, the team said.      “We have opted for initiating the transition with the absolute minimum risk to [layer one], and then adding functionality over the course of the next few months as we build confidence in [Optimistic Ethereum],” Warwick wrote.

(These are not dissimilar in a general sense from Bitcoin’s Lightning Network.)      A rollup allows a blockchain to settle more transactions across the whole network by sending transactions off-chain, validating them and then settling the lump value on the main Ethereum blockchain. Most dapps have a rollup solution on the agenda.

42405720,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedzpL,1610747536,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Dips to $34.4K as Big-Name DeFi Tokens Trounce ETH,"Bitcoin was slipping Friday on lower-than-average volumes for 2021 so far. In other news, while BTC and ETH are up this year, some DeFi tokens are doing even better.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $35,610 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 9.4% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $34,425-$39,673 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC below the 10-hour and 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin fell Friday, a steady decline over the past 24 hours that saw the world’s oldest cryptocurrency bottom out as low as $34,425 before picking up to $35,610 as of press time.      Read More: Biden’s $1.9T Relief Package Proposal Fails to Stir Bitcoin Market      “The price rested at $40,000. Now we are waiting for a rollback to $34,000,” said Constantin Kogan, partner at crypto investment firm Wave Financial. “Most likely the next possible low will be at least $26,000.”      That’s a pretty bearish sentiment from an analyst, but the outsized volume numbers to open 2021 are certainly diminishing for the time being. For the first two weeks of the new year, bitcoin’s daily spot volume on the eight major exchanges tracked by CoinDesk (Bitfinex, Bitflyer, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex) averaged $6.1 billion per day. For Friday, spot volumes are at $4.2 billion, as of press time.      ""There is a definite tug and pull between North American and Asian traders in crypto assets,” noted Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer USA. “Since the U.S. is going into a three-day weekend the U.S. trading volume will be lighter, so Asia will likely set the tone.”      Many investors and traders will be off Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day including the U.S. equities markets, which along with other major indexes are ending the week in the red Friday.    Asia’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.62% in a session that was capped by the tech sector as semiconductor manufacturer TSMC posted its best-ever quarterly profit.  In Europe the FTSE 100 ended the day slipping 1% as new lockdown measures and a rise in coronavirus cases in China left investors worried about the global economy.  In the United States, the S&P 500 closed in the red 0.74% as President-elect Biden released a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to help boost the coronavirus-afflicted global economy.    “The important thing to keep in mind is that the macro view has not changed,” said Bitflyer’s Edgerton. “There is growing demand for crypto assets, an unwillingness of current holders to sell and limited supply being added. This naturally leads to long-term price appreciation.""      Read More: Advisers Allocating Crypto in Clients’ Portfolios Rose 49% Last Year: Survey      Andrew Tu, an executive of quant trading firm Efficient Frontier, pointed to the inverse relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and bitcoin as a macro example. The index, also known as the DXY, is a measure of the greenback versus a basket of other fiat currencies.      “The rise in DXY was simultaneously accompanied by a drop in BTC,” Tu told CoinDesk. “On a fundamental level, the economy looks weak, thus probably driving a risk-off move into dollars.”      When bitcoin goes up, the DXY seems to go down and vice versa, at least so far in 2021. On Friday, the DXY was up 0.55% during bitcoin’s bearish past 24 hours.    Big-name DeFi tokens doing better than ether in 2021    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Friday, trading around $1,139 and slipping 5.7% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: MahaDAO’s Algorithmic ‘Valuecoin’ Goes Live on Ethereum      Bitcoin’s is up over 20% in 2021. However, ether is easily beating that, in the green over 50% to start the year. Meanwhile, two well-known projects built on the Ethereum platform used for decentralized finance (DeFi) are doing even better than that. The token associated with derivatives liquidity platform Synthetix is up more than 83% so far this year, while lending protocol Aave's token has climbed more than 69% in 2021 so far.      Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital, told CoinDesk DeFi tokens such as aave and synthetix have big upside potential in bullish markets. He recently tweeted about DeFi token performance over the last three months. However, Bonnefous cautioned that there’s also a downside to these lesser-known and less-liquid tokens.      “Ether is the mothership, the main reserve currency layer for DeFi, whereas the DeFi coins are more application-related with a potential additional monetization component and some growth potential if well executed,” Bonnefous said. “So by nature the top DeFi assets will likely outperform in a up market for crypto in general, and conversely in a bear market.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, mostly in the red Friday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    cosmos (ATOM) + 21.7%  chainlink (LINK) + 15.2%  omg network (OMG) + 6.8%    Notable losers:    bitcoin cash (BCH) - 8.9%  litecoin (LTC) - 8%  stellar (XLM) - 7%    Commodities:    Oil was down 2.9%.

When asked about timing, the Goldman source said the bank’s custody plans would be “evident soon.”      Goldman’s digital asset custody RFI was circulated to at least one well-known crypto custody player toward the end of 2020.      “Like JPMorgan, we have issued an RFI looking at digital custody. We are broadly exploring digital custody and deciding what the next step is,” said the Goldman source, who asked not to be named. (An RFI on crypto custody was issued by JPMorgan in October 2020, as reported by The Block.)      The Goldman insider said the bank’s digital assets initiative was “part of a broad digital strategy,” citing stablecoins in relation to recent missives from the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).      A tectonic shift took place in the world of crypto custody this week, as San Francisco-based Anchorage attained conditional approval from the OCC to become a national digital bank and “unequivocally” meet the definition of “qualified custodian” in the process.      Anchorage President Diogo Mónica said in an interview this regulatory approval will invite many large and risk-averse institutional players into crypto.      When asked about JPMorgan, Goldman and Citi – the three big U.S. banks most are watching in relation to crypto custody – Mónica said: “We are talking to all these guys.”      There has been chatter about Goldman perhaps offering something akin to prime brokerage services involving crypto. However, the Goldman insider said the bank is looking at custody but not prime brokerage.      “Anchorage, BitGo and Coinbase have quite grand plans in crypto prime brokerage and we would not be looking to duplicate those,” said the Goldman source.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/15/goldman-sachs-to-enter-crypto-market-soon-with-custody-play-source,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Now, under terms of the settlement, the company is barred from giving its investors those tokens and must notify them of the fact.  SEC prosecutors said in their filing that Wireline's SAFT was an investment contract and thus subject to agency oversight.

42405713,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedzgU,1610740681,Fixing Crypto's Silos,"It’s an established truth the cryptocurrency sector is more fragmented than shattered glass. Industry devotees have long made the most of working piecemeal, accepting ever-increasing fragmentation as the price of a decentralized financial system. But what advancements might we achieve if we could stop paying it?      At first glance, interoperability seems like a near-impossible goal. According to CoinMarketCap, over 8,000 unique cryptocurrencies currently exist – a400% increase from two years ago. These numbers sound impressive at first, however, the veneer wears off once you consider the sheer inconvenience that variety poses.    Stephen Tse, is founder and CEO of Harmony.one. He was previously a researcher at Microsoft Research, a senior infrastructure engineer at Google and a principal engineer for search ranking at Apple.    Decentralized applications (dapps) are limited by the constraints of their home blockchain. If a dapp is built on Ethereum, it can usually only enjoy the benefits provided by Ethereum (ex., smart contract functionality). Thus, for all of the advantages that diverse cryptocurrencies might present individually, users may struggle to take full advantage of the multiplicity because the blockchains are not interoperable.      Here’s the issue – while career cryptocurrency traders may be willing to manually “hunt and peck” across fragmented cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain apps for the features and services they want, it seems overly optimistic to think that the rising cohort of investors will be content with the status quo. Consider the push towards cryptocurrency normalization we saw in 2020. Three major fintech firms (Square, MicroStrategy and Mode) embraced bitcoin, and PayPal recently launched its own cryptocurrency trading service.      As a result, the people we see entering the crypto market aren’t technology professors or developers, they’re ordinary consumers and investors who are accustomed to more streamlined and cohesive experiences.      “As new users enter the industry, I've seen a clear demand for ‘intermediaries’ that mirror the centralized financial entities consumers are used to, improved user experience, and greater liquidity, but I've also seen the control and holding of users funds: sacrificing ownership for access,” cryptocurrency expert Alexey Koloskov recently wrote for Forbes.      If the crypto sector’s fragmentation remains unaddressed by those within it, Koloskov suggests, there is a risk that conventionally minded players will offer solutions that undermine the freedoms cryptocurrencies were invented to provide.    Consumers are right to ask for interoperability. They need innovation, they need new interoperability tools.    The intervention of centralized powers is frustrating, both for its tacit erosion of trader freedom and because consumers are right to ask for interoperability. They need innovation, they need new interoperability tools – and if innovators who appreciate the philosophy that underpins blockchain can provide it, they stand to not only solve a major UX problem, but also redefine the capabilities of fintech as a whole.      Consider the work that has already been done with trustless bridges as an example.      For context, a trustless blockchain bridge is essentially a public blockchain network that allows two technologically different and economically sovereign chains to freely communicate with each other sans permissions. This connection allows for interoperability between two blockchains that would otherwise have no means to conduct mutual transactions or utilize the other’s chain-specific apps.      Trustless, two-way bridges could provide game-changing fluidity across previously siloed chains, allowing newcomers and blockchain devotees alike unprecedented access and ease-of-use. Assuming future advancement, we can imagine a future version of the cryptocurrency sector, one that upholds interoperability without compromising its commitment to decentralization and individual autonomy.      Beyond enabling smoother transactions and a more cohesive and informed trading experience, such bridges facilitate greater usability. By linking two disparate cryptocurrencies by cross-chain bridges, users can enjoy the best of both, rather than having to pick one over the other. When using a cross-chain bridge between Ethereum and Cosmos, for example, a user could leverage Ethereum’s smart contract functionality and Cosmos’ scalability.      Imagine that versatility multiplied out over a dozen blockchains. Imagine the functionality we could achieve if end-users and app developers could ultimately cherry-pick the features they wanted in their trading experience.      We may not be to the point where such fluidity is possible yet, but there’s little doubt that such a reality waits on the horizon. Innovations like cross-chain bridges offer a glimpse of what the future of fintech and crypto could look like – what it might mean to introduce a truly decentralized financial system where consumers finally, truly, have the final say not only on trades, but on their trading experience.      See also: How One Firm Is Addressing the Interoperability Problem Posed by FATF’s ‘Travel Rule’      The blockchain fragmentation problem is significant and, in the absence of proper consolidation tools, expanding. The cryptocurrency sector needs to provide solutions that facilitate blockchain connections among all people and any economy.      Our fragmented and siloed status quo will not work indefinitely. We have the technological means – and the market impetus – to seek interoperability without compromising on decentralization or consumer experience. By literally bridging the silos, we won’t just improve user experience, we’ll usher in a new era of financial innovation and creativity.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Tse,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/01/15/fixing-cryptos-silos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3963be3744e8512aca8b2108a029b19a36216ab6-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405711,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedzeW,1610736305,Why Celsius Thinks CEL Won't Receive the Same SEC Treatment as XRP,"The CEO of cryptocurrency lender Celsius believes CEL won’t meet XRP’s fate.      In a Dec. 31 interview, Alex Mashinsky attributed a recent spike in CEL’s price to the token being registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Mashinsky said this would protect CEL – the native token of the Celsius lending platform – from being embroiled in an SEC lawsuit, like the one the securities regulator has filed against Ripple because of its XRP token.      The CEL token, however, isn’t actually registered with the SEC; Celsius filed a Form D, which was an exemption from having to register a securities sale with the SEC and only available to accredited investors. This is separate from other SEC registrations the crypto industry has completed, such as INX’s registration of securities it sold in its initial public offering and asset management firm Arca’s registration of its Ethereum-based fund.      “We did not determine that CEL token is a security,” Mashinsky said in an interview with CoinDesk TV last Friday. “What we said is that because we’re not sure what it is, and it’s not clear because the regulations are not clear, that we’re going to file it as if it were a security.”            CEL increased from a few cents to $6.50 on Jan. 3 and has since dropped to $4.97 as of press time.      “Mass adoption from over 300,000 users worldwide is the driver,” Mashinsky said of CEL’s price action. “Half of our community … wants to be paid interest in CEL token.”      If users choose to get rewards in CEL, they can get better interest rates on earning and borrowing in the app.      In May 2018, Celsius raised what was then $50 million worth of crypto in CEL’s initial coin offering (ICO). (Financial statements filed with the U.K. registrar Companies House in May 2020 show proceeds of only $25 million from the sale; Celsius told CoinDesk it had not converted the crypto to fiat in the same month that it was raised.)      Mashinsky also clarified that Celsius makes under-collateralized loans only to institutions.      “On the institutional side we have 350 customers,” Mashinsky said. “Based on credit ratings, we will require some of them to give us 200% collateral. … There are one or two institutions which have multibillion-dollar balance sheets that we require less than 100%, so they may give us 75%. If you take our book of $6 billion in assets, less than 1% of those are uncollateralized loans.”      Mashinsky also revealed Celsius is considering participating in crypto lender Cred’s bankruptcy auction, but said that Celsius has not yet made a decision about the company.      “Just like Mt. Gox, every event like this is a trust withdrawal from the crypto community,” Mashinsky said.",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP | TOKEN SALE,"Nate DiCamillo, Christine Lee",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/01/15/why-celsius-thinks-cel-wont-receive-the-same-sec-treatment-as-xrp,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b01b9b868e1a98367aa605c5417a75fe72bc420-1200x801.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to surge this year, many traders are looking for any indicator for when – or if – the bull market will come to an end. Some are convinced they have the answer: They are examining polkadot (DOT), the native token of the Polkadot blockchain, as a potential canary in the coal mine for cryptocurrency. CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen covers the market maneuver.    At stake    Tethered It’s been a while since we last covered Tether here, but a recent headline related to the bank where the stablecoin issuer parks its funds is as good a reason as any to check in. In a year-end video recording sent to its customers, and recently surfaced in the crypto media, Deltec Bank & Trust Chief Investment Officer Hugo Rogers said it was investing some client funds in bitcoin.      According to the video (which I haven’t personally seen), Rogers said the bank bought bitcoin before its latest run-up, at about $9,300. “[S]o that worked very well through 2020 and we expect it to continue working well in 2021 as the printing presses continue to run hot,” Rogers said in the video. The money machines go brrr.      Apart from the revelation that an investment officer at a Bahamian bank is a bitcoin bull, the quote did raise questions about Tether’s reserves. Tether (USDT) is a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. It’s issuer, Tether, a company that shares executives with the Bitfinex crypto exchange, is said to maintain the stablecoin’s one-to-one relationship with the greenback based on cash or cash equivalents held by Deltec.      Deltec has clarified that Roger’s statements “had no relation whatsoever to Tether's depositary assets with Deltec.” So Tether’s reserves are definitely not backed by bitcoin. Or at least not bitcoin that investment officers at Deltec had begun purchasing in Q4 2020.      So what is backing tether?      There are now more than $24 billion in tether in existence, approximately a fivefold increase from the beginning of 2020, when there were fewer than 5 billion tethers. In theory, there should be approximately $24 billion in tether reserves parked in the Bahamian bank.      While many vouch for the company and coin, Tether has yet to produce a full audit of its reserves. In 2019, Bitfinex and Tether told the New York courts tether is only backed 74% by cash and short-term securities rather than maintaining a complete peg, though months later they walked back that claim.      In short, no one outside of Tether can be entirely sure what's backing the popular stablecoin. Tether isn’t decentralized like other cryptocurrencies, nor does it have a hard cap to the amount that can be created.      Now the third-largest crypto by market cap, tether is likely the most trafficked crypto in terms of trade volume. It’s used not only as a legitimate means of payment (CoinDesk reported it’s frequently used to skirt sanctions in China and Russia), but also as a common trading pair and a place for investors to park their money during periods of market volatility.      “Tether's growth in 2020 has been spectacular. We are now starting to speak of the Tetherization of trading, with the lion's share of spot trading volume now denominated in tether (USDT) tokens,” Chief Technology Officer at Bitfinex and Tether Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk over email through a spokesperson in December. “As commercial activity rises, so does the use of tether,” he continued.      As Ardoino suggests, the amount of tether is based purely on demand for the preeminent stablecoin. The company mints tethers based on orders from exchanges, traders and others, though because of its limited know-your-customer rules it’s not always obvious who is calling to turn on the mint.      Some of these questions might soon be answered. As part of an ongoing lawsuit pursued by the New York Attorney General, Bitfinex and Tether face a Jan. 15 deadline to provide millions of pages of documents related to a loan Tether allegedly provided to Bitfinex to cover an $850 million hole.

42405721,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedzoM,1610732576,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin's Warning for Central Banks,"Another week, another lifetime lived:      The U.S. President impeached, again. Worldwide COVID-19 deaths close in on 2 million. Bitcoin surges to a record high above $42,000, promptly plunges to almost below $30,000 and then begins a late-week rally above $36,000.      Meanwhile, the crypto community has been grappling with some contentious regulatory proposals that would strengthen U.S. monitoring of global digital currency transactions.      That’s the topic of this week’s ""Money Reimagined"" podcast episode. We talk to Christopher Giancarlo, the former chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and Marvin Ammori, a famed digital civil rights lawyer who’s now chief legal counsel at Uniswap, about how the crypto industry and regulators can better collaborate on rules that enable constructive innovation.      Have a listen after reading this week’s newsletter.    Lagarde: 'It's a highly speculative asset'    What does it mean when the most powerful woman in finance scolds you?    Christine Lagarde: “For those who had assumed [bitcoin] might turn into a currency, terribly sorry, but it’s an asset. And it’s a highly speculative asset which has conducted some funny business and some interesting and totally reprehensible money laundering activity.”  Did the European Central Bank President just give bitcoin a time-out? Or is punishment still coming? During those remarks in an online Reuters event on Wednesday, Lagarde called for crypto regulation “at the global level.”  Bitcoin is a disruptive force that demands attention. So such comments aren’t necessarily bad. They suggest the stewards of the global monetary system now realize they can no longer ignore it as a mere curiosity of zero. A soaring price is putting bitcoin on central banks’ radars.  The question is whether high-level monetary authorities such as Lagarde truly understand why they should take it seriously. Do they get that it’s sending a message about the failures of their system, one that has made the owners of financial assets fabulously wealthy in a year that hundreds of millions have suffered unprecedented hardship?  Lagarde has actually been a well-informed supporter of crypto innovation, both as head of the International Monetary Fund and now at the ECB. (She’s spearheading the digital euro.)  So, why now trot out old, nuance-less critiques of bitcoin that, while arguably true, are mostly irrelevant?  A wide cross-section of bitcoiners welcome clear, internationally consistent regulation to dissuade bad guys and make crypto safe for good guys. But if your priority is attacking money laundering – rather than, say, boosting financial inclusion – then please first go after the trillions of dollars in “funny business” facilitated by mainstream finance’s bankers and lawyers.  Yes, bitcoin is “speculative” (though our chart below might suggest it has become less so.) And, yes, it’s “volatile, an “asset” and a poor unit of account/medium of exchange. But very few informed market participants expect anything more. They are betting on it to become “digital gold,” a future hedge against monetary dysfunction. Until a wide enough investor base believes in that, it will stay volatile and will be generally useless for buying groceries.  Lagarde has surely heard all that. So why the rant?  Perhaps, just as crypto people join forces when regulators come after their industry, she, too, is siding with her community: international financial policymakers. Much of what Lagarde said sounded like solidarity with the U.S. Treasury Department’s hardline proposal that crypto exchanges be required to track the identities of self-custodial wallets.  Or, as Bloomberg’s Brian Chappatta suggested this week, do central bankers like Lagarde see the soaring price of bitcoin, and perhaps also Tesla, as symptoms of a wider bubble in capital markets that will require a tighter monetary response?  Maybe. But let’s be clear: Bitcoin is still nowhere near big enough to encompass actual systemic risk.  Yes, its market capitalization, about $650 billion, has suddenly become higher than Facebook’s and is just shy of Tesla’s. But it’s nothing like, say, the $55 trillion credit default swap market of 2008, whose complex interconnections with bond markets meant that when defaults accelerated, they fueled that year’s global financial crisis. If bitcoin investors lose money, it won’t lead to meaningful knock-on effects in other markets.  So, instead, might it be that Lagarde and Co. are starting, just slightly, to get a hint that bitcoin’s price says something about public confidence?  If we view owning bitcoin as a short position against the financial system, then its surging price – alternatively, the plunging price of fiat – along with its increased attention from institutional investors, reflects waning faith in that system. Will financial authorities take the right message from it?  Short-sellers are often maligned. But one value they bring to society is that the price movements they generate are a signal that something needs fixing.  So, policymakers: Yes, you should regulate bitcoin. But even more urgently, fix the legacy financial system.  Speculative? It’s all relative    Last week, we brought you a chart showing how data from the Bitcoin blockchain described how the current bull market has been driven by large investors, unlike the “Mom and Pop” rally of December 2017. (The number showed a recent rise in the number of large addresses that hold more than 1,000 BTC, whereas that measure was falling three years ago.)      This week, we use exchange data to suggest another difference in investor type, this time between the new, incoming large investors – thought to be large, sophisticated institutions such as hedge funds – and the more established crypto-native players. While the latter are more sophisticated than the naive retail newbies of 2017, they tend to be individuals or crypto startups.      We looked at open interest in bitcoin derivatives on six of the biggest exchanges, which reflects the amount of money invested in options, futures and other such instruments that hasn’t been converted into the underlying asset, in this case bitcoin itself. Then we compared that to the volumes traded in the underlying spot market for bitcoin, creating a percentage that we treat as an admittedly imperfect proxy for how much leveraged speculation is going on.      Then we split these results between the four online crypto exchanges that are outside U.S. regulation and which allow for significantly higher leveraged bets – OKEx, Huobi, BitMex and Binance – and two long-established U.S.-regulated exchanges that follow the more traditional, low-leverage models on which they were founded: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Bakkt, which belongs to the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange. The idea is that the crypto natives typically play in the first and the institutions in the second.      From the chart that CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao pulled together, which uses a seven-day moving average for open interest, you’ll note that although speculative bets in the CME and Bakkt futures rose steadily over the spring and summer, it was nothing like the build-up that occurred in the crypto-native exchanges.      Then, after criminal charges were brought against the BitMex founders, a sharp pullback occurred. And although the crypto-native speculators came back for a bit, they haven’t sustained it, closing out their positions as bitcoin started to soar in December, presumably at a profit. Meanwhile, the institutions, the big money players who’ve been pouring cash into long positions in the spot market, have kept a comparatively steady hand.      As the price quadrupled in four months, the bitcoin market appears to have been driven by a moderately low level of derivatives-based speculation and leverage, at least compared to the summer. All things considered, that should mean less volatility. That seems hard to square with the past week’s rally-plunge-rebound. But it might explain why the early-week sell-off was so short-lived.    The conversation: Platform or publisher?    Perhaps the biggest immediate fallout from last week’s insurgence of Donald Trump’s supporters into the Capitol came from Twitter’s and Facebook’s moves to suspend the outgoing president’s accounts and those of some of those supporters in what some have dubbed Silicon Valley’s own impeachment process. Inevitably, they drew support from many who saw Trump as an instigator of violence but also sweeping criticism from others, who complained of these platforms’ unique power to curtail speech.      It’s a complicated debate, one that animates the call for decentralization within the crypto and blockchain community, where people are trying to build a new, censorship-resistant architecture for the internet and for digital money. Twitter and Facebook – and Amazon, which joined in by kicking right-wing-friendly social media site Parler of Amazon Web Services’ servers – are private companies. They aren’t subject to the government’s First Amendment free speech standards. Yet, because of their massive size and the dependency of their users, and because they have proprietary control over users’ data and an algorithmic capacity to curate what they view, these de facto public forums have a monopoly power that can shape society.      Ironically, some of the best discussion occurred on Twitter.    CEO Jack Dorsey published a thoughtful lament that his company, as a private entity, is forced to make these difficult decisions. He said he’d rather a less centralized internet, which is why he has a “passion for Bitcoin,” describing it as “a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity.”  Chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, whose experiences under the totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union have made him an articulate voice for freedom, emphasized the need to distinguish private power from state power.  But it was former presidential candidate and now New York mayoral wannabe Andrew Yang who nailed it. Moving beyond the contentious issue of Trump’s account, he focused on the broken state of the media economy, on how it rewards people for disseminating destructive disinformation. He skewers the business models of the big tech companies, calling them “essentially quasi-governments unto themselves,” where “their decisions are driven by maximizing ad revenue, user engagement and profit growth … not the set of incentives you want when deciding what millions regard as truth.”  Relevant Reads: A crypto-savvy SEC    Reports emerged this week that President-elect Joe Biden would nominate former Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler to head the Securities Exchange Commission. This news that someone with such deep knowledge of this industry (Gensler has taught courses on cryptocurrency and blockchain at MIT for several years) was widely welcomed by a crypto community, which has been whipsawed of late by big shifts in the regulatory environment. Our coverage reflected that.      (Disclosure: I worked with Gensler at MIT before joining CoinDesk, including co-authoring an economic paper with him and other colleagues from MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative. It’s true what they say: Gary gets it.)    CoinDesk initially picked up Reuters' scoop on the story. Kevin Reynolds’ account noted that Gensler had testified before Congress on cryptocurrencies and, in his course on cryptocurrencies and blockchains, had called the technology ""a catalyst for change in the world of finance and the broader economy.""  In his “The Breakdown” show on the CoinDesk podcast network, Nathaniel Whittemore optimistically described Gensler as “a partner we can work with” who “is going to try to get the space in line with the regulatory mainstream” but who “also appreciates what makes it different, where the opportunities lie.”  OpEd contributor Jeff Bandman, a former CFTC official, wrote that Gensler will start the job “shovel ready.” He predicted that his wariness of incumbents having too much power could create opportunities for crypto innovators and that the SEC would now finally move to approve a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Michael J.

42405719,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedznN,1610721344,First Mover: Biden's $1.9T Plan Shows 'Blue Wave' Bitcoiners Saw Coming,"(EDITOR'S NOTE: First Mover will not publish Monday, Jan. 18, in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the U.S., a CoinDesk company holiday. The cryptocurrency market will be open, as it always is.)      Bitcoin (BTC) was lower, trading around the $38,000 level where prices have gravitated for the past week.      The market faces price resistance around $41,000, with support seen around $34,000, Mark Warner, head of trading for London-based BCB Group, a financial firm focused on digital assets, said in comments emailed by a spokeswoman.      ""A move above $42,000 will likely see a resumption of the heady gains we saw last week,"" Warner said. Prices are up 29% so far in 2021, versus a 0.4% year-to-date loss for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.      In traditional markets, Asian and European shares fell and U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Friday, as anticipation of President-elect Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion relief proposal, rolled out late Thursday, yielded to sober assessments of the state of the economy. Gold was little changed at $1,847 an ounce.    Market moves    First Mover wrote last October how a ""blue wave"" in then-upcoming U.S. elections – full control of the government by Joe Biden's Democratic Party – could lead to trillions of dollars of new government spending on coronavirus relief and economic stimulus.      That wave has arrived, in the form of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus-relief package proposed late Thursday by U.S. President-elect Biden. And some Wall Street analysts are now wondering openly if the economy and markets are becoming hooked on stimulus.      ""The market is back to an expectation that more fiscal stimulus is all but inevitable,"" Ed Mills, of the stock-brokerage firm Raymond James, wrote early Friday in a note to clients.      Cryptocurrency investors could jump straight to the implication: The Federal Reserve might need to print trillions of new dollars to help finance any extra borrowing by the U.S. Treasury Department. That in turn could spur more demand for bitcoin, seen by a growing number of investors as a hedge against inflation.      ""Stimulus targets could steadily increase on any setbacks with the coronavirus pandemic, and that has been one of the fundamental reasons why many continue to pile into bitcoin,"" Edward Moya, a New York-based senior market analyst for the London-based foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote in an emailed note.      Biden's proposal, announced in a speech, earmarks $1 trillion for families and individuals and more than $400 billion to combat the pandemic directly, including money to accelerate vaccine deployment and safely reopen schools, according to the New York Times. There's also $350 billion of aid for state and local governments.      Democrats, set to become the majority party in both chambers of Congress, might use a ""budget reconciliation"" process to push the legislation through with a simple majority of votes, according to Mills at Raymond James.      ""We would note that it would not prevent them from a second reconciliation package later this year,"" Mills wrote.      During the 2020 fiscal year that ended in September, the U.S. budget deficit hit a record $3.1 trillion, swollen from government relief packages signed by President Donald Trump as the coronavirus-related lockdowns devastated the economy.      Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon, predicts the U.S. budget deficit could reach $4 trillion during the current fiscal year.      With the economy now suffering from the recent uptick in coronavirus-related cases and a vaccine rollout still months away, fiscal discipline looks unlikely. A government report Thursday revealed a bigger-then-expected increase in weekly unemployment claims to 965,000, the highest since August. The past year's shift toward remote working represents another potential source of widespread dislocation.      Not to fear. As Scott Anderson, chief economist at San Francisco-based Bank of the West, a unit of the giant French bank BNP Paribas, told clients Thursday: ""While the latest jobless claims report is sobering, the $900 billion coronavirus aid package recently passed and the promise of more fiscal aid coming shortly from the Biden administration should deliver some much-needed support to the unemployed and businesses in the current quarter until service-sector businesses are allowed to reopen as more Americans receive the vaccine.""      The U.S. national public debt stands at an already-elevated $27.7 trillion, and analysts say the Fed would likely have to help finance any extra goverment borrowings with more purchases of Treasury bonds, once considered an emergency measure.      ""Taxes will go up, but they are unlikely to rise by what could be an incremental $4 trillion in one year,"" Dick Bove, a longtime bank analyst who now works for the brokerage firm Odeon, told clients Thursday. ""Thus, the Fed must step in. This can cause the dollar to decline meaningfully, inflation to rise and interest rates to become a problem. It is a worrisome situation that a President Biden may be unable to control.""      Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan, who sits on the U.S. central bank's monetary-policy committee, suggested that officials later this year might consider whether to taper their ongoing $120 billion-a-month of bond purchases, initially implemented as an emergency measure.      But the drama was short-lived, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday squashing speculation of an imminent tapering. ""Now is not the time,"" he said during a virtual discussion.      Bank of America estimates the Fed's balance sheet will end 2021 at $8.8 trillion, up from about $7.4 trillion as of Wednesday. Before the pandemic hit at the start of 2020, the level was $4.2 trillion.      But even those estimates might be subject to change.      ""Depending on the extent of U.S. fiscal expansion and deficits in coming years, there is a risk the Fed might not be able to withdraw themselves completely from the U.S. Treasury market for fear of disorderly market conditions,"" Bank of America's economists wrote this week.      The upshot for crypto traders and investors? If bitcoin is a hedge against Federal Reserve money printing, the use case doesn't appear to be going away anytime soon.      - Bradley Keoun    Bitcoin watch    Bitcoin’s two-day rally has stalled as the U.S. dollar gains ground in the wake of President-elect Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal-stimulus proposal.      The cryptocurrency was changing hands around $39,600 when Biden spoke at around 00:15 coordinated universal time (UTC), and prices have since traded down to about $38,000, based on CoinDesk 20 pricing.      The pullback marks a weak follow-through to the two-day rise, which saw prices revisit $40,000 resistance. The lack of a bullish response by the bitcoin market is perhaps surprising, given that fiscal and monetary stimulus is seen as inflationary, and bitcoin is seen by a growing number of investors as a store of value.      The strength of the U.S. dollar against major currencies could be playing spoilsport, with the greenback gaining in foreign-exchange markets early Friday. Over the past year, bitcoin prices have shown an increasingly negative correlation with the U.S. dollar, meaning they typically move in opposite directions.      - Omkar Godbole      Read More: Biden’s $1.9T Relief Package Proposal Fails to Stir Bitcoin Market    What's hot    Paxos teams up with Chainlink in fresh push to make its asset-backed tokens paxos standard (PAX) and paxos gold (PAXG) more widely available across DeFi (CoinDesk)      Some Asian traders are using Polkadot to predict bitcoin's future (CoinDesk)      Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees ""years rather than months"" before digital dollar is released (CoinDesk)      Grayscale raises $3.3B in 4Q 2020, most ever (CoinDesk), adds 2K+ BTC to reserves in first day back after three-week pause on new investment; reserves addition is 2.4x number of new bitcoins minted by the blockchain (Decrypt) (EDITOR'S NOTE: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

42385630,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2XPh,1610721169,MahaDAO’s Algorithmic ‘Valuecoin’ Goes Live on Ethereum,"An India-based startup is coming for decentralized finance (DeFi) stalwart MakerDAO’s crown with the launch of its new “valuecoin.”      MahaDAO’s ARTH algorithmic stablecoin is now live on the Ethereum mainnet, according to a press release shared with CoinDesk. ARTH will also go live on the Matic network at an undisclosed point in the future, the team said.      The MahaDAO team defines the new token as a “valuecoin” for its ability to “maintain its purchasing power over time.” That’s compared to other stablecoins – like MakerDAO’s collateral-backed dai token – which are meant to mirror the dollar in terms of price value even if the greenback goes off a cliff.      “Elastic supply stablecoins are one of the most exciting and innovative verticals within DeFi right now,” MahaDAO co-founder Steven Enamakel said in a statement. “Having closely examined existing algorithmic stablecoins, and learned from their successes and shortcomings, we’ve engineered ARTH to ensure that it will be much more stable, making it suitable for a range of DeFi applications from lending to staking as well as real-world, non-crypto use cases.”      The majority of the $30 billion stablecoin market consists of collateral-backed tokens, such as tether or USDC.      Regardless, a host of algorithmic tokens have recently come back into vogue such as basis cash (BAC) or empty set dollar (ESD). These tokens, like ARTH, try to retain a peg to the dollar through a complex system of bonds that can be redeemed or bought when the peg is thrown off.    Read more: ‘Basis Cash’ Launch Brings Defunct Stablecoin Into the DeFi Era    “Users who elect to purchase ARTH bonds will exert a direct effect on the Uniswap price of the ARTH-DAI pool instead of just reducing the supply of ARTH. This will exert a stronger effect on the ARTH-DAI price, resulting in greater price stability for ARTH,” the MahaDAO release states.      This system hasn’t really panned out for BAC or ESD, as data provider CoinGecko notes both tokens are far below their intended pegs, currently at $0.86 and $0.58, respectively.      Enamakel told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that ARTH’s algorithm has greater resistance than other algorithmic tokens because of the token’s underlying components – including price dynamics tied to a basket of goods, bond purchases on Uniswap and stability fees to “dampen bond redemptions.”      Distribution of ARTH will begin Jan. 16 by placing assets into MahaDAO pools.

42385631,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXB2XTT,1610712607,Biden's $1.9T Relief Package Proposal Fails to Stir Bitcoin Market,"Bitcoin's two-day rally has stalled as the U.S. dollar gains ground in the wake of Joe Biden's fiscal stimulus announcement.      The U.S. President-elect proposed an emergency relief package worth $1.9 trillion at around 00:15 UTC when bitcoin was changing hands near $39,600. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value is trading down near $38,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The pullback marks a weak follow-through to the two-day rise, which saw prices revisit $40,000 resistance.      The lack of a bullish response by the bitcoin market is perhaps surprising, given that fiscal/monetary stimulus is inflationary and bitcoin is widely considered a store of value. Public-listed companies such as MicroStrategy bought bitcoin in the second half of 2020 to preserve the value of their treasury.      The strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies could be playing spoilsport. The performance of USD on the Dollar Index (DXY) has affected the cryptocurrency's price in the past, and the negative correlation between the two assets is strengthening, as noted by CoinDesk Research.      The DXY is currently trading modestly higher on the day near 90.40. Meanwhile, European equities and S&P 500 futures are trading lower, and gold is trading flat, according to data source Investing.com.      ""A lot of the optimism surrounding another injection of U.S. fiscal stimulus had already been priced in ahead of the keenly awaited announcement,"" ForexTime market analyst Han Tann noted in his daily analysis. Axios had previously suggested Biden would push for a $3 trillion relief package.      With the stimulus expectations, the dollar is rising, possibly on the back of the classic ""sell the rumor, buy the news"" trade and capping upside in bitcoin.      Analysts, however, expect the greenback's bounce to be short-lived. ""Biden's stimulus plan has given some strength to the U.S. dollar. However, it remains firmly bearish for the medium term,"" Matthew Dibb, COO, and co-founder of Stack Funds, told CoinDesk. ""Any further depreciation of the greenback will lead to a bitcoin rally.""

According to a report by Bloomberg on Friday, Mirror Trading International (MTI) is set to be put under the microscope by four liquidators following an investigation from South Africa's Financial Services Conduct Authority (FSCA) last year.      A kind of trading club, the firm had claimed to be able to create profits of 10% per month by using bots to carry out high-frequency trading using client's pooled bitcoin.      The liquidators now want to increase their powers to include the right to call witnesses to an insolvency trial, appoint additional investigators and request financial information from banks.
