42398841,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Uf,1452629725,Suspected Members of Bitcoin Extortion Group DD4BC Captured,"The European Union’s top law enforcement agency has announced a new crackdown on distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack group DD4BC.  Europol said today that one individual had been arrested and another detained as part of an effort called Operation Pleiades. The group, which demands bitcoin payments after threatening DDoS attacks, has been known to target a wide range of Web-based services focused on bitcoin, including mining pools.  Authorities in Bosnia and Hezegovina, Germany, France, Japan, Romania, Switzerland, the UK and the US either supported or directly contributed to the action, according to the agencyhttps://www.europol.europa.eu/newsletter/international-action-against-dd4bc-cybercriminal-group.  Europol said in a statement:  ""Operation Pleiades resulted in the arrest of a main target and one more suspect detained. Multiple property searches were carried out and an extensive amount of evidence was seized.""  The agency indicated that it had identified ""key members of the organised network"" located in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The operation comes months after the Swiss government issued a warning about the group following a string of attacks in Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland.  DD4BC has also reportedly targeted mainstream financial services.

42398844,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Xc,1452623893,Concerns Mount Amid Issues at Digital Currency Exchange Cryptsy,"UPDATE (13th January 05:04 BST): Cryptsy has posted a notice on its website stating that it has suspended withdrawals and trading following what it described as an ""attack"". The move comes amid reports on social media of a phishing attack that targeted customer email accounts and cell phone numbers.      The controversy surrounding the digital currency exchange Cryptsy has shown little sign of abating amid problems with customer withdrawals, allegations of fraud and mismanagement, user frustration and a lack of clarity from the exchange.  Founded in 2013, Cryptsy is a digital currency exchange that lists bitcoin and a variety of alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, and for months, customers of the exchange have voiced concerns about delayed withdrawal requests. Some customers claim that their funds have been unavailable for weeks or more at a time.  Many of these complaints have filtered throughout social media, sparking speculation that the exchange is set to follow in the footsteps of Mt Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange that shut its doors and later declared bankruptcy after potentially losing hundreds of millions of dollars in customer funds.  In some instances, according to testimonials from Cryptsy customers, withdrawals have been successfully made in lower-volume altcoins – a move that has reportedly resulted in disparate prices between exchanges and may have resulted in Cryptsy being removed from exchange-oriented services like Coinmarketcap.  At this time, it is unclear how much money is being held by the exchange or the total amount of outstanding withdrawal requests, though some have speculated that the amount may be in the millions of dollars.  Services cut ties  In light of the problems, some cryptocurrency services are moving to sever ties with Cryptsy, citing both the problems with withdrawals as well as problematic exchange rates.  As reported last week, digital currency pricing website Coinmarketcap moved to delist Cryptsy amid the ongoing issues. At press time, the exchange remains unlisted on the site.  Altcoin mining pool service Multipool.us announced on 4th January that it was suspending its auto-deposit integration with Cryptsy.  The site said in a statement at the time:  ""We have attempted several times now to contact Cryptsy to get a status on BTC/LTC withdrawals but have received no response. According to reports from our users and users on other sites, it appears that Cryptsy has not processed BTC or LTC withdrawals in over a month. Other currencies may be working but are now highly inflated on Cryptsy.""  ""We consider Cryptsy to be a defunct exchange and recommend our users avoid it,"" the message continued.  More recently, cryptocurrency trading software developer Coinigy announced that it would remove the exchange from one of its pricing tools.    NOTICE: Cryptsy will be removed from ArbMatrix tomorrow evening as exchange rates are out of whack. Take note! #Bitcoin #Cryptsy        — Coinigy (@Coinigy) January 12, 2016    Offices vacated  Last week, bitcoin news site Bitcoinisthttp://bitcoinist.net/cryptsy-has-moved-out-of-their-building-unannounced-nowhere-to-be-found/ reported that the offices of Project Investors, Inc. – one of the firms tied to the exchange – had been vacated.  According to the media outlet, an anonymous source had learned that Project Investors left the building at 160 Congress Drive, Delray Beach, Florida.  When reached for comment, a representative for Cohen Commercial Management, the property's management firm, confirmed that Project Investors had departed the premises. According to the representative, the company left about a month ago.  A Cryptsy support staffer reportedly told customers in the exchange's online chatroom that the move was planned and is aimed at ""cutting expenses"".  The actions come amid divorce proceedings involving Vernon that cite Project Investors and other entities owned or controlled by Vernon as a third-party defendant.  Unconfirmed reports have also alleged evidence that the exchange is being investigated by the US government.  Cryptsy has not responded to requests for comment.

42398845,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Yb,1452594476,World of Bitcoin Shrinks as Startups Scale Back at CES 2016,"One of the biggest events on the annual tech calendar has passed without many major announcements from bitcoin or blockchain industry firms.  The 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held in Las Vegas last week, saw a notable decrease in the number of industry startups attending, with 2015 attendees including Blockchain, BitPay, Circle and Kraken indicating they did not participate.  Further, of the assembled participants, a lineup that included lesser-known names such as BitCircle, BitRouter, Bits Limited, HyprKey and Ledger, only the latter company had a booth showcasing its technology or an announcement as it unveiled its new flagship bitcoin hardware wallet, Ledger Blue.  Ledger co-founder Thomas France told CoinDesk during the conference that he noticed a particular absence of peers at the event.  ""We’re the only bitcoin startup this year. There’s a couple of bitcoin [people] that came to the stand, but no other bitcoin products,” France reported last week.  The development is a contrast to 2015, when 10 industry startups combined efforts to launch the 'World of Bitcoin', an effort led by bitcoin payments processor BitPay to showcase the emerging technology and then-new products like its Copay wallet.  In statements, BitPay largely dismissed its lack of presence at the event, stating that attending simply wasn’t in line with its current strategy.  Marketing associate James Walpole told CoinDesk:  ""Right now we’re focused on growing transaction volume and improving the BitPay platform for our users. Attending the show this year isn’t in line with that focus.""  The World of Bitcoin is the latest educational outreach initiative to be disbanded by the bitcoin payment processor amid staff reductions, following its decision to end its sponsorship of the postseason college football game, the St Petersburg Bowl last year.  Reasons unclear  When reached for comment, most bitcoin startups did not provide further insight as to their reasons for not attending.  Blockchain cited scheduling conflicts, while firms like Kraken and Circle simply reported that they were not at the event.  David Raviv, VP of corporate development at HyprKey, speculated that the funding environment for the bitcoin community could have influenced attendance.  ""These events are super expensive. You come out here as a startup, you’ll drop $60,000–$70,000. So depending on where you are in the funding cycle you may not see it as a priority,"" Raviv said.  He suggested some established digital currency firms may be seeking to conserve funds in light of perceived funding issues as investor interest transitions to blockchain use cases.  Raviv was also keen to stress that HyprKey has an expanded product suite, and that it saw a market for its biometrics solutions in the home automation, healthcare and wearables, all industries he said were well-represented.  Even Ledger was seeking to position its offerings toward a more mainstream audience for CES, booking a booth in the cybersecurity section and billing the Ledger Blue as a ""privacy and security device"" in its official release.  Still, France suggested the event was fruitful for the startup, which saw interest from some major financial firms.  “We had some people from the innovation from the banks coming to look. Bitcoin is blockchain security. You always have to have some sort of trusted hardware,” he said.  Blockchain talk  The industry was given more exposure at the Digital Money Forum, a CES event produced by Living in Digital Times and sponsored by MasterCard.  There, familiar faces such as Uphold chairman Halsey Minor, SnapCard CEO Michael Dunworth, Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring, and Blockchain Capital managing partner Brock Pierce participated in talks on digital payments.  Though featuring representatives from in and around the industry, only one panel session directly addressed the industry in title, with “Virtual Currency (Block Chain 101)” covering how the technology is being embraced by financial institutions.  Elsewhere, topics were more generally framed under titles such as ""A Brief History of Money"" and ""Wallet Payment Systems"".
