42431021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzK5h,1569758400,Asian Institutions Are Finally Warming to Crypto Hedge Funds,"The Takeaway:  Asian institutional investors, mostly high-net-worth individuals and family offices, are increasingly showing interest in digital assets, with some having allocated part of their portfolios to crypto hedge funds.  The gloomy macroeconomic outlook and the news of Facebook’s Libra and China’s central bank digital currency have fueled this interest, market participants say.  Crypto hedge funds in the region face hurdles to getting off the ground, including licensing, banking, custody and insurance.      Asian institutional investors, mostly high-net-worth individuals and family offices unfamiliar with digital assets, are increasingly showing interest in allocating a small portion of their portfolios to crypto hedge funds.  Unlike in the past, some have actually taken the plunge and made such allocations, while more are likely to follow, industry experts say.  The rub is that, like in other parts of the world, a crypto-averse banking sector and regulatory requirements pose high hurdles to launching such funds, and hence wider institutional adoption, in Asia.  This year has been a crucial turning point for BBShares, a Hong Kong-based crypto hedge fund catering to institutional investors in Asia. The firm is on track to reach committed capital of $10 million before year-end, mostly from high-net-worth individuals and family offices, while traditional financial institutions remain on the sidelines.  Most of the capital came in during the past four months after news of Facebook's Libra project and bitcoin’s bull run since early this year piqued investors’ interest.  ""The pace of [institutional] investor allocation to crypto this year has been much faster,” said Jett Li, chief investment officer at BBShares who formerly worked at Bank of New York Mellon. ""Demand for secure and efficient institutional asset allocation into crypto is quite strong.""  Tiantian Kullander, co-founder of Asian crypto trading firm Amber Group, echoed that sentiment.  ""The interests are definitely there,"" he said. ""The frequency [of institutional investors inquiring about crypto investments] is increasing noticeably in recent months.""  That said, the number of crypto hedge funds located in Asia is still small. Around five percent of global crypto hedge funds are located in Singapore, compared to 64 percent in the United States, according to a 2019 research report by consulting firm PwC.  These funds are structured much like traditional hedge funds, leveraging strategies such as quantitative trading, arbitrage, long-only and long-short, and aiming to generate alpha, or above-market returns, for institutional investors.  Free advertising  A number of market participants noticed significant pickup in investor interest in crypto after Facebook formally announced in June that it plans to launch Libra.  ""It is the best advertising you can hope for crypto,"" said Jianbo Wang, chief investment officer of CYBEX, a decentralized crypto-asset exchange. ""After the Libra announcement, people feel like they have to look into investing in the space.""  If Libra is the perfect advertisement, the increasingly plausible reports about People's Bank of China's (PBoC) planned digital currency serve as an official blessing.  In August alone, the Chinese central bank made several public comments on its planned digital yuan, which could be the world's first. Underscoring the seriousness of the project, a dedicated team has been developing the system in a separate office with restricted access since earlier this year.  Beyond the two immediate catalysts, several macro factors could also be shoring up investor interest. Bitcoin’s price has jumped 120 percent year-to-date in 2019 – the best-performing asset in 2019 so far by a massive margin.  To put this in perspective, some of the best-performing assets in 2019 so far include the U.S. real estate index (measured by MSCI REIT Index) and U.S. equities (measured by the Russell 3000 index) – both are up around 20 percent, according to data from SeekingAlpha.  Bitcoin’s outsized returns are giving investors a case of FOMO, fear of missing out. Negative interest rates in Europe and a gloomy economic outlook worldwide make an allocation in crypto – viewed as an uncorrelated asset, unaffected by swings in traditional markets – much more appealing.  ""The downward trend in the macro environment has contributed to investor interests. People's eyes are opened a bit more toward crypto,"" said Ryan Rabaglia, head of trading at OSL Brokerage, a digital asset brokerage firm in Hong Kong. ""There is definitely a sense of awakening to crypto as investors are battered with all kinds of 'wars' and problems around the world.""  Belt and road  To be sure, the road to wider institutional adoption for crypto asset trading may be a rocky one in Asia.  Even after investors decide to allocate assets to crypto, there is a myriad of challenges for actually deploying the capital.  Options are limited, especially in Asia. Investors can either purchase crypto assets directly or do so via a trustee, said Kenneth Xu, CEO of Hong Kong-registered crypto custodian InVault Trust.  But more sophisticated and versatile products are needed to provide alpha-generating returns beyond just a one-way bet. Providing that optionality, by setting up a crypto trading fund that can take money from accredited and institutional investors, is no simple feat.  The most basic investment fund services such as opening a bank account, fund administration, custodian service, insurance coverage, and auditing are difficult to obtain or simply unavailable to crypto fund managers in Asia.  Opening a bank account for a crypto investment management company in China is almost impossible, given regulatory and foreign exchange constraints. Meanwhile, banks in Hong Kong and Singapore are in general unfriendly toward this type of accounts due to perceived risks related to crypto investment.  BBShares said it took well over a year to get everything ready. It turned to a U.S. custodian to provide custody and insurance coverage for its funds and created an in-house asset management system to meet compliance requirements in Hong Kong and Singapore.  Point95 Global, another crypto hedge fund based in Hong Kong, has also begun preparation since spring in 2018 and is currently perfecting internal processes with plans to raise external capital in 2020.  ""We had to build the car and the road at the same time,"" said Lin Cheung, CEO of Point95 Global, who previously worked at JP Morgan. ""Each step was challenging and took a long time.""  Both BBShares and Point95 Global also turned to the U.S. to open bank accounts, which usually requires the management team to have U.S. citizens or green card holders and professionals with sufficient investment management work experience. For some teams, this requirement is not easily met.  ""The ecosystem in Asia doesn't want to take risks,"" said one industry expert who did not want to make a critical comment publicly. ""From regulators to financial institutions, they are used to being the follower. They just want to wait and copy what has worked in developed markets.""  First-mover advantage?  Nevertheless, there are clear signs that concrete developments are finally taking place in Asia.  For the believers in institutional adoption, getting ready before institutions deploy capital to crypto en masse provides a first-mover advantage.  ""You can't wait until institutions are putting money in tomorrow. That will be too late,"" said Point95 Global's Cheung.  It's difficult to predict what will happen in regulated crypto funds in the next three years, or even the next year, said BBShare's Li. ""This market moves so quickly. But we are very bullish on crypto's long-term potential and our fund's value proposition.”  Others are thinking about creating intermediate products such as managed accounts since the cost of setting up and operating a licensed crypto hedge fund is very high.  Considering most investors who are deploying capital today are high net-worth individuals and family offices, a managed account can serve as a decent option. CYBEX's Jianbo Wang and Point95 Global are both considering launching such services soon.  Others are not so hasty. Amber's Kullander said that a lot of requests his firm sees still stop at inquiry. ""If they are poking around only now, it's likely that they will be very slow.""  Such caution can create its own risks.  ""There has certainly been more talk than action,"" said InVault's Xu. ""A crypto fund might take two years to prepare all the documentation, licenses, and meet compliance requirements. But in the world of crypto, the market could be upside down in that time frame.""  That may be true. But for the first movers, the upside is well worth the risk.

42431023,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMzK9h,1569751374,New Interest in DAOs Prompts Old Question: Are They Legal?,"“Ethereum is only now starting to shrug off its ‘PTSDAO,’” tweeted Ameen Soleimani, the SpankChain CEO and creator of a now-$1.2 million decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called the MolochDAO.  After an infamous hack drained “The DAO” of roughly $60 million in 2016, developers have been hesitant to kickstart new projects in its likeness. That is, until now.  DAOs were the “it” topic at recent ethereum gatherings in Berlin. That followed the announcement in early August of a new DAO spearheaded by former Web3 Foundation executive Ryan Zurrer.  But one lingering question still remains: Is a for-profit DAO legal?  ConsenSys-backed blockchain startup OpenLaw is looking to answer that question, unveiling earlier this month a new vision for DAO projects focused on legal compliance.  In a blog post, OpenLaw boldly stated:  “OpenLaw will help to resurrect the initial vision of The DAO in a manner that comports with U.S. law.”  OpenLaw’s so-called “Limited Liability Autonomous Organization” or LAO project aims to conform with guidelines set forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) established in the wake of the 2016 DAO hack.  Such compliance should pave the way for other DAO projects to gain legitimacy in the eyes of investors, lawmakers and the broader public. At least according to OpenLaw CEO Aaron Wright.  “Even if there wasn’t an issue on the technical side,” Wright said of the original DAO, “even if there wasn’t that attack, there would have been significant regulatory issues, at least in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.”  Done correctly, Wright said, DAOs do have the potential to replace venture capital and private equity firms. That could be a monumental achievement in fueling the future of blockchain network development.  How to make DAOs legal  It all starts with creating a “legal wrapper.”  First, you have to structure your DAO as a business entity registered under U.S. law. According to OpenLaw’s Wright, your best bet, in terms of legal framework, is what’s known as a limited liability company (LLC).  Or, as blockchain lawyer Andrew Hinkes explained:  “Operating as a [LLC] means the entity is responsible for contracts and the entity is responsible for taxes and the entity is responsible for violations of the law, not necessarily the individuals who are acting on behalf of the entity.”  Without that, Hinkes said, “it could mean that the individuals [in the DAO] are liable for everything.”  Pushing liability to a designated and registered business entity under U.S. law is especially important in the event of a hack resulting in lost funds. 2016 made that abundantly clear.  “In The DAO hack, where one third of the ETH was spun into a child DAO by the attacker ... there was a pretty decent argument to be made that anybody damaged could sue anybody involved. That would have been disastrous,” Hinkes said.  Removing such uncertainty is one of the key benefits to wrapping DAOs within the limited liability framework, Wright said.  “It provides a framework to begin to get clarity,” he said. “It limits the liability between [investors] to one another and it also clarifies issues related to how taxes need to be accounted for.”  There is a tradeoff  At the same time, regulatory clarity also comes with stricter policies and rules as to how a legal DAO can and cannot operate. The LAO, for example, unlike the original DAO, will only be available for a limited number of accredited investors at its launch.  That’s right, only the wealthy can partake.  In this way, the LAO may not differ all that much in substance from a traditional business requiring participants to disclose their identities, pay taxes and, often, hire legal counsel.  “There’s nothing new here,” said Felix Shipkevich, blockchain lawyer at Shipkevich PLLC. “It’s no different in offering the same concept without the use of tokens.”  Preston Byrne, a crypto lawyer who wrote a detailed blog about the LAO project, agrees. In an email to CoinDesk he said:  “The ‘DAO’ here is not modeled after an LLC. It is an LLC. … As an investment vehicle for venture funding, I do not find the structure particularly compelling or better for investors than existing methods.”  For Wright, on the other hand, the advantages of LAOs are clear.  “The startup [using the LAO] can receive funding in days instead of weeks,” he said. “Instead of having to take a trip to Silicon Valley or New York or somewhere else where there’s angel investors and venture capitalists, they can go to the venture capital firm in the sky.”  While this is clearly an advantage to entrepreneurs, the opposite may be true for investors. According to Byrne, it is a “human problem” where experienced investors simply don’t want to give their money away without extensive due diligence and follow-up.  At the very least, Wright’s LAO project represents an important step in the evolution of DAOs, one that could spur further experimentation with bringing decentralized technologies into harmony with current legal constructs.  Said Hinkes:  “I think the next step will come when states start to experiment with their own laws and allow for flexibility in corporate structure to accommodate more code-driven conduct.”  Image: Aaron Wright speaking at CoinDesk Consensus",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/29/new-interest-in-daos-prompts-old-question-are-they-legal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9729acf2baa9dc4200e83454827efa9b18875cf4-1500x821.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
