42376869,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erS3,1391035514,Bitcoin Hearings Day 2: Bitcoin Businesses Court Regulation in NY,"If day one of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) hearings on virtual currencies was characterized by a circus-like atmosphere and initial tension from both parties, day two saw the emergence of a loose consensus of regulatory goals that could benefit the bitcoin community as well as help regulators bring stability and safety to the market.  Members of the bitcoin business community continued to express a desire for reasonable regulations, and named wallets and exchanges as the best places for initial oversight. Further, academics and regulators began to define the space as one that could benefit from increased structure and greater involvement from traditional banks.  Most notable from the day's conversation was that New York regulators seemed more open to the idea of a regulated New York-based bitcoin exchange, the jobs and opportunity such bitcoin businesses could bring to the state and the benefits these developments could provide the nascent bitcoin ecosystem.  Benjamin M. Lawsky  , superintendent of financial services for the State of New York, called the prospect of a New York-based exchange a ""double whammy"" that could encourage onshore transactions while helping eliminate the bad actors and lax oversight that have so far plagued virtual currency businesses and law enforcement.  Jeremy Allaire, founder and CEO of Circle demonstrated his support for the idea saying that such a such a development would ""provide a more mature platform"" for the community and lead to the industry away from a reliance on businesses in countries with less oversight.    ""Rather than the market leader for liquidity being a 14-person company in Slovenia, why not have a leading exchange in NYC?"" - J Allaire      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 29, 2014    'A hybrid system'  Despite bitcoin's potential as a system that could replace the traditional finance industry, the investment community – represented by Allaire and Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase – offered up a more moderate short-term future for the technology. This vision was perhaps more akin to today's omnichannel commerce environment, in which like physical and online retailers, bitcoin and fiat-based financial systems coexist as competing or even complementary offerings.  ""We are a long way away from a world where things stay in bitcoin all time,"" Ehrsam said.  Ehrsam continued, saying that in the years to come, there will ""need to be a lot of coordination with the traditional financial system"".  Allaire echoed these sentiments, calling the reluctance of big banks to participate in the growing economy ""unfortunate"". Allaire, who spoke at yesterday's Wells Fargo hearing, says the interest of major banks is evidence that a thawing between the two camps is occurring, but that the fear factor of high-profile arrests and money laundering has set back such relationships.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Allaire voiced the opinion of his fellow investors that bitcoin is moving away from fringe ideas.  ""If you're not interested in mainstream adoption, and you're really focused on anonymous, completely self-governed currencies, theres 20 or 50 or 100 altcoins to go do that with.""  'The dark side of virtual currency'  The day's first panel – featuring Cyrus R. Vance, Jr, District Attorney of New York County and Richard B. Zabel, Deputy U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York – focused on the negatives of bitcoin, or what regulators called the ""significant law enforcement challenges posed by virtual currency"".  The conversation was dominated by references to identity theft, child pornography, cybercrime and litany of the evils that stemmed from the high-profile cases so far prosecuted by New York, including Liberty Reserve and Silk Road.  In contrast to yesterday's investor panel, which appealed to the state for a ""safe harbor"" period that would not stifle innovators with increased compliance, Vance Jr. advocated that digital currency exchangers should be required to ""maintain transaction records"", ""obtain identifying information from customers"", ""implement procedures to ensure the accuracy of information"" and ""file periodic applications in order to do business"".  Zabel and Vance Jr. also downplayed assertions by the first day's witnesses that current laws are enough.  ""I don't think that because we've made significant arrests in this area, that means it's all under control,"" Vance Jr. said.  A call for national and international coordiation  While bitcoin does pose a regulatory challenge for the State of New York, as evidenced by the day's first panel, Ehrsam and Allaire broadened the outlook of regulators to the implications bitcoin will have given its borderless and frictionless capabilities.  Calling it ""one of the first major Internet, technology-driven issues that really will require collaboration on a worldwide basis"", Allaire suggested the industry would benefit most from ""unilateral action"" that sets forth a clearly defined model for startups between states and perhaps even internationally.  Zabel's comments suggest that such an approach would also be beneficial to investigations. He noted that Liberty Reserve's operators relocated to Costa Rica to specifically go beyond the jurisdiction of authorities, and that a lack of cross-border restrictions to bitcoin transfers has enabled criminals and set back prosecutors.  Consumer protections  Notably, Allaire and Ehrsam seemed more willing than their counterparts in the VC community to indicate that anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) rules were a necessary aspect of running a money service business, even those dealing in bitcoin. Ehrsam noted that Coinbase has spent a ""disproportionate"" amount of its funding on ensuring it abides by these rules, but demonstrated a willingness go above and beyond if it meant operating with less uncertainty.  ""Regulation could be a positive in this regard, if there is a framework where companies are required to perform due diligence or enhanced due diligence, we really filter that bottleneck,"" Ehrsam said.  Executive vice president of Overstock.com Jonathan Johnson stated that online retailers would also help ensure identity tracking and consumer safeguards.    ""For our customers, no one is completely anonymous - they always provide us an address to ship to."" - J Johnson http://t.co/wUZYC0oVCA      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 29, 2014    A mainstream commerce phase  Ehrsam and Allaire agreed with statements from yesterday's panel that indicated bitcoin is coming out of its speculative phase. As evidenced, Johnson was onhand to attest to how bitcoin can be a 'managable opportunity' for mainstream retailers, even if he jokingly suggested that he doesn't exactly welcome more entrants to the space.  Johnson made the business case through a story of an interaction with his local hairdresser, who lamented the restrictions of large credit card companies.  ""Both large and small businesses have a real incentive to add 2% to 4% to their bottom line,"" Johnson said.  But, if cost savings was a uniting discussion point, regulators and law enforcement officials continued to express that certain aspects of the industry, such as mining, if left without supervision, could lead to currency manipulation and consumer fraud.  Princeton professor Ed W. Felten  stated there could be a need for regulation in this area, saying ""We don't know for sure that would happen if someone were try to monopolize bitcoin's mining system"".  Bitcoin-specific regulations  Law enforcement officials were firm in their assertion that virtual currencies are ""quantitatively different"" about virtual currencies, saying that comparisons to burner cell phones or encrypted computers were not applicable to the challenges posed by bitcoin.  ""We have seen digital currencies becoming part of the mainstream market, and financial transactions market, and that means that if people misuse this medium for criminal purposes... it is opening a big door into financial transactions around the world,"" Vance Jr. said.  Vance Jr. also moved to attack the belief that the public blockchains of some virtual currencies would benefit law enforcement agents.  ""Having an IP address and knowing who's behind the IP address are two entirely different things,"" Vance Jr. said.  Further, regulators also inquired about the possibility of whether a coin could be programmed to follow regulations implemented by the state.  Bitcoin, an academic view  If most of the day was focused on regulation for bitcoin, the gathered professors gave more attention to the hypotheticals that could disrupt bitcoin and its status as the major player in the market. Regulators inquired as to problems in the system and whether it could truly develop into a lower-cost financial services system for consumers given competition and investor demands for returns.  Athey and Felten focused on highlighting the potential of the technology and defended the value of bitcoin as well as its ability to serve as a payments system despite issues with hoarding and liquidity.  Mark T. Williams, professor at Boston University School of Management, took an opposing view, citing the currency's 9,000% growth in 2013:  ""Bitcoin prices have been artificially inflated through a cartel ownership structure, hoarding, market hype and greater opportunities for market manipulation,"" Williams said.  While the conversation did discuss the outstanding uncertainties with bitcoin, it also added a more universal perspective on the underlying possibilities of bitcoin technology and their possible applications to better alternatives. However, academics suggested limiting the ability for such experimentation would likely be detrimental long-term.

42376856,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6erBh,1391015194,French Regulator Requires Bitcoin Exchanges to Register,"The French Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR), which regulates the nation's banks, has issued a statement clarifying the status of bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges in the country.  In addition to the standard list of concerns and warnings, the regulator points out that anyone operating a bitcoin exchange in France must have a license.  The ACPR has now adopted the position that intermediation in the sale or purchase of bitcoins, or receiving funds to transfer bitcoins, requires the seller to be treated like any other payment service. This means any exchange will have to be approved by the ACPR as a provider of payment services.  The authority also reminded the public that the European Banking Authority (EBA) has already issued public warnings about digital currencies. The concerns include the lack of regulatory authority and protection in case an exchange or other bitcoin-related service defaults, the risks involved with storing bitcoins on a computer, lack of a protective legal framework, high volatility, risk of abuse by criminals, and possible tax implications.  The regulator stresses that exchange platforms that acquire or sell bitcoins for legal tender must make transactions through a registered provider, such as a credit institution, payment institution or an electronic money institution.  This public statement does not change much for bitcoin users in France, who will not be affected. However, those planning to open an exchange in France will have to register first.  The ACPR pointed out that it was prompted to make the statement in light of recent criminal events, mainly in the US, and the risk of fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing associated with anonymous financial instruments like digital currencies.

42425368,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwF7h,1391007932,PwC Report Has High Hopes for Bitcoin in Show Business,"PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has published a report which claims that digital currencies, namely bitcoin, are already driving digital innovation across several industries.  The report, titled 'Digital Disruptor: How Bitcoin is Driving Digital Innovation in Entertainment, Media and Communications' was published by the multinational professional services firm earlier this week and its conclusions are largely positive.  PwC's pros and cons  The PwC report is the latest in a series of consumer intelligence reports, and it explores the impact of bitcoin on entertainment, media and communications (EMC) companies. It is based on the 3 – 4 million online mentions bitcoin had in 2013, alongside an online consumer survey commissioned by the company.  The report opens by outlining the risks and benefits for companies and consumers alike. Benefits for businesses include low transaction fees, daily cash outs, no payment reversals and the availability of merchant tools; while consumers also stand to gain from low fees and pseudo-anonymity. According to the document, consumers can also benefit from fluctuations in value, and the fact that financial institutions don't control digital currencies.  The list of risks for businesses is somewhat longer: volatility means they have to use dynamic pricing, and network security is an issue. Additionally, bitcoin is not legal tender in some countries, there is no central entity backing it and processing times can be slow.  Consumers have to struggle with the complexities of buying bitcoins, cashing them out and using digital wallets. Since there are no payment reversals, they also face more risks than merchants in any disputes that may arise, it claims.  Free publicity for emerging brands  The report also found that bitcoin is a media phenomenon. The currency had 3.4 million online mentions in 2013, the equivalent of all General Motors’ brands combined. Bitcoin was the subject of 11,200 traditional media stories in 2013, and in November alone it was featured in more than 14,100 online stories. The report stated:  ""Bitcoin is not only a brand, it’s a digital ecosystem whose decentralized architecture makes it ideal for entrepreneurship. History shows that when that happens, disruption follows. With more than 1,000 brick-and-mortar businesses and 10,000-plus merchants accepting bitcoin, its early influence is taking root.""  The report also concluded that early adopters enjoy a public relations and marketing advantage. Being noted as a bitcoin innovator can lead to favourable press and social media mentions.  ""In 2014, social gaming company Zynga added bitcoin to its most popular games and garnered thousands of media mentions,"" PwC notes.  Beyond the click-and-mortar model  The report outlines a number of down-to-earth uses for bitcoin which are far from new, but it also makes a good case for monetization. Thanks to extremely low fees, bitcoin is much more than an interesting alternative to existing digital payment services. Unlike cumbersome payment systems, bitcoin can be effectively employed as a microtransaction platform, and this is where PwC sees potential.  Cryptocurrency can be used to monetize all sorts of content, from blog posts to multimillion dollar films. PwC notes that the time is ripe for bitcoin-monetized content, in addition to traditionally distributed content which can be paid for in bitcoin:  ""Bitcoin presents an opportunity for filmmakers, musicians, artists, authors, and other content creators to more easily sell their work directly to fans worldwide, bypassing a byzantine maze of country-based currencies, payment networks, gateways and distribution platforms. Given its no-chargeback model, bitcoin makes global direct selling more attractive as a hedge against credit card fraud.""  Paywalls also get a mention as the ""logical first choice"" for bitcoin deployment. Using microtransactions it is possible to devise intricate paywall systems that would allow users to purchase the content they need without a costly subscription fee.  ""Transaction fees have hindered deployment for anything sold for less than $1. In lieu of daily or monthly subscriptions, bitcoin may make it possible to charge pennies, or nickels, for a la carte content,"" the report points out.  Curated content is a growing trend, and the driving force behind many wildly popular mobile apps. Yet, bitcoin microtransactions could take it to the next level, by allowing content creators to monetize their work on just about any platform.  Downloads, gaming and gambling  The report also discusses downloads as an interesting niche for bitcoin. Digital distribution is already killing off retail sales. Video games, music and video content have already gone online and some small video gaming companies are already experimenting with bitcoin payments.  Another interesting benefit could be the use of bitcoin micropayments for in-app purchases. This would be relatively easy to incorporate into existing games and new games could be devised around bitcoin themes.  Virtual goods in RPG games or chips in poker games could easily be cashed out, or purchased. Of course, the report brings up Zynga, stating that bitcoin could improve profitability due to lower transaction costs for in-app purchases.  Casino gaming is another industry that may embrace bitcoin sooner rather than later. PwC notes that online casino startups are already accepting bitcoin, but it points out that the online casino market is estimated at $4bn to $6bn.  In addition to cheap microtransactions, bitcoin has a few other features online gamblers may find interesting – it offers a high level of user privacy and the risk of theft is relatively low, as there is no need to share credit card data with suspicious gambling sites.  Other potential uses include telecoms or mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), as bitcoin could be used to simply pay for services, or to use the telecom network as a substitute payment system, which is already being done in Africa.

42425359,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEnh,1391000488,Bitcoin Arcade Machine is 'On Like Donkey Kong',"The games room specialist that developed a bitcoin-operated pool table has released its arcade machine equivalent.  Liberty Games  , based in the UK, has developed a method of retrofitting arcade machines so that gamers can play with bitcoin rather than a bag full of metal coins.  The company's technical director Stuart Kerr said an arcade machine can be fitted with a Raspberry Pi, a simple credit-card sized computer, and other components so that gamers can send bitcoin to the machine owner's wallet. The method is similar to the one used by Liberty Games to outfit pool tables to accept bitcoin. Kerr said:  ""We love arcade machines at Liberty Games, we've been selling them for over 10 years now ... [But] I'm not sure if it's just me, but I never have any coins on me, so the idea of an arcade machine that you can pay for in bitcoin seems like a really good idea!""  Kerr said the the company's arcade technicians worked alongside bitcoin-savvy employees to develop the machine. One machine has been fitted so far, but the firm has the ability to retrofit any of the coin-accepting arcade machines it sells, including the latest cabinets from publishers like SEGA or Namco.  Cheap as microchips  Kerr said fitting an arcade machine with the bitcoin option would be a relatively cheap endeavour. An operator running its own web server (for the Raspberry Pi to communicate with the Bitcoin network) would pay less than £100. He added that it would cost slightly more if Liberty Games hosted the server.  The Liberty Games arcade machine that's currently modified to accept bitcoin is the Galaxy Cosmic II 60-in-1 model. The stand-up cabinet features two sets of joysticks with six illuminated buttons each.  The display is a 20-inch flat-screen – a departure from the bulky CRT monitors arcade machines originally sported. The Galaxy Cosmic II features 60 classic games from the golden age of the coin-op, from Atari's Centipede to BurgerTime and Pac-Man and Nintendo's Donkey Kong series. The cabinet costs £949. Kerr added:  ""There's no doubt that the people who like to play arcade games, especially the retro ones, also love their tech.""  Though rescuing Princess Peach from the nefarious Donkey Kong with bitcoin may appeal, the bitcoin-accepting arcade machine is likely to remain a novelty product for some time. At least that's the opinion of Stephen Early, founder of Individual Pubs Ltd, which owns five pubs in the UK that accept bitcoin. Early noted that his pubs did not have any arcade machines in them.  ""The fact that an arcade machine supports payment by bitcoin and cash is not going to be a big deal, really. For example, we take bitcoin over the counter at our pubs, but it's less than half a percentage point of our sales. So it's not a big deal at the moment.""  International interest  Liberty Games previously released a bitcoin-accepted pool table that ""attracted plenty of international interest"". The firm has taken two orders on the tables, although it fielded inquiries from across the globe.  ""We thought we might have a few tech-savvy pubs in the UK interested, but in reality the interest has been much more far flung than that. Bitcoin fans in South America and Asia seem really keen on the idea,"" Kerr said.  The firm is arranging to ship the tables, which can weigh up to 300kg, to international customers.  Liberty Games says it is the UK's largest supplier or pool tables, arcade machines and football (or foosball) tables. It sells more than 2,000 pool tables annually, and more than 1,000 arcade machines annually. According to Kerr, about 90% of the firm's business is in the UK.

42425358,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwElh,1390981192,Vera&John Becomes First Licensed Casino to Accept Bitcoin,"Large online casino Vera&John has become the first licensed and regulated online casino to accept bitcoin deposits.  The Malta-registered site began taking deposits from customers on Tuesday, automatically converting them to Euros which would then be paid into customers' accounts on the site. Customers making bitcoin deposits made at Vera&John will only be able to withdraw those deposits in bitcoin.  This online casino is different to the many bitcoin gaming sites that are found on online, said Johannes Klasson, an SEO consultant who has been working with Vera&John for two years, and consulted with the casino on the two-month bitcoin project.  Sites like SatoshiDice use bitcoin transactions as the basis for bets. They use the block chain, or an algorithm for proving off-blockchain bets, to prove that their bets are fair.  Instead, Vera&John is an established online casino, presenting bitcoin as way to pay for existing games on the site, rather than as a basis for new online games. Customers can make deposits in bitcoins, which are converted in real time at current Euro exchange rates. This means that the casino doesn't hold bitcoins, and isn't exposed to market risk.  A customer's account can be used to play over 200 slot games on the site. The back end software that runs the games therefore doesn't have to be adapted to work with bitcoin in any way.  Vera&John has over 100 employees. ""They have the same software providers as the land-based casinos in Vegas do,"" said Klasson. ""In order to host them, you have to be huge."" These companies include Play'n GO, Betsoft, IGT, Nextgen Gaming, Bally Technologies and Three Pigeons. He added:  ""Even SatoshiDice would get turned down if went to IGT and said, 'hey, give me your games to host on on my page'. It doesn't work like that.""  Vera&John is a EU-based casino, regulated by Malta’s Lotteries and Gaming Authority, and as such as required to provide fair bets, and are frequently audited, said Klasson. Bitcoin players will trust the online site's fairness as fiat customers would.  Gamers can win up to 5,000 BTC in a single bet, according to a statement from the firm today.  The European online casino is working with Coinapult, which Klasson says is acting as a payment processor for the bitcoin element of the casino's business.  When customers make a bitcoin deposit at Vera&John, the bitcoins are sent to Coinapult, converted into Euros and deposited into their Vera&John account.  ""Vera&John have been extremely excited to get bitcoin payments up and running,"" said a spokesperson at Coinapult, who said that the fact the bitcoins were immediately converted into Euros meant that bitcoin was being used as a payment network, rather than as a currency.  ""They understand that it's only a matter of time until other gaming operators recognize the benefits of bitcoin technology and realize the actual ease of integration.""  Vera&John does not accept business from US customers, due to the stringent anti-gambling legislation there. Coinapult's operation operates under the laws of Panama, the spokesperson said, adding that launching a lawful and compliant business relationship was particularly timely, given ""recent events and today's NYC hearings"".  ""Being able to build business relationships like these - in jurisdictions and with banks that have clear, market-friendly regulatory frameworks - is why Coinapult opted to leave the US and establish itself in Panama,"" the spokesperson concluded.

42425363,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEvh,1390979269,Vault of Satoshi Rolls Out New Altcoin Support,"Canadian digital currency exchange Vault of Satoshi will announce a plethora of new features today, including more verification options, coin-to-coin trading, and support for several new coins.  The exchange, which opened its doors in October, has eased its verification procedures, said founder Mike Curry. It previously had two verification states for customers: verified and unverified. As of today, it offers four.  The unverified status (which essentially stops you doing anything significant on the site) still exists. But requirements for its basic level of verification have dropped from two pieces of photo ID to one. You can then trade up to $9500 per week.  In addition, it has introduced an elevated level, with bill payment capabilities, allowing people to trade up to $15,000 per week in the first month, rising over time. Finally, a fourth level for ""serious"" traders (of which it has around 25) enables them to deposit and withdraw up to $100,000 per week.  It has managed to reduce its verification requirements thanks in part to a deal with Equifax, which has provided it with access to its API, to help with KYC and AML procedures.  New altcoin support  Curry also told CoinDesk that Vault of Satoshi will now be supporting several more coins, one of which is the seven week-old dogecoin. Also now on the books are namecoin, quarkcoin, feathercoin, and Sunny King's prime number-busting primecoin. These join its existing bitcoin, litecoin and peercoin portfolio.  Vault of Satoshi always planned to add support for more altcoins. It ignores those outside of the top 20 in market capitalization, said Curry. Of those inside, it tends to go by ""gut feel"" and market interest when choosing which to support.  ""It's become more than a joke, to one of the top five most important coins right now. It has some interesting attributes,"" Curry said of dogecoin, pointing to the fact that all of them are scheduled to be mined by 2015. ""We're going to be able to see what happens to a coin after its creation ends.""  Among those soon to be supported by the exchange are Marketcoin, and Nxt. However, these are taking considerably more work due to their fundamentally different architectures, he said.  Within the next two weeks, Vault of Satoshi will be introducing coin-to-coin trades, which will make it easier to trade between altcoins without having to drop back into fiat currency first.  The company, which started in Curry's basement, now has a 2000 square foot office, and ten employees. It is taking attempting to cement itself as the number two in the Canadian market behind incumbent Calgary-based exchange Virtex, and is also rolling out a Canadian order book. This will enable it to process orders directly in Canadian dollars, rather than dealing in US fiat, making life easier for Canadian traders, which make up 72% of its volume.  Finally, it is introducing basic charting facilities, which will become more sophisticated over time. It will start with a single page charting system, but will introduce charts based on other exchanges' data over time.  ""I'd like the relationship to go further than just having our competitors' names on the charts. We'd like to conduct remote trading from Vault of Satoshi"", Curry said.

Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) is a term often used in bitcoin circles to describe feelings about the prospect of regulation concerning virtual currencies, and there may be no better phrase to convey the mood at the start of the New York Department of Financial Services' (NYDFS) first day of public hearings on virtual currencies.  Following a prolonged and palpable excitement in the boardroom, an uneasy quiet took hold following the arrival of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, principals of Winklevoss Capital Management and major investors in BitInstant - the company whose CEO was arrested not 24 hours before for his association with Silk Road, the biggest online bazaar of illegal goods and services devised to date and a veritable worst nightmare for regulators.  But if fear and uncertainty were high at the onset on both sides of the aisle, what gave way after four hours of questions, answers and debates was a feeling that the immense energy and intellectual capital driving the space will persevere at the expense of virtual currency's more fringe ideological elements.  Mark T. Williams  , a professor at Boston University School of Management and upcoming panel speaker, described the comments by Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of SecondMarket; Jeremy Liew, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners; Fred Wilson, partner at Union Square Ventures; and the Winklevoss brothers as being undeniably pro-regulation.  ""The vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation [Shrem] made them realize that they’ve lost leverage, and if they want to regain that, they better be more accommodative, instead of being more adversarial. Up until now, the strategy of bitcoiners has been anti-establishment, anti-regulation, but if they want to make Bitcoin payment system to be used globally, they will need to work with regulators”  Regulation in 2014  If the assembled investors were more willing to bring controls to the ecosystem, regulators also seemed to open up to the new financial technologies, as well as the possibility of a future of banking where the speed of money transfers no longer lags behind the speed of information.  Creator of Litecoin, Charlie Lee, indicated that he was excited at how both parties were able to find this common ground over the course of the day's panels:  ""I feel they're coming in with a very open mind and they seem pretty receptive of our ideas, so I feel pretty positive about the outcome.""  Of course, while regulators as well as industry investors seem united in this common goal of continuing bitcoin's great economic experiment, discussion later turned to the admittedly massive challenge of adapting 50 to 100 year-old statutes to the needs of entrepreneurs who need to compete in a fast-moving market.  However, the NYDFS seems optimistic events like this will lead toward finding a solution, and soon. Benjamin M. Lawsky, superintendent of financial services for the State of New York, said:  ""Ultimately, it’s our expectation that the information we’ve gathered in this fact-finding effort will allow us to put forward, during the course of 2014, a proposed regulatory framework for virtual currency firms operating in New York.""  A thawing of the ice  While Lawsky began the conversation by noting that the event was ""not a congressional hearing"", an early drawing of the lines was evidenced by the hearing's first question, which directly addressed the ""cloud hanging over the industry"" following the arrest of BitInstant's Charlie Shrem. But Liew and the other witnesses moved quickly to distance themselves from Shrem and illustrate how the case could be seen positively.  ""This speaks to the satisfactory nature of existing regulatory framework,"" Liew said.    Cameron Winklevoss went further, suggesting bitcoin investors would even be welcoming to clear regulation that could prevent similar setbacks to the community.      ""The Wild West attracts cowboys. A sheriff would be good thing.""            Models of regulation emerge  Regulators spent much of both discussions focusing on how the witnesses believed bitcoin could be best regulated. Wilson took the lead on this question, noting that New York should be cognizant of how its actions could stifle innovation and push young companies to distance themselves from making themselves known to regulators:  ""Many of these new companies, are two, three, four-person companies. It will be very difficult for them to do what JP Morgan Chase does.""  Wilson went on to suggest that New York implement a permissive environment that allows entrepreneurs to test their ideas before bearing the heavy cost of compliance. This ""safe harbor"" period would allow entrepreneurs time to move through the licensing processes, but without the fear they could be shut down.  However, Daniel Alter, Lawsky's General Counsel, expressed reservations about such a permissive climate, noting that when a service involves ""sending money to terrorists,"" more serious considerations needed to be made. Lawsky said:  ""If the choice is permit money laundering on one hand, but permit innovation on the other, we're always going to choose squelching the money laundering. It's not worth it to society to allow money laundering to exist to allow 1,000 flowers to bloom from innovation.""  Speaking in the second panel on virtual currencies and regulation, Judie Rinearson, partner at Bryan Cave, suggested she too supported a safe harbor plan, drawing a comparison between bitcoin and the prepaid card industry, which in its early stages had issues limiting fraud. She added:  ""I think that's a fabulous idea, that it's worth thinking about, as long as it's not owned by fraudsters.""  Exchanges, wallets most likely targets  Panelists differed on where regulation should be enacted, but certain consensuses did emerge. For example, Lee and Rinearson both indicated that miners should not be constricted.  The best option available to regulators, the witnesses indicated, was to put a special emphasis on businesses that facilitated the transfer of virtual currency to fiat. Rinearson stated:  ""I know that I mentioned that I kind of look at virtual, digital cryptocurrencies as something that are under the water. I don't see that as the regulated part. The risk comes when you're getting out of the water, then it's time. Because as soon as you can take these currencies and exchange them for a fiat currency, the risk changes considerably.""    ""Any regulation should help to secure cryptocurrencies and the wallets used to hold them."" - Charles Lee at the New York bitcoin hearings      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 28, 2014    Investor protection was another big point of emphasis for regulators, who sought guidance on how to protect consumers from the risk of the notoriously volatile financial instruments, and whether insurance pools should be used to protect consumers from loss. Rinearson continued:  ""There are other things that these exchanges need to be investing in, and setting up this insurance pool for consumers who are investing in a volatile product, I guess I don't see that as a use of this fund.""  A united business front  Despite the bitcoin world's anti-centralization stance, what emerged at the hearing was a clear commonality in how bitcoin's primary investors are looking to move the technology forward, and indications are this will mean embracing regulation at the cost of the early ideology that propelled the market to where it is today. Liew said:  ""The market of radical libertarians is not very big, the market for criminals is not very big.""  Liew also talked about what he called ""a change in character of the people being involved in bitcoin"", noting that bitcoin is ""moving in the direction of greater legitimacy"" and today's bitcoin businesses, like the Bitcoin Foundation, are attracting very different types of users.  Perhaps most vocal was Wilson, who laid out his five stages of bitcoin adoption. The first phase being defined by an ""open source, geek, nerdy, crypto-libertarian kind of thing""; second being the vice phase; and the third and current phase defined by price speculation.  The promise of bitcoin  The coming stages, of bitcoin mass adoption, were also given ample play, as the gathered investors attempted to get regulators to see the larger benefits that could come from a financial system built on top of bitcoin's infrastructure.  In comments, witnesses were keen to put the emphasis on the unknown advances that may be waiting around the corner, while stoking fears that too much action could inhibit job growth and push innovation overseas at a time when the US is still fighting high unemployment.    ""We're trying to create a world where transactions can move globally for free. We need to put the compliance into the code."" - @fredwilson      — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 28, 2014    He also hinted at what the benefits of this change would bring to New York, saying that the next stock exchange and the next Ticketmaster will be built on top of bitcoin, and that a large bitcoin exchange could even find its home in New York given the right actions from regulators.
