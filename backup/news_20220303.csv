And sign up for First Mover, our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $42,528 -3.2%  Ether (ETH): $2,839 -3.8%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Cosmos ATOM +4.8% Smart Contract Platform Internet Computer ICP +3.0% Computing Ethereum Classic ETC +2.2% Smart Contract Platform  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Solana SOL −5.3% Smart Contract Platform Ethereum ETH −4.1% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA −3.7% Smart Contract Platform  Bitcoin and other major cryptos declined on a dark Thursday in Ukraine.  At the time of publication, bitcoin was trading at about $42,500, down more than 3% over the previous 24 hours. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was changing hands at about $2,800, down roughly 4% over the same period. Most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap were in the red.  Russian forces captured Kherson, a port city of about 300,000 in the southern part of Ukraine and a shipbuilding hub, and continued to grab huge swathes of the region with its access to the Black Sea. Rocket fire and cluster bombs barraged Ukraine's largest cities, and more than one million people have fled the now war-torn country, including foreign students and workers from Asia.  Meanwhile, the Biden administration requested $10 billion in humanitarian and defense aid for Ukraine nd imposed new sanctions on Russia as crypto and other donations poured into Ukraine. The attack on a sovereign country has put a spotlight on crypto's potential as a way to conduct transactions outside of traditional financial services networks.  Earlier this week, investors viewed this development optimistically. But momentum has faded as investors shied away from riskier assets over the past two days.  ""Bitcoin’s rally is starting to show signs of exhaustion,"" wrote Oanda senior market analyst Edward Moya in an email. ""Bitcoin needs risk appetite to be healthy for prices to make a run above the $50,000 level, so it should come as no surprise if prices consolidate around the $40,000 level.""  Markets  S&P 500: 4,363 -0.5%  DJIA: 33,794 -0.2%  Nasdaq: 13,537 -1.5%  Gold: $1,936 +0.4%  Insights  China Ratchets Up Testing of Digital Yuan; India to Tweak Definition of Crypto  An expansionist China, arguably an even greater challenger than Russia to the U.S-led rules-based order, “will soon approve a third batch of localities set to launch trials of its digital yuan currency,” according to Reuters, which cited state-backed financial outlet Securities Times. The report says that “a number of cities and regions have applied to authorities for permission to test the digital yuan,” including the cities of Guangzhou, Chongqing, Fuzhou and Xiamen.  Meanwhile, according to a report in the South China Morning Post, analysts said that ""Western sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, including exclusion from the SWIFT financial messaging system, could offer new development opportunities for China’s digital currency and its home-grown yuan cross-border payment system.""  One analyst wrote, “It is necessary and urgent to vigorously promote yuan internationalization, especially the development of the CIPS system (Cross-Border Interbank Payment System set up to boost international use of China’s currency in trade settlements) and the digital yuan.”  China’s crypto narrative, though, appears to be focused on its central bank digital currency, or e-yuan. A note by the Financial Stability Bureau of the Chinese central bank revealed that China’s share in bitcoin transactions has declined 80 percentage points after the government's crackdown.  “The global share of Bitcoin transactions in China has dropped rapidly from more than 90% to 10%,"" the note said.  China’s crypto narrative appears to be accelerating again just as Ukraine generated a high level of crypto adoption excitement by announcing an airdrop for donations, a first by a country. It had to be canceled after it became apparent that a third party may have been spoofing the much-anticipated event.  Instead, Ukraine will announce NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to support Ukrainian Armed Forces soon, according to Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation.  ***  India, the world’s largest democracy, may make its tax policy clearer by tweaking the definition of crypto or virtual digital assets. According to a report by CNBC TV-18, the Indian government is likely to tweak the definition to clarify that only cryptocurrencies, crypto tokens, NFTs and vouchers fall under the definition of virtual digital assets, but not other categories such as Demat shares, credit card points, frequent flier points, e-vouchers, cash bank points, etc. The government will also include a detailed FAQ to explain the definition, according to the report.  ***  And while the world has its eyes on the U.S. Federal Reserve and its plans to combat inflation, the debate around how inflation will affect cryptocurrencies remains active.  Adding to the conversation, Bill Gross, the ""bond king"" who co-founded the Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO), said he sees the possibility of stagflation and he wouldn't buy stocks aggressively now, according to CNBC.  However, Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CNBC “we are not in stagflation yet.”  Stagflation takes place when stagnant economic growth, high unemployment and high inflation occur concurrently.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Takes a Breather; Support at $37K-$40K  On Thursday, bitcoin extended its pullback from the $45,000 resistance level, although initial support at $40,000 could stabilize the down move.  Buyers will need to keep BTC above the $37,000 breakout level to sustain the recovery phase. Further, if momentum builds, a decisive move above $46,000 could yield further upside targets toward $50,000.  Intraday charts are showing initial signs of downside exhaustion, which could encourage short-term buying into the Asian trading day.

The facility will be on line by 2024 and will be powered by 100% clean energy sources, the miner said in a statement on Thursday.

In September, Genesis raised $431 million to expand its bitcoin mining operations in North America and the Nordic region in a funding round that was led by Paradigm Ventures. That was on top of the $125 million the miner raised in July in a funding round that was led by Kingsway Capital.

42421652,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotX3,1646349018,Monetary Weapons: 4 Lessons from Canada and Russia,"Just when fear of the latest COVID-19 variant was waning and long-term planning was starting to seem possible again, February brought unsettling episodes that shattered dreams of lasting peace and normality. Money played a crucial part in these episodes.  In Canada, we saw a Liberal government invoking for the first time the federal Emergencies Act, enacted in 1988, to end disruptions caused by protestors blocking borders and streets with trucks. Among other measures, the government ordered banks, financial institutions and even crypto exchanges to freeze personal and corporate accounts suspected of sending contributions to protestors, eliminating the need to obtain a court order and the risk of later being sued for abuse.  Marcelo M. Prates, a CoinDesk columnist, is a lawyer and researcher helping shape the future of money and payments.  It didn’t matter whether you were transferring C$10 (US$7.89) or C$100,000 or paying for legitimate services provided a week ago: Send money to a targeted account and yours might end up frozen, too. A democratic government indiscriminately depriving its citizens of money as a sanction for supporting a protest shouldn’t be taken lightly – even after the emergency declaration was revoked. But this action paled in comparison to what was about to happen.  In the last weekend of February, reacting to a dreadful invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and the European Union, among others, decided to impose sanctions on Russia. By executive order, political leaders decided to prevent the Russian central bank from using hundreds of billions of dollars of its international reserves – an unprecedented move in its breadth and intensity.  These reserves are safe and liquid assets denominated in foreign currencies, usually U.S. Treasury bonds, that a central bank keeps deposited around the world to support its country’s international transactions. Without international reserves, neither the government nor the private sector can import goods or services, from software and clothing to much-needed medicine and consumer goods that aren’t produced locally.  Read More: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post-Dollar Planet  Cutting a country’s access to its international reserves amounts to unplugging it from the rest of the world: The longer the sanction lasts, the more isolated the country becomes and the scarcer essential goods and services get. It’s an extreme measure that affects all citizens, no matter their political preferences.  Not your money  It’s still early to understand all the implications of these episodes, but some lessons can start to be drawn. First, and perhaps most sobering, money is a weapon that can be used both against fellow citizens and despicable enemies.  As a weapon, money needs better governance. We have to think harder about the powers a money issuer, public or private, has. Should money issuers, from states to stablecoin creators, be able to restrict access to the money we legitimately hold? Under which circumstances?  Read More: Bitcoin Is 'Armageddon Insurance'? | The Node  This concern grows stronger when we realize digital money is the money that matters most. The long lines outside ATMs in Russia and Ukraine are a reminder that banknotes and coins aren’t always available. Unless you have your mattress permanently stuffed with cash, you’ll run out of it in no time when times are tough.  In the end, we don’t really “hold” the bulk of our money. It’s held for us, somewhere in a computer that can be blocked, hacked or stolen. The technological and institutional protections around this computer represent the thin line that separates monetary order from chaos – and this is true for all digital currencies, from bank deposits and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) to stablecoins and crypto.  Privacy  Second lesson: Monetary anonymity is a fallacy, not a solution. Against the Canadian background, it’s easy to argue that anonymous money would be the way to go. Wrong. Anonymous money in these circumstances would only give authorities more reasons to broaden their intervention and issue blanket bans.  That doesn’t mean we need fully transparent money to satiate the desires of a surveillance state. It means money transactions should run on a system of partial identification and protected identity, following David Birch’s ideas. If a decentralized pseudonymous bitcoin (BTC) type of coin seems too far-fetched for any sovereign currency, a decentralized pseudonymous identity should be allowed in money transactions.  Instead of providing your tax identification number and your personal details to open a bank account, for example, you’d digitally send the bank a code generated by a decentralized database holding the details of your identity. Every time you needed to prove your identity or a personal detail (like your age, nationality or monthly income), the decentralized database would authenticate your access and release the required information.  But only under certain conditions (say, a court order) would the database disclose your full identity.  A better alternative  Third, cryptocurrencies can offer a way out for those being attacked and also for regular people who disagree with the actions taken by their tyrannical government. Think about a Russian family who doesn’t feel safe in Russia anymore or simply doesn’t want to pay the price for the government’s lunacy. If they hold at least part of their savings in crypto, they have a chance of escape.  Sure, crypto can be volatile and isn’t widely accepted or easily used for everyday payments. But try fleeing a country at war with gold in a suitcase or making payments with rubles in a couple of weeks if this tragedy lingers. In these cases, crypto has only to be better than the alternatives – and it is.  See also: Into the Money-verse: Central Banks Under Siege in 2028  Money for enemies  Finally, cryptocurrencies proved they can be valuable also for sovereign governments. The Ukrainian government asked for – and received – financial support via crypto donations. If crypto can provide some relief to a country being brutally attacked by a powerful neighbor, its social value becomes indisputable: it can be used against criminals.  More than that. As the freezing of the Russian international reserves raises doubts about how safe and liquid these reserves ultimately are, central banks might have started pondering if the time to add cryptocurrencies to their reserves’ portfolio has arrived.  Between securities controlled by foreign governments and cumbersome gold bars, crypto could end up offering a reasonable option.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Marcelo M.

The startup told CoinDesk it will invest its $17.2 million funding round into creating a decentralized alternative to arweave.net, a critical (but at present centralized) gateway for uploading files to Arweave’s on-chain hard drive, the “permaweb.”  “Gateways are kind of like the front door to the permaweb,” said Phil Mataras, ArDrive’s founder. “That’s where all the apps connect to, to push data up, to query for it, to send a transaction from your wallet to another – it’s all going through the gateway.”  Almost all of the data on Arweave has entered via the core team’s original gateway service, Mataras said. AR.IO, the planned decentralized network, could change that by allowing anyone with the know-how and about one MacBook Pro’s worth of spare computing power to host their own gateway.  Read more: Why Crypto Networks Should Preserve Russian Propaganda  Arweave is one of the handful of blockchain-based services working to popularize decentralized file storage. Those services are tiny compared with cloud giants like Amazon Web Services but are growing fast, with Arweave, Fliecoin, Akash and Storj all offering low-fee file storage that can't be censored.  Arweave has more than 1,000 nodes, 150,000 users and 157 million files, Arweave co-founder Sam Williams said through a spokesperson. The network is adding about 1.5 million files a day, he said.  ArDrive’s Mataras said more interfaces are needed.  “We feel that in order for data to really be permanent, access to it also has to be as permanent as possible. And that requires a decentralized network with great incentives to ensure it’s not just about getting data in, but out,” he said.  The AR.IO token will play a big role in that incentive structure. It will be issued via a SmartWeave smart contract, similar to ArDrive’s own token but minus that token’s profit-sharing mechanisms. It will have some degree of governance powers over an eventual decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Mataras said.  But the token’s core function will be as a form of gateway collateral. Operators will stake AR.IO tokens against the balance of their users to prove their commitment to the network. As with other staking-based consensus mechanisms, naughty operators risk their collateral being slashed.

The tech-spec barrier to entry is designed to be low but Mataras said “we’re prepared” for any entity that might rather run “big, scalable gateway hardware” to take that route, too.  It’s all still very much in development. The central gateway’s code went open source only a few weeks ago. And the AR.IO testnet will go live later this year. If all goes well, the network could launch by 2023.  That said, it has already attracted the interest of Arweave’s core team. They co-led ArDrive’s $17.2 million funding round alongside Blockchain Capital and Sino Global Capital. After receiving the fresh capital, ArDrive is worth $63 million, according to Mataras.  “ArDrive’s mission is to get permanent storage in the hands of everyone and we need this new infrastructure to really accomplish that,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | AR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/03/ardrive-raises-17m-to-make-arweaves-data-storage-blockchain-more-usable,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9ee5f4778725824e59090d5bbbbcbe08b560019-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375208,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6K7p,1646345131,Why Charles Schwab Is Prepping Its First Crypto Product,"Schwab Asset Management is preparing to offer its first in-house crypto product to its 33 million clients: the “Schwab Crypto Economy ETF” – a vehicle that tracks equities engaged in the world of digital assets.  An incomplete prospectus filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Charles Schwab’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) would invest in “stocks that are included in the Schwab Crypto Economy Index.” Miners, exchanges, blockchain developers and other crypto companies will comprise that yet-to-be-formed index, the filing said.  In short, the planned ETF would offer Schwab’s massive client base tailored (and non-controversial from a regulatory standpoint) exposure to the crypto economy, though not to any coins.  It would be the first to do so carrying the Schwab brand and name, a representative confirmed.  Schwab (SCHW) joins BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity and other financial institutions that have gradually warmed to the booming crypto markets.  “The reason they’re doing it is that all of their customers are asking them how they can get exposure to crypto,” Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan told CoinDesk, calling it a “milestone.”  “A crypto equity product – it’s the first step. It’s the crawl in the ‘crawl, walk, run,’” he said. (Bitwise launched a similar ETF last May.)  Indeed, Schwab’s own client base is becoming ever more interested in crypto investments opportunities, according to the firm’s own research. Twenty percent of respondents to Schwab’s most recent retail client sentiment survey said they’d invested in crypto in the last three months; 16% said they planned to do so again in the following three.  That’s a marked uptick from 12 months prior, when 10% and 7% of respondents, respectively, said the same.  Clients’ ability to do so through Schwab has thus far been limited to third-party products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a representative said. (Both CoinDesk and Grayscale are owned by crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group.) Clients approved for futures trading can trade bitcoin futures, too, Schwab said.  Focused on equities instead of coins, Schwab’s ETF avoids the regulatory quagmire ensnaring spot products like a bitcoin ETF. But it’s not going to be trading on NYSE just yet. Schwab still needs to find an indexing partner to build the product’s backbone.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/03/why-charles-schwab-is-prepping-its-first-crypto-product,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d820c2cc33b8dc522fe68cf6b3ffe0d9776e4006-6000x3978.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian diplomats ended on Thursday without an agreement. The impasse kept markets on edge, contributing to gains in traditional safe-haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar.  In crypto markets, the correction over the past month appears to be stabilizing as bearish sentiment wanes. Some analysts remain optimistic due to persistent long-term demand, especially for bitcoin.  ""A larger proportion of investors are becoming long-term holders, which is beneficial for price appreciation as it is clear that more investors are seeking higher prices to sell,"" Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at the U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  ""Crypto adoption globally continues to soar and aligns with the thesis that we are in an accumulation phase,"" Sotiriou wrote.

42421662,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotdF,1646341961,"‘Crack Down’ on Crypto? Maybe, but You Can’t Ban Math","In recent days, following the invasion of Ukraine and the West’s disabling economic sanction of Russia – an unprecedented retaliatory move – there has been increased chatter that governments and international bodies may step up efforts to “crack down” on cryptocurrency.  Like most everything involving cryptocurrency, this conversation is speculative. The argument is that non-state, blockchain-based monetary networks might help the Russian government and oligarchs evade sanctions; and so, if the West’s economic blockade is to be effective, it needs to tighten access to crypto.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  This fear is partially grounded in fact. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, tweeted last week, “Cryptocurrencies risk undermining sanctions against Russia, allowing Putin and his cronies to evade economic pain. … U.S. financial regulators need to take this threat seriously and increase their scrutiny of digital assets.” The Massachusetts Democrat renewed her call to action today.  Likewise, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the ongoing war “underscores” the need for cryptocurrency regulation. European power brokers have voiced similar concerns. French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said: “We are taking measures, in particular on cryptocurrencies or crypto assets, which should not be used to circumvent the financial sanctions decided upon by the 27 EU countries.”  Still, the fear that crypto could be banned is mostly rooted in uncertainty and doubt. It’s worth noting that calls to “crack down” on the industry, a common phrase, are imprecise. What would a “crackdown” look like over and above the rules to increase surveillance and compliance already being discussed or enforced today?  It’s true too that Powell, Warren and their ilk are also being fairly cryptic in their calls for increased “scrutiny” of and “measures” over crypto. That could mean anything – hence the fear, uncertainty and doubt. But it cannot seriously mean a blanket ban of blockchains.  You can’t ban math  Around the time of the fall of the Soviet Union, the U.S. was leading a battle to kill consumer encryption. For most of history, encryption – the ciphers used to send secret messages – was primarily developed and guarded by governments. Various militaries are credited with creating the first paper codices and first digital cryptographies to protect war correspondence. At the height of the Cold War, the U.S. placed strict controls over the export of commercial and military encryption.  This changed with the advent of the internet. Early cypherpunks saw that computer networks could easily be surveilled and worked to design codes to foster privacy. That was the environment in which, in 1991, computer scientist Phil Zimmermann released the public-key program humbly named Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and kickstarted the “Crypto Wars.”  The United States Customs Service alleged that Zimmermann had violated the Arms Export Control Act that forbade the export of “strong” cryptography and opened a criminal investigation. Around the same time, the Clinton administration tried to legally force companies to write in backdoors into commercial encryption technologies, called “clipper chips.”  Due to a confluence of factors, including PGP’s wide adoption and MIT publishing its code as “open source,” regulators were essentially forced to drop the case. More importantly, privacy advocates made the case that code was math, and that math was speech. Suppressing encryption would be unconstitutional – the cat was out of the bag.  “We won in the courts, Congress and public opinion,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation, one of the leading organizations advocating for strong encryption, later wrote.  That hasn’t necessarily stopped governments from trying to quash a host of industries based on encryption and supercharged by the internet. These include attempts to “crack down” on facial recognition, artificial intelligence and private communication through end-to-end encryption – although strict regulation or bans of those industries might be desirable (considering their dystopian prospects).  Encryption likewise serves as the basis for cryptocurrencies (that’s the “crypto” part; I think we’re still figuring out what “currency” means). It sounds “just so,” but that’s essentially the reason that an outright ban of bitcoin (BTC) or ethereum (ETH) is unlikely.  See also: Bitcoiners Were Right: Weaponized Finance Just Created a Post-Dollar Planet  Not only is there legal and constitutional precedent, but knowledge has flooded the plain. (Imagine trying to ban a recipe for cookies.) PGP wasn’t nearly as widespread as Bitcoin software is today.  Regulated channels  Still, even if cryptocurrencies are open source, open access and protected by speech laws at the command-line level, most consumers access crypto through intermediaries. These on-ramps can and ought to be regulated – and should be part of sanctions packages against Russia.  Indeed, they are. As part of the “Russian Harmful Foreign Activities Sanctions Regulations,” the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is set to issue new rules to prevent people from interacting with prohibited Russian entities. This means that crypto exchanges and service providers will blacklist any assets believed to be owned by a targeted group of Russians.  Salman Banaei, Chainalysis' head of public policy for North America, said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that there are about 100 wallet addresses identified in OFAC’s sanctions package.  Although there are calls, including from the Ukrainian government, to issue a blanket ban to prevent all or most Russians from accessing crypto networks, such rules have yet to be written.  Further, major exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Coinbase say that denying access across all of Russia is a line they will not cross, though they will comply with targeted sanctions.  “[Kraken] cannot freeze the accounts of our Russian clients without a legal requirement to do so,” Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said over Twitter.  “Our mission at [Kraken] is to bridge individual humans out of the legacy financial system and bring them into the world of crypto, where arbitrary lines on maps no longer matter, where they don't have to worry about being caught in broad, indiscriminate wealth confiscation.”  Is a ‘crackdown’ necessary?  Although many people are speculating that crypto could be a powerful tool for people to breach economic sanctions, so far in the conflict, that has yet to bear out.  Banaei didn’t have detailed information related to suspected and sanctioned addresses belonging to Russian oligarchs, but said, “Our data does show that the ability of those sanctioned wallet addresses to seek liquidity has been seriously hampered as a function of sanctions.”  There are a few reasons why crypto is less than ideal for evading sanctions – try as criminals might. First, all transactions are publicly viewable, irreversible and leave a trail of evidence for investigators to snoop out a purported crime. This was the argument Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal made a few weeks ago when calling for Bitcoin to be made “better for money-laundering.”  A few days ago, ex-bitcoiner Nassim Taleb similarly said he “hopes Sanction Evaders use bitcoin,” because it's so easy to track – barring some types of transactions like CoinJoins, which are not widely adopted and may be compromised. Unlike gold, which can be melted down to anonymize who bought or sold the asset, Bitcoin is a public ledger with a clear view on “entry and exit points.”  The worst Russian actors are skilled in plundering their country’s wealth and hiding the proceeds. Their wealth is in gems, gold and yachts. Less and less it’s in dollars, but that’s not to say there isn’t fraud committed with greenbacks. “Russians are very familiar with the traditional tools available to money launderers and the traditional banking system,” Banaei said.  Politico reported last week that “Treasury officials say they aren’t overly worried about crypto undermining the effort to choke off the Kremlin’s access to capital.” That’s in part because there are already strong tools to track where money flows on blockchains – even if obscured through mixers or complicated swaps, Banaei said.  But there’s also growing evidence to suggest that current crypto networks are incapable of handling the amount of money that Russians would need to wash to evade sanctions without giving up the game, Banaei said, “given some of the structural features of cryptocurrency.”  “The order of magnitude of liquidity that would be flowing into the cryptocurrency markets would be detectable,” he said.  Credibly neutral  All of this unfolds as Ukraine’s government raises millions of dollars’ worth of dog tokens, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to fund its resistance efforts and support civilians affected by the war.  Just a border crossing away, many Russians stand opposed to their government’s unjust actions. Those people, suffering at the hand of Putin’s war, who may have lost their savings with the ruble’s collapse, whose businesses may have been hurt by sanctions, could turn to crypto as a “safe haven.”  In the months leading up to the Ukrainian invasion, Russia’s central bank pushed to “ban” cryptocurrency in the country – perhaps as part of the government’s war planning. Legislatures pushed back on those plans, preferring to monitor the industry through regulated on-ramps. Putin has since enforced strict capital flight controls, which include rules for digital assets.  See also: Putin Is Temporarily Banning Foreigners From Pulling Money  Circling back to “cracking down” on crypto in the U.S., crypto lawyer Jason Gottleib responded to Elizabeth Warren’s ambiguous criticism of this industry by noting how an “indiscriminate ban” would affect more than just the worst humanity has to offer.  “Fundamentally, crypto frees people from corrupt, evil, or incompetent intermediaries who can cancel their money at any time. It puts financial power back into the hands of individuals, and out of the hands of the elites and banks,” he wrote.  It’s a simple calculus – let’s hope they don’t try to ban calculus, either.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/03/03/crack-down-on-crypto-maybe-but-you-cant-ban-math,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b297992436c5dc003056a5a243975cf2cff5fe9d-2400x1566.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375194,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw6Jtz,1646338149,Bitcoin Analysts Ponder Impact as Oil at Highest Price Since 2008,"Bitcoin (BTC) is an inflation hedge, right? That's what a lot of crypto analysts say. So, theoretically, the bitcoin market would get a boost as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sends crude oil to its highest price since 2008.  But it's not that simple. High oil prices might give the Federal Reserve an extra reason to worry about inflation, and that might keep pressure on the U.S. central bank to tighten monetary policy from the current, ultra-loose conditions.  In recent months, bitcoin has been falling in response to hawkish announcements from the Fed – seemingly in sync with stocks.  A question some crypto analysts are starting to ask is if bitcoin might decouple from stocks and start to trade more like a safe haven asset, similar to gold – that is, an asset whose price might benefit or even just hold its value when stocks are selling off.  ""I’m wondering if bitcoin is starting to show the first signs of maturity as a safe haven,” said Jason Deane, analyst at Quantum Economics. “If so, this could, theoretically, become a positive outcome for the asset.”  Bitcoin is having its best week so far in 2022; the cryptocurrency is up 12% since Feb. 27. The latest rally pushed bitcoin into the $40,000s after news of the invasion initially sent the price down to the $30,000s. As of press time, the bitcoin price was just under $43,000.  Crude oil prices  Oil prices rose earlier Thursday to their highest point since 2008, with the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude hitting $116.57 a barrel at one point during the trading session.  A concern expressed by a growing number of economists is that the higher oil prices might drive up prices for motorists at the pump, and also possibly push up costs for manufacturers and the transportation industry. Such a dynamic could exacerbate inflation, which is already at its highest in four decades.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday in an address before the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee that he expects the central bank to raise rates 0.25 percentage point at its next regularly scheduled meeting later this month.  Powell cited high inflation, a tight labor market and strong economic demand as reasons why the Fed needs to start tightening monetary policy.  He didn't directly address oil in his comments Wednesday. He is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.  “We think the Russia-Ukraine war will intensify global and U.S. inflation pressures by pushing up oil and gas prices,” Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch, told CoinDesk in an email.  Coulton says that while many economists focus on ""core"" inflation, which excludes the impact of volatile food and energy prices, repeated ""shocks"" from oil prices could become a problem.  “Headline inflation shocks matter if they keep on coming,” Coulton said.  The entire debate stems from the fact that so far in 2022, bitcoin hasn’t performed as the hedge against inflation that many traders had expected.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down 8% year to date as data readings on consumer prices have continually surprised economists on the upside. There's even been talk of possible ""stagflation,"" where inflation is high but economic growth is negligible to nonexistent.  Traders have shown they're more comfortable putting cash into gold, which has thus far outperformed bitcoin year to date. That's been a knock on bitcoin's performance.  “For crypto, the volatility and regulatory uncertainty and unpredictable swings are hurting the efficacy against inflation, oil or economic weakness,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Brian Evans,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/03/bitcoin-analysts-ponder-impact-as-oil-at-highest-price-since-2008,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4185ca45cb12badfc80e60d37ffa2cf3023c5d8c-5616x3744.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

What About Bitcoin Mining?,"Intel played a big role in President Biden &apos;s State of the Union address. He highlighted the company&apos;s plan to manufacture semiconductor chips in Ohio, and said, &apos;Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America.&apos; Was he secretly approving Intel&apos;s plan to produce ASIC bitcoin miners? Or did he not know that those semiconductors are an integral part of those machines? Make no mistake, semiconductor chips or integrated circuits are an integral part of almost every technological device around you. And Intel is a huge company with many products and many clients. Those semiconductors Intel is planning to produce will go everywhere. However, there&apos;s no denying that ASICs are a big part of the company&apos;s future plans.

The firm also used Lido to stake an undisclosed portion of a16z Crypto’s ether holdings on the Beacon Chain.  The Ethereum blockchain plans to switch this summer from its current proof-of-work validation system to PoS, which is more energy efficient and lets users validate network transactions through temporary token deposits (or staking) in exchange for rewards.  Ethereum needs to encourage ether holders to stake their tokens or a secure PoS transition won’t be possible, which is where Lido Finance comes in.  “Lido solves the competitive incentives between staking and seeking yield in DeFi. By issuing an Ethereum-native liquid token, Lido allows you to use staked ETH as collateral within DeFi in the same way you can use ETH currently,” wrote a16z Crypto’s Daren Matsuoka and Porter Smith in the announcement post.  Last summer, a16z launched a $2.2 billion crypto fund that was the largest ever for the industry until Paradigm announced a $2.5 billion fund in November.

Without compromising decentralization, it is challenging for a blockchain to have such a high-speed transaction capacity. Solana has accomplished an impressive transaction per second capacity without compromising decentralization much. It is an open-source project that is a new permissionless and high-performance blockchain. The Solana Foundation manages the open-source project, situated in Geneva, Switzerland. It is the high-speed layer one blockchain, with a max capacity of 65,000 transactions per second. It has a transaction finality of around 13 seconds. How does Solana work? Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH) are used by Solana Network to process its transactions efficiently with high speed. PoH is a simple method for validating all the transactions without communicating with other nodes. PoS is also used for validating transactions, for this, you have to stake your token. PoH is based on a simple method. It assigns a leader position randomly to a particular node after every new block creation. Any node which is the leader node must generate the whole proof of history statement. After being given the responsibility, the leader node coordinates with other nodes to construct a proof of history statement. The leader node also pushes the currently executed ...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | SOL,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/solana-review-high-speed-layer-1-blockchain/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Multiple users took to Twitter with screenshots showing their account history had been deleted, and users who manage verified collections have reported those collections have been removed.  “OpenSea blocks users and territories on the U.S. sanctions list from using our services, including buying, selling, or transferring NFTs on OpenSea,” a representative of the marketplace told CoinDesk in a statement. “If we find individuals to be in violation of our sanctions policy, we take swift action to ban the associated accounts.”  The U.S. sanctions in question are against the Iranian government, which prevent U.S. companies from providing goods or services to any user based in Iran. OpenSea is a U.S. company headquartered in New York and incorporated in Delaware.  Policymakers have taken a renewed interest in crypto companies' compliance with sanctions amid the Russia-Ukraine war. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) asked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell about that during a Senate committee hearing Thursday, asking whether crypto could be used to undermine sanctions.  ""Chair Powell, obviously you do not administer sanctions, but you are an expert on the international financial system. Are other countries currently using cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions? I'm thinking here of North Korea, Iran, Venezuela,"" she said.  Powell said he's ""read that those things happen.""  This isn’t the first time the cryptocurrency industry has gone up against a gray area of sanctions laws – Ethereum software company ConsenSys unexpectedly barred a group of Iranian students from its coding academy back in November citing similar restrictions.

Over recent years, leaks and hacks on centralized servers have become almost an everyday occurrence - and it&apos;s getting worse. Once the pandemic hit, the sudden shift to working from home created multiple new attack vectors. The pressure on hospitals and healthcare systems made them particularly vulnerable, with cybersecurity breaches up by ten percent in 2021. Then there&apos;s the challenge of data harvesting and surveillance - a shadow we&apos;ve all had to live with since the Snowden revelations in 2014. Legislation like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aims to address this imbalance, but in reality, it simply ends up in long, drawn-out legal battles. The latest twist in a GDPR dispute between the EU and Meta Platforms is that the firm has threatened to pull Facebook and Instagram entirely - hardly a desirable outcome for millions of users. Furthermore, there&apos;s a severe lack of transparency with how data is used across the board. Once we hand over our data to a third party, we have no way of knowing how it may be passed on, sold, transferred, or otherwise misused. Is Blockchain the Answer? Blockchain is purported to offer a solution to many of these problems, and it&apos;s true that from the individual perspective, there&apos;s plenty of promise.

Two key pieces of the Ethereum ecosystem – MetaMask and Infura – moved to restrict access to users in “certain areas” amid an industry-wide focus on the risk cryptocurrencies pose for evading international sanctions.  “MetaMask and Infura are unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance,” the ConsenSys-controlled crypto wallet and infrastructure provider, respectively, said in a joint blog post time-stamped around 11:00 a.m. ET Thursday. Users from those areas would get an error message, the blog post said.  The post was later updated to say:  “By default, MetaMask accesses the blockchain via Infura, which is unavailable in certain jurisdictions due to legal compliance.”  The post did not state what “certain jurisdictions” were covered. Some Venezuela-based users were reporting service interruptions, although CoinDesk could not independently confirm this.  A ConsenSys representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  After the initial publication of this article, Infura said in a series of tweets that the restrictions were intended but made too broad through a technical error.  “In changing some configurations as a result of the new sanctions directives from the United States and other jurisdictions, we mistakenly configured the settings more broadly than they needed to be,” the project’s official Twitter handle said. “This was our oversight, and we are grateful that it was pointed out to us.

The two-month-old company has $2.5 million in pre-seed funding to spend on building better communication rails for crypto projects and wallets. Initially focused on the Solana and Terra ecosystems, Notifi’s ultimate goal is to improve everything from push notifications to direct messages across the crypto world, said CEO Paul Kim.  “We’re trying to help manage that upcoming explosion of people pushing messages to you,” he said. He described an ugly future awash in Web 3 notifications: for on-chain transactions confirming, for promotions upcoming, for direct messages, for governance votes – “a boatload of messages spamming you non-stop.”  “We want to get ahead of that,” he said. “We want to create the infrastructure as well as the in-application experience so that we can help give that power back to you. Otherwise, you’re just gonna be inundated.”  A growing number of crypto teams are making similar plays.

Kim said the “insane amount of liquidations” triggered by end-of-year volatility inspired him to start Notifi.  “We want to make sure that you – a degen in DeFi – monitor, manage and operate your positions as best as you can,” Kim said, referring to decentralized finance.  He also mentioned governance and gaming as two Web 3 areas where a robust notifications system could improve participants’ experience.  Any project, regardless of chain, would be able to utilize Notifi’s developer tools once it is fully live, Kim said.  The project website notes Solana and Terra as two ecosystems of initial focus.

42395925,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzzx3,1646325954,Avalanche Users Can Now Buy Polygon or BSC Assets in a Single Transaction,"Cross-chain messaging system Router Protocol has integrated Avalanche network’s C-Chain to enable communication between Avalanche and other supported blockchains, such as Polygon and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  The integration gives users the ability to buy digital assets on Polygon or BSC in a single transaction without leaving the Avalanche network. Cross-chain services allow users to transfer data between different blockchains, which otherwise do not interact with each other.  Router previously raised nearly $4.1 million in a strategic funding round that saw participation from Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of crypto exchange Coinbase, and influential crypto fund QCP Capital.  C-Chain, short for Contract Chain, is one of the three chains built into Avalanche. The others are Exchange Chain (X-Chain) and Platform Chain (P-Chain). All are validated and secured by a single primary network.  X-Chain is intended to allow users to create and exchange assets; P-Chain allows for the creation of smaller networks called “subnets;” C-Chain allows developers to deploy smart contracts, which in turn allow the creation of Avalanche-based products and services.  Some benefits to users include low-fee transfer of native assets, such as on Avalanche’s AVAX and Polygon’s MATIC directly without relying on third parties or having to use centralized crypto exchanges. Settlement for most transactions is expected to be less than one minute, the company said Thursday.  Router will automatically match trades between decentralized exchanges (DEX) on supported blockchains to look for the cheapest rates. This means if users want to swap from AVAX to MATIC, Router will check both Trader Joe and Pangolin, two Avalanche-based DEXs, and conduct the trade on whichever has the lower fee.  Ramani Ramachandran, a co-founder of Router Protocol, said such products allow the broader industry to reach a “multi-blockchain” future in which products and services run on several interconnected networks instead of a single, dominant blockchain.  “As blockchain ecosystems continue to grow, they are becoming increasingly siloed and unconnected from each other, preventing the industry from reaching its full potential,” he said in the statement.  A forthcoming software developer kit from Router Protocol will allow developers to build cross-chain applications that can interact with multiple chains.",POSITIVE,AVAX | MATIC,AVAX | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/03/avalanche-users-can-now-buy-polygon-or-bsc-assets-in-a-single-transaction,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dc86b18ad16eb5dd0dd25e9bc259094813c9ef43-6720x4480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The facility is expected to become fully operational with the additional 150 MW online in the third quarter of this year, the miner said in a statement on Thursday.  Previously Mawson said the facility would have 100MW of power capacity by early Q1.  Mawson cracked 1 EH/s mining power in January and said it expects its hashrate to be around 1.35 EH/s by the end of February, which would bring the miner’s share of mining power closer to 1% of total Bitcoin network’s hashrate. Total Bitcoin network hashrate was about 189 EH/s as of March 2, according to data analytics firm Glassnode.  The Sandersville facility mainly uses nuclear and hydro energy sources, the miner said. Mawson also intends to use Carbon Credits and Renewable Energy Credits at the facility to ensure the miner’s goal of being 100% net carbon-neutral by 2030 is on track.

42395912,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzzlF,1646319820,Anchor Protocol’s ANC Rallies 23% – Here’s Why,"Anchor Protocol’s governance token, ANC, has gained 23% over the past 24 hours and was trading at $4.95 at press time.  Henrik Andersson, co-founder of Australia-based crypto-asset investment firm Apollo Capital, said that the rally is due to a combination of ANC offering a high annual percentage yield (APY) and talks of new tokenomics.  “Anchor offers among the highest APY for crypto stablecoins which has driven demand of UST,” said Andersson. “At the same time stablecoin yield on aggregator platforms like Yearn and Convex has fallen dramatically to low single digit to low double digits.”  This, in combination with talks of new tokenomics for ANC, might be the reason for the rally, said Andersson.  Anchor is a decentralized money market built on the Terra blockchain that offers UST (Terra’s U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin) depositors a 20% APY. ANC, Anchor’s inflationary protocol token, offers holders governance rights as well as a percentage of protocol earnings.  Anchor Protocol announced in a Feb. 17 blog post a proposal introducing vote-escrowed ANC (veANC) instead of ANC staking. Vote escrow, which was pioneered by curve.finance, is a mechanism of locking tokens for a preset time period. The longer users elect to lock up tokens, the more weight the tokens might get for governance voting and earning staking rewards.  “ANC would be locked up for up to four years in a contract to mint veANC,” wrote Anchor in the blog post.  “VeANC would mean that ANC would need to be locked in order to achieve the highest possible yield on UST – this could further drive demand for the ANC token,” said Andersson.  Meanwhile, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) announced at the end of February that it closed a $1 billion private token sale to establish a decentralized UST Forex Reserve denominated in bitcoin.  “This makes TerraUSD the only stablecoin (with reserve backing) that is fully decentralized,” said Shawn Dexter, DeFi analyst at Quantum Economics, in a telegram chat with CoinDesk. This is because the coin is not issued by a central party, nor are the reserves controlled by a central party (unlike USDT or USDC, for example).  “This was an inflection point for Luna and instantly made most projects on the ecosystem (including Anchor) that much more attractive,” said Dexter.  “The confidence in Anchor Protocol and its prospects for long-term success is dependent on the success and stability of the Terra ecosystem,” added Dexter.  The $1 billion raise along with the fact the reserves are in bitcoin speaks to the long-term prospects of the ecosystem seeing continued development and improvements, according to Dexter. “UST being backed by BTC reserves reduces the fragility of their entire ecosystem during times of market stress and contraction,” he said.  Terra’s LUNA token is up 43% in the last 7 days, trading at around $93.  “Many market participants perceive projects on the Terra ecosystem as a higher-beta trade on Luna, and this could be why we are seeing the stronger projects (on Terra) see their price rally since the announcement,” said Dexter.",POSITIVE,LUNA,BLOCKCHAIN | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/03/anchor-protocols-anc-rallies-23-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd323034a85545cccfc3e76e5ff9a685131daead-1280x941.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Sign up here to get it in your inbox each weekday morning.  Here’s what’s happening this morning:  Market Moves: Bitcoin takes a bull breather as markets price out prospects of a 50 basis point Fed rate hike later this month.

And check out the CoinDesk TV show ""First Mover,"" hosted by Christine Lee, Emily Parker and Lawrence Lewitinn at 9 a.m. U.S. Eastern time. Today's show will feature guests:  Salman Banaei, head of public policy, North America, Chainalysis  Timothy Brackett, CEO, The Markets Compass  Market Moves  By Omkar Godbole  Bitcoin traded moderately lower alongside most alternative cryptocurrencies while U.S. stock futures were flat and the safe-haven dollar remained firm as markets awaited the conclusion of the second round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value struggled to pick up a bid even though the European lawmakers scrapped a section of a pending bill that would have deemed crypto mining illegal.  Bitcoin reached daily highs at the descending 100-day moving average (MA) hurdle at $45,000 before retreating to $44,000, according to chart platform TradingView. The cryptocurrency was still up 28% from last Thursday's one-month lows.  However, the digital asset's future prospects looked bright with inflation expectations surging across Europe and in the U.S. and markets pricing out prospects of a 50 basis point rate hike later this month. Further, technical charts painted a bullish picture.

The potential negative impact of the central bank's planned interest rate hikes on emerging market (EM) paper currencies may perhaps compensate for an expected drop in the U.S. demand for perceived store of value assets like bitcoin and gold.  ""Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are good alternatives during depreciation,"" Mark Thornton, senior fellow at Ludwig von Mises Institute, told CoinDesk in an Email. ""I also think gold and silver are good alternatives at the moment, particularly in EMs.""  ""Toggling back and forth between cryptocurrencies and precious metals provides balance and greater upside for that segment of an individual's portfolio,"" Thornton added.  An emerging market economy is a developing nation in the process of becoming more industrialized and connected with the global economy. India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Brazil are notable emerging market economies.  Currency depreciation or devaluation refers to a fall in the value of the home currency in terms of its exchange rate versus other currencies. Depreciation is inherently inflationary as a weaker currency boosts import costs and often has local investors scrambling to buy alternative assets with a store of value appeal, such as gold and bitcoin.  Bitcoin has found increased demand from Russia and Ukraine, as Moscow's decision to invade Ukraine has sent the Russian ruble crashing and led to significant disruptions in Ukraine's currency markets. Gold also rallied to an 18-month high of $1,974 last week.  Some traditional market observers have been worried about a potential slide or depreciation of emerging market currencies against the U.S. dollar ever since the Fed took a sharp hawkish turn in November 2021, hinting at several interest rate hikes in 2022.  That's because interest rate differential is one of the significant factors influencing exchange rates. When a dominant country like the U.S. signals rate hikes, emerging markets with relatively higher rates but significantly smaller economies see capital outflows. That exerts downward pressure on the EM currencies and pushes the dollar higher.  ""Exchange rates against the U.S. dollar have held up for most emerging markets (EMs) in recent months, but there remains a risk that more could face significant depreciation pressure in 2022, particularly if the pace of monetary tightening in the U.S. accelerates,"" Fitch Ratings said last month.  EM investors could diversify into bitcoin and gold if the Fed tightening triggers a sharp reversal of capital inflows, leading to an exchange rate slide. With inflation already elevated worldwide, even a slight currency depreciation could trigger panic buying of gold and bitcoin.  The Fed tightening is a major risk, particularly for currencies of EMs running current account deficits. The deficit occurs when a country sends more money abroad than it receives, leaving the domestic currency vulnerable to increased borrowing costs elsewhere. Thus, countries running current account deficits, such as Brazil, India and Pakistan, may see strong demand for bitcoin.  ""Large current account deficits implies greater borrowing from overseas, and this puts the local currency at greater risk, as people will exchange local currencies for cryptocurrencies, precious metals and anything real,"" Thornton said. ""Major economies' central banks have already printed enough money to create hyperinflation and have borrowed more than enough money to induce hyperinflations. Paper money will fail. It's only a matter of time.""  EMs may prefer bitcoin over other hard assets  Emerging market investors may flock to bitcoin rather than gold or other hard assets, as cryptocurrencies can circumvent government-imposed capital controls.  ""One tool emerging markets have used when trying to defend a devaluing currency (or maintain a peg) is to restrict convertibility. The 'capital controls' are designed to limit conversion from the emerging market currency to USD. Broadly speaking, these restrictions are not very effective,"" said Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at the Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University. ""Presumably, crypto gives one more channel for people to get around capital controls.""  Governments and central banks often impose capital controls to stem the outflow of money from the country to arrest the exchange-rate slide. Earlier this week, the Russian central bank raised rates from 9.5% to 20% and ordered exporting companies to sell 80% of their forex revenues in the market. In August 2013, the Reserve Bank of India imposed controls on overseas investments to support the sliding rupee and the government put curbs on gold imports.  EMs can initiate similar steps if their currencies slide in the coming months. However, with their decentralized, peer-to-peer and borderless systems, cryptocurrencies appear insulated from such measures.  Anyone can mine a bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency's blockchain facilitates peer-to-peer transfers between two parties, meaning that intermediaries are no longer required to manage the transaction. In other words, crypto users can bypass traditional banking channels and, in theory, cannot be controlled.  ""The existence of cryptocurrencies may expand the options for capital flight, hence perhaps making these situations more difficult, though the capital flight is always difficult to control and there probably aren't many good regulatory options,"" said Michael Englund, principal director and chief economist at Action Economics LLC.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Omkar Godbole, Bradley Keoun",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/03/03/first-mover-americas-fed-hikes-could-drive-bitcoin-adoption-in-emerging-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/20436e40b2d4bbfea24bd109ddedd4022b258937-856x468.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Blockchain Association is a member-led organization whose “goal is to improve the public policy environment so that blockchain networks can thrive in the United States,” it says on its website.  “Foundry will leverage Blockchain Association’s singular platform, blending industry insights and legal analysis, to inform lawmakers of the economic growth and technological innovations the crypto industry will continue to bring to the job market and electrical grid,“ Foundry said in the statement.  Foundry Digital is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk.  Foundry joins the lobbying group as policymakers around the globe are weighing a host of potential regulations for the crypto industry.  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, said on Wednesday that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could emphasize a need for cryptocurrency regulation to prevent sanctioned individuals from using cryptocurrency as a workaround.  As the crypto mining industry has rapidly expanded in the U.S. after China’s sweeping ban last year, miners have come under scrutiny by lawmakers over their use of energy and the impact on the environment. Most recently, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) sent letters to six miners questioning “extraordinarily high energy usage” and their environmental footprint.  “Foundry and its clients have grown rapidly and expanded operations in various regions that are often overlooked, demonstrating the type of economic development and community revitalization the crypto industry can bring to these regions,” said Kyle Schneps, director of public policy at Foundry.

According to an announcement on its official website, the financial watchdog said it has 50 ongoing investigations, including “criminal probes,” into businesses that have not registered with it.

42421653,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXotUz,1646315400,"If Crypto Belongs in Retirement Accounts, Where Are the Assets?","There’s every reason to believe cryptocurrencies belong in retirement accounts – but why aren’t there more alternative investment options in retirement accounts in the first place?  Investors already have the ability to invest in cryptocurrencies in self-directed IRAs (SDIRA), but these accounts were once difficult propositions because they took a long time to set up. That’s changing thanks to new custodial offerings created, in part, because of the digital assets industry.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.  “From investor to sponsor, it’s a cumbersome, painful process,” said James Jones, senior vice president of Investor Relations at CalTier Realty, a digital alternatives issuer with roots in private real estate. “The new SDIRA custodial platforms take a process that sometimes means weeks of paperwork going back and forth and turn it into a matter of minutes.”  Jones said alternative investment sponsors have long tried to tap the retirement account market. While at any given time $1 trillion resides in checking and savings accounts, $35 trillion resides in retirement accounts.  “People have $35 trillion sitting in retirement accounts, mostly over-allocated to stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs,” Jones said, referring to exchange-traded funds. “Most people have the same portfolios in their taxable accounts as they do their 401(k). They’re going after 5% of the market and leaving 95% of the money on the table.”  Right now, the attraction of digital assets in retirement accounts is the potential for high-flying, tax-deferred growth. But over time, crypto will become more than just a growth play within these accounts.  Investors will demand more high-yield products, and the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces could be instrumental in offering those opportunities within retirement accounts, said David Abner, global head of business development at Gemini.  A frustrating system  So why haven’t we seen more similarly esoteric assets –like private investments, real estate and collectibles – placed within a tax-advantaged retirement account? Because it’s exceedingly difficult to do so, said Eric Satz, the founder and CEO of AltoIRA, a digital self-directed IRA custodian that offers a crypto IRA.  “Alto really grew out of my own frustration with those legacy workflows and processes,” Satz said. “They resulted in higher-than-ought-to-be account fees and eliminated access for the majority of Americans.”  With crypto, it’s a case of mismatched-time – consumers wouldn’t want an account that took weeks to open and potentially weeks to fund to purchase a high-volatility asset, said Satz.  Legacy SDIRA custodians were also notorious for not updating their technology and workflows – and were ill-suited for an asset class that trades 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  “The legacy players have been around since ERISA [the Employee Retirement Income Security Act] was created in the 1970s,” Satz said. “They grew up with people, and paper-burdened processes and they never really updated their capabilities as new technologies developed.”  Jones said they rely on technology that isn’t integrated, creating complicated “go-between” processes involving the custodian and an exchange that was too much for many investors.  They were also costly to keep.  “Legacy self-directed IRAs typically charge account fees of $300 per asset per year,” Jones said. “If you have investments spread across a couple of platforms, you could be paying $3,000 to $4,000 in fees. If someone is only investing $15,000 to $30,000 a year, they’re seriously eroding their capital.”  Enter the crypto IRA  Today, there are options that make it easier to open and maintain a self-directed IRA capable of holding digital assets and other alternatives. A number of crypto IRA custodians, including Bitcoin IRA, Kingdom Trust, iTrustCapital and AltoIRA have launched accounts to hold digital assets.  One flavor of crypto IRA involves a custodian to hold the IRA, an exchange to manage cryptocurrency trades and potentially a secure storage solution offered by the bitcoin (BTC) IRA.  iTrustCapital earlier this year wrapped up a $125 million fundraising round that valued it at over $1.3 billion. Like AltoIRA, iTrustCapital uses Coinbase’s custody solution.  Generally, a crypto IRA provider will work with one exchange, but some are exchange agnostic. They also carry more fees than a standard free IRA at a traditional custodian, including set-up fees, trading fees and account management fees.  “We’ve eliminated most of the people and the paper in opening up a SDIRA,” Satz said. “You can open and fund an AltoIRA account depending on whether you have the information necessary sitting by your side in anywhere from 10-to-20 minutes as opposed to two-to-three weeks. That’s big-time savings.”  Moving funds into a crypto IRA ideally involves a trustee-to-trustee transfer, which moves the money from one custodian to the self-directed IRA custodian. Internal Revenue Service rules permit an unlimited number of trustee-to-trustee transfers in a given year.  The generic “60-day rollover” – taking funds out of one retirement account to deposit them within 60-days into another retirement account of the same type – requires the originating custodian to cut a check to the client and automatically withhold 20% in federal taxes. If the rollover amount is not deposited within 60 days, it becomes a fully taxable distribution from the retirement account subject to tax penalties.  Currently, the rules on such accounts require they be funded with earned income, so it is not possible to transfer digital assets from a taxable account into the self-directed IRA.  The future of 401(k)s?  Satz believes crypto 401(k)s and 403(b)s are in the making, enabling a cryptocurrency rollover from a workplace or solo retirement plan into an IRA, a view that Abner shares.  “We see advances in crypto IRAs,” Abner said. “You’ll be able to transfer a 401(k) into a crypto IRA for sure, so there’s going to be a lot of growth in that segment.”  Today, only a self-sponsored retirement account like a solo 401(k) or Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA can be set up to hold crypto. True workplace plans may be more of an uphill battle because they are governed by the stringent fiduciary rules established by ERISA.  Currently, Satz said there are three ways advisors can use AltoIRA with their clients.  “One is that they can help them manage their own accounts by pointing them to Alto,” Satz said. “The second way is that advisors can view assets in separately managed accounts (SMA) via our partnership with Eaglebrook Advisors. The third way is that they can help clients invest in the leading cryptocurrency funds if that’s what their preference is, whether it’s Skybridge or Grayscale or Osprey, all of those funds are available on the Alto platform.” (Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.)  Satz said Alto is also offering an advisory option in the future.  “Alto is streamlined, integrated and launching soon with IRA as a service, which will allow for third-party account opening,” Jones said. “That is going to allow advisors to get on the platform and invest across the spectrum in their clients’ IRAs.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/03/if-crypto-belongs-in-retirement-accounts-where-are-the-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5d0d05ce2164fdac53c45248fbd671b430c42f8-2333x3500.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421661,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoteH,1646315400,Why NFT Profile Pics Matter to Investors – and Regulators,"It seems nobody – not even the U.S. government – can agree on exactly how to classify the digital assets known as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Yet the digital art pieces have taken off in popularity and attracted buy-in from creators, collectors, a growing sector of digital asset lawyers and everyday social media users.  One prevailing trend is NFT profile pictures, or PFPs. Collectors throughout 2021 began switching over their social media avatars to display their most prized pieces of their NFT collections. Twitter last month attempted to make PFPs more legitimate by releasing a tool to verify PFP authenticity. Platforms like Reddit and OnlyFans are reportedly next in line.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.  Collectors like displaying their NFT profile pictures because the avatars convey confidence in blockchain as an emerging technology. They are also a signal of belonging and status. In addition, NFTs often come with “utility,” meaning a record of ownership can unlock access to online and in-person membership communities. With all the hype, demand for these exclusive assets has made prices skyrocket.  NFTs as membership tokens  The tokens produced by NFT artists are something of a cultural timestamp. Designed collaboratively by artists and developers, PFPs depict a mix of randomly generated characters. The artwork uses a templated base, and then an algorithm assigns a unique mix of attributes for each minted NFT. Some characteristics end up being more rare – such as the pale blue alien CryptoPunk that just sold for $23 million – which gives certain NFTs more value than others.  The top collections board on OpenSea, a popular NFT marketplace, shows a seven-day trading volume of 6,185 ETH for the CryptoPunks collection, one of the first (and inadvertent) PFP collections to drop before the trend took off. Below that on OpenSea’s board are newer collections that contain up to 10,000 randomly generated avatars with mixed traits.  Floor prices for popular PFP projects on OpenSea vary widely. The Coolman’s Universe collection of 10,000 cartoon “Speshies,” for instance, is No. 45 on OpenSea’s top collections list and has a floor price of roughly 1.4 ETH with a seven-day trading volume of about 887 ETH as of time of writing. Meanwhile, the World of Women collection, with its 937 ETH seven-day trading volume, ranks at No. 43 and has a floor of about 8.74 ETH.  Owning one of these or other PFPs entitles the collector to certain privileges. On its website, for instance, World of Women lists the benefits of NFT ownership. Those include holders-only raffles and discounts, an invitation to an annual gala, and curated presales, among other perks. And on the social justice of things, the sold-out Women Rise project outlines a road map to support gender equality and girls education, including donating 2.5% of profits to the Malala Fund. PFPs therefore signal inclusion into the type of well-curated and values-aligned future collectors want to be part of, along with the promise of community.  But when profit also enters the equation, regulators and lawyers have questions.  The uncertain regulation of PFPs  According to the Howey test, a monetary investment in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the effort of others is the definition of a security. Buying into an NFT collection to support a good cause or join an art community is one thing, but it’s also no secret the most rare and coveted PFPs are now worth millions.  But while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued general guidance on digital assets, the agency hasn’t focused specifically on NFTs, which differ from stocks or even cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  “[SEC guidance] really wasn’t designed with NFTs in mind,” explained James G. Gatto, a licensing and regulatory issues lawyer and partner at the law firm Sheppard Mullin, during an online NFT conference in February.  In most cases, an NFT isn’t going to be a security, Gatto said, but his firm has encountered a few examples in which NFTs did have the traits of a security, meaning securities law should come into play. The main instance so far has been in the case of fractionalization, or taking a high-value piece of art and creating multiple NFTs that share the revenue.  This model is similar to the one used by alternative investment platform Masterworks, which says in its disclaimer that it is “testing the waters under Regulation A under the Securities Act of 1933.” Masterworks files its artwork with the SEC as a security, even though the platform itself isn’t registered or licensed as a brokerage. While PFPs won’t automatically fall into the fractionalization category, this particular nuance could have implications for some NFT marketplaces like Fractional that offer shared ownership of expensive digital art pieces.  Examining the intention behind your purchase  As with every purchase, investors should have a clear investment thesis backing their reasoning for buying NFTs. The recent Pudgy Penguins scandal makes this point clear. The Pudgy Penguin project’s founders never delivered on their promises, and the cringeworthy failure made headlines when Pudgy Penguin NFT holders coded a smart contract to maintain the liquidity of their tokens while denying the original owners access to any more trading profits. The situation was described as a “blatantly fraudulent illegal securities offering and embezzlement” in a LinkedIn post written by Carlos Mercado, a data scientist and founder of crypto outfit CharlieDAO.  For every failed NFT project, however, is a similar thriving community with transparent leadership and an engaged collector base – and sometimes it’s hard to know which is which. “Blatant” often becomes clear only in hindsight.  NFT enthusiasts would then tell investors to consider the “why” behind their purchases and not view PFPs as a get-rich scheme. Doing so not only protects investors from making impulsive NFT purchases, but could also be a buffer when teasing out exactly what is a security and what’s not. NFT collectors won’t necessarily have to defend their NFT purchases from the SEC one day, but everyone should always have a sound thesis backing his buys.  “There are collectibles, utility tokens and clear securities in the NFT space. It is important to understand the differences when buying them,” Mercado wrote in a follow-up LinkedIn post after I spoke to him about his Pudgy Penguins commentary. Mercado is not a lawyer – just a data scientist and Web 3 enthusiast – but he has experience buying a variety of digital assets. He also speaks with digital asset lawyers regularly while building out his DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, of token holders.  “I buy plenty of NFTs just because I want to support those artists,” he told CoinDesk. “Then I buy other entities that are like, ‘We’re going to build this game. It’s going to look so cool. Here are previews of our new 3D renderings.’ There’s a clear promise of development [in these examples], and expertise from the people who want your money.

The announcement was made by the country's deputy prime minister and minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, via his verified Twitter account on Thursday.  ""After careful consideration we decided to cancel airdrop. Every day there are more and more people willing to help Ukraine to fight back the aggression,"" Fedorov tweeted.  Fedorov said the country will announce non-fungible tokens (NFT) to support Ukrainian armed forces, but emphasized there are no plans to issue any fungible tokens. NFTs are digital assets on a blockchain that represent ownership of virtual or physical items.  The airdrop was initially announced on Wednesday on the country's official Twitter account, following which government officials did not release any further information or announcements regarding the event scheduled for Thursday. Government officials also did not respond to CoinDesk's multiple requests for comment since the initial announcement.  Wednesday's announcement indicated the goal of the airdrop was to reward donors who have been sending crypto to support Ukraine as it stands against Russia.  Earlier on Thursday, it appeared as though an airdrop was underway, but it later became apparent that a third party may have been spoofing the much-anticipated event.  According to Fedorov's most recent update on Telegram, the Ukrainian government has raised around $30 million since it began accepting crypto donations last Friday. The government has been raising funds via a range of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Polkadot's DOT.

The move comes after the decision sparked objection from the crypto community. Rumors of banning cryptocurrencies with PoW mining, such as Bitcoin are missing in the latest framework published by the EU&apos;s Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA). The proposed bill sought to enforce oversight of the crypto industry, including the introduction of a licensing scheme for service providers and regulations for stablecoins. The EU Parliament was expected to approve the proposed legislation on February 28 and had also decided to ban the network from January 2025, however, the vote had to be postponed to address concerns raised by the representatives of crypto space. Stefan Burger has confirmed that the bill has been completely removed, although, the vote has been rescheduled. Additionally, climatic concerns have been weighing on Europe.

""Bitcoin has cleared resistance defined by the daily cloud, and it is likely to confirm its breakout upon today's close,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk in an email on Wednesday. While bitcoin traded slightly weak on Wednesday, it managed to print a UTC close above the cloud, confirming a bullish trend change.  ""The breakout reverses the intermediate-term downtrend and puts the next major hurdle on the chart in the $50,000-$51,000 area based on the 200-day moving average (MA) and a 50% retracement level,"" Stockton added.  Created by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s, the Ichimoku cloud comprises two lines – the leading span A and the leading span B. Both lines are plotted 26 days ahead of the last candle to indicate future support or resistance.  The indicator uses a somewhat complex formula to plot these lines. However, users don't need to know the inner workings, which are taken care of by chart providers, and can focus on interpreting the signals given by the indicator.  The cloud turns green, signaling a bullish bias when the leading span A crosses above the leading span B. The cloud color changes to red whenever the leading span B drops under the leading span A.  Crossovers above or below the cloud are widely taken to represent early signs of a bullish or bearish trend change.  The 200-day moving average (MA) and Fibonacci retracement are widely used to identify long-term trends and potential support and resistance levels.  The latest breakout is backed by an above-zero or bullish reading on the MACD histogram. ""Our short-term gauges are pointing higher,"" Stockton noted.  So far, the follow-through to the breakout has been dismal, with the cryptocurrency trading 1% lower on the day at $43,400. The daily chart stochastic is close to flashing an overbought signal, indicating potential for temporary consolidation before a continued move higher.  ""Risk is heightened in this environment, so we would keep a tight stop loss for all cryptocurrency positions,"" Stockton said, adding that the daily cloud can now offer support.  Bitcoin has rallied over 25% since hitting lows under $34,500 a week ago, supposedly on the back of increased demand from Russia and Ukraine.  According to the latest reports, Russians have taken control of the Ukrainian port city of Kherson and a Ukrainian delegation is on the way to Belarus for the second round of ceasefire talks with their Russian counterparts.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/03/bitcoins-ichimoku-cloud-breakout-could-lead-to-continued-uptrend,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f1ee31ee31a20552b727a45c1d29f6b03cf0881-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

After the initial publication of this article, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation announced that the planned airdrop had been canceled.  Ukraine’s official crypto donation wallet appears to be holding nearly 7 billion peaceful world tokens in what might be the token that will be used in the country’s first crypto airdrop.  Ethereum blockchain explorer Etherscan shows 7 billion peaceful world (WORLD) tokens were created on Wednesday, March 2 at 22:15 UTC and sent to Ukraine’s official crypto donation wallet address.  The Ukraine wallet then appeared to send nearly 1 million Peaceful World tokens to a wallet that used the tokens to seed a liquidity pool on decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap. Blockchain analysts, however, said a third party could trigger the transaction and the Ukraine wallet never directly interacted with the peaceful world tokens.  Approximately two hours later, Ukraine’s wallet appeared to send 1.03 peaceful world tokens to 30 wallet addresses corresponding to the 30 wallet addresses that first sent cryptocurrency funds to the official Ukraine Crypto Donation wallet on Feb 26. The transactions appear to be a preliminary test airdrop.  As of press time, the Ukraine wallet owned 99.98% of the total Peaceful World tokens outstanding.  Ukraine has so far raked in over $40 million in cryptocurrency donations over the course of five days from supporters of the country’s effort against Russia.  On Wednesday morning, Ukraine tweeted “airdrop confirmed” and promised a “reward” to those who have made cryptocurrency donations to the country.  Ukraine has remained tight-lipped regarding details of the airdrop, including what tokens donors would receive and in which quantities.  The mere tease of the airdrop has prompted an influx of microdonations on the Ethereum blockchain as crypto users attempted to game the airdrop.  Additionally, Ukraine is no stranger to Uniswap – the decentralized exchange earned praise from Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov when it added a feature that made it easier to swap cryptocurrencies to ether and donate the funds directly to Ukraine.  However, Ukraine’s track marks on the Ethereum blockchain point to this peaceful world token as the likely candidate for the country’s much-anticipated airdrop.

These options will be tabled with the community and voted on” by the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), the note read.  Treasure is the biggest NFT ecosystem on layer 2 protocol Arbitrum, which runs atop the Ethereum blockchain. Each project listed on the Treasure marketplace uses native MAGIC tokens in its own metaverse.  MAGIC allows users to take part in future decisions and drive the growth of the marketplace. Metaverse refers to the immersive digital world created by the combination of virtual reality, augmented reality.  In early Asian hours on Thursday, hackers were able to exploit a vulnerability on the protocol that allowed them to mint NFTs for no cost. Treasure asked users to delist their NFTs from the marketplace at the time. NFTs are blockchain-based representation of a digital or real-world asset.  Blockchain addresses uncovered by sleuths show several ""Smol Brains"" and “Legions” were stolen in the attack. The Smol Brains NFTs are one of the most popular on Treasure, with some stating the stolen collection alone was valued at over $1.4 million at the time of the attack.  Prices of MAGIC fell 40% in the hours following the exploit. However, prices have since recovered to the $3.34 mark, as per data from CoinGecko.  Thursday’s exploit put Treasure in the news for the second time in as many weeks. In February, anonymous blockchain sleuth “zackxbt” claimed Treasure developer “JC” was previously involved in several short-lived NFT projects that were abandoned soon after hyped launches.  Treasure, however, responded to the allegations stating JC worked on a contract basis and delivered stipulated work before the previous projects were abandoned by their creators.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/03/stolen-smol-brains-nfts-returned-to-users-hours-after-treasure-exploit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e5527a6e9d6817185dbf7f3bc774dad75e004f9-1300x903.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Joshua and Jessica Jarrett sued the IRS in 2021 on claims they should not have had to pay income tax on Tezos tokens they gained by staking on the network. In December, the IRS offered a refund to the couple, who refused to accept it to force a federal court to make a ruling on whether the IRS can tax crypto gained through staking as income (in addition to taxing crypto transactions as a capital gain or loss).  In a motion to dismiss and a supporting 12-page memorandum of law filed earlier this week, the IRS said the Jarretts could not refuse the refund, and the case should be dismissed. The Jarretts’ legal case has been funded in part by the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA).  Read more: IRS Offers Tezos Staker Refund on Rewards Tax in Break From Current Policy  “Despite obtaining the full relief they ask for in their Complaint, the Jarretts believe this is still a 'live' case or controversy because the Court has not yet ruled on whether staking rewards are taxable as income when received. They suggest in their letter that they can simply refuse the refund for which they sued in order to ‘vindicate their rights,’” the filing said. “The Jarretts essentially argue they can continue this case to force the United States to explain why it granted the refund and then obtain an advisory opinion from the Court about those reasons. Not so.”  The tax refund ($3,793) plus interest ($208.03) was delivered on Feb. 14, the IRS said.  According to the filing, the IRS expects the plaintiffs to dispute the IRS’s motion to dismiss, but said none of the possible exceptions would apply, pointing to how tax and tax refund cases are viewed within the U.S. judicial system.  “Even if the Jarretts make future refund claims based on the argument that staking rewards are not taxable income when received, that controversy would be ‘at most a similar one.’ That is not enough. And given that this is the Jarrett’s [sic] first suit to seek a refund after paying tax on the receipt of Tezos rewards tokens, the Jarretts cannot show repeated cases evading review,” the memo said.  The IRS said there is “nothing left to adjudicate,” that the refund was “not an offer to compromise” and therefore the case is over.  “Plaintiffs may, as they hypothesize, seek a refund in a future tax year. Or they may not. That depends not only on whether they are earning staking rewards for any given year, but also on whether – accounting for all the other income, deductions, and payments they report on a future return – they report another overpayment,” the IRS said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,"Nikhilesh De, Cheyenne Ligon",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/03/us-tax-agency-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuit-by-tezos-stakers-who-refused-refund-demanded-trial,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d630f94c3514589dd51706f904f353a3c7c9464-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42395910,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASzziI,1646267430,Ukraine's Airdrop Tease Spurs Influx of Microdonations,"Ukraine’s airdrop tease is prompting an influx of microdonations on the Ethereum blockchain.  Since the country tweeted “airdrop confirmed” early Wednesday morning, Ethereum users have made thousands of donations ranging from 0.0001 ether (ETH) to 0.01 ETH (approximately $0.30 to $30) to Ukraine’s official Ethereum wallet, according to data from Etherscan.  Ukraine has raked in over $40 million in donations since the country's Twitter account first tweeted it would begin accepting donations in cryptocurrency on Feb. 26.  The number of unique wallets that donated cryptocurrency in the 18 hours since the airdrop tweet has already surpassed the number of unique wallets that donated prior to the tweet, according to data from Dune Analytics.  The influx of donations suggests Ethereum users are trying to game the airdrop via a Sybil attack on Ukraine’s Ethereum wallet. The method typically involves one user making small donations from multiple wallets, as opposed to a larger donation of one larger sum.  The advantage, experts say, is that Ukraine could potentially airdrop the teased “reward” to unique wallets, thereby giving the owner of multiple donor wallets multiple helpings of the anticipated airdrop.  Historically, some decentralized finance (DeFi) users have deployed such a method to increase the total of their token airdrops. Now, instead of being used to game DeFi protocol airdrops, the method appears to be in use to game the rewards for donating to geopolitical crises.  However, it is still unclear what mystery item(s) Ukraine will actually airdrop, or the criteria the country will use to evaluate eligible recipients.  For example, one way Ukraine could combat such an attack is to restrict airdrops only for wallets that have donated above a certain amount.  Ukraine has announced that a snapshot will be taken at 6 p.m. Kiev time (20:00 UTC) on March 3. The snapshot likely refers to a list of all wallet addresses that have donated to Ukraine’s cause. The timing also means the Ethereum microdonations could continue for another day.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | AIRDROP,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/03/ukraines-airdrop-tease-spurs-influx-of-microdonations,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
