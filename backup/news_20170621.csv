42400079,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzW3I,1498079463,$13: Ether Prices Plunge in GDAX Exchange Flash Crash,"In yet another instance of just how volatile the cryptocurrency markets can be, the price of ether plummeted to $13 today on cryptocurrency exchange GDAX.  The steep decline, observed at roughly 20:30 UTC, had an outsized effect on the market for the digital token that powers the world's second-largest blockchain. Overall, the value of ether fell to this price after trading at as much as $365.79 earlier in the session, according to GDAX data.  As a result, the flash crash represented a more than 96% decline from the daily high.  The move was so severe that Coinbase, the US-based operator of the exchange, opted to disable trading of the ETH/USD pair and block withdrawals of ether.  Further, the price of ether suffered this loss amid signs that the ethereum network has been struggling to cope with the demands of its rising use. Data provided by Etherscan reveals that more than 300,000 ether transactions were broadcast on 20th June, an all-time high for the two-year-old network.  As such, it remains unclear whether the decline and network congestion will be enough to stem enthusiasm, as until recently, many market observers were so bullish on the asset's potential they believed it was on track to bypass bitcoin as the market leader.  At press time, ether was trading at roughly $300 across global exchanges.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.  Correction: An original version of this article miscalculated ether's decline. This has been corrected.

42400065,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVrU,1498073156,Startups See Service Outages Amid Ethereum Blockchain Backlog,"The ethereum blockchain is beginning to show signs it's being impacted by a new influx of users.  Amid a surge in mainstream media interest, not to mention projects raising funds via initial coin offerings (ICOs), transaction backlogs were visible on the network. Data from ethereum information provider Etherscan shows that more than 300,000 transactions were broadcast on 20th June, the highest amount ever observed on the two-year-old blockchain.  The rise in activity has also pushed the size of ethereum's transaction blocks – which change dynamically – to new highs, while the amount of gas used to send transactions, a kind of charge for processing power, has climbed to new heights as well.  Combined, these changes appear to be impacting businesses.  The list of exchanges that have announced withdrawal pauses or service disruptions in the past day includes Bitfinex, BTC-e, CEX.io and ShapeShift, among others. Social media posts suggest that users are also seeing disruptions when using other exchanges, including Coinbase, BitBay and Poloniex.  Get in line  So far, however, this outsized demand has perhaps been most visible in impacting token sales.  An ICO hosted yesterday by the ethereum messenger app Status has been blamed by some for the inflow of transactions it attracted to the smart contract associated with the sale.  In a bid to avoid a similar situation, an ICO launched today by identity startup Civic has employed a queuing system. Earlier today, the line of potential purchasers saw interest from more than 15,000 participants. (At press time, the sale was still ongoing).  It's a situation that brings one of the central areas of blockchain development – scalability – into the fore. The issue is one that has faced the bitcoin community for some time, though developers, users and other stakeholders differ on the approach that should be taken to scale the network.  The market price of ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) has declined amid the congestion, falling more than 9% since the day's open.  At press time, the price of ether is roughly $323.  Dark market disruption  Exchanges aren't the only services that have been disrupted by the backlog.  Transaction delays also appear to have ensnared the dark market AlphaBay, which moved to integrate ether early last month. The market's operators first announced that they would let vendors accept the digital currency in March.  Posts on the AlphaBay and DarkNetMarkets reddits indicate that several users have experienced problems when trying to withdraw their funds.  Some of those issues seem to be connected to the exchange disruptions, according to one subreddit post.  Another possible factor: the use of a transaction tumbler by AlphaBay. One market vendor suggested that the need to cycle transactions – thereby creating a host of new ones while obfuscating their original source – had contributed to the delays.

According to Dr.Web, a Russian anti-virus vendor, the NSA's ""DoublePulsar"" backdoor – which was leaked earlier this year by a group called the Shadow Brokers – allows the entry of a Trojan program that installs software to secretly mine the privacy-oriented digital currency monero.  In a 15th June blog post, Dr.Web laid out the nuts and bolts of the malware, noting:  ""This malicious program, designed for mining the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency, was dubbed Trojan.BtcMine.1259. Trojan.DownLoader24.64313 downloads the miner to a computer. This loader Trojan is distributed via the backdoor DoublePulsar.""  It's not immediately clear how many machines have been infected with the malware due to the NSA exploit, and a representative for the company wasn't immediately available to comment when reached.  Wired reported in April that tens of thousands of machine were impacted following the exploit's release.  DoublePulsar has also been identified as a factor in the recent ""WannaCry"" ransomware attacks, which impacted hundreds of thousands of computers across the globe.

42400074,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVzM,1498062620,Porsche Names Winner of Blockchain Startup Contest,"German automaker Porsche has revealed the winner of a blockchain startup competition first announced in April.  As CoinDesk reported at the time, Porsche solicited entries from startups as part of a broader bid to explore how it might apply blockchain to its own business. The carmaker said today that more than 100 applicants entered the contest.  The winner is a startup called Xain AG, founded in February of this year and based in Germany. The startup is looking to apply blockchain to the industrial production process, leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning in tandem.  Xain AG will receive a cash prize worth €25,000, as well as a spot in the HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management's Accelerator Program.  Perhaps more notably, the startup and the automaker will work together on blockchain research starting in August. The collaboration will kick off with a three-month prototype development phase at SpinLab, a Leipzig-based accelerator backed by Porsche.  In statements, Porsche reiterated past statements that it wants to leverage the expertise of startups as it explores potential uses of the tech.  ""We aim to gain new perspectives on the disruptive potential of the transaction system blockchain from the startup scene,"" Martin Roth, Porsche's manager for strategy, finances and risk management, said.  Porsche is not the only automaker that is trialling blockchain tech.  In May, Toyota unveiled a new internal research effort. And earlier this year, Daimler AG announced that it was joining the Hyperledger project, a blockchain development effort backed by the Linux Foundation.

That's because China's ZhongAn Technology announced this week a blockchain-based system that aims to track the whole process of the chicken farming, according to Chinese media outlets Leiphone and Jiemian.  Formed last November  as a technology division under China's first web-only insurer ZhongAn, ZhongAn Technology said the blockchain application will give each chicken an identity that can trace and record the information of its birth, the farms on which it was raised and the processing factories and logistic suppliers it reaches on its way to market.  The project is also a partnership with Wopu, an Internet of Things company based in Hangzhou that provides physical devices attached to the chicken and uses mobile applications to check each transaction recorded on the blockchain.  With the news, ZhongAn is rolling out one of the first blockchain use cases in the country's agricultural industry, though one that follows on a larger trend.  Food safety  has been haunting the country's customers over the last a dozen years, a crisis popularized by heightened media coverage.

Back in April, the National Bank of Cambodia announced that it was working with Japan-based distributed ledger startup Soramitsu to trial the technology, with an eye to potentially implement blockchain at the central bank.  The bank's director general, Chea Serey, has now indicated that that work will continue, telling The Phnom Penh Post:  ""At this stage we will focus on the operational functionality of the system, but we believe the system can further be customized with application development to benefit the [central] bank’s monetary policy, including the use of the local currency.""  That said, she reportedly stressed that the central bank isn't looking to develop its own cryptocurrency – rather, it is viewing the tech (for now, at least) squarely through the lens of interbank payments.  This approach, Serey explained, would help provide ""smooth, efficient, safe and affordable interbank transactions which will ultimately benefit end users"".  According to the report, the central bank is utilizing Hyperledger Iroha, one of the blockchain initiatives under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation-led Hyperledger project. Iroha was developed by Soramitsu, along with tech firms Hitachu and NTT Data, and blockchain startup Colu.

42400071,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVtS,1498050632,No ICO: Hedge Fund Numerai Releases Blockchain Token But Skips the Funding,"A new blockchain token will hit the market today, but you won't be able to buy it in an ICO.  As criticism mounts for so-called initial coin offerings – spurred by those who say the flash fundraising method isn't always the best way to incentivize a distributed economic network – the debut of a token issued by next-generation hedge fund startup Numerai is providing a glimpse at how alternative models could take shape as the market matures.  Announced today  , Numerai has released 1.2 million 'numeraire' tokens, a cryptocurrency it's already begun to allocate to the distributed network of 19,000 data scientists that contribute work and help improve the calculations it uses to make real bets on the stock market.  Launched in 2016 and funded by Union Square Ventures and AngelList founder Naval Ravikant, Numerai has raised $7.5m to offer a solution to what it described to Wired as a lack of coordination and collaboration in the global stock markets.  Originally, Numerai used bitcoin as a way to pay its distributed network of data scientists. However, beginning today, it will now use a combination of ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, and its own ethereum-based token, to incentivize users.  Xander Dunn, software engineer at Numerai, explained:  ""Today, we are launching numeraire on chain, it will become a real cryptocurrency. There will be actually tokens with value on secondary markets.""  So, in a sea of competing tokens, what makes numeraire valuable? As Dunn told it, there are several reasons, the first of which is that they are tied directly to the company's core operation: gathering data and predicting stock market outcomes.  When data scientists want to lock in a prediction, they send numeraire to a smart contract which then holds the funds until the performance of the submitted predictions can be judged. Those who issued predictions that performed well earn ether – and have their numeraire returned – while those who didn't have their numeraire destroyed.  ""In a sense, numeraire is mined by data mining Numerai's data, and submitting predictions is the proof of work,"" the company wrote in a February blog post.  Perfecting the model  It's this integration of the token into the project's economy that may be what sets Numerai's token apart from the wider array of token-issuing blockchain projects. And it has already caught the interest of some of the nascent market's earliest thought leaders.  While largely absent from headline-grabbing ICOs of late, Polychain Capital is among those interested in the Numerai token, even if it was restricted from purchasing it in any pre-sale. (As there was no funding, no early investors were in on the token).  Ryan Zurrer, a principal at the token-focused hedge fund, has been among the more critical of tokens that seek to function like traditional securities.  Zurrer said of the Numerai scheme:  ""You have to earn it on their tournament through proof of intelligence. The intellectual premium will be amazing to watch.""  As explained by Dunn, the token aims to promote a virtuous cycle, reinforcing behaviors the network wants (like use of the Numerai token and its issuance and removal from the market) and discouraging those it doesn't (like the hoarding of tokens).  ""Data scientists want more numeraire because you can win more money. So the more you stake, the bigger the payout for you,"" he said.  Of course, positive rewards would only have so much benefit. That's why Numerai also runs a 'staking competition' in which its users can risk losing the digital asset based on their confidence in the performance of their claims.  Shifting economics  Still, the specificity with which this economy will function will need to be iterated.  In conversation last week, Dunn remarked that it wasn't even yet decided how many numeraire would be issued on the first day. He also acknowledged the hard cap of 21 million tokens is somewhat arbitrary (necessary only to ensure the number of tokens is finite), and not a scientific or strategic figure.  Overall, the comments indicate the current period of development is likely to persist as startups attempt to determine how best to incentivize distributed networks of users.  Already, Numerai has changed its rewards payouts so that results are less skewed in favor of the best performers. Whereas before, first place may have earned $1,000 in tournaments, on 11th June this figure was reduced to $400 for first place, $353 for second place and $312 for third place as part of a change in strategy.  ""We think this gives a better incentive for data scientists to build robust models that reliably place high,"" CEO Richard Craib wrote in a post at the time.  Still, the company is hoping to keep an open mind and maintain a collaborative dialogue with users as it seeks to expand its model after launch.  ""The interaction of speculators, exchanges, the price of Numeraire and data scientists is hard to predict at this point so we will change the mechanisms as we learn from you,"" Craib continued.  What happens now  Going forward, the launch of an initial set of digital tokens adds another aspect to an already operational company.  As such, Dunn expressed his optimism that the token will now benefit those it is intended to serve – the data scientists helping to improve the outcome of its trading. Yet, given the recent excessive run-ups in token value, he also commented on situations in which Numerai might become too valuable, though he doesn't believe this is likely.  ""That's something we joked about cryptos are so hot right now, these people are going to make so much money. Some would come back even if they were made rich, but a huge majority of the world's data scientists have never used Numerai,"" he remarked.  For now, it remains to be seen how speculation will impact the secondary market for the token. As for where he predicts the market will debut, Dunn suggested a valuation of $15 per Numerai token, or a $30m market cap.  ""I think that's it's completely within the realm of possibility,"" he said.  Given that some new tokens have debuted to $1bn market caps, that number could well end up being a conservative estimate.

42400080,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzW4H,1498044612,"Armed with an Ethereum ICO, Can Kik Succeed Where Facebook Failed?","Social media network Kik is on the verge of launching its own ethereum ICO, making it the first mainstream social network to feature cryptocurrency as a core component of its services.  With more than $100m in venture capital invested so far in the company, and what they claim is 15 million monthly active users, the social network that made a name for itself by incentivizing interactions with a points system seems ripe for cryptocurrency adoption.  But this is not the first time someone has come up with the idea, and in spite of what appears to be an impressive number of users, this is still a significant decline from just a couple years ago when it had a reported a total of 200 million registered users.  Among the failed past attempts at similar efforts are no less than Facebook itself, which in 2013 unceremoniously shuttered its own Facebook Credits program after less than two years in existence.  Mindful of the obstacles to changing user behavior, Kik CEO and co-founder Ted Livingston initiated a 2.5-year experiment, called Kik Points, to learn if his social media followers would transact where so many others proved unwilling.  Following the publication of the trial results last month, Livingston explained to CoinDesk why the lessons learned from that data will finally set the stage for the successful integration of social media with cryptocurrency.  The CEO said:  ""If we can make this work, we can build one of the largest, most adopted cryptocurrencies in the world, just by integrating this into Kik, and putting Kik Points on the blockchain.""  What the data showed  Founded in 2009, Canada-based Kik raised $120m venture capital from investors including Union Square Ventures, RRE Ventures and others, with then-partner Adam Ludwin of Chain at one time joining as an advisor.  As early as 2011, Livingston said Kik was interested in the potential to use a cryptocurrency to ""monetize the consumer community"" without having to force advertisements onto their page or sell virtual goods, both of which they have done in the past.  To test the theory, the startup launched Kik Points in 2014 to measure the demand for a product that lets users charge each other for basic services and to learn more about how those users conduct such transactions.  Then, on 11th March, 2017 – exactly months before the announcement of its plans for 'Kin', Kik’s own cryptocurrency – it shut downhttps://kikinteractive.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005869007-What-are-Kik-Points- the system.  The published results of the test, which concluded in 2016, shows that Kik users completed 253 million offers for points for doing tasks such as viewing ads, and spent those points on 74 million purchases. On average, 300,000 transactions were conducted per day, with a peak of 2.6m transactions.  ""There were two things it was meant to test,"" said Livingston. ""One is, could digital currency be used to incentivize opt-in advertising? Two is, could we use a digital currency to build an economy? We were trying to test those two things at the same time. What we found it's yes to both.""  The main differences between Kik Points and Kin are that the tokens are capped, helping to minimize the potential impact of inflation. Additionally, the use of ethereum's ERC-20 standard means the tokens can be removed from the Kik ecosystem and spent, or traded elsewhere, and eventually cashed out for fiat currency.  Can the success be converted?  In spite of user behavior that seems to support the willingness to use a cryptocurrency-like system, history is in many ways still stacked against Kik.  In September 2013, when Facebook shuttered its Credits program, the social network already had monthly active users including 874 million people, according to a report by The Next Web. That’s about 1,650% more than Kik currently has.  Also, in a 2012 blog post, the director of Facebook's project management cited the simplified ""purchase experience"" of using fiat currencies and the increased use of native virtual currencies in Facebook games as contributing factors to the decision to shutter Credits.  While Facebook's difficulties integrating a native currency into a social network are certainly the highest profile, it is not alone.  After raising over $1m back in 2015 to create a bitcoin-based incentivization token for sending social media messages, GetGems has seemingly disappeared, with its most recent Skype group chat dating back to July 2016.  However, a lot has changed since those earlier attempts to merge social media and a native currency.  Industry evolution?  Kik’s native currency, Kin, is being built in accordance with the relatively new ERC-20 standard that has helped lead to more than $300m being raised in cryptocurrency via ICOs this year alone.  Also since those early days, companies like Zcash and Ripple have innovated by setting aside a percentage of the total tokens for their own uses – a practice Kik intends to follow.  In this case, Livingston said Kik will hold for its own purposes 30% of the total tokens that will ever circulate.  Perhaps nothing demonstrates the new context more that the fact that, the month Facebook shuttered its Credits service, bitcoin's market cap was about $1.6bn and ethereum didn't exist. Now bitcoin is valued about $44bn and ethereum at $33bn.  While Livingston didn’t reveal the current finances of Kik, he emphasized that he hopes the currency will further align the interests of his users and the company, who he says both want to see the products they create generate revenue.  Livingston concluded:  ""We really do view this as a new monetization model, not just for the broader ecosystem, but also for ourselves. Our goal now is to make this cryptocurrency as widely used as possible.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which has an ownership stake in Chain.

Tasked with considering uniform state legislation for alternative and mobile payment systems, the ULC has been focusing on digital currencies as part of its mandate to create consistency among US state laws for some time now.  As such, the issues, outlined in a recent memohttp://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/regulation%20of%20virtual%20currencies/2017AM_VirtualCurrencies_IssuesMemo.pdf showcase how much work and deliberation may be left before the model regulation is published and made available as a guide to state lawmakers.

However, in the same way, the ULC is seeking to assist state lawmakers grappling with such questions, in those states and others, providing them an easier way to give clarity to entrepreneurs and investors.

42400068,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzVvQ,1498038921,IBM Announces Blockchain Truck-Tracking Solution,"IBM has struck yet another notable deal in Latin America.  Announced today, a partnership between IBM and AOS, a Colombian provider of logistics solutions, finds the two firms developing a new blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) solution for the logistics business.  Being built with IBM Blockchain and IBM Watson to track the provenance and status of trucks and their goods, the solution records the handling of transactions and information on cargoes to create greater transparency in the delivery process, according to AOS's director of innovation, Ricardo Buitrago.  ""Having the right hardware, software and cloud environment is what gives our clients the protection to ensure blockchain is secure. We’re thinking about the whole spectrum, how we can secure as much as possible and how we can do it with the most integrity,"" explained Jorge Vergara, CTO of IBM Colombia.  So how does it work?  Trucks are equipped with RFID tags that contain data on the vehicle, the name of the driver and details of its load, according to Buitrago.  IoT sensors would track the journey of the shipment, as well as the availability of free space on a truck, and record this data on the blockchain for all relevant parties to access. According to IBM and AOS, this process is usually done manually, and is slower and prone to error.  Buitrago told CoinDesk:  ""[T]he trucks are sealed with bar code seals, which are entered into the blockchain and serve as a safety indicator that the load has not been altered. Additionally, we are considering registering the GPS signal of each truck to record its route and increase traceability data.”  The solution integrates with IBM’s Watson IoT system to check in on factors like weather and temperature, which can impact the journey and the estimated delivery time.  Hard data  IoT in logistics is expected to be worth more than $10bn by 2020, per market research. A report from Cisco and DHL estimated that IoT in logistics and supply chain will generate $1.9tn in value.  Companies often lack hard figures or data on where exactly their shortcomings and losses are in the transport cycle, said Buitrago, adding:  ""Obtaining this information is one of the biggest benefits they will have when implementing our IoT solution in their logistics operation.""  But as blockchains become more efficient and produce greater network effects, the next challenge will be growing that network.  One company has signed up to use the new solution so far. AOS declined to name the firm, but Buitrago said deployment is planned for July. For now, the solution will only be available in the Colombian market.

42400109,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbzW0L,1498035614,A Bitcoin Scaling Upgrade: How It Could Finally Happen (And How It Could Fail),"Bitcoin, it seems, has one of two futures.  Either the $40bn economic network that still defies scientists is on the verge of the biggest change in the network's history, or the most advanced of its many long-theorized scaling compromises is headed toward its biggest political failure.  In recent weeks and months, the likely outcome has shifted quickly, often daily, as the varying stakeholders and competing proposals have jockeyed for position, media attention, and in some cases, actual headspace in the form of creative political attire.  What has been less visible, however, is that, in the midst of the chaos, bitcoin has been progressing, slowly and messily, to the point where some sort of action in the years-long effort to increase its transaction capacity seems likely to be taken.  This is partly because of a key proposal that emerged last month.  After convening in a meeting in May, a group of entrepreneurs and miners put forward Segwit2x, certainly not the first, but arguably the most advanced alternative to the roadmap long advocated by Bitcoin Core, the network's open-source developer group.  Armed with the commitments from the majority of bitcoin's mining pools, the group, comprising more than 50 startups and organized by investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group, now has enough influence to push through at least the first portion of the agreement, though it's not without its dissenters.  Come August, a number of outcomes are plausible. Some are more likely than others. Bitcoin could be upgraded smoothly, or not. But, the big conclusion could play out in many different ways.  The SegWit split  For the moment, the most important takeaway may be that every group is pushing for a change known as Segregated Witness. Bitcoin Core's original roadmap, the Segwit2x plan and users rallying around a change known as a 'user-activated soft fork' (UASF), all call for the upgrade.  Introduced already to no ill effect on the litecoin network, SegWit could provide a boost to bitcoin's transaction capacity among other enhancements. But it has yet to activate on its own. (Some mining pool operators and mining hardware companies have long pushed back against the proposal, though the motivations here are varied.)  But as all the proposals now ultimately support SegWit on different terms, many in the community see this as a sign that SegWit is finally going to activate this summer.  The question is whether it could ultimately lead to a split into two bitcoins, due to how the upgrades are set up.  For one, some mining pools are showing signs that they want to take aggressive measures to hard fork bitcoin to a 2MB block-size parameter. If that happens, it's possible that bitcoin could split into two competing assets later in the summer.  The tricky part is that the debate is constantly shifting.  But, to help understand the current state, here's a timeline of what could happen:  Segwit2x soft fork: 21st July    Described formally in BIP 141, SegWit was first released last November. Today, as many as 80% of bitcoin nodes are running it.      And though it has grown contentious, it's important to note SegWit was originally billed as a 'compromise', since it increases the block size (though not in a way that changes the hard-coded 'block size').      Partly because of this, the idea did not please everyone. Namely, most mining pools did not upgrade their software in support of SegWit, either because they did not agree with the change or because they were indifferent.      Because of the contention around SegWit, others have been looking for a way to boost capacity that aligns with more stakeholders.    Segwit2x is one alternative proposal that combines SegWit with an increase to a 2MB block-size parameter. Most major bitcoin companies and mining pools representing 80% of the hashrate signed the proposal.  As noted earlier, the compromise might be working. As of Monday, the majority of the bitcoin mining hashrate is signaling support for Segwit2x.  This is a non-binding show of support. But the code is set to be officially released by 21st July, according to the technical working group timelines. Once that happens, mining pools can run and signal support for the change.  If 80% of mining pools run the code for 672 blocks, over a period of four to five days, then SegWit will lock in. Although it's non-binding, it's notable that the mining pools plan to lock-in SegWit the day before 1st August (more on that below).  Three months later, the second portion of the agreement, the 2MB block-size increase, is supposed to kick in. The problem is that if not all users upgrade, this could lead bitcoin to split into two assets. At least some users have said that they don't plan to.  Timeline: Signaling for the change begins on 21st July. Three months after SegWit is activated, users will need to upgrade their software if they want to support the 2MB block-size parameter increase.  Who supports it? Most major companies and mining pools.  If mining pools lock in Segwit2x by 31st July, then that might be it. Otherwise the following events could unravel.  BIP 148 UASF: 1st August  BIP 148 UASF also aims to activate SegWit, but it takes a different approach.  It rekindles an older way of making consensus upgrades to bitcoin, one that doesn't explicitly ask mining pools for support before pushing through a code change. (Some in the community are calling it bitcoin's 'Independence Day' for that reason.)  Many users and some companies are already running code that could trigger this type of soft fork. At this point, nodes will start rejecting blocks that do not signal support for SegWit.  That's why the idea is controversial. As these nodes reject the blocks, they're effectively pushing them to a different network. It's a controversial idea because, like the above hard fork, it could lead bitcoin to split into two competing cryptocurrencies, both called bitcoin.  But, some argue that it has more of a psychological affect. For example, some believe that mining pools rallied around Segwit2x on Monday in response to growing support for BIP 148. The idea is that, if they don't want bitcoin to split, SegWit needs to be activated somehow prior to that date.  Timeline: On 1st August, nodes that are running BIP 148 will start rejecting blocks from miners that do not support SegWit.  Who supports it? Some users, some businesses, some miners and some developers, but like the other proposals, support is split.  UAHF: 12 hours after BIP148  If BIP 148 gets off the ground on 1st August, mining firm Bitmain plans to roll out a ""user-activated hard fork"" (UAHF) in response.  This could potentially protect users' money in the event of a split, according to the company, by making the split more permanent. In theory, a bitcoin hard fork could provide protection from a 'wipe out', where transactions on one version of the blockchain might accidentally be erased.  Still, mining pools might lose money if they end up mining a competing fork. So, some are calling the the Bitmain UAHF a bluff.  Another mining firm, ViaBTC, unveiled a related plan on Monday to guard against the prospect that some in the community may not uphold the 2MB increase portion of the Segwit2x agreement.  The far-fetched goal is to incentivize the creation of a bitcoin with bigger blocks by raising the funds to do so via an initial coin offering (ICO).  Timeline: If BIP 148 triggers, Bitmain will start mining a private chain and open it up to more bitcoin users if there’s enough support.  Who supports it? Two mining firms, Bitmain and ViaBTC.  What lies ahead  Still, it's possible that all these scaling efforts will become obsolete once mining pools lock in Segwit2x. If not, though, there is the more complex timeline to keep in mind.  Meanwhile, there are other complexities to the argument, not the least of which is that it can seem like bitcoin users are voiceless in the middle of all this in-fighting.  This was the highlight of a debate between Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Peter Smith, CEO of bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain, on a mailing list last week. There, Back argued that users don't want a small group of entities dictating the rules of what's supposed to be a decentralized currency, while Smith asserted that its wallet users want cheaper fees.  Given the complexities of the outcomes above, bitcoin's biggest question now may not be whether it will upgrade, but whose vision for the network will win out when it does (or doesn't).
