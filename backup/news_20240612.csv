As part of his analysis, he suggested how high Bitcoin could rise in the short and long term. Bitcoin To Rise To As High As $300,000 Dave the Wave suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could rise to as high as $300,000 based on his logarithmic growth channel (LGC) indicator. Based on the chart he shared, BTC’s rally to this unprecedented price level is expected to happen sometime in 2025. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies 5 Altcoins To Buy That Could Be A Good Bet Meanwhile, in the short term, Dave the Wave expects Bitcoin to rise above $100,000 later this year. He highlighted an ascending diagonal line, which Bitcoin has continued to hold as support even following its recent decline below $67,000. As such, the analyst believes that the flagship crypto will remain in a multi-month upward trend as far as it holds above the line. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital also suggested that there was no need to worry about Bitcoin’s pullback, stating that this current pullback would not last forever. In fact, he remarked that everything was going according to plan, as the Bitcoin pullback was long overdue based on “historical tendencies.” The analyst expects Bitcoin to continue consolidating in this Re-Accumulation range for a while. Rekt Capital predicts that the breakout into the ‘Parabolic Uptrend’ phase will likely come in September this year if history repeats itself. This aligns with Dave the Wave’s prediction that Bitcoin will rise above $100,000 later this year. Rekt Capital also warned Bitcoin investors about being shaken out of their positions. He stated that Bitcoin will soon be transitioning into “increasingly fearful territory” as its price drops to as low as $60,000. He added that this “fear tends to precede the point of maximum financial opportunity.” In another X post, he remarked that Bitcoin will retrace deep enough to convince anyone that the bull run is over, and then the flagship crypto will resume its uptrend. BTC Still On Course Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also shared a sentiment similar to Rekt Capital’s. He stated that BTC is still in the range and advised investors not to get shaken out. The analyst had earlier called for patience while BTC consolidates in this range. He highlighted a wedge that he claimed would send Bitcoin’s price to an initial target of $85,000 when a breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Buying Pressure Reaches Critical Level Amid Massive Whale Buying Crypto analyst Jelle also suggested that this is the time for Bitcoin investors to do nothing and just sit on their hands. The analyst reshared his profit-taking strategy, which showed that Bitcoin investors should only look to take profits when the flagship crypto climbs to $80,000.

29385876,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624263,1718226046,"Optimism Activates Fault-Proofs On Mainnet, OP Is Down 55% In 3 Months","In a major milestone for Ethereum and layer-2s, Optimism, a layer-2 scaling platform for the second most valuable network, has announced the activation of open source and permissionless fault proofs. Even though the platform manages over $7 billion of assets, according to L2Beat, Optimism, like most optimistic rollups, lacked a way of trustlessly verifying transactions. It relied on a centralized sequencer and fraud-proof system for this function. Optimism Activates Trustless Fraud-Proof System Activating the open-source fault-proof system is crucial to creating a more decentralized and secure future for the Optimism ecosystem. Overall, fault proofs are a critical component, allowing users to verify the validity of all offchain transactions. Related Reading: Ex-Ripple Director Explains XRP Price Slide Amid Good News Most importantly, it allows users to challenge any fraudulent activity on Optimism, creating a safeguard against unauthorized withdrawals, for example, and much more. In a post, Optimism Labs said the layer-2 platform relied on a centralized system. Here, the Optimism Security Council held the power to initiate withdrawals. However, the platform eliminates this dependency with trustless fault proof in place. This means that any user can withdraw tokens without the council intervening. The power move is huge for the community and decentralization. Even so, to ensure the safe implementation of this fault-proof system, the Optimism Security Council will still have the power, at least temporarily, to intervene in cases of critical failures. This decision means Optimism will continue to operate securely as it decentralizes gradually. Eventually, the platform plans to release a “multi-proof nirvana” that is open-source and modular, possibly including zero-knowledge proofs. This will go beyond the current “Cannon” system. Buterin Acknowledgement, But Why Is OP Crashing? Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, acknowledged this milestone, welcoming Optimism to the “club of stage 1+ L2s.” Nonetheless, the co-founder still needed more zero-knowledge proof-based layer-2 platforms to join the ranks. Optimism is the second layer-2 platform after Arbitrum to announce the release of fault-proof systems, though both are still being tested. Dubbed the Bounded Liquidity Delay (BOLD), Arbitrum’s fraud-proof system was launched on Testnet early last month. Despite this milestone, OP is firm but under pressure in the first half of June.

42417917,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc2Wr,1718222874,Trump's Appeal to Bitcoin Miners Is a Wakeup Call for Crypto to Stay Apolitical,"Former President Donald Trump is calling for a domestic bitcoin mining industry to develop in the U.S. Perhaps with a bit of hyperbole, the Republican presidential candidate said Tuesday he wants “all the remaining” bitcoin – about 2.1 million units – to be produced in the U.S., arguing it would help the country become energy independent and counter the development of a central bank digital currency.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  The announcement, made on his Truth Social social media platform, followed a talk between Trump and Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey in front of representatives from leading bitcoin mining firms CleanSpark, Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  The latest in a series of increasingly pro-crypto statements – including a pledge to defend the right of self-custody, accept crypto campaign donations and “keep Elizabeth Warren and her goons away from your Bitcoin” – has drawn mixed reactions from crypto advocates. Perhaps that is not so surprising, given how polarizing the former president (whose favorability rating never stood above 50%) is in the U.S.  However, this is arguably the first time since 2019 – when Trump said he was “not a fan” of Bitcoin – that the former reality star missed the mark on crypto. The idea of onshoring bitcoin mining is all well and good, and has been happening ever since China banned the practice in 2021. But, if you take Trump literally, calling for all bitcoin miners to be located in a single region suggests a profound ignorance of what Bitcoin is, how it works and why it’s powerful.  Geopolitical signal?  However, that’s just one opinion. There are many others. Bitcoin Magazine’s Alex Bergeron, for instance, argues Trump’s statement is a powerful signal for the importance of crypto.  “We absolutely want the world's most powerful man to signal to every other power brokers that Bitcoin mining is a geopolitical issue. That's how you get everyone to start mining. That's how you decentralize the network,” Bergeron wrote, responding to climate change expert and co-founder of the Bitcoin Policy Summit Margot “jynurso” Paez.  Paez argued that centralizing hashrate production in any one country – specifically one where politicians and regulators have in recent memory been hostile to crypto – is perhaps unwise. President Biden’s administration, for instance, has floated the idea of a steep 30% bitcoin mining tax.  In any event, it’s unlikely the hashrate would ever centralize in any one region, given that there are bitcoiners the world over, who would be difficult even for the President of the United States to prevent from mining.  See also: Why, for Some, Crypto Is a Defining Political Issue | Opinion  So the real question here is whether the U.S. attempting to dominate the bitcoin mining trade through government support or even subsidy would inspire other governments to incentivize domestic mining. It’s far-fetched, but global leaders do often look to the U.S. to set agendas. The problem is Trump’s notably low standing among said global leaders.  So whether this campaign platform actually moves the needle on bitcoin mining is difficult to say. Especially because it’s impossible to say whether Trump’s pro-crypto statements should be taken as pandering or flattering. He is certainly a divisive figure among bitcoiners – and not even just the progressive ones.  Lying with dogs  Many see it as frankly embarrassing to be buddying up with any politician, putting aside Trump’s Napoleonic sized ego. Bitcoin writer and privacy advocate L0la L33tz, for one, wrote a whole essay about the subject, arguing that politicians cannot be trusted, that Trump failed to deliver on many of his previous campaign promises, and that Bitcoin doesn’t really even need political support.  See also: The Biden Administration Is Easing Up on Crypto (a Vibes Analysis) | Opinion  “When your morals can be bought, you are not a patriot – you are a sell out,” L33tz wrote.  Apart from being an internally consistent take considering the “Bitcoin ethos,” it’s worth noting that L33tz’s position is also likely long term optically best for the industry development.  It may seem expedient to fall in with the Republican party standard-bearer given that most political support comes from the right. But I think the view of someone like Uniswap's Marvin Ammori (who debated big-time Trump supporter Ryan Selkis at Consensus 2024 last month) – that the crypto industry should strive to be neutral and apolitical – is likely the better strategy.  I’ve argued before that it’s inevitable for crypto, as a cause celeb, to become an issue for the right to defend and left to vilify.

The analyst alluded to history to show that the second-largest meme coin by market cap can still reach unprecedented heights. Shiba Inu To Reach $0.00024 In This Bull Run Eljaboom suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Shiba Inu will rally by over 1,000% to reach $0.00024 in this bull run. This came following his remarks that history was repeating itself for SHIB. The accompanying chart he shared showed that the analyst was expecting Shiba Inu to experience a similar price surge as it did in 2021, although way higher this time around. Related Reading: Bitcoin Turns Weakness Into Strength: Analyst Identifies Major Liquidity Zone At $73,000 Crypto analyst Crypto Emily seemed to agree with Eljaboom’s prediction, stating that anyone who has lost faith in Shiba Inu is “clueless.” Meanwhile, Eljaboom’s prediction aligns with other crypto analysts who predict that Shiba Inu will shed another zero and rise to $0.0001. One is Javon Marks, who predicts that SHIB will eventually rise to $0.0001553. Crypto analyst Capt Toblerone shared a similar prediction to Eljaboom’s own while using the Elliot Wave Theory to analyze Shiba Inu’s chart. The chart showed that SHIB will rise to $0.00022 when wave 3 of the five-way sequence occurs. Interestingly, the analyst suggested that Shiba Inu’s rise to this price level could happen by September this year. Meanwhile, other crypto analysts, like Armando Pantajo, have made more bullish price predictions for SHIB in this bull run. Pantajo predicted that Shiba Inu would shed two zeros and rise to $0.001. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez went one further and predicted that Shiba Inu could shed three zeros and rise to $0.011. Factors That Can Spark Shiba Inu’s Unprecedented Price Surge Several factors could contribute to Shiba Inu’s parabolic rise to such heights. One is the institutional adoption of the meme coin. The Shib community has been actively working towards achieving this by petitioning Grayscale to consider launching a SHIB ETF. Interestingly, this petition has gained over 10,000 signatures, highlighting the community’s dedication to the cause. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Below $67,000 Sends Market Spiraling, Here Are The Levels To Watch The potential launch of a Shiba Inu ETF would bring new money into the meme coin’s ecosystem, which could trigger this parabolic price surge. New money is also expected to flow into the SHIB ecosystem when the team finally launches the proposed privacy-focused layer-3 network. More users are expected to troop into the Shiba Inu ecosystem to enjoy such utility. Meanwhile, layer-2 network Shibarium undoubtedly still has a significant role to play in SHIB’s growth. The network has already committed to using some of the network fees earned for Shiba Inu token burns. As such, Shibarium can be expected to carry out massive token burns again once daily transactions on the network pick up.

The alliance was set to merge Fetch.AI (FET), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) into the ASI token on Thursday. As a result, the three AI tokens faced a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Reveals Top 7 AI Tokens For Massive 100x Growth – Don’t Miss Out! ASI Token Merger Postponed To July In March, Fetch.AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol, three leading AI blockchain projects, revealed their plan to merge into the ASI token. This move aims to develop a decentralized AI platform to foster technology advancements accessible to a wider audience. On Tuesday, the ASI alliance announced the delay of the token merger from June 13 to July 15, 2024. Per the announcement, the primary reasons for the rescheduling are “logistical requirements” and “technical independencies.” It was further explained that the ASI token merger involves managing complex integrations and attention to numerous moving parts. As a result, the delay was a “strategic decision” to ensure a smooth execution during the process and ensure all “stakeholders’ needs are adequately met.” Humayun Sheikh, Fetch.AI’s CEO, and ASI’s Chairman, reassured the community that the alliance’s vision remained unchanged despite the delay. This temporary delay does not impact the substantial progress we have made towards creating a decentralized superintelligence network. Our teams are actively working with centralized exchanges to finalize the remaining steps. We appreciate the continued support and patience of our community and stakeholders as we work through these final logistical steps. SingularityNET Foundation’s CEO, Ben Goertzel, explained that they are working on integrating the three companies’ AI and blockchain technology. Additionally, he stated his excitement for the upcoming milestone: The finalization of the 3-way tokenomic merger on July 15 will be a major milestone, and we anticipate a series of progressively more exciting milestones after that as we leverage our $ASI token-based network to move toward increasingly capable AI systems and in time actual superintelligence. FET, AGIX, And OCEAN Face 8% Drop After the announcement, the three AI tokens saw a negative price impact in the following hours. SingularutyNET’s AGIX token saw an 8.9% decline, from trading at $0.7035 to $0.6404 throughout Tuesday. In the early hours of Wednesday, the token recovered some ground from the retrace. AGIX traded at $0.6819, a 3.8% decrease from the day before. Similarly, Ocean Protocol’s OCEAN had an 8% drop after the news. The token’s price went from trading at $0.7156 to $0.6576 before recovering the $0.68 support level on Wednesday morning. At the time, AGIX faced a 4.4% decline in its price before the announcement of the delay. Meanwhile, FET saw the largest retrace of the three, with a 10.8% drop. The token fell from the $1.66 price range to $1.48. Later, the token recovered above the $1.62 level, a 3.1% decrease from Tuesday morning. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa commented on FET’s performance. The price drop was a good reminder that “everything comes back down eventually; you just have to be patient.” Moreover, Sherpa said the price range may be a good buy, but it was yet “TBD if it’s ‘the bottom.’” Related Reading: Dogwifhat To Tumble? Analyst Sets $1 Target For WIF However, the tokens have now recovered from the drop. As of this writing, FET is trading above the $1.7 price range. The surge represents a 6.7% increase in the last hour and a 4.4% recovery from its price 24 hours ago. Similarly, AGIX and OCEAN have seen a 5.7% and 5.5% surge in the last hour. This represents a 3.4% and 3% increase since the ASI token merger delay announcement.

As of this week, the gap has finally been filled in. Read on.

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  Network news  MISSING TOOTH FILLED IN: Optimism, the Ethereum layer-2 project, provides the technological foundation for some of the biggest names in blockchain, including the Coinbase exchange's popular Base blockchain and Worldcoin's World Chain, from OpenAI founder Sam Altman. But for years, blockchains that used Optimism's technology were built according to a false underlying premise: that they ""borrowed"" Ethereum's security apparatus. In reality, it wasn't the case, because they lacked a crucial piece of functionality known as ""fault proofs"" – used to challenge actors suspected of malicious behavior. On Monday, that long-promised tech finally came to Optimism's mainnet, CoinDesk's Margaux Nijkerk reported Tuesday. “We literally deleted the entire system essentially, re-architected it, and rewrote the entire thing,” Karl Floersch, CEO of OP Labs, said in an interview with CoinDesk. “That was brutal, but absolutely the correct decision.” The achievement might blunt some of the project's most truculent criticism; similar ""proof"" technology is used by all layer-2 rollup networks, including Optimism competitors like Arbitrum. Without fault proofs, users who deposited funds into Optimism needed to trust the rollup's ""security council"" to return their funds – a system vulnerable to potential human error or bias. With fault proofs, users should only need to trust Ethereum's security. For now, though, the Security Council will remain intact and could still intervene in the event that the fault-proof system goes down.  BACK FOR MORE? The crypto lending sector is recovering from the crypto winter, which blew up several large players, thanks to spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and creditors getting some of their assets back from bankrupt companies, CoinDesk's Aoyon Ashraf reports. The sector spectacularly imploded in 2022 as crypto prices dove, with firms including Celsius, BlockFi and Genesis filing for bankruptcy. Since then, digital-asset prices have soared, with the CoinDesk 20 Index up more than 200% since the end of 2022. ""What I'm seeing is that this market has come back roaring,"" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto lending firm Ledn, told CoinDesk during a recent interview at the Consensus 2024 conference in Austin, Texas.  ALSO:  After a UK court ruled in March that Craig Wright was not the creator of Bitcoin and didn't author the original blockchain's whitepaper, as he had claimed, he's now being asked to cover costs of the legal proceedings. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance's (COPA) legal representatives last week asked Judge James Mellor to grant that Wright pay 85% of the costs the group incurred in the legal proceedings.  Almost $19 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen in thefts dating back to 2011 and the industry continues to grapple with rising blockchain-related crime, according to a report from Crystal Intelligence.

Solana Heavyweights Wage War Against Private Mempool Operators  (Danny Nelson)  A group of Solana (SOL) validators are facing financial penalties for allegedly facilitating economic attacks against crypto traders.  Over 30 validator operators were kicked off the Solana Foundation Delegation Program over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter said. While they remain validators on the network, they're no longer eligible to receive what amounted to payout boosters for validating transactions on the Solana blockchain. Many of the operators were Russians, another source said.  The purge escalates a months-long shadow war between heavyweights of the Solana validator ecosystem and an underground economy of validators believed to be exploiting traders for profit through what's known as a ""sandwich attack,"" whereby bots frontrun and backfill trades that haven't yet been executed.  ""Enforcement actions are on going as we detect operators participating in mempools which allow sandwich attacks,"" a representative for the Solana Foundation said Sunday.

Bitcoin gave up big early session gains following the Fed's hawkish turn.  As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee of the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday held its benchmark fed funds rate range at 5.25%-5.50%, but its economic outlook now calls for just one 25 basis point rate cut this year.  ""In recent months, there has been modest further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective,"" said the FOMC in its policy statement. The ""modest"" wording is notable because the previous policy statement complained of a ""lack of progress"" towards lower inflation.  Updating its economic projections, the Fed's median expectation for the fed funds rate at year-end 2024 is now 5.1% versus 4.6% three months ago. This means the central bank is now anticipating just one 25 basis point rate cut this year versus 75 previously. The 2025 year-end fed funds expectation is now 4.1%, suggesting 100 basis points in rate cuts next year.  At his post-meeting press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said inflation remains too high and the central bank's focus remains on returning that gauge to its 2% target.  Earlier today, the U.S. Consumer Price Index report for May showed an unexpected slowdown in inflation last month. The news sent crypto, stock and bond markets sharply higher as traders ratcheted upward their expectations for the commencement of Fed rate cuts.

The settlement must still be approved by the New York judge overseeing the case.  The agreement would also permanently ban Kwon and Terraform Labs from buying and selling crypto asset securities.  Terraform Labs and its former CEO Do Kwon have agreed to a settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would see them forking over a combined $4.5 billion in disgorgement and civil penalties.  The settlement agreement, which was filed Wednesday, would also permanently ban Kwon and Terraform Labs from buying and selling crypto asset securities – including all of the tokens in the Terra ecosystem.  In addition to their proposed final judgment, lawyers for the SEC filed a letter with the court urging the New York judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Court Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), to approve the settlement agreement.  “If approved, the proposed judgment will send an unmistakable deterrent message to not only those who engage in brazen misconduct, but also to all those who seek to evade the requirements of the federal securities laws by crafting new standards of behavior for crypto assets that fall under the purview of the federal securities laws,” the lawyers wrote. The SEC declined to comment further.  A representative for Terraform Labs declined to comment on the proposed settlement or what it means for Terraform Labs’ future.  In April, a New York jury found Kwon and Terraform Labs liable on civil fraud charges brought against them by the SEC in connection with the $40 billion implosion of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022. Kwon – who is still in custody in Montenegro where he awaits a decision on his extradition to either the U.S. or his native South Korea to face criminal charges for his role in Terra’s collapse – was not in attendance for the trial.  According to court documents, Kwon and Terraform Labs’ current CEO, Chris Amani, both agreed to the terms of the settlement on June 6, though the settlement agreement must still be approved by the New York judge overseeing the case before it is made binding.  Of the $4,473,828,306 that Terraform Labs and Kwon must pay to the SEC in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, Kwon must pay at least $204,320,196 out of his own pocket. The steep penalty is slightly lower than the SEC’s first settlement offer of $5.3 billion in fines, but much higher than the virtual slap on the wrist – a $1 million civil penalty and no disgorgement or injunctions – Terraform Labs suggested to the court in its April memorandum of opposition to the SEC’s motion for final judgment.

29379146,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624301,1718215208,"Bullish News: Top Analyst Forecasts Altcoin Bottom Today, Market Poised For Upswing – Here’s Why","In a recent social media post, renowned crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe shared his predictions regarding the potential bottoming out of the altcoin market. Van de Poppe emphasized the significance of key economic data and the upcoming interest rate decisions from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), highlighting their potential impact on the crypto market. Altcoin Rally Ahead? CPI Data Points To Bullish Outlook Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed that US inflation had fallen to 3.3%, lower than expectations, which he deemed bullish news for the altcoin market. The CPI data holds particular importance as it influences the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rate cuts. Related Reading: Ex-Ripple Director Explains XRP Price Slide Amid Good News Van de Poppe explained that if the CPI data came in above expectations, it would have led to a stronger US dollar and higher yields. In such a scenario, the chances of a near-term rate cut would have diminished, leading to a decline in risky assets. Conversely, a lower-than-expected CPI reading paves the way for a positive market reaction, as is the case today. The FOMC’s interest rate decisions were identified as the second significant event of the day. Following the European Central Bank’s recent rate cut, there is speculation that the US might consider similar measures. Van de Poppe emphasized the importance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech, as it could provide valuable insights into future monetary policy, potentially influencing market sentiments. Trading With Caution The altcoin and crypto markets experienced notable corrections last week, led by Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin in the market, with a price drop of over 5%, with a historical negative correlation observed during FOMC meetings and CPI releases. However, Van de Poppe suggested that a repricing upwards could be anticipated, potentially leading Bitcoin to approach its all-time high of $73,700 in the coming weeks if the FOMC adopts a dovish stance. However, caution was advised, as price action can be deceptive. In the event of an unchanged rate decision, initial downward market responses might occur, with the true impact unfolding later. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Major Analysts Say BTC Is Headed For 6-Digit ATH Another market expert, Adrian Zduńczyk, offered his perspective, highlighting the tendency for prices to retrace to previous levels with little effect on volatility following FOMC decisions. While traders often anticipate news releases and follow patterns, he cautioned against trading against the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. As the altcoin market awaits the outcome of key economic data and FOMC decisions, analysts monitor these factors closely, anticipating a potential reversal and subsequent market upswing. With the Ethereum ETF seeking trading in the coming weeks, the summer months promise renewed market momentum and a potential challenge to all-time highs. ETH is currently trading at $3,618, experiencing a significant surge of 4.1% in the past few hours, coinciding with positive CPI data and heightened expectations of favorable news from the US Federal Reserve.

29376967,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624198,1718211658,Is Bitcoin Overheated Right Now? This Metric Suggests No,"Data of an on-chain indicator could suggest Bitcoin is currently not at a stage where its price would be at a significant risk of facing correction. Bitcoin 365-Day MA Growth Rate Is Sitting Below Historical Overheated Zone In a post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has discussed about the recent trend in the “Growth Rate” metric for Bitcoin. The Growth Rate basically keeps track of the difference between the changes happening in the Bitcoin Market Cap and Realized Cap. The Market Cap here is naturally just the simple valuation of the cryptocurrency’s total circulating supply at the current spot price. The Realized Cap, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slips Under $67,000: Can BTC Rely On This Historical Support Again? The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model for the asset that takes the “real” value of any coin in circulation to be the same as the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. As the last transaction of any coin was likely the last instance of it changing hands, the price at its time would act as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this price for all tokens of the asset, it essentially calculates the sum of the cost basis of each coin in the circulating supply. In other words, the Realized Cap measures the total amount of capital that the investors have used to buy their Bitcoin. The changes in the Realized Cap would, therefore, represent the capital inflows or outflows happening for the cryptocurrency. As the Growth Rate keeps track of how changes in the Realized Cap are reflecting in the Market Cap, it basically tells us about how reactive the market is being to capital flows. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 365-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin Growth Rate over the last decade or so: As is visible in the above graph, the 365-day MA Bitcoin Growth Rate has been at positive levels since early 2023. When the indicator has green values, it means that the Market Cap is growing at a rate faster than the Realized Cap. At present, the indicator is sitting at the 0.001 mark, which is a relatively high level. Thus, it would appear that capital inflows have been rapidly driving up the price recently. Historically, during periods of euphoria in the market, where Market Cap has exploded relative to the Realized Cap, tops have become more probable to take place. Related Reading: Litecoin In Uphill Battle: Strong Resistance Might Block Recovery From the chart, it’s apparent, though, that the recent levels of the metric, although high, have still been below the 0.002 mark beyond which corrections have become likely in the past. The Bitcoin all-time high (ATH) back in March, which has continued to be the top for the rally thus far, had also occurred when the Growth Rate had surged above this level. BTC Price Bitcoin had slipped under the $67,000 mark yesterday, but the asset has since seen a recovery push that has now taken its price back above $69,300.

Digital assets, once relegated to the periphery of technological curiosity, are now capturing substantial global investment. This burgeoning acceptance is propelled by the debut of Bitcoin ETFs in January and the anticipated arrival of Ethereum ETFs. These regulated investment vehicles provide a familiar and accessible gateway, catalyzing a significant influx of institutional capital.  The appeal of digital assets to institutional investors is manifold. Primarily, they present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to participate in the birth of a new asset class. Unlike any previous financial innovation, cryptocurrencies are forging a distinct market niche, offering unparalleled growth potential. They have the added advantage of helping to diversify investment portfolios.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We can see Bitcoin’s usefulness as a diversification tool by looking at Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq Composite. It has fluctuated, currently standing at 0.60 — up from 0.0 two months ago. Despite this recent rise, the average correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq Composite for 2024 remains at a modest 0.30. This relatively low correlation underscores crypto’s potential to act as a diversification tool, providing a hedge against the movements of traditional equities and enhancing the overall resilience of a well-balanced investment portfolio.  Source: The Block  Deciding which tokens merit inclusion, and in what proportions, is a pivotal consideration. Despite the proliferation of thousands of cryptocurrencies, only a select few warrant inclusion in institutional portfolios. Bitcoin and Ethereum, as industry stalwarts, are indispensable. Additionally, tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Chainlink (LINK) should be considered, albeit with careful, active management to mitigate potential risks. This balanced approach ensures that investments in digital assets are both judicious and resilient.  Investing in an index like the CoinDesk 20 offers several benefits, particularly in terms of diversification and risk management. By design, the CoinDesk 20 Index captures the performance of the top 20 digital assets by market capitalization, inherently reducing volatility compared to single asset crypto investments. This diversification mitigates the impact of sharp fluctuations in any one asset, providing a smoother investment experience. Quarterly rebalancing ensures the index remains representative of the broader market, adapting to changes and maintaining a balanced exposure to the evolving asset class.  Source: CoinDesk Indices  Navigating the crypto landscape presents significant challenges. Direct investment and self-custody demand a high degree of expertise and are not advisable for novice investors. For most, collaborating with a reputable asset manager is the most prudent course of action. Trusted asset managers streamline the investment process, making it easy and efficient. They guide institutional investors into strategies that make sense for their portfolios and handle the complexities of liquidity, custody, and security.  The crypto market has transcended its early reputation as a mere curiosity, emerging as a formidable force in the modern financial ecosystem. Visionary institutions are positioning themselves to capitalize on this burgeoning asset class. Proactive allocation of capital to digital assets now allows institutions to secure a substantial advantage as the market matures and cryptocurrencies become more integrated into the broader financial landscape. Despite the inherent challenges, digital assets offer diversification, significant growth potential, and the guidance of expert asset managers render the risks manageable and the opportunities too compelling to overlook.

42417927,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc2iD,1718207100,What ETF Approval Could Mean for Ethereum,"The SEC recent approval of ETH ETFs might eventually prove a more important event for Ethereum than it was for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s dominance, niche, and value proposition as a store of value are well-established and unlikely to be challenged in the near term. Ethereum, however, faces far stiffer competition, sometimes struggling to distinguish itself among narratives of smart contract platforms — until recently.  Now we know there are two major crypto assets likely not at risk of being called securities by U.S. regulators. This might not mean much for retail investors, especially outside the U.S., but clearing up the regulatory uncertainty will influence many institutional investors in considering chains to use, build and invest in.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Ethereum will likely continue dominating developer activity in the blockchain space, at least when it comes to large projects. According to Electric Capital’s Developer Report, Ethereum (and EVM chain in general) attracted vastly more developers than all other chains last year. The potential capital inflows from the ETFs, accessible institutional pathways like Coinbase’s BASE L2, and now this stamp of legitimacy could further strengthen its dominance.  From a project point of view, the Ethereum chain has a robust pipeline including EigenLayer, Ethena, and BlackRock’s BUIDL. Just Ethena synthetic dollar (USDe) alone amassed in a few months the entire market cap of stablecoins on Solana, a staggering $3 billion. This doesn’t mean that other chains won’t host important crypto projects – they certainly will. But only Ethereum (for now) hosts protocols with the history and track record necessary for institutions to participate with meaningful capital. Think of AAVE or Uniswap, for example.  Lastly, a higher ETH price could kick-start the Ethereum DeFi economy, setting off a powerful feedback loop. To take a simple example: just on AAVE, there is ~$9 billion of ETH-linked collateral (between wETH, wstETH, weETH), plus another $1 billion or so in L2s. Sure, some of this collateral is used for delta-neutral strategies like recursive lending and points farming, but most of it is likely not.  A higher ETH price – and collateral value – could act like a stimulus package for its crypto economy. It creates wealth effects, more spending, more investment, more leverage. Especially if ETH-related altcoins follow higher.  It’s too early to say, but we might look back at this moment when Ethereum establishes itself as the “Amazon” of the digital asset economy. If scenario unfolds (still a big “if”), it might relegate other smart contract layer 1s to niche players (like “Etsys”), even if still supporting thriving communities. It’s unclear (to me at least), whether this is the best path for the industry; perhaps a more balanced multi-chain world would ultimately maximize adoption – we may never know. But at this stage, Ethereum dominance sure looks like the most likely outcome.

These analysts predict that Bitcoin will soon rise and climb to a six-digit all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin To Rise To $100,000 Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin would rise to $100,000 on its next leg up. He claimed that this upward trend would begin in the next seven to ten days, stating that BTC will “absolutely giga send” when that time comes. The analyst made these remarks while suggesting that the worst was over for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Buying Pressure Reaches Critical Level Amid Massive Whale Buying He alluded to the “brutal” price correction that Bitcoin underwent shortly before and after the halving, with the flagship crypto experiencing a 20% price drop. As such, he believes that BTC is unlikely to decline that much again from its current price level. Instead, CrediBULL Crypto claimed that the downside is now limited to $60,000 and that, realistically, Bitcoin can’t drop below $62,000 and $63,000. Whatever happens, he expects the Bitcoin pump to begin in the next ten days, which would send it to $100,000. In another X post, CrediBULL Crypto stated that things were looking good for Bitcoin. He suggested that the bears would get shaken out of their positions once Bitcoin clears the asks that are above its current price level. He also noted that Bitcoin’s open interest is dropping a bit because the short positions are already starting to cover, and the spot premium is returning for the first time since May 20th. Interestingly, CrediBULL had earlier predicted that Bitcoin would experience a price decline to $66,000. He had made this prediction as part of a bigger picture, which would send BTC’s price rallying above $71,000 following the price correction. Seeing as the drop to $66,000 has occurred, CrediBULL suggested that it was time for the upward trend to begin. BitcBTCoin Still Headed For $173,000 Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto has given a more bullish price for prediction, stating that the next target for the flagship crypto is $173,000. He made this assertion while noting that Bitcoin’s current price action is currently mirroring its price action in the 2017 market cycle, consolidating around Fib 1.0 just like it did back then. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies 5 Altcoins To Buy That Could Be A Good Bet He highlighted that Bitcoin had four monthly candles followed by an “explosive fifth one” back in 2017. According to Egrag, the same thing is happening again, with Bitcoin already showing four monthly candles while consolidating around its previous ATH. As such, he believes the explosive fifth candle will come in July, just like in 2017.

42417921,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTc2az,1718203119,Should Banks Be Crime Fighters? The Hidden (and Not So Hidden) Costs,"“We are all Nigels now.”  That was former chief economist for the Bank of England Andy Haldane speaking at an event last month. He was referring to the closure last year of right-wing politician Nigel Farage’s account at upscale bank Coutts, for what Farage insisted were political reasons. In the resulting fuss, the bank’s CEO lost her job, Farage got an apology, and we all breathed a sigh of relief that we weren’t in his shoes (for many reasons besides the bank issues, I imagine).  There’s a strong chance we will be, however, at least in terms of banking struggles. Haldane was talking about his experience of being denied a bank account. Yes, a well-respected former high-ranking official of the U.K.’s bank regulator was not an acceptable bank customer. The reason given was that he was “politically connected.” It may be puzzling why that would be a problem, but the bank in question (any bank, really) had reasons that are both reasonable and nonsensical at the same time.  Noelle Acheson is a partner at Triple Crown Digital, an institutional digital assets advisory, and the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  The “reasonable” part comes from simple business economics. The “nonsensical” part is from rules that prevent banks from doing banking business, because of a “guilty until proven innocent” preference for prevention over freedom.  The culprit is anti-money laundering (AML) rules that have added layers and layers of costs, making many “normal” bank customers unprofitable.  Just close it down  Earlier this year, a parliamentary committee determined that, in 2023, the U.K.’s largest banks closed the accounts of more than 140,000 companies – that’s roughly 560 registered businesses losing banking access per working day. Many of these were no doubt financial scams, since the U.K. is a global haven for money laundering activities (in a speech a couple of weeks ago, the U.K.’s deputy foreign secretary claimed that 40% of the world’s “dirty money” passes through London). But all of them? I don’t think so.  Individuals are getting hit as well. By now we probably all know at least one person who has had banking issues because of crypto asset activity. Fintech author and advisor Chris Skinner published a post last month detailing the hours of back-and-forth with a bank representative questioning every payment going back years, because of some transfers to and from a licensed crypto exchange. Others have had accounts simply closed with no explanation.  This is not just happening in the U.K. Over the past few months, both Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been accused by state officials of politically motivated de-banking.  It’s not that the banks suspect the affected individuals or businesses of committing financial crime (okay, maybe sometimes, but usually not). And it’s not just the fear of a whopping fine for allowing money laundering (although this is a real and reasonable concern). It’s the running cost of certain account profiles, imposed by questionable AML rules.  The Financial Action Task Force, the global body entrusted with establishing coherent anti-money laundering rules, last year updated its 2012 “recommendations” which set out a long list of flags and prevention measures, the bulk of which relies on information gathering.  Essentially, for compliance and also insurance purposes, banks need to do a risk assessment on each client. These are not cheap and are often unprofitable, especially on small accounts, making it a better business decision to just not serve low-income customers.  Artists, authors, actors, freelancers and many others have erratic income. Drug dealers and money launderers also have erratic income. How can you tell them apart? Well, that kind of analysis will cost a lot of money, and you might get it wrong, so it’s less risky to just de-bank anyone without a steady salary.  And charities that accept foreign donations. How can you tell which transfers are legitimate and which might be from entities not subject to the same rigorous KYC? A bank could run diagnostics on each and every donation, or it could take the simpler and safer route and de-bank charities.  What about citizens living overseas? The rules require additional AML scrutiny on these, so it’s easier to not serve them (Barclays, to pick one example, stopped serving expats last year).  “Politically exposed” people are an official client category unto themselves, with additional risk assessment as well as surveillance requirements given the possibility of corruption. This category is not just limited to politicians – it also includes military officials, judges, executives of state-owned corporations, board members and senior management of international institutions, etc. Oh, and their families. If, say, your partner or your mother gets promoted to head of a regional aid organization, you could get de-banked. As I mentioned above, Andy Haldane was denied a bank account because he was “politically connected.” At the time, he was chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts.  British MPs are starting to protest the potential damage to national security. A Treasury Select Committee disclosed earlier this month that over 300 accounts belonging to ""public administration and defense"" companies were closed last year.  Zooming out, entire countries have had to cope with local branches of foreign banks closing en masse, cutting off access to the dollars or euros needed to pay for imports. This is especially acute in small islands with a tax-haven reputation. There may be heightened money laundering risk in servicing these communities, but this blanket “de-risking” policy hurts all sectors of the economy by blocking trade, foreign investment, remittances, borrowing capacity and more.  Even in developed economies, prioritizing crime prevention over equal treatment and opportunity is making it increasingly difficult to get and maintain a bank account, just as it is becoming increasingly impossible to participate in the economy without one. It’s not even a case of whether or not an individual or business is part of the digital economy. Just try paying taxes in cash.  And to highlight the hypocrisy, just over a year ago “financial inclusion” was made a priority for the G20 group of leading global economies.  The bigger cost  Of course, all this sounds very wrong. But from the banks’ point of view, it makes economic sense. After all, they are private businesses with profit-maximizing responsibilities to their shareholders. And compliance is expensive, especially for certain profiles.  A study last year estimated that following AML guidelines cost banks roughly £34.5 billion a year, double the £17.4 billion the government spends on policing all other crimes put together. This either eats into shareholder profits or gets passed on to customers – neither feels fair. And the numbers don’t take into account the social and personal cost for all those wracked with financial uncertainty, because of futile rules that few dare question.  Are these rules futile? Crime is impossible to effectively measure, intent even more so, which means we have no way of knowing just how much is prevented. But, to pick one example, a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report from 2022 showed that cocaine seizures in 2020 were more than double the 2010 level, and 5% higher than the previous year. Of course, this could mean that officials are better at tracing and seizure. But it’s more likely there’s just more drugs moving, and anyway, success at confiscation has little to do with money laundering. In other words, it’s hard to argue that crime – drugs, smuggling, sex trafficking, sanctions busting – is heading down, despite the heavy-handed and punitive approach.  Delegation of responsibility  The situation raises the question: why are banks shouldering this burden, rather than the relevant authorities? Holding banks responsible for what money is used for is akin to holding tollbooth operators responsible for what drivers do.  There are two answers. One is that they are the only ones who can, since they control the movement of money. Make the money hard to move by denying access to banking, the theory goes, and crime will crumble. Only, that hasn’t happened in over ten years of AML rules. And business activity as well as individual opportunity is curtailed in the application of generalities.  Another answer is that there could be systemic and reputational risk in handling dubious funds. Depositors shocked that their bank would stoop so low could decide to exit, triggering a bank run. But there is no evidence at all (and plenty of evidence to the contrary) that news of a bank handling illicit funds would upset clients. Over the past few years, AML-related fines have been levied against Wells Fargo, HSBC, TD Bank, Santander and Commerzbank, among many others. Have you heard about bank runs at these institutions? Denmark’s largest bank, Danske Bank, was accused in 2017 of what is probably the world’s largest money laundering scandal to date. No bank run.  And yet, the overbearing focus on prevention suggests that banks handling illicit funds would bring down the whole system. It doesn’t seem to matter if a meaningful chunk of the population is denied banking access as a result.  There is another way  It’s clear something has to change. The assumption that criminals will stop being criminals because it’s harder for them to send money is, well, naïve. And the current system of punishing the innocent in a futile effort to choke off the guilty exacerbates inequality (the rich are less likely to be de-banked, and tend to have more financial alternatives). In yet another example of over-regulation weakening a sector’s reach, it also incentivizes the search for alternative systems.  Of course, crypto is becoming an increasingly practical alternative. For now, we can’t pay taxes with crypto, or electricity bills or our Amazon orders. But I, for one, feel safer keeping a chunk of my meager wealth out of the reach of banks. It’s likely we’ll see more individuals and businesses realize the relative security in having access to an alternative savings and transaction system, especially as regulatory overreach always spreads in the absence of strong pushback.  And in a virtuous and exponential loop, any increase in the number of crypto users delivers network effects that encourage usability improvements, benefitting the ecosystem as a whole and drawing in even more users.  What’s more, increased use of such a network would be a gift to crime fighters, not criminals, given the relative simplicity of tracing movements. (I’m not suggesting this is simple, “relative” is the key word here, but blockchain forensic techniques are progressing fast).  The large money laundering scandals of recent years were possible because of lax documentation practices, opaque transaction information and a lack of communication between payment systems. The transparency and immutability of blockchain networks should help to identify actual crime.  While greater use of crypto assets would be positive, I live in hope that banking regulators will realize how much damage they’re doing. Blockchain rails are not a feasible solution for most, not yet anyway, and economic activity would be better served by banks focusing on banking, with customers free to conduct legitimate activity without fear.  What if, instead of passing on the colossal cost of crime prevention to private businesses (and ultimately their clients), authorities instead focused on fighting the crime? Money laundering itself does no damage – that is done by the activity that generates the illicit money, and the crime that money facilitates.  What if, instead of impeding the key bank business of handling funds, agencies focused on using flows to trace criminals and prosecute them at the source? In today’s disjointed financial network, it is not easy to bring disparate buckets of data together – but, going forward, AI could make that less onerous.  In sum, the current system of delegating crime prevention to banks draws on faulty assumptions (that banks should be responsible for policing, that prevention is more important than encouraging opportunity, that blocking transfers will stop crime) and does more harm than good.  Mercifully, an alternative is emerging, one that the authorities are finally recognizing they can’t shut down. Yet again, the crypto ecosystem steps up to the plate. Yet again, it helps us resist authoritarian overreach.  We should be glad this alternative exists. We can also be sad that it appears to be increasingly necessary.

29370104,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624186,1718200858,Bulls Takes Charge: XRP Price Undergoes Brief Recovery,"XRP has recently experienced a temporary recovery amidst ongoing market volatility. After a period of sustained downward pressure, XRP’s price has rebounded, offering a brief respite for traders and investors. This recovery comes amid a broader context of fluctuating market conditions, driven by various factors including regulatory developments, market sentiment, and overall cryptocurrency market trends. Despite this positive movement, the market remains highly unpredictable, and it is uncertain whether XRP’s recovery will be sustained in the long term. Investors are closely monitoring the situation, analyzing technical indicators and external factors to gauge the potential trajectory of XRP in the coming days. This introduction explores the factors behind XRP’s temporary recovery and the implications for its future performance in a volatile market environment. Technical Overview Of XRP Price Technically looking at the chart from the 1-hour chart, it can be observed that XRP is attempting a recovery move from its downward surge. This move, however, will lead to more drop in XRP as the price is trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The 1-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator also confirms this as the RSI line is currently moving toward the 50% level. Therefore the RSI line suggests that XRP’s price will move upward to a point where the price will begin to drop again. From the 4-hour chart, it can be observed that XRP is also attempting an upward recovery move after creating support at $0.4714. A final look at the chart with the 4-hour RSI indicator reveals that the price of XRP will still move upward for a while before continuing in its downward trend. The reason for this is that the RSI line is attempting an upward move out of the oversold zone. The Crypto Asset Poised For More Drop In conclusion, XRP’s recent temporary recovery amidst market volatility highlights the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Thus far, this recovery has led to XRP moving toward the 1-hour resistance level of 0.4887. If the price breaks above this level, it may move higher to test the $0.560 level. However, it should be noted that this is just a temporary move, as at some point the price will start declining again. When this happens, XRP will begin to move toward the $0.4714 support level. Should the asset break this level, it will continue to move downward to test the $0.4546 support level and may probably move on to test or create new levels. With a market capitalization of more than $26 billion and a trading volume of more than $1.2 billion as of the time of writing, the price of XRP is up by 0.04%, trading at around $0.4802 in the last 24 hours. XRP market cap and trading volume are currently down by 1.09% and 11.13% respectively.

On a year-over-year basis, CPI was up 3.3%, compared to analyst forecasts and the previous month's reading at 3.4%.  The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.2% in May, better than forecasts for a 0.3% rise and versus 0.3% in April.. Year-over-year, core CPI rose 3.4% against expectations for 3.5% and April's 3.6%..  Bitcoin {{BTC}} welcomed the soft inflation read, jumping to $69,400, up nearly 4% over the past 24 hours.  After inflation readings rapidly fell in 2022 and 2023 as the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates, the trend stalled in the previous months at stubbornly higher levels than policymakers' 2% target, pouring cold water on market participants' expectations of rate cuts.  Early this year, traders anticipated five or six 25 basis points (bps) cuts in 2024 by the end of December, which shrunk to one or two before today's CPI report with the first cut not happening until September, the CME FedWatch Tool showed.  Crypto prices have been ""highly sensitive"" to U.S. economic data recently, K33 Research noted in a report earlier this week. The recent hotter inflation figures and resulting diminished hopes for rate cuts propelled bitcoin's tumble from all-time high prices above $73,000 in March to below $57,000 in May. Traders anticipate that looser monetary conditions will fuel the crypto rally's next leg to record prices.  Contrasting the U.S. expectations, several key central banks globally have already started to lower benchmark rates with the European Central Bank and Bank of Canada cutting rates last week, which helped to propel the U.S. dollar index (DXY) to a one-month high.

The network has one of the largest user bases, judging by both MAU and DAU figures. Despite the large surge in coin price, SOL is actually trading at lower price to fees valuations than larger peers Ethereum and Binance. Since the fall of FTX in late 2022, the resurrection of Solana ( SOL-USD ) continues to be one of the more impressive turnaround stories in the digital asset market. At one point this chain looked to be in real trouble. Now at $68 billion, Solana commands a top 5 market capitalization and is the third highest ranked smart contract blockchain after Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Binance ( BNB-USD ). In my February article, I detailed the chain's NFT activity, DeFi health, and valuation - noting at the time that consumer utility is one of the primary things I look for in any cryptocurrency network. In this update, we'll look at how the stablecoin footprint, chain usage, and valuation relative to peers have progressed over the last few months. DeFi/Stablecoin Setup In February, I noted the growth of stablecoin supply on Solana relative to blockchain peers like Ethereum, Arbitrum ( ARB-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ). I primarily focused on the USDC ( USDC-USD ) portion of that stablecoin growth due to its usage in Visa's ( V ) pilot program. At that time, Solana's USDC supply was clearly growing faster than peers. For this update, rather than comparing what are fairly arbitrary dates around submission of my articles, I'll instead highlight the year over year growth of USDC on Solana at the end of May compared to peers. USDC Supply End of May 2023 End of May 2024 YoY Change Ethereum $23,577 $22,026 -6.6% Base $0 $3,004 N/A Arbitrum $1,145 $1,410 23.1% Solana $647.1 $2,212 241.8% Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) $620.7 $503.4 -18.9% Avalanche $554.9 $711.3 28.2% Total USDC $28,662 $32,034 11.8% Source: DeFi Llama, $ in millions In the table above, I'm showing Solana's year over year USDC supply growth at nearly 242%. With the exception of Coinbase's ( COIN ) L2 blockchain Base, Solana has exhibited the best supply growth of the Top 5 chains for USDC supply by far. Base has a bit of an unfair advantage here because Coinbase has a vested interest in seeing USDC supply move off of its centralized exchange and onto its L2 chain since the company generates sequencer fees from Base DEX swaps. The same can't be said for any of the other chains in this table. Given that, I view Arbitrum as a more natural peer for USDC liquidity than Base. Solana has indeed passed Arbitrum for USDC supply. Polygon has fallen out of the top 5 entirely. In my view, USDC liquidity is important because it allows for what could be viewed as more meaningful settlement volume than just memecoin trading - which is admittedly still a significant source of Solana's fee generation. But if public blockchain rails are going to ever disrupt more traditional payment processing firms like Block ( SQ ) or PayPal ( PYPL ), dollar-denominated liquidity is going to be an important metric to consider and Solana has one of the best stories in the market through this lens. Solana TVL (DeFi Llama) More broadly, Solana ranks 4th among all smart contract chains with $4.4 billion in Total Value Locked and $3 billion in total stablecoin supply when accounting for other stable offerings like Tether ( USDT-USD ). Something else to mention pertaining to Solana's DeFi footprint is the recent implementation with bridging network LayerZero. This will allow for more cross-chain operability between Solana and other blockchains which alleviates one of my primary concerns about Solana as a more closed off network where DEXes and protocols have generally served Solana's users and very few additional chains. In many ways, crypto can be a fragmented ecosystem and Solana's integration with LayerZero should help open up the network to additional users and liquidity. Chain Usage Two of the primary ways one can view blockchain usage is through metrics like active users and fees. Due to the fact that public blockchains are generally permissionless and active addresses aren't necessarily indicative of unique users, one must take some of this data with a grain of salt. But for comparative purposes, these are still important figures to consider. Monthly Active Users Comp (Token Terminal) As of article submission, Solana boasts the third highest monthly active user figure among all Layer 1 blockchains with 11.6 million MAUs. Looking at a longer length of time, the MAU trend has been borderline parabolic: MAU Trend (Token Terminal) At the end of May 2023, monthly active users settled at 3.2 million according to data from Token Terminal. That figure surge over 184% to 9.1 million at the end of May 2024 and has continued higher to start June even as trading volume has come down in each of the last two months. Fees for May still came in at $46.8 billion - which is roughly 40x what Solana's fees were last May. Shifting to daily active users, or DAUs, we can observe a similar trajectory: Monthly DAU trend (Artemis) Solana's monthly aggregated DAUs have surged up to 1.6 million in June. This puts it only behind Tron ( TRX-USD ) and Near Protocol ( NEAR-USD ) for the most active user base. Valuations Since SOL is primarily a gas token that is used to pay for transactions on the blockchain, I like to view the coin's valuation through price to fees multiples. There are two ways to look at that. The circulating supply price to fees and the fully diluted supply price to fees. I don't currently have a strong preference among the two but both show a similar trend lower: Price to Fees Ratio (Token Terminal) After having been one of the more expensive L1 blockchains by fully diluted price to fees at nearly 5,000x in early 2021, Solana's fully diluted P/F ratio is currently sitting at 160x. SOL is now cheaper than both Ethereum and Binance, which trade at 159x and 756x fully diluted fees respectively. Market Cap to Settled Volume (Artemis) Solana also trades at much lower market cap to settled volume ratio compared to what it did in previous years. SOL closed May at a MC to Settled Vol ratio of just 0.7. This was a 50% reduction in that ratio compared to May 2023 despite the price of Solana appreciating by nearly 650% over the last year: Data by YCharts The takeaway here is that despite the massive surge in SOL's price, the coin's valuation has actually improved dramatically due to how much volume the network is settling. Risks Public blockchain networks are inherently risky. Being generous, the value of these coins will move dependent on how much utility the networks have. The less generous explanation is asset prices are dependent on speculative trading and usage booms that may only be temporary. Solana's blockchain brings in additional risk because it's viewed as a highly centralized blockchain and could theoretically face tougher regulatory scrutiny because of that. This centralization concern is evidenced by the fairly regular pauses in the chain to battle things like network bugs. Investor Takeaways I continue to be impressed by Solana's turnaround story. Solana is certainly not the only crypto network that enjoyed a surge in usage in recent months. But given the low fees and fast processing of transactions, there is a clear incentive for users and merchants to adopt such a network if both regulatory clarity domestically and application interfaces improve. For long term bulls, I now think Solana is a borderline must-own in any crypto portfolio. It's a chain with consumer usage and a comparatively low valuation relative to other networks despite the high flying coin price. As long as valuations stay low and usage remains stable, I think dips in SOL are buys.",POSITIVE,SOL | USDC,BLOCKCHAIN | SOL | TRADING | ZRX | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698733-solana-improved-valuation-despite-a-600-percent-rally-sol-usd?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29365631.jpeg

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin has stabilized following its plunge below $67,000 on Tuesday, with traders awaiting the latest key macroeconomic reports from the U.S. BTC nudged upward toward $68,000 during the late European morning, an increase of 1.3% in the last 24 hours. Ether meanwhile rose around 0.2% to sit just under $3,550. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the broader digital asset market, is about 0.25% higher in the last 24 hours. Attention will be on the CPI data, due today, from the U.S. and the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will indicate the Fed's monetary policy.  Bitcoin ETFs recorded a second straight day of outflows on Tuesday, with $200 million exiting the 11 spot products in the U.S., the highest since May 1. Grayscale's GBTC, as it often is, was the worst affected, with outflows of $120 million. ARK 21Shares' ARKB, Bitwise's BITB and VanEck's HODL's outflows ranged from $57 million to $7 million. ""Markets are [in] risk-off mode ahead of CPI and FOMC tomorrow. This month's FOMC will also release the Dot Plot, which informs the market how many cuts the Fed anticipates for the rest of 2024,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast message. However, the firm added that its long-term view is bullish ""despite short-term headwinds.""  Donald Trump said he wants all remaining bitcoin to be ""made in the U.S.A.,"" having met with executives from mining companies CleanSpark and Riot. The Republican presidential candidate referred to bitcoin mining as the U.S.' ""last line of defense against a CBDC,"" adding that President Biden's ""hatred of bitcoin"" is beneficial to China and Russia. ""We want all the remaining Bitcoin to be MADE IN THE USA!!! It will help us be ENERGY DOMINANT,"" Trump wrote in a post on the social media platform Truth Social late on Tuesday. Data suggests that more bitcoin is already mined in the U.S. than any other country, with 37.84% of the network's total hash power. Trump's post indicates he wants this figure to be much higher.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin has come under pressure since Friday, decoupling from Nasdaq, which has hit fresh record highs.  Nasdaq might follow bitcoin lower if the impending U.S. CPI for May blows past expectations.

29363007,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624179,1718190028,Ex-Ripple Director Explains XRP Price Slide Amid Good News,"Via X, Sean McBride, a former director at Ripple, offered an analysis of the perplexing downtrend of the XRP price despite a series of ostensibly positive developments surrounding Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). McBride’s insights come at a time when XRP’s underperformance in a bullish market continues to baffle investors and industry observers alike. Why Is XRP Price Down Despite A Slew Of Positive News? Despite recent bullish periods in the broader crypto market, XRP has notably failed to capitalize on these gains. In a conversation with X users, McBride attributed this lackluster performance to the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), highlighting the critical impact of impending judicial decisions on XRP’s valuation. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Rally 50,000% To $250, Here’s When On July 13, 2023, Judge Torres’s ruling that XRP is not a security led to a temporary surge by 100% to $0.93, demonstrating the market’s sensitivity to legal developments. However, eleven months later, XRP’s price has halved, reflecting ongoing concerns about the possible long-term implications of the SEC’s actions and the potential for an appeal, which McBride acknowledges could happen unless the ruling is unfavorable to Ripple. “Nothing significant is going to happen with the price of XRP until Judge Torres makes her decision. So anyone expecting anything different is delusional,” McBride explained, adding “once Torres makes her decision, I think we find out a bit more about what’s actually behind the curtain. This could open up the door for US institutions working with Ripple to ‘flip the switch’. We will just have to wait and see if that’s the case.” Despite the overshadowing legal drama, Ripple has not been short on positive news. Recently, Ripple announced the creation of the XRPL Japan and Korea Fund on June 11, 2024, a significant initiative with an allocation of 1 billion XRP aimed at catalyzing the growth and development of the XRPL ecosystem in East Asia. Additionally, Ripple’s strategic acquisitions have been notable. The company has successfully finalized its acquisition of Standard Custody & Trust Company. In May 2023, Ripple further expanded its services by acquiring blockchain firm Metaco for $250 million, and in April, it announced plans to launch a stablecoin aimed at bolstering the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP At $0.75 In July Despite Year-Long Slump Commenting on these strategic shifts by Ripple, McBride noted, “Ripple is perfect, they don’t make any mistakes. Their executives fart rainbows. Everything they have done turns to gold. Wake the f*ck up people. If you think that’s how Ripple operates, you’re sorely mistaken. They are vocally self-critical, employees have backbone; disagree and commit. Ripple has changed their strategy many times.” Notably, Ripple has been proactive in securing over 40 Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs), necessary for its payment operations across the United States. “The next big piece of this is clear legislation in the US. Hopefully that is on the way with the recent developments in Congress and Trump’s commitment to Crypto (assuming he becomes President),” McBride remarked. In response to a user’s inquiry about the likelihood of an SEC appeal if Ripple receives a favorable ruling, McBride commented, “Shouldn’t stop what’s happening in the US from happening, IMO, unless of course the ruling is not in Ripple’s favor.” Addressing another user’s observation about a perceived shift in his tone regarding Ripple and XRP, McBride reassured, “No, not at all. I’m still very positive on Ripple and XRP. I’m a big fan, but that doesn’t mean I’m blind to the realities of what’s happening.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.4818.

The meme coin, known for its association with the adorable Shiba Inu dog breed, has lost nearly 14% of its value in the past seven days, raising concerns about its future. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? Bearish Signals Fill The Air Technical indicators often used to gauge market sentiment are flashing red for SHIB. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) currently sit at 38 and 35, respectively. While these values suggest the asset might be oversold and ripe for a rebound, other indicators paint a bleaker picture. The Elder Ray Index, which measures the strength of buyers versus sellers, has been firmly in negative territory since June last week, indicating a clear dominance of bears in the market. The current technical outlook for SHIB is bearish. The lack of buying pressure combined with strong selling momentum suggests the price could drop further in the short term. Analysts expect to see SHIB retreating to the $0.000020 mark. Is The Howl Of The Crowd Fading? NewsBTC’s analysis also highlights a potential decline in investor interest for the self-proclaimed “Dogecoin Killer”. This waning enthusiasm could be a significant contributing factor to the price drop. The meme coin’s initial surge to prominence relied heavily on social media hype and community-driven movements. However, with the overall cryptocurrency market experiencing a correction, and meme coins facing increased scrutiny, the “Shiba Army” might be losing some of its steam. While the immediate future appears bleak for SHIB, a complete collapse isn’t entirely out of the question. Market sentiment could trigger a price rebound. If bulls regain control and investor confidence returns, SHIB could potentially climb back up to the $0.000024 mark. However, analysts warn that this scenario hinges heavily on unforeseen market forces and a renewed wave of community support. SHIB Price Forecast Meanwhile, with a projected value of $0.00007 by July 12, 2024, the present analysis of Shiba Inu (SHIB) points to a large potential price growth of 226%. But even with this bullish price forecast, the technical indications show that the market is still pessimistic. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Headed For Reversal?

42408074,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9DeQ,1718186400,MetaMask Adds 'Pooled Staking' for Cheaper Ethereum Validation,"MetaMask, the most popular wallet for Ethereum, will roll out a ""pooled staking"" feature to its users beginning this week, in a move that would make it cheaper to contribute to the blockchain network's security compared to running a full validator node.  The new feature will allow users to participate in Ethereum staking – a popular crypto investment strategy that involves parking tokens in an address on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. For ""proof-of-stake"" blockchains like Ethereum, staking is the primary way that the network is kept secure.  “With Pooled Staking, MetaMask users now have an easy way to stake ETH in enterprise-grade  validators while maintaining full control of their ETH, earning rewards and making Ethereum more secure,” Matthieu Saint Olive, senior product manager at MetaMask developer Consensys, said in a statement.  Staking on Ethereum conventionally requires users to tie up 32 ETH with the network, which at current market prices totals some $112,000. ""Pooled"" services like Lido, Rocket Pool and now MetaMask give more users access to staking by bundling together assets from various people, making it possible for anyone to stake even if they don't have 32 ETH.  Read more: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking?  MetaMask's staking feature may come as a welcome surprise to some retail traders who want to stake, trade and monitor their staking investment in one interface.  But Consensys is playing catch-up with industry peers: MetaMask is far from the first crypto wallet to introduce staking, and it is missing some of the functionality that has helped to differentiate incumbent pooled staking platforms.  Most glaringly, Lido and Rocket Pool offer users receipts on their deposits called ""liquid staking tokens"" that can be borrowed, loaned or re-invested into decentralized finance protocols. LSTs like Lido staked ETH (stETH) are among the more popular assets in crypto trading.  MetaMask doesn't plan to offer its own LST as part of its pooled staking service.  The new staking feature will not be available in the U.S. or UK, according to Consensys.  ""The team aims to bring it to market in these regions as well,"" the company said in its statement.

Marathon Digital's technical outlook is murky with deteriorating conditions, but long-term bullishness remains. MARA stock's growth in hash rate and reward share post-halving shows potential for future success, making the current stock price a potential bargain. The Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) saga for 2024 continues, as the OG alt-coin remains very near its all-time highs. We know the halving took place a couple of months ago, to much fanfare, but not a huge amount of actual impact on the price of the coin. For miners, it's been a wild ride, but with the halving obviously very well telegraphed in terms of both timing and impact, it was priced in. I've covered miner Marathon Digital ( MARA ) a few times, and I've generally been bullish on the stock. Most recently, I covered Marathon after its earnings report in late February, noting the potential for a bullish technical pattern. That potential didn't materialize, and instead, we got a big selloff into long-term support at ~$14. Three-plus months on - and with the halving behind us - what is the outlook for Marathon now? I still like Marathon long-term as a miner that's taking share, mining efficiently, and holding a ton of Bitcoin in treasury, but for the short term, the outlook is a bit murky. Watch long-term support With the failure of the potential breakout earlier this year, Marathon has continued its consolidation. There's been an uptrend channel forming since April, but pre-market action this morning threatens to break that channel, as well as sending the stock below both of the major moving averages. StockCharts With this deteriorating technical condition in mind, I cannot objectively look at this chart and be bullish short-term. For now, the PPO is above the centerline, which is bullish, but the price action simply doesn't look very good. On the daily chart, then, I'm seeing cause for caution and waiting to take a position. The closer it gets to the support level at $14/$15, the better the buy it is. Of course, if that support level is broken, all bets are off from a long perspective, but for now, I'm neutral on the daily chart. Obviously, the price of Bitcoin is important for any miner, so let's check in on Marathon's action relative to the coin itself. We'll start with the 20-day correlation of Marathon to Bitcoin to ensure that they do indeed trade with each other. StockCharts We can see the correlation today is 0.80, but it actually went negative ahead of the halving. I wouldn't expect that condition to happen a lot, or persist for long when it does, but it's always a good idea to validate any assumptions of correlation. For now, they are pretty highly correlated. Next, let's take a look at the price of Marathon relative to Bitcoin, which is a measure I like to use for Bitcoin miners. StockCharts Marathon's valuation has plummeted relative to Bitcoin by 61% since the start of the year, which doesn't guarantee us anything, but we can see these periods of low relative valuation have generally resolved higher. These moves have been temporary in some cases, but from a fundamental perspective, this looks much better than it did in December or January. Finally, I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the look of Bitcoin itself right now, which, as we've seen, should have a large impact on the price of Marathon. StockCharts We have several attempts to break the ~$72k level that have all failed, as well as an ascending triangle that has now failed. The PPO is in positive territory but declining, so the price of Bitcoin itself is not something I see a lot of reason to be super bullish on at the moment. Let me be clear in stating that I remain a Bitcoin bull for 2024. I think we're going to see big new highs well clear of $72k, but given the look right now on the chart, I don't think that's going to be particularly soon. Like the chart of Marathon, I'm neutral on Bitcoin until we get some clarity on the next big move. Marathon's place in a competitive environment I've covered Marathon's growth story before, but it's a nice point in the year after the halving to check in on progress. Investor presentation The company is on track to boost its hash rate to ~50 EH/s by the end of next year, which would be about double what it started 2024 with. That's a lot of capacity growth, but what matters is the company's ability to maintain or take share from others on the network that are trying to do the same thing. Investor presentation Marathon has rapidly gained share over the past several quarters, ending 2023 at 4.4%. In May , the first full month after the halving, the company produced 616 Bitcoin for a share of 4.2%. While that's lower than the Q4 2023 tally, it's still in the ballpark, and keep in mind that Marathon has huge capacity upgrades coming. I suspect we'll see reward share creep towards 5% in the coming quarters, but we'll have to see. If I'm right about that, the current share price of ~$19 will likely prove to be a bargain, but that's dependent upon Bitcoin pricing improving and the company continuing to take share. If you end up taking a position in Marathon, this is a critical measure you want to keep an eye on. Wrapping up My long-term bullishness on Bitcoin and Marathon has not changed. However, we have to take the market we have, not the market we want, and I see short-term weakness on both charts. On a technical analysis basis, I'm neutral on both securities. From a fundamental perspective, I still like Marathon, and I think the stock is much more attractive than it was in February. The valuation is much cheaper relative to Bitcoin, it continues to take share in rewards, and it owns almost 18k Bitcoin as it has rapidly ramped up its holdings of coins, rather than selling them. That hoard is worth about $1.2 billion today, and long-term debt has declined from almost $800 million to just over $300 million. I'm going to maintain a buy rating on Marathon because I think the issues the stock has are likely temporary, and longer-term, I still believe $19 will prove to be a good entry price. The caveat is that for the short-term, we may see a trip close to that critical $14/$15 support level.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698808-marathon-digital-time-to-consider-accumulating-mara-stock?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29360071.jpeg

42408073,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9Dhj,1718185853,U.S. CPI and Fed Meeting: Things to Watch Out as BTC Nurses Losses,"Dollar index, bitcoin at the mercy of core inflation, housing rent and Fed's take on inflation trajectory.  Investment banks expects a decline in the housing rent.  A hotter-than-expected CPI could shock risk assets.  Wednesday could prove to be a make-or-break day for markets, as the pivotal U.S. consumer price index report will be released just hours before the Federal Reserve's meeting.  The Labor Department's CPI, due at 12:30 UTC, is expected to show the cost of living increased by 0.1% in May, following April's 0.3% increase, according to FactSet. That would keep the annual inflation rate steady at 3.4%. Meanwhile, the core figure, excluding the volatile food and energy metrics, is forecast to rise 0.3% for May, matching April's pace.  Later, at 18:00 UTC, the Fed is expected to keep the benchmark borrowing cost unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5% and publish the interest rate dot plot chart. The inflation data is expected to influence the dot plot projections and Powell's post-meeting communique.  Here are key things to watch out for that could influence the dollar index and bitcoin.  Core inflation, rent price growth  Per investment banks, the risk for the core CPI is to the downside.  ""Core (excluding food and energy) price growth is also expected to edge down to 3.5% (from 3.6% in April) on a more normal-looking 0.2% month-over-month increase. Home rent price growth should also slow alongside a lower month-over-month increase in the core services ex-rent measure that Fed policymakers have been watching closely,"" RBC's economists wrote in a preview.  Per ING, some economists foresee that Owners' Equivalent Rent - the intangible component with a 40% weight in the core CPI basket - will finally come lower.  Potential easing in shelter price pressures, one of the sources of stickiness in inflation in recent months, might rev up Fed rate cut hopes, sending the dollar lower. A weaker dollar often accompanies a rally in risk assets, including bitcoin.  The dollar will likely surge if the month-on-month core CPI tops 0.4%, according to JPMorgan.  Bitcoin has come under pressure since Friday, losing over 5% to trade near $67,350, according to CoinDesk data. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's value against major currencies, has risen by 1% to 105.20.  Fed statement  A status quo rate decision is likely a foregone conclusion, and so is the interest protection chart, which is expected to show two rate cuts this year instead of three. Since Friday's hotter-than-expected payrolls data, markets have priced out odds of more than two rate cuts this year.  As such, the focus will be on the central bank's take on the inflation trajectory.  ""Should the Fed remove the sentence 'in recent months, there has been a lack of further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective' from its statement, short-dated U.S. [Treasury] yields and the dollar could drop,"" ING said in a note sent to clients early Wednesday.  ""Chair Powell typically delivers a dovish press conference and the dollar has ended lower on the day over the last four consecutive FOMC meetings,"" ING said. ""we would have to see some shock 0.4% MoM core CPI number or a more hawkish Powell to get DXY anywhere near the 105.90/106.00 area. We see that as unlikely.""  This year, bitcoin has consistently seen price pullbacks in the lead-up to the Fed decision, only to resume the uptrend after the event.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/12/us-cpi-and-fed-meeting-things-to-watch-out-as-btc-nurses-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1f46b1fc86e3d929b48f436f9673da11a298191d-4897x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analysts are split on the cryptocurrency’s immediate future, with some predicting a bullish breakout and others bracing for a bearish correction. Related Reading: Solana Searching For Direction: Will SOL Break Free Or Fall Flat? Analyst Buckles Up For A Reversal One analyst, known by the moniker Trend Rider, has taken an optimistic stance. They’ve identified a technical pattern suggesting a potential trend reversal for ADA. This pattern involves an initial price surge followed by a pullback, a scenario mirrored by several other cryptocurrencies recently. $ADA had a brief pump and then corrected, just like all other coins. Based on the facts, I see it lacks momentum. On the chart, I’ve marked the key levels: 🟢Zone for longs: $0.36–$0.40 📈Key price to start reversing the trend: $0.50 Note: Daily Timeframe pic.twitter.com/3fH7xI08Ke — Trend Rider (@TrendRidersTR) June 10, 2024 Trend Rider believes a key breakout point lies at $0.50. Surpassing this level could signal a significant shift in momentum, potentially ushering in a new uptrend for ADA. Furthermore, they’ve identified a buying zone between $0.36 and $0.40, suggesting this could be a favorable entry point for investors seeking long positions. Analyst Averages Offer Tentative Midpoint Adding another layer to the complexity is the average price prediction from various crypto analysts. These predictions collectively suggest an average price of $0.422 for ADA in June 2024, with a range between $0.405 and $0.439. This midpoint prediction positions ADA precariously close to its current price, offering little guidance for investors seeking decisive direction. ADA Price Forecast The current analysis of Cardano (ADA) indicates a potential price increase of 5.00%, potentially reaching $0.446851 by July 12, 2024. Despite this optimistic price projection, the technical indicators suggest a bearish market sentiment. This is further corroborated by the Fear & Greed Index, which currently reads 72, signifying a state of greed in the market. Over the past 30 days, Cardano has experienced a moderate level of volatility at 3.52%, and only 40% of those days have been positive, indicating limited bullish momentum. Related Reading: Blood In The Water? Ethereum Whales Circle As Price Drops Given the prevailing market conditions and sentiment indicators, it appears that now is not an opportune time to invest in Cardano. The bearish sentiment and high greed level suggest a potential market correction or increased risk of downside volatility.

Ultimately, the fate of ADA’s price hinges on a confluence of factors beyond the realm of pure technical analysis. Regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and broader market sentiment will all play a role in shaping ADA’s trajectory.

42408067,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9DHH,1718178985,"Bitcoin ETFs See $200M Net Outflows in Fed, CPI Jitters","U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded the second consecutive day of outflows driven by Grayscale's GBTC.  The outflows are likely due to traders derisking ahead of U.S. CPI and the Fed rate decision.  U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a second-straight day of outflows as traders likely derisked ahead of key macroeconomic reports scheduled for later Wednesday.  Data from SoSoValue shows the eleven ETFs recorded $200 million in net outflows on Tuesday, the highest since May 1 figures of $580 million. Redemptions came amid a BTC sell-off, during which the asset briefly tumbled to $66,200 before recovering.  Grayscale’s GBTC accounted for most of the $120 million in outflows, leading among its counterparts. GBTC continues its infamous run of being the worst-performing ETF by outflows since going live in January, racking up a cumulative $18 billion in outflows.  Ark Invest’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC and VanEck’s HODL recorded outflows ranging from $56 million to $7 million. None of the ETFs saw any inflows.  Traders said the outflows were likely derisking action ahead of the CPI reading on Wednesday and the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that ends today, during which the Fed’s monetary policy will be decided.  “Markets are [in] risk-off mode ahead of CPI and FOMC tomorrow. This month's FOMC will also release the Dot Plot, which informs the market how many cuts the Fed anticipates for the rest of 2024,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast message.  However, the firm added that its long-term bullish view remained intact.  “Despite short-term headwinds, we think this might be a good opportunity to accumulate coin. Bullish events on the horizon, such as the eventual ETH spot ETF going live along with Biden and Trump in a verbal armsrace to win the crypto vote,” QCP said.  Additional headwinds are Treasury secretary Janet Yellen’s speech on Friday, which may cause a reaction in riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies based on comments, as previously reported.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/12/bitcoin-etfs-see-200m-net-outflows-in-fed-cpi-jitters,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27b53cfa82766953ae1a35280e08d80682d4961f-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

29353052,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624146,1718175934,"Bitcoin Is ‘Still Significantly Undervalued,’ Says Finance Guru Bill Miller IV","In his latest blog post titled “Why I’m Still Betting on Bitcoin,” financial expert and seasoned investor Bill Miller IV, CFA, CMT, Chairman and CIO of Miller Value Partners, reiterated his bullish stance on Bitcoin. According to Miller, who is the Chairman, CIO of Miller Value Partners and son of legendary investor Bill Miller III, Bitcoin remains in the early stages of a secular transition in global capital and governance perspectives. Bitcoin: It’s Still Early Miller’s analysis begins with a reflection on a thesis he first introduced in 2015 in his paper, “A Value Investor’s Case for…Bitcoin?!”. He argued that Bitcoin held potential far beyond its valuation at the time, either as a revolutionary payment network or as a viable alternative to traditional fiat capital. Fast forward to today, Miller observes Bitcoin’s ascendancy but maintains that its journey is far from over. His current valuation places Bitcoin’s market capitalization at about $1.5 trillion, a figure he considers minuscule compared to the nearly quadrillion-dollar global fiat capital system. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $67,000: Key Reasons “Despite Bitcoin recently hitting new highs against every fiat currency, I believe Bitcoin today is still significantly undervalued and that the world is likely in the early stages of a secular shift around how humans think about capital and its governance,” Miller writes. He points out the inadequacies of current monetary systems, which are prone to human error and manipulation, often leading to the devaluation of currency through inflation and mismanagement. Supporting his argument, Miller references “Broken Money” by Lyn Alden, which outlines the historical precedence for superior monetary technologies eventually eclipsing their outdated counterparts. Alden’s analysis suggests that when people are presented with better options for preserving or growing their financial resources, they will invariably gravitate towards those options. “History shows that the best monetary technology inevitably wins, as people trade inferior depreciating capital technologies for superior ones that better align with users’ goal of preserving or growing their option set over time,” writes Miller. Bitcoin, with its decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger, offers a robust alternative to the governance-laden fiat systems. Miller also delves deeper into the technical and philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin, describing it as a “true technological breakthrough.” Unlike traditional monetary systems, Bitcoin operates on a global scale without the need for centralized control, enabling transactions that are resistant to censorship and confiscation. This property alone, according to Miller, radically changes the dynamics of how property rights are transferred and managed across borders and generations. Related Reading: Is Now The Time To Buy Bitcoin? Latest Chart Analysis Says Yes – Here’s Why He also comments on the general public’s struggle to understand and value revolutionary technologies, citing the substantial returns generated by companies like NVIDIA, Google, and Meta as examples of what happens when new paradigms are embraced. “Humans are notoriously bad at contextualizing the relevance and potential of new technologies,” Miller states, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s case is no different. “This gap is especially wide for groundbreaking concepts of an epistemic nature – that is, inventions that change the way we think about and relate to information and each other. It also explains why NVIDIA, Google and Meta have generated outsized returns relative to other stocks,” Miller states. In a compelling conclusion to his argument, Miller acknowledges the inherent risks and volatility associated with Bitcoin. As a technology and asset class that is still in its developmental phase, it faces potential shifts in perception and regulatory landscapes. However, he warns that underestimating Bitcoin’s long-term potential could be as harmful as ignoring the early signs of any major technological shift. “It’s still early,” concludes Miller, suggesting that the journey for Bitcoin is just beginning. He remains confident that as the world continues to grapple with the limitations of fiat currencies and the possibilities presented by digital assets, Bitcoin’s true value will eventually be realized, reflecting its capacity to redefine the fabric of economic systems worldwide. This stance not only reinforces his investment strategy but also serves as a bold forecast for the future of finance. At press time, BTC traded at $67,406.

42408081,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9E8B,1718166600,In Conversation With Brian Nelson,"Last October, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) – the U.S. Treasury Department's money laundering watchdog – announced a proposal to label crypto mixers as a ""primary money laundering"" concern, a move that alarmed a broad swath of the crypto industry. Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson addressed this move and more at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 last month in Austin, Texas on stage. The following transcript has been lightly edited (and the bulk of my questions have been slimmed down to their gist).  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  'This is not a ban on mixers'  The narrative  Brian Nelson is a senior Treasury Department official focused on both money laundering and sanctions issues. He's addressed and overseen actions taken both by FinCEN and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Last month, he joined me on stage at Consensus.  Why it matters  Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson discussed Treasury's proposed rulemakings and other issues on stage in Austin last month.  Breaking it down  Nikhilesh De: I just want to give you a chance to really just introduce yourself and talk about what you're doing and why you're here.  Brian Nelson: So, first of all, thank you for having me. And some of you may know, I am the Under Secretary for Terrorism, Financial Intelligence at the Department of the Treasury, which has the responsibility for managing both our Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers U.S. sanctions, as well as our Financial Crime Enforcement Network that administers the Bank Secrecy Act and all of the AML/CFT [anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism] obligations financial institutions have to comply with that are operating here in the United States. I also have offices that do international policy work, because what we have discovered in this space, both in terms of our sanctions authorities, as well as our AML/CFT authorities, is that we need to do that with partners and in a way that is directionally aligned with setting global standards. And then lastly, we have an office of intelligence analysis, intelligence office that really is the foundation for so much of the work that we're able to do,  I thought I would just take a couple of minutes to level-set a little bit about the work that we're doing in the space that's most relevant to you all and, and give you a sense of where we're going. So I know, across a number of sessions for this year, there's really been a guiding principle focused on innovation and ensuring privacy, while also mitigating those risks. And of course, I'm primarily interested in those risks associated with illicit finance. As I said, one of the reasons why I am here and why we have so much industry engagement is because this work requires that we all have a firm understanding of the threats and risks and vulnerabilities associated with any of these products and services, including, of course, financial services. I'll announce – maybe some of you all have seen it – but today, we published a risk assessment on non-fungible tokens or NFTs. It really identifies that NFT and NFT platforms, while rarely used for terrorists or proliferation financing, are really highly susceptible to the use and fraud and scams, and many of these traditional schemes that involve NFTs which can be of course stolen from victims, and then use to launder proceeds generated from illicit activities. I would just encourage you all to read it if you haven't had a chance to read it yet, and it just dropped a couple of hours ago. It really builds on national risk assessments that we've done in the context of money laundering, proliferation, financing and terrorism financing over the course of this year, and all of these NRAS noted that we are really continuing to observe that digital assets are being abused by those actors that you would expect. So these are North Korean cyber criminals as well as ransomware actors. And they're doing this to generate revenue and launder their illicit proceeds.  We've also identified some newer trends within the digital asset ecosystem, which includes a sharp rise in investment scams. I think you all are familiar with pig butchering. This was something that was relatively new to me, as well, last year, but we're really seeing that is generating quite a bit of losses as well as other investment schemes that have accounted for 75% of internet enabled investment fraud, as of 2023, and those losses totaled over two and a half billion dollars. We've also observed the increased use of stable coins, notably tethers USD T by sanctioned person scammers and terrorist groups. And a key theme across all of that is that bad actors are seeking out those jurisdictions. And those products where there are weak or insufficient AML/CFT, or sanctions, compliance programs, and some virtual assets, service providers are sort of outright failing to meet their compliance obligations. So all of this, I think, emphasizes the importance of our engagement with you and your companies, as well as, from my perspective, how significant a national security risks, some of this activity really poses to the United States. Just a last word, and then want to get to the conversation. You may have seen late last year, we, along with our colleagues at the Department of Justice, and the CFTC, took an enforcement action against Binance, which of course, is the world's largest virtual assets service provider. We did that because of the extraordinary amount of illicit activity we received through Binance. And their failure to meaningfully manage an AML/CFT compliance program, particularly as it related to U.S. persons. And it really reflects our desire to create an environment that incentivizes compliance, and that's through education as well as enforcement, additional regulatory clarity, and all of that, again, really requires that we work collaboratively together. So I'm happy to be here and in that spirit, I've told you a lot about what we're doing. I'm excited to have this conversation and reflect some more on the way ahead. Awesome.  I think the area I want to start with is most recently, you mentioned the report on NFTs. How do you build on that? Can you just speak to you know, what's the next steps? What will you do with this information now that you've put it together?  That's a great question. And really, we identified NFTs as a particular source of risk back in 2022, when we released the risk assessment, as it relates to the digital asset ecosystem, broadly and committed that we would take a closer look at this asset class in particular, recognizing that NFTs and MT platforms are hard to define because they have the capacity to do a number of things. And of course, in 2022, the sort of NFT marketplace was going way up, it went down and, it's sort of come back up a little bit over the last number of months. But I think it reflects that absent, you know, sort of whatever the market movements are, we perceive, given the risk of abuse by illicit actors that we need to emphasize doing a number of things, one, creating the shared understanding through our risk assessment, which is really to communicate to stakeholders in industry, but obviously, across our government and with international partners, acknowledge that there's probably work that we need to do to better clarify how our regulatory authorities and AML/CFT compliance relates to NFTs. We need to do more things like this, which is enhanced stakeholder engagement, which we are committed to do. And, you know, sort of I think critically, from what I see is the sort of this jurisdictional arbitrage. So it's the capacity for virtual assets, service providers, you know, other actors within the virtual asset ecosystem to build companies that really don't have that compliance tone from the top technology to manage illicit finance risks. So working with foreign jurisdictions to have a shared understanding of the best way to regulate NFTs internationally, with sort of one clearly understood standard is another way for err that we identified in this report. Gotcha.  One thing that I think was really controversial within crypto circles was the NPRM, the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, last year on crypto mixers and potentially treating them as areas of primary money laundering concern. Can you speak to the feedback you've received, the risks that you're trying to address and then where you might go from here?  We had a proposed rule that would require financial institutions to report information about transactions with crypto mixers. That comment period has now closed, we received a number of those comments, and we are, of course, working through them in order to promulgate a final rule. So I'll just make a couple of points about our concern about mixers and what I see is the road ahead. I mean, in the first instance, I think, from our perspective, we believe that there is a difference between sort of obfuscation and anonymity enhancing services and those that support privacy. And we, of course, totally recognize that, in the context of public blockchains, which provides information about financial transactions, that there would be a desire to have a certain degree of privacy around those financial transactions. That's obviously a core principle that is reflected in the BSA and protecting financial transaction privacy. And we, in that spirit, in terms of our commitment, and ongoing support for technological innovation, we want to work closely with industry to identify and, and collaborate on tools that can enhance privacy.  But what we see today is that mixers are not designed to provide that privacy, they're designed to offer escape from the origin, movement and destination of these assets. And, of course, in that context, they're extremely attractive to illicit actors. And in this context, we see North Korean cyber criminals and ransomware actors using mixers, to obfuscate the movement of these funds, the destination of these assets. And that creates a significant national security challenge for us. It is something in the context of this NPRM, this proposed rulemaking, we seek to enhance transparency around what is going on with these convertible virtual currency mixing services. But at the end of the day, I would just, you know, I would say this is not a ban on mixers. This is a proposed rule designed to drive additional transparency. And again, as we work through the comments towards the final rule, will, of course, have much more to say about a way to again, manage illicit finance risk in the context of these technologies, and the service providers with a goal to meet the desire for meaningful privacy and the use of some of these technologies.  Right, so can you just maybe just build a little bit upon that, and, you know, in your, you know, you know, just kind of further talks about distinction between privacy and obfuscation? You know, to you, where's the how do you look at this question of balancing those two different, arguably similar issues with this technology?  I think it goes back to a couple of core principles that Treasury has reflected for a long time in its rulemaking. One is, you know, focus on the activity, not necessarily the product, and then based on the activity, making sure that we are building regulatory obligations to meet the risk associated with that type of activity. And certainly, that reflects the really the core of what we do and how we think about our regulations, which is that they need to be risk based and drive risk based behavior. So when you think about, again, these 80s and mixers and you reflect on the fact that they are really both I'm very attracted to elicit actors. But to this is, I think the important point and in terms of like, how do we manage privacy versus anonymity, you have these mixing entities that are not doing meaningful KYC, there's no AML/CFT, there are none of the things that are in place to manage exactly this tension. So it's not that everybody needs to know who you are transacting with. But there has to be a capacity, we think, for a U.S.person to be in a position to FOLLOW U.S.law, and not engage with a sanctioned individual, or a U.S.financial institution to not unwittingly engage in activity that is supporting the building of weapons in North Korea, and the like. So, ultimately, that's the good news is we balanced it, and I think we have sort of the policy framework to balance it. But we recognize that the technology is developing quickly, we recognize that we need to engage closely with industry so that we understand the technology and as we think through potential new regulatory authorities, and, you know, a new definition of financial institution that clearly covers virtual assets, and virtual assets are riders and, and the like that, that we are doing in a way that is informed by what we are learning from, from, frankly, from smart people in this room.  Last year, Treasury requested additional authorities and resources from Congress to specifically talk about or go after and police crypto issues. And I think you even repeated that request in risk assessments over the last couple of months. Could you just speak to you know, how's Congress reacted, what the engagement with them looked like? And do you think you'll get what you're hoping for?  Look, I think we're in a we're in a constant conversation with Congress, I think we've reflected and we've tried to reflect here, some of the key risks that we perceive, one of them being this challenge with the jurisdictions out there that are developing virtual assets and an environment where there's very little or no regulatory infrastructure around managing illicit finance and AML/CFT compliance in line with international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force. So how do we help our U.S. persons andU.S.financial institutions manage that risks and some of the ways that we've reflected that we can do that is by creating authority for Treasury to restrict financial institutions and other U.S.persons from engaging or virtual assets, service providers that are here in the United States from engaging with these other virtual assets, service providers that are operating in jurisdictions that have no meaningful AML/CFT compliance, or we know are behaving in a way that is allowing for a lot of this type of illicit finance that we perceive and are collectively concerned about?  I think the second thing that we've been really focused on is the risks around stable coins. And particularly, as we have seen those become more attractive to terrorists and other bad actors. Is there a way to work with Congress to get in authority so that those stable coins that are U.S. backed are clearly subject to OFAC sanctions authorities? And then, you know, I think overall, you know, it's the work to ensure that virtual asset service providers and other entities that operate in the ecosystem know clearly that based on the activity that they are engaged in, they are required to register with FinCEN as a money services business, or, or are really a financial institution that's subject to all of the AML/CFT obligations that FinCEN administers. Right now. What we have, we often see is virtual asset service providers, big and small, will say well, 'that's not us, we're not subject to your regulatory remit.' So making clear that, no, you don't get to define whether you're you are not based on the product that you that you are developing or you have promulgated, but really it's based on the activity that you're engaged in and regulate statutory definition of financial institutions may be the way to get at that challenge.  You mentioned Binance earlier, and, you know, we have an entire panel tomorrow on just corporate monitorships in crypto companies and their potential continued evolution. Could you speak to the settlement itself, how that came to be. And then I know a corporate monitor has finally been appointed a few weeks ago, here to speak to what that engagement with them will look like in the coming weeks and months.  Just set the stage a little bit on Binance. We, with the Department of Justice CFTC, engaged in the largest enforcement actions that Treasury has ever undertaken, which was settled for $4 billion. But as a sort of a critical piece of that settlement is this monitorship that will last for five years. The reason the monitor ship is so important is because of the violations that we saw Binance engaged with and that included apparent violations of our sanctions programs, which included U.S. persons engaging with sanctioned jurisdictions, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, Crimea and Ukraine and the like.  We saw that Binance had no meaningful AML/CFT compliance program to speak of and as a result of that, there were over 100,000 suspicious transactions that were not identified by Binance over a period of years. So the monitorship will allow FinCEN to ensure that Binance has a credible and comprehensive AML/CFT compliance program in place, that they have fully incredibly exited the United States that they will engage in a look back of that history of suspicious activity and prove and file and provide information as it relates to those transactions. And one of the, you know, sort of foundational things in addition to the monetary payment, we're really these sort of historically important capacity to ensure for ourselves that Binance is no longer engaged in the type of activity that was so deeply problematic over the last number of years. And certainly to the extent that we identify that Binance continues to engage in those activities that would be subject to very significant additional penalties, to the extent that they breach the agreement.  It feels like we're starting to get to a point where a lot of crypto companies are beginning to accept and understand that maybe they should have compliance departments and worry about these issues earlier in the stage. Do you have any thoughts or advice for them to make sure that they don't end up in a place down the line where they are now facing down [a similar enforcement action]?  I think the key is really that sort of tone from the top and compliance really built into the culture of an organization. That's like a day one principle, it can't be, 'we'll get to it once we've scaled some.' I think that's a problem that we often see, we see, you know, sort of the desire to sort of outsource compliance or relegate compliance, a certain part of your business, and that isn't as a successful operating model. I think that that sort of tone from the top is critical. The other thing is really building in the sort of the tools and the technology to manage illicit finance risks, to do AML/CFT, the KYC, the sanctions list screening, from the very beginning, again, don't wait until you've scaled to do those types of things. And the thing that we really need and we really want to see and have for many firms, but for many others we don't see this is really that sort of proactive engagement, proactively engaging us on sort of what You're seeing because you're obviously will be much closer to it.  And that type of proactive engagement can help you better assess your risk and ensures that your compliance program isn't geared towards a risk environment that hasn't, you know, frankly, shifted quite a bit to the right. I think the thing that we really need and find to be so valuable, and I think as really a really a great sort of feedback loop, when it works well is getting those reports of suspicious transactions and suspicious activity that provides really the foundation for the advisories and the alerts and the other communications that FinCEN provides about sort of the risks that we that we are seen. And that's been true, very true in the context of digital assets. And since 2022, I think FinCEN has released 15 of those types of alerts and advisories. So that is critical to what we do and and I and at the end of the day, I think we want to create more avenues and more forums for Frank, productive, open exchanges. FinCEN hosts what's called FinCEN exchanges, which are statutorily mandatory and that provides a confidential format, to have direct conversations between FinCEN law enforcement and companies to talk about sort of the illicit finance risks that we collectively proceed and way to tailor our respective approaches to manage that risk. Awesome.  So we're about to wrap up in a minute, but really quickly, so maybe you could just speak a little bit to kind of sanctions compliance and monitoring with crypto companies , in particular, if there's any challenges you've had with, you know, making sure crypto companies – even the ones that want to work with Treasury – that they have for making sure they're actually able to do so effectively.  I think it's to two things, I would say on the sort of sanctions list side and sort of understanding what can and cannot be done as it relates to OFAC authorities. OFAC has a hotline, it's 24 hours, they'll respond usually for the vast majority within 24 to 48 hours, encourage you to use that hotline and ask your questions of OFAC. And then with FinCEN, you know, to the extent that we are not providing alerts and guidance that is useful to your business, or you don't perceive that please come talk to us. And I know we are happy to facilitate additional opportunities for exchanges that directly related to the types of risks that you're seeing. But we can't do that, if we don't have the type of industry cooperation, which is really in that sort of the two flavors, one the sort of meaningful AML/CFT compliance programs that allow for the identification of specific activity on your platforms or through your service. So I think having that information really allows us to work more effectively and efficiently with this industry and I think will result in the type of hopefully tailored regulatory and statutory approaches that will achieve the goal that we all want, which is to promote and support financial innovation here in the United States.

Namely: Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville allegedly was part of a conversation with a Fulton County prosecutor and a key witness that defense attorney Brian Steel charged amounted to coercion. The judge ordered Steel to share who told him about the ex parte conversation, which Steel refused to comply with. Steel has been ordered to spend the next 10 weekends in jail, and asked that he spend those weekends with his client. What's really interesting to me is while Glanville seems to have taken issue with Steel having information about the conversation, at no point did he appear to refute any of the details Steel shared.

The price tested the $0.4700 zone and is currently attempting a short-term recovery wave. XRP is slowly moving higher from the $0.470 support. The price is now trading below $0.4850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.480 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could recover, but the bears might be active near the $0.4880 resistance. XRP Price Finds Support XRP price failed to recover above the $0.4880 resistance like Ethereum and Bitcoin. The price extended losses below the $0.480 level. It even tested the $0.470 zone. A low was formed at $0.4701 and the price is now eyeing a short-term recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.4750 level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5053 swing high to the $0.4701 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.480 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. However, it is still trading below $0.4850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.4850 level. The first key resistance is near $0.4880 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5053 swing high to the $0.4701 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.4920 level. A close above the $0.4920 resistance zone could send the price higher. The next key resistance is near $0.50. If there is a close above the $0.50 resistance level, there could be a steady increase toward the $0.5050 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5250 resistance. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.4850 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4750 level. The next major support is at $0.470. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.470 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline and retest the $0.4550 support in the near term.

The company operates Bitcoin mining facilities in New York and Pennsylvania, with plans to increase mining capacity. TeraWulf aims to become debt-free and reinvest its operating cash flow into Bitcoin mining and data centers for generative AI and complex computing. TeraWulf ( WULF ) is a domestic bitcoin miner that owns and operates vertically integrated and environmentally clean facilities. The stock just broke out of a multi-month trading pennant that started late last year. Shares appear ready to move considerably higher over the summer, and especially if Bitcoin pricing can continue its upward trend in the second half of 2024. Further, WULF has a pilot program towards the development of data centers to capitalize on the growth in demand for locations to house the power-hungry processes of generative AI and related complex computing. As a result, I recently added exposure to WULF. TeraWulf currently operates a wholly owned Bitcoin mining facility in Lake Mariner, New York, and is part of a JV operating the Nautilus Cryptomine Facility in Berwick, Pennsylvania, along with Cumulus Coin and Talen Energy (TLNE). Talen owns and operates the Susquehanna nuclear power plant that provides Nautilus with a fixed cost of $0.02/kWh for its zero-carbon power for the next few years. TeraWulf's Lake Mariner facility is powered by hydroelectric electricity from a Niagara river facility that boasts 93% zero-carbon power at an annual average cost of $0.04/kWh. Both facilities are capable of substantially ramping their mining capacity. WULF has plans to make significant increases over the next year through already made purchase and option agreements for S21 miners. WULF's past and future BTC mining growth (TeraWulf's May 2024 Investor Update) Additionally, the company has been reducing its debt this year, and expects to be debt free within 2025. TeraWulf's ability to pay down debt is largely premised on its profitable mining operations, where it sells the Bitcoin it mines. Many large publicly traded Bitcoin miners switched to a ‘hodl’ strategy in 2021 or shortly thereafter. This distinction may allow WULF to not only become debt free, but also keep it from undertaking the significant level of dilution that proliferates the business. WULF's debt repayment since Q4 2023 (TeraWulf's May 2024 Investor Update) In addition to paying down its existing debt, WULF's future operating cash flow is likely to be reinvested into the company's ambitions for growth. These growth aspirations include both their Bitcoin mining operations and data centers for power-hungry processes such as generative AI and related complex computing. Operating AI data centers should be a highly complementary business to Bitcoin mining, where both require large optimized facilities with access to competitively priced energy, and ideally renewable energy. This secondary line of business should be expected to eventually attract a second investor base. It is reasonably likely that a growing number of investors will increasingly allocate into high-speed parallel processing of complex computations that are powered by cheap and renewable energy sources, such as those WULF intends to develop. After the semiconductor and hardware companies, leasable AI data centers appear to be the next pure-play within the ongoing AI revolution. I believe that it is probable that the marketplace will soon lump Bitcoin miners and AI data centers into a combined umbrella asset class that I currently think of as nodes acting as utilities. The primary difference between an AI data center and a Bitcoin miner is that the mining operations utilize Application-Specific Integrated Circuit ('ASIC') hardware, and the AI model are using Graphics Processing Unit ('GPU') hardware, but the best of both tend to be made by the same chip designers. WULF's stock recently broke out of what appears to be a 5-month long bull pennant pattern. WULF daily candlestick chart ( FINVIZ.com ) WULF shares appear likely to increase from here so long as Bitcoin pricing maintains or increases from here. Further, TeraWulf has another potential catalyst from its nascent data center business, where a future hosting contract may be announced, or investors may simply begin to speculate upon it. At WULF's current share price, the company has a market capitalization of almost exactly $1 billion. Many mutual and alternative fund instruments are restricted by their own covenants from buying securities based upon both the overall market value of the company and the actual stock price. In particular, a great many funds are restricted from purchasing stocks that have a market price below $5. As a result, there is far less institutional and news coverage of such low-priced equities. Similarly, many advisors cannot suggest equities below $5 to clients, as some compliance standards will consider them penny stocks. Risks The primary risk to TeraWulf is if Bitcoin were to sustain a significant decline. WULF and all Bitcoin miners will follow the underlying performance of Bitcoin, and likely with leverage. Other risks include the possibility of dilutive secondaries, which are incredibly common for Bitcoin miners, and the potential for excessive stock-based compensation. WULF's recent history of making debt repayments appears to indicate a conservative use of available cash, and hopefully that they will be sensible issuers of shares. While dilution is always problematic for Bitcoin miners, it is considerably less concerning towards the underlying thesis than is the potential for Bitcoin to enter a bear market. For this reason, if Bitcoin were to decline more than 10% from present levels and not immediately bounce off of some supportive level around there, I would likely abandon any near term speculation upon Bitcoin miners. Conclusion I believe that the recent breakout in TeraWulf shares has the potential to continue. If WULF gets a catalyst in the form of either an increasing Bitcoin price or a meaningful AI-related data center, let alone both, I think it is possible and even likely that WULF shares will be revalued well above current levels. Further, if shares can advance above $5, new fund and institutional investments are probable, as is an influx of media coverage.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698752-terawulf-breakout-is-likely-to-continue-wulf-stock-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/29344260.jpeg

29343077,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=624119,1718161229,NFT Prices Tumble As Crypto Investors Place Big Bets On Bitcoin And Ethereum ETFs,"In a market dominated by optimism surrounding the price spikes of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the non-fungible token (NFT) market has seen a decline in popularity. NFTs, which include digital artwork and collectibles recorded on blockchains, have recently experienced a notable loss of appeal. According to a Bloomberg report, Google searches for NFTs have reached their lowest levels since 2021, when these tokens first gained mainstream attention. Popular NFT Collections Experience Steep Price Declines A significant drop in sales further highlights the NFT market’s struggles. Researcher DappRadar reveals that NFT sales have decreased by more than six percent to $8.5 billion in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in the previous year. This decline starkly contrasts the industry’s peak in January 2022, when it recorded an impressive $17.2 billion in NFT sales within a single month. Related Reading: Blood In The Water? Ethereum Whales Circle As Price Drops The report further notes that the sentiment surrounding NFTs hit last month when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated steps toward approving exchange-traded funds (ETFs) directly investing in Ethereum. In anticipation of this approval, some investors reportedly began reallocating their investments into ETH while divesting from NFTs. Nicolas Lallement, co-founder of NFT data tracker NFT Price Floor, explains that capital rotation is common in crypto markets, with Ethereum likely to continue attracting and absorbing market capital, resulting in price drops for other assets like NFTs. This year, many popular NFT collections have experienced significant price declines. NFT Price Floor reports that prices for these collections are down by 40 percent to 50 percent year-to-date. CryptoPunks, a collection minted on the Ethereum network, is trading around 2021 levels and has dropped by 29% from its lowest point in the previous year. Similarly, collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Chromie Squiggle have seen their price floors, based on Ethereum, decrease to approximately half of what they were at the lowest point of last year. Market Correction Looms Daniel Maegaard, an NFT collector, confirms that most NFT collections continue to decline or remain stagnant after the peak euphoria observed in 2021. Maegaard has recently sold several blue-chip NFTs, including works by digital artists XCOPY, Hackatao, and Coldie. While some NFT art collections, such as XCOPY’s, have posted positive returns over the past 90 days, Lallement says the overall trend points to a market correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crashes Below $67,000: Key Reasons Amidst the challenges faced by the NFT market, one platform that has shown resilience is the NFT marketplace, Magic Eden. The platform has been gaining market share as trading activity on its platform has increased, as per Sara Gherghelas, an analyst at DappRadar. Although Magic Eden recorded record volume in April, trading activity has since decreased. In sum, the current state of the non-fungible token market reflects a decline in popularity and prices. While some individual collections have shown positive returns, overall market sentiment suggests a continuation of the NFT market correction. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $3,480, following Bitcoin’s lead, with a sharp 5% drop in the past 24 hours and over 8% in the past seven days.

As the dog-themed token faces a price decline of over 10%, some crypto analysts consider that a stop at $1 may be the next target for WIF. Related Reading: Iggy Azalea MOTHER Token Skyrockets 27% After Major Announcement Is The Hat Still On? Dogwifhat was the talk of the town earlier this year after becoming one of the leading champions of the Q1 memecoin frenzy. The token had a 95,000% “turbo parabolic” run from $0.004773 to its all-time high (ATH) of $4.58 at the end of March. Since then, WIF has hovered between the $2.3 and $3.7 price range, briefly testing the $4 resistance level at the end of May. Its most recent performance has led crypto analyst Bluntz to set a $1 target for the memecoin. In an X post, the analyst and trader stated that WIF’s descent to the $1 prince range is “inevitable.” According to Bluntz’s chart, the token displays a macro five-wave impulse followed by the formation of an a,b,c zig-zag pattern. To the analyst, “the plan hasn’t changed,” but the b wave “took longer than initially thought.” Additionally, he set the target for the c wave between the $1 and $2 price range, which should offer a “generational buy opportunity” to investors. Nonetheless, the analyst’s seemingly bearish forecast is based on his previous bullish prediction. To Bluntz, the memecoin will significantly retrace before the “next parabolic leg” that could see WIF reach a new ATH. According to crypto trader Otsukimi, WIF’s chart exhibits a solid performance. To the trader, it “shows a solid last stand with a trend support alongside the mid of the complicated range.” Moreover, he considers WIF’s bullish consolidation to be “very wide,” which makes a bounce back from its current levels possible. Elon WIF Hat As the week started, Dogwifhat was acknowledged by X owner and ‘Dogefather’ Elon Musk. During a live stream, Musk claimed having heard of the memecoin sensation before changing the topic. “Yes, I have heard of dogWiFihat, dogwifhat,” he said. The crypto community quickly shared the news and speculated whether Musk liked the token. One user claimed, “You can tell he had more to say but stopped himself.” Others were expectant of the impact the mention could have in the memecoin’s price. The ‘Musk Effect’ didn’t reach WIF, as the token continued hovering between the $2.65-$2.8 range. However, Musk’s impact propelled a quickly created dogwifihat (WIFIHAT). The token surged by 6,200% in the hours following the live stream, going from $0.00007048 to $0.004506. WIFIHAT saw a short-lived rally as it shredded over 95% of its gains in the past 24 hours.

This performance represents a 26.3% and 18% decrease in the weekly and monthly timeframes. Nonetheless, the token’s market activity has seen a 76.1% increase in the past 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $705.6 million.

He noted that these coins were looking “pretty strong” at the moment despite a lot of other tokens looking like “crap.” Five Altcoins To Keep An Eye On In an X (formerly Twitter) post, Altcoin Sherpa mentioned Injective, Wormhole, JasmyCoin, Stacks, and Toncoin as the altcoins that are looking strong at the moment. He revealed that he has eyes on these coins and is looking to actively trade them at some point. In a series of other X posts, he explained why he believed some of these coins were strong. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts 800% Rally To $6,000 For BNB, Here’s The Timeline In one X post, he talked about Wormhole and claimed that it was one of the strongest coins. He advised traders to keep an eye on it if they are actively trading. He further revealed that he would be looking to buy Wormhole if it breaks out. He added that if Wormhole pulls back strongly, it will likely continue to trade within its current range as it is not ready for that “big move.” In another X post, Altcoin Sherpa touched on JasmyCoin and stated that the coin is “extremely strong,” seeing as it didn’t “budge” despite the pullbacks in the crypto market. He claimed that JasmyCoin could rise to as high as $0.067 before it experiences any significant pullback. He added that he wasn’t actively trading it, but it is one to watch. Altcoin also provided insights into Toncoin’s price action, which he claimed was “weird,” with the top end being a supply zone and its price pulling back. However, he remarked that he is still bullish on the coin because it is enjoying a lot of attention, mainly thanks to Notcoin. The analyst views the $6 price range as a level to bid for anyone who believes that Toncoin will still break past its previous highs. Altcoin Sherpa also seems bullish on Notcoin. He recently claimed that he has changed his mind about the token since its price action has calmed down and there is less volatility. He highlighted the consolidation pattern that has formed on Notcoin’s chart, which suggests that it is still primed for major moves to the upside. A Meme Coin To Watch Out For Altcoin Sherpa is also bullish on Dogecoin and suggests that it is a meme coin to watch out for. He noted that Dogecoin is still looking pretty good on the high-time frame charts despite many memes looking choppy in the short term. He added that he expects Dogecoin to still do “big numbers” later in the year. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Metric Breaks 3-Month Downtrend Amid Bullish Network Recovery For now, he revealed that he is still expecting more chops for the next stretch and that he won’t be rushing to buy any fresh positions for Dogecoin at its current price level.
