42402817,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8At,1555972201,Coinbase's Political Action Committee Shuts Down Without Ever Raising a Cent,"Coinbase is moving to shut down its political action committee (PAC) without ever raising a cent.  The San Francisco-based crypto exchange filed a Termination Report for its PAC on April 3, 2019, according to publicly available documents on the Federal Election Commission's website (FEC). The move means that the exchange wants to shut down its PAC, though it was not immediately clear if the committee had actually been shut down.  A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed that the exchange had filed to shut down its PAC, but could not say if the FEC has granted the request yet.  PACs are typically formed to raise funds on behalf of specific candidates for public office or business and ideological interests. However, the Coinbase PAC did not raise any funds, nor did it back any candidates during its 10-month lifespan, public filings show.  Personnel change  The exchange first launched its PAC in June 2018, and it was run by former chief policy officer Mike Lempres, who left the exchange last year to join venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.  Brian Brooks, who joined Coinbase as chief legal officer in September, was the likely candidate to have taken over the PAC following Lempres' departure.  According to the FEC's website, a committee can file to terminate its operations if ""it no longer receives (or intends to receive) contributions,"" or if ""it no longer makes (or intends to make) expenditures.""  That said, a committee is required to continue regularly filing disclosure reports until the FEC accepts the termination report, the site explained, adding:  ""Committees shouldn't stop filing just because they checked the 'Termination Report' box on their regular campaign finance disclosure form. Committees must file regularly scheduled reports until the Commission notifies them in writing that it has granted their request to terminate.""

42402827,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Jk,1555962023,Bittrex: 'North Korean' Accounts Flagged by NYDFS Were South Korean,"Crypto exchange Bittrex said Monday that New York regulators erred in identifying two of its users as North Korean.  In a statement issued Monday, Bittrex said it had reviewed two accounts that were flagged as belonging to residents of the sanctioned country by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which recently rejected the exchange's application for a BitLicense.  It turned out that the same two users had already been investigated by the exchange in October 2017, Bittrex said, adding:  ""South Korean residents mistakenly selected North Korea in our country dropdown menu, but we determined through country identification, physical and IP address that ALL were from South Korea.""  In an op-ed published in CoinDesk Thursday, Shirin Emami, the executive deputy superintendent for banking at NYDFS, stated that when the agency's examiners sampled Bittrex accounts earlier this year, they identified two based in North Korea.  ""More may exist,"" she wrote. ""At least one North Korean account was active into 2017,"" along with two accounts in another sanctioned country, Iran, that were active during this year's examination.  In a rebuttal issued the same day, Bittrex denied having any accounts in either country this year. But Monday's statement represented the first time the company explained why NYDFS might have thought two of the accounts in question were North Korean.  Sanctions compliance is one of several issues NYDFS cited for denying a license to Bittrex, along with broader anti-money-laundering (AML) practices and the exchange's coin listing process.

42402823,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Fo,1555947914,Controversial Oil Tycoon Moves to Shake Up Argo Blockchain Board,"Oil tycoon Frank Timis has been revealed as the biggest shareholder in Argo Blockchain, a crypto mining firm that listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) last summer.  According to a Daily Mail report on Saturday, Timis' involvement with the firm was revealed after he moved behind the scenes to oust two board members at the firm in order to force a change in direction for the struggling firm. Through his company First Investments, the entrepreneur owns 14 percent of Argo, the report adds.  Romanian by birth, Timis reportedly relocated to Australia where he was twice convicted for possession of heroin with intent to supply. He later founded Regal Petroleum, shares of which later collapsed and earned Timis a fine from the LSE in 2009 for misleading investors.  Argo's IPO on the LSE raised £25 million (about $32.5 million) last August. However, its value has since plummeted to around £10 million ($13 million). In its 2018 financial report, the firm disclosed a £4.1 million pre-tax loss (or $5.3 million USD)  The firm put its poor performance down to the crypto bear market over the last 16 months, saying in a statement:    ""The Board strongly believes that the cryptoasset market still has short term profitable characteristics and will also become a major asset class in the long term. This asset class will need a reliable, professional cryptomining (both in respect of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake) industry to support it as it gains wider acceptance.""            Yet, apparently in order to bring the firm back to a good financial footing, Timis is attempting to remove Jonathan Bixby and Mike Edwards from the board – who are, according to the Mail, together the second largest shareholder with 13 percent of Argo – and put in place a new as-yet-unnamed director. Shareholders will vote on the issue at a May 16 general meeting.    Argo argued for shareholder to reject Timis' demands, saying:      ""Mr Timis has made clear he does not believe the strategy being pursued by the board will result in a satisfactory return to shareholders. However, he has made no substantive alternative proposals for the running of the company and has not nominated any alternative director at the time of writing.""            The company also claims it is in a ""very strong strategic position,"" owning £15 million in cash (or $19.5 million), £300,000 (roughly $389,000) in cryptocurrencies and crypto mining equipment as of the close of March.

42402831,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Li,1555943402,CFTC Chair Giancarlo Hints at What's Holding Back Bakkt's Bitcoin Futures,"The Takeaway  Bakkt, the proposed bitcoin futures exchange, remains in regulatory limbo  CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo wouldn’t discuss specific proposals, but his general comments about crypto regulation offer hints at the reasons Bakkt is languishing  Part of the problem appears to be the firm’s plan to custody its own bitcoin, and clear trades through its parent company’s clearinghouse  This proposal may present issues both in terms of regulatory jurisdiction and opposition from other clearinghouse participants      When Bakkt?  The question has been posed repeatedly since last summer, when Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, first revealed its grand vision for a bitcoin futures platform that would help take the cryptocurrency to the next level of mass acceptance. Bakkt has postponed its launch date twice now, including an indefinite delay at the end of 2018.  It’s widely known that Bakkt's holdup is regulatory in nature, rather than technical. But the specific reasons for the delay have been hazy, the subject of rumor and speculation in crypto legal circles and anonymously sourced news articles.  This much is clear: Bakkt needs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide a final green light before it can launch. In blog posts, Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler has said the exchange is working with the regulator but offered little in the way of detail. (Bakkt declined to comment for this article.)  The CFTC, for its part, has kept quiet about Bakkt, so it's hard to tell where in the process the agency is.  However, CoinDesk recently sat down with CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, who became a hero to the crypto community after advocating for a ""do no harm"" approach to regulating the space before Congress in early 2018.  While he wouldn't discuss any specific proposals or companies being reviewed, Giancarlo spoke in very general terms about the regulatory issues facing new crypto products, offering insight on how the 45-year-old agency is approaching futures, as just one example.  And if you read between the lines, his comments offer some clues about the snags Bakkt has hit.  The 80-year-old protocol  Describing the broad contours of U.S. derivatives regulation, Giancarlo used the language of the community which has nicknamed him ""CryptoDad.”  “In the world of crypto, everything's based on certain protocols. Well the law is also a protocol, we work on a really old protocol – in our case it's over 80 years old,"" he said, referring to the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936. “It’s voluminous, it’s thousands of pages of regulations and it’s very detailed.”  Under this protocol, which also includes state and federal antecedents and began to take form as far back as the 1860s, regulation of derivatives was bifurcated between the state and federal governments, Giancarlo explained.  ""The deal that was struck was there’d be federal oversight of the exchanges, derivatives products, certain intermediaries, and the clearinghouses but the entities that actually held custody of financial instruments, like cash, were usually regulated as banks or trusts under state law or a national charter,"" Giancarlo said.  These custodians, which also include commodity warehouses regulated by state-level agencies or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, hold the underlying assets and deliver them to customers when their futures contracts expire.  ""Even when we have a CFTC-regulated clearinghouse, the clearinghouse uses state-regulated custodians or a nationally chartered, OCC-regulated bank for the actual holding of the funds and securities,"" Giancarlo said. That said, firms can choose to hold their assets within the clearinghouses themselves.  Today, Giancarlo went on, one of the challenges his agency faces comes from evaluating how futures exchanges might store cryptocurrencies. This comes into play when contracts are physically settled, meaning buyers are delivered the actual commodity at expiration.  While the bitcoin futures launched in 2017 by CME Group and CBOE were settled in cash – amounting to side bets on the cryptocurrency’s dollar price – Bakkt, along with startups ErisX, Seed CX and LedgerX, aspire to list derivative contracts settled in real bitcoin.  ""Our statute allows us to regulate the new physically settled cryptocurrencies, but it contemplates an entity using a regulated trust or bank for custody of customer funds, unless they opt to hold the assets in the clearinghouse,"" Giancarlo said.  In that light, it starts to make sense why the CFTC has been slow to approve Bakkt.  According to its past announcements, the exchange initially planned to custody bitcoin through its own digital “warehouse.” Since ICE is not a bank or state-regulated custodian, this would have required an exemption to the rules described by Giancarlo.  However, Bloomberg reported last Thursday that Bakkt is now seeking a license from New York state (presumably for a trust company) so it can handle custody.  But there’s another issue as well.  Not so clear  Zooming out the lens again, clearinghouses act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers in derivatives markets, ensuring that both parties in a transaction uphold their respective ends of any deal. They also serve to reduce the cost and risk in such transactions, as former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke explained in a 2011 speech.  But the risk isn’t totally removed – it’s mutualized among a clearing house’s member firms. Hence, if a clearinghouse were to hold bitcoin (in the sense of buying and selling it, not necessarily custodying the private keys), its members would be exposed to the asset’s rapid price swings.  ""A potential challenge here, and as we saw with bitcoin futures, is that the other asset class participants in the clearinghouse don’t always want the exposure to mutualize their risk on their interest rate or commodity futures with somebody else’s cryptocurrency holdings,"" said Giancarlo.  Indeed, a number of firms were less than thrilled by CME and Cboe launching bitcoin futures contracts at the end of 2017. One group of clearinghouses, the Futures Industry Association, even went so far as to write an open letter criticizing the CFTC for allowing this. The letter cited bitcoin's high volatility at the time as their main cause for concern.  Based on what Bakkt has shared so far, it plans to clear the one-day bitcoin futures contracts through its parent firm's regulated clearinghouse, ICE Clear US, which would act as the intermediary.  So regardless of how Bakkt custodied bitcoin, it would need to send the assets through ICE Clear US to a buyer – raising the question of how that would sit with the clearing members.  CoinDesk reached out to a number of ICE Clear US members. A majority of the firms reached out to did not respond, and several more declined to comment.  However, Bob Fitzsimmons, executive vice president of fixed income, currencies and commodities at ICE Clear US member Wedbush Securities, said he had no concerns about ICE warehousing bitcoin, though he did not reference its price.  ""Our understanding in this process is we would not be handling any of the cash bitcoin or the spot bitcoin or the spot digital currency, so there’s no need for us to have the holding or the handling of it, which is one of the things that scares people,"" he said. ""In terms of the futures side, we're very comfortable.""  That being said, Wedbush may be an outlier in this view – as Fitzsimmons noted, the firm has long been involved in the crypto space, having published a research report on bitcoin in 2013, and backing Coinbase early in the exchange's life.  Not alone  With Bakkt in regulatory limbo, it may not be the first company to offer physically-settled bitcoin futures in the U.S.  LedgerX, which was founded in 2014 and received CFTC approval to offer bitcoin derivative products in 2017, has offered swaps and options to American customers over the past two years, and now plans to offer its own physically-settled futures contracts in the coming weeks.  Juthica Chou, the firm's COO, told CoinDesk that LedgerX applied to become a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) and Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) when it was founded. Like Bakkt, it took some time to get regulatory approval.  In 2015, the company's applications entered an extended public comment period before receiving a final go-ahead two years later. Only then did LedgerX self-certify its physically-settled options and swaps contracts, Chou explained.  Under the CFTC's regulations, a company can self-certify that upcoming products fulfill legal and regulatory requirements, rather than ask the agency to approve a new product. CFTC staff only reviews a product to ensure that it is compliant with the appropriate regulations. If a product does violate any statute or rule, the CFTC can halt the product. Otherwise, the CFTC will allow a product to go forward.  CME and Cboe both followed this process when launching its bitcoin futures products just under 18 months ago. Because Bakkt wanted to use its own warehouse to custody bitcoin, it did not follow this self-certification path.  Chou noted that LedgerX holds its own bitcoin on customers' behalf, since the company has a DCO license. In other words, it operates its own clearinghouse, and as such can conduct transactions directly with a buyer, rather than operate through an intermediary (as Bakkt would through ICE Clear). In turn, this means it can handle custody itself.  ""LedgerX deals directly with our participants, we have no intermediaries,” Chou said. “Ironically, the model that cuts out the intermediaries is the safest model. Too many established Wall Street firms are used to dealing exclusively with intermediaries.""  Despite all the setbacks, Bakkt has continued to build up its platform, naming a board of directors, hiring execs, recruiting developers and managers, making an acquisition, and getting a $20 million to $25 million budget from its parent company (on top of $182.5 million raised from outside investors).  Still and all, whether and when Bakkt launches will depend on the CFTC, and will require every last detail to match. As Giancarlo put it (again, without mentioning any specific firm or application):  ""It’s often a fine detail in one protocol or another that makes all the difference.""  J.

42402836,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Qd,1555938050,You Can Now Shop With Bitcoin on Amazon Using Lightning,"Bitcoin spenders can now use the lightning network to shop at e-commerce sites like Amazon.  Crypto payment processing startup Moon announced today that any lightning-enabled wallet can now also be used through Moon’s browser extension. Before this lightning feature, roughly 250 beta users already used Moon to spend crypto on e-commerce sites by connecting the browser extension to exchange accounts like Coinbase.  Moon CEO Ken Kruger told CoinDesk:  “[The extension] will pop up a QR code and it will have the lightning invoice, which you could also copy and paste if you can’t use the QR code for some reason, and you’ll be able to pay with your favorite lightning wallet.”  To be clear, Amazon itself never touches bitcoin. Kruger declined to specify which traditional financial institutions are helping convert the bitcoin to fiat on the backend so that Amazon merchants actually receive fiat currency for their wares. However, Kruger added that by 2020 the lightning-enabled feature should work on almost any e-commerce site, regardless of whether that platform accepts bitcoin directly.  “There’s no direct merchant integration,” Kruger said, clarifying that Moon also manages payment channels and merely offers a simple interface for sending payments.  “We’re integrating with the Visa and Mastercard networks and we get a cut of the interchange fees that merchants pay every time they receive a credit card transaction,” he said.  Moon was founded in New York last year and grew to a staff of three people with just $100,000 invested by the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. The accelerator’s managing director, Murat Aktihanoglu, told CoinDesk he sees Moon as one of the “anchor” crypto businesses with lucrative potential over the next five years.  “We invested in Moon as a long-term portfolio company,” Aktihanoglu said.  In the meantime, Kruger said his startup is looking to raise a Series A in 2019 and continue learning from user behavior.  “There’s a lot of opportunities to help solve some of those usability problems and getting people onto the lightning network, increasing adoption in that way,” Kruger said. “We’re going to engage with other folks in the lightning community to see what people are doing, what they’re working on and if there are any significant gaps. We’d love to step in and help whenever possible.”  UPDATE (April 22, 14:10 UTC): The extension's lightning network functionality is still being reviewed by the Chrome Web Store and is now anticipated to launch on Wednesday, according to Moon.

The exchange announced on its corporate website on Friday that, as of Monday, April 22, the firm will have signed over its business to publicly listed Japanese investment firm Fisco and full operations will be reinstated Tuesday.  The plan for the takeover was first aired in October 2018, and sees the exchange pass from its previous owner, Tech Bureau, to an existing crypto exchange owned Fisco. Friday's post indicates that the deal cost Fisco 5 billion Japanese yen ($44.675 million).  In its September 2018 hack, Zaif lost approximately 7 billion yen ($62.5 million) in the bitcoin (BTC), monacoin (MONA) and bitcoin cash (BCH) cryptocurrencies.  Since then, Zaif said Friday, registration of new members has been suspended, while trading, depositing and withdrawing MONA has been on hold since October 10, 2018. As of tomorrow, those services will be reinstated.  As pledged previously, the exchange has now refunded users that lost holdings in the breach. The firm explained that holders of BTC and BCH were refunded in their original cryptocurrency, but, due to liquidity issues with the token, MONA holders received about 60 percent in the crypto and the remainder in Japanese yen for compensation at a rate of 144.548 yen per MONA.  As reported last November, cybersecurity experts at Japan Digital Design, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), working in conjunction with other security firms, said they had found possibly revealing information on the Zaif hackers.  After investigating the outflow of monacoin from the exchange soon after the hack, Japan Digital Design said it was able to identify the “source” of the attackers.

42420843,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWZIFB,1555930825,Bitcoin Price RSI Confirms Possible Long-Term Bull Reversal,"View  Bitcoin’s 14-week relative strength index (RSI) has moved above the key resistance range of 53.00–55.00, validating the longer-term bullish reversal signaled by a falling channel breakout witnessed two weeks ago.  As a result, BTC may rise to the former support-turned-resistance of $6,000 over the next couple of months.  A pullback to the 200-day MA, currently located just below $4,500, may precede such a rise.  The cryptocurrency is teasing a falling channel breakout on the hourly chart, which, if confirmed, could see prices revisit recent highs above $5,460 in the next day or two.  With a widely-followed price indicator now signaling a long-term bullish reversal, bitcoin (BTC) could extend its recent rally to $6,000 over the next couple of months.  Notably, the 14-week relative strength index (RSI) – an indicator used to identify overbought or oversold conditions – has found acceptance above the key 53.00–55.00 resistance range, which had served as strong support in the 2015–2017 bull market.  Essentially, the indicator has jumped back to bull market territory, reinforcing the longer term bullish reversal first confirmed by bitcoin’s violation of a bearish lower highs and lower lows pattern on April 2.  As a result, BTC may challenge the former support-turned-resistance of $6,000 in the near term.  As of writing, the crypto market leader is changing hands near $5,300 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.20 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Prices have been largely restricted to $4,900–$5,500 range since April 3 and may see a pullback before prices rise to $6,000.  Weekly chart  As seen above (left), the 14-week RSI has found acceptance above the resistance range of 53.00-55.00.  While a reading above 50 indicates bullish conditions, the weekly RSI established the 53.00-55.00 range as the make-or-break level during the 2.5-year bull market that topped out in December 2017 at a record high of $20,000.  At no point during the bull market were the bears strong enough to push the RSI below 53.00. Further, the RSI’s break below 53.00 in January 2018 was followed by a bear market that saw prices slide to lows near $3,100 by December.  Also, note how the RSI’s repeated rejection of attempts to climb back above 53.00 in the five months to October 2018 was followed by a high-volume drop below $6,000 on Nov. 14.  So, with RSI now having found acceptance above 55.00, the longer-term bearish-to-bullish trend change confirmed by a falling channel breakout two weeks ago looks to have legs, and BTC could rise to the former support-turned-resistance of $6,000 over the next couple of months.  Backing that argument are the 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs), which are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls for the first time since early December 2017. These bullish averages, currently located at $5,045 and $4,505, may act as brakes on any pullbacks going forward.  Daily chart  Signs of bullish exhaustion have emerged on the daily chart. For instance, BTC created a doji candle on Friday and remained more or less flat-lined over the weekend. The case for a deeper pullback, however, would strengthen only if the recent low of $4,934 is breached.  A break below that level cannot be ruled out, as markets often test the bulls’ resolve immediately after a major breakout. For instance, the 100-day MA hurdle, which was breached on Feb. 19, was put to test multiple times in the 10 days to March 4 before a sustained move higher.  On similar lines, BTC may revisit the 200-day MA, currently at $4,482, before rising further.  The cryptocurrency, however, may pick up a bid in the next 24 hours, if the bearish pattern seen in the chart below is violated.  1-hour chart  Currently, BTC is flirting with the upper edge of a bearish channel, having invalidated both a bearish divergence of the RSI and a falling wedge breakdown with repeated defense of support at $5,170 last week.  The channel breakout, therefore, looks likely and could be followed by a retest of the recent high of $5,466.  On the downside, a break below $5,170 would shift risk in favor of a drop to the recent low of $4,912.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Williams took to the social media platform late last week to announce her VC firm Serena Ventures – which was secretly founded in 2014 – and listing some of its investments, including Coinbase and startups in areas such as fitness, clothing, food and women's health and community.  Williams said in the post:  ""In 2014, (yes I know I can keep a secret) I launched Serena Ventures with the mission of giving opportunities to founders across an array of industries. Serena Ventures invests in companies that embrace diverse leadership, individual empowerment, creativity and opportunity.""  The Serena Ventures website states that the company's portfolio includes over 30 firms with a total market capitalization of $12 billion. It is not clear how much was invested by her VC firm in Coinbase or in which round(s).  According to Crunchbase, Coinbase has seen investments totaling $546.6 million since its seed round in 2012. It most notably raised $300 million in a Series E round in October 2018, valuing the firm at $8 billion.  Forbes  indicates that, in 2018, Williams became the highest paid female athlete globally for the third year in a row, with earnings of around $18 million. She also has her own line of clothing and accessories.  As an athlete, Williams has achieved won a world record 23 Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era. She's also achieved 14 Grand Slam doubles titles alongside her sister Venus, and won four gold medals at the Olympics.  The Coinbase investment may not be such a surprise, as Williams' husband, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, was an early backer of the exchange through his venture capital firm, Initialized Capital.

42402811,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd88v,1555921804,JPMorgan Expanding Blockchain Project With 220 Banks to Include Payments,"Investment banking giant JPMorgan Chase is planning to expand an existing blockchain project to include settlement features as it seeks to fend off competition from payments upstarts such as TransferWise and Ripple.  The blockchain-based Interbank Information Network (IIN), set up in partnership with Australia’s ANZ bank and the Royal Bank of Canada back in 2017, currently allows its over 220 banking members to quickly address payments that contain errors or get held up for compliance reasons – problems that can takes weeks to solve with multiple banks being involved across the payments chain.  The Financial Times reported Sunday that John Hunter, head of global clearing at JPMorgan, said the IIN is fast developing and that the bank is ""looking at the ability to do more at the point of settlement.”  JPMorgan, he said, has now built in a feature that would allow for real-time verification that a transaction is being sent to a valid account. Currently, an error in the recipient's account number, sort code, or other detail, can result in the payment being rejected days after it was sent.  On that issue, banks' payment processing is still ""in the mid-80s to the mid-90s,"" according to Hunter. The ""5 to 20 per cent of payments"" that fail because of an error or compliance problems is ""where we’re trying to alleviate some of that pain,” he said.  The FT said that the settlement system will be live in by Q3 2019, and will allow both domestic and international payments.  The Interbank Information Network has been built on Quorum, the ethereum-based blockchain network revealed by the bank in 2016.

42402815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdd8Bs,1555920024,Bitcoin SV's Delisting Isn't 'Censorship.' But It's Still a Problem,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Is cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s delisting of bitcoin SV a form of censorship?  And if so, doesn’t that make hypocrites out of all the Bitcoin Core supporters and Craig S. Wright haters who cheered the downgrading of the latter’s competing bitcoin project? Are they not applying a double standard by simultaneously arguing for immutable, “censorship-resistant” blockchains?  These are the questions bitcoin skeptics are putting to a cryptocurrency community they view as failing to comply with the Voltairean maxim that one should fight for someone’s right to say something regardless of whether you agree with it. (Yes, I know it wasn’t actually Voltaire who said that…)  Whether this “gotcha” is fair or not, it has given rise to a far more interesting crypto debate than the tiresome, yearlong squabble between Craig Wright-supporting BSV holders and Craig Wright-loathing BTC holders, the one that triggered the delisting in the first place. (Before Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, made his decision, BTC supporters had pressured him to punish Wright for filing defamation lawsuits against Twitter accounts that had refuted the bitcoin SV founder’s claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto.)  A popcorn-worthy debate  It’s not all that clear who’s winning this debate. If anything, it has provided a reminder that the words used by both blockchain utopians and their hard-nosed realist critics often fail to adequately capture the nuances of what’s happening in the crypto ecosystem or, for that matter, in the wider world of social media and online communities.  The bitcoin critics’ main point is compelling. It’s that a decision to delist BSV cannot be about whether CSW is a jerk (there is almost universal consensus that the Australian “Faketoshi” meets that characterization). Jerks should not be censored just for being jerks, and doing so contradicts the Cypherpunk ideal of censorship-resistance to which many bitcoin believers subscribe.  (Full disclosure: Craig Wright blocked me on Twitter for using the j-word against him – this from his @ProfFaustus account, which, intriguingly, appears to have been deleted in recent days.)  As I munched on my popcorn, I found myself sympathizing with the ever-astute Angela Walch, a constant, formidable critic of blockchain advocates’ sweeping, hand-wavy claims to the magic of “decentralization.”  In a stage-setting tweetstorm, Walch pointed out that the cheerleading for Binance’s move exposed the “cognitive dissonance in what the space claims to be about.”    Do I have this right...one guy thinks what another guy said is not true so says no one can trade a censorship-resistant, decentralized digital asset on the first guy's exchange. #crypto #blockchain #veilofdecentralization        — Angela Walch (@angela_walch) April 15, 2019      But then, along came investor Ari Paul, who gave the whole thing a different context.  You see, Paul said, the standard of censorship resistance does not extend to private entities that provide services on top of open systems, much as Binance does with the bitcoin protocol and those of other blockchains. These private agents are free to deal with their clients as they wish.    1/ Freedom of speech is a value near and dear to my heart, so it's frustrating seeing people misuse ""censorship"" and conflate radically different cases. It's not censorship for Amtrak to have a quiet rail car. Let's explore Binance/BSV:        — Ari Paul ⛓️ (@AriDavidPaul) April 16, 2019      That seemed fair enough too. It accurately distinguished between the decentralized rule-setting of each system’s underlying blockchain – the layer to which the aspiration for censorship-resistance applies – and the centralized entities that access it.  And on that basis, Paul’s point matched how U.S. courts approach First Amendment lawsuits. To preserve free enterprise, courts routinely allow privately-owned entities to pick and choose whom they deal with and what information they publish, whereas they will curtail government entities’ efforts to restrict the speech of private citizens and businesses.  Similarly, we could argue that a price-quoting and trade-executing crypto exchange whose business decisions occur off-chain isn’t subject to the rigid, quasi-constitutional on-chain rules for equitable treatment that govern the decentralized network running a blockchain’s publishing protocol.  An exchange can refuse the prices and transactions of whomever it pleases. Doing so does not compromise the integrity of the free-speech/anti-censorship standards of the underlying blockchain’s governance system.  Holding the big guys to account  The problem is there are countless different blockchains. And within that environment, exchanges such as Binance don’t so much operate an application (i.e. run a private business) and subject it to a single blockchain’s governance system, but rather service the needs of people moving across those systems.  Using the same constitutional analogy, they are flag-less shippers carrying information across borders; they aren’t jurisdictionally bound by any one government.  In playing this role, cryptocurrency exchanges aren’t executing the censorship-resistant rules of a blockchain but, as the on- and off-ramps between different blockchains’ assets, they are nonetheless vital to the functioning of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem.  That’s why critics like Walch are rightly highlighting their actions. So far, exchanges represent pretty much the only proven business use-case in this space. They are the cryptocurrency industry. Surely, they should be held to high standards of neutrality.  Comparisons can be drawn to the debate over “deplatforming” on Twitter, Facebook and other social media entities. On the one hand, these can be viewed as private entities free to censor whomever they like.  On the other, because of their giant networks, the public naturally wants to hold them to a different standard. Given the enormous role they play in our communication system, there’s a strong case for regulating their publication decisions, much as governments regulate public electricity or water utilities.  Due to its size, Binance could be characterized as the cryptocurrency equivalent of a dominant social media network. Just as being banned from Twitter and Facebook can seriously hurt the economic performance of a social media influencer, so too can a Binance delisting seriously hurt the value of a crypto token.  The role of regulation  That brings us to another analogy proffered by critics of Binance’s actions. Imagine the outcry, some said, if leaders of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq – both integral to a functioning capital market ecosystem – suspended trading in a company because they didn’t like the comments of its CEO. The point: Binance should be held to similar standards of impartiality.  But the comparison is imperfect. The NYSE and Nasdaq, as well as countless other formal stock exchanges around the world, frequently delist companies for reasons of wrongdoing. It’s just that they apply a highly regulated framework when doing so.  Take a look at the most up-to-date list of “issues pending suspension or delisting” at Nasdaq and you’ll see that the reason many companies are on that list is, very often, one of “regulatory/non-compliance” issues.  In other words, whatever “censorship” decisions that sophisticated, traditional exchanges make tend to occur on the basis of rules set by an external governance system.  In the U.S., it’s an interconnected hierarchy that includes exchange members; self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Industry (FINRA); the exchange’s own internal compliance teams and oversight boards; various bodies of legislation; and external enforcement agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Now consider a thought for CZ. He was under enormous pressure from both sides of the BTC vs. BSV fight to decide what he felt would best serve his and the industry’s long-term interests. But he did so without a set of external rules to refer to. If he had one, he could more comfortably have argued that his hands were tied.  I don’t expect CZ to call for more regulation. But the fact is that regulation, by externalizing the listing rules criteria, would, at least in these kinds of matters, help crypto exchanges manage their public image.  It might be tempting to believe these are just temporary problems because new decentralized exchange models will let clients maintain custody of their assets and independently execute their trades. But execution isn’t the main reason we depend on exchanges; it’s that, as centralized hubs, they bring many buyers and sellers together in one place, enabling effective price discovery.  The harsh reality is that, until someone achieves the extremely difficult goal of creating an effective, fully open-source trade-matching and price-discovery algorithm running on an entirely decentralized network, cryptocurrency ecosystems will depend upon the network effects that these necessarily centralized entities generate. And that’s why consistent listing standards, and the question of how to enforce them, matter.  In the absence of consistent, externally enforced rules, it’s perhaps unfair to hold Binance – a centralized entity, not a miner in a blockchain – to a “censorship-resistance” standard. CZ had to make a decision amid the chaotic hurly-burly of a boisterous community. By the same token, we can perhaps excuse the seemingly hypocritical stances of many BTC investors who supported that decision.  But that should not stop users from demanding that crypto exchanges establish and adhere to more consistent standards and rules. A company of such size and influence over the crypto ecosystem must be held to account – a standard no different from what we should demand of banks in the fiat ecosystem.  This, and not the tortured discussion over what “censorship” means, is the most important lesson to take from the latest bout of crypto agita stirred up by my Aussie compatriot.
