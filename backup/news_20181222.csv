42381421,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lPh,1545491348,Why the CFTC's Questions About Ethereum Matter,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and member of CoinDesk’s product team.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a newsletter for the institutional market, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.    ————————–————————–————————–————————–————————–————————–    Are ether futures just around the corner?  Last week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a series of questions for the public, focusing on the workings of ethereum and the market for its token, ether.  That ether futures are being considered is not a surprise. In July, Cboe Global Markets said it was contemplating listing ether futures but was waiting for CFTC guidance, which implies that it has had discussions with the derivatives regulator. It’s unlikely to be the only one.  What is a surprise is the new approach the CFTC seems to be taking – and what it could mean for cryptocurrency development going forward.  Ether futures?  Before delving into the CFTC’s changing role, let’s look at how likely ether futures are in the short term.  On the one hand, listed ether derivatives would give the CFTC insight into the underlying markets and enable it to more efficiently monitor the network and pursue possible cases of manipulation and fraud.  On the other hand, there’s the problem of potential manipulation. The derivatives regulator has often stressed the importance of mitigating the possibility of manipulation in any given contract market – which means mitigating it in the underlying market as well. Academic research has shown that the bitcoin price was being manipulated in the run-up to and the aftermath of the launch of bitcoin futures.  Ether’s volume is approximately a third of that of bitcoin, so it is not a stretch to assume that it, too, is vulnerable. Also, the upcoming consensus protocol switch from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake adds a unique and substantial risk to the integrity of the underlying asset.  No doubt it will have been exhaustively tested by the time it goes live – but no amount of testing can completely eliminate the possibility that something can go wrong. The added risk will spill over into the derivatives market, not just from confusion and volatility, but also from the spikes in hedging demand as the switch approaches.  So, while an ether futures contract on a regulated exchange would give the CFTC more influence in ensuring market integrity, there are strong fundamental reasons against it.  In the way  If the CFTC decides that it definitely does not want ether derivatives trading on any of the platforms under its oversight, can it stop it? The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 introduced the concept of self-certification, in which exchanges can start trading a new contract the day after presenting the CFTC with the necessary commitments that the contract does not violate any rules.  While it is difficult to imagine an exchange presenting such documentation knowing that the CFTC disapproves, the agency has stressed that if a contract complies with established regulation, it can’t really say no.  Responding to criticism that bitcoin futures were rushed through with no public input, in January Chairman Giancarlo reminded the community that self-certification rules were implemented to foster innovation by implementing a faster approval process. He did, however, add to the review checklist the requirement that the soliciting exchanges seek and accommodate sector responses.  Here is where we start to see a change in approach.  More hands-on  One of Chairman Giancarlo’s main objectives, when he took office in 2017, was to enhance the CFTC’s influence over the markets it is entrusted to regulate. He has also often spoken eloquently of the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  As a result, his agency has been navigating a path between deeper oversight and supporting the development of innovative assets.  Rather than allow the bitcoin futures listing process to mirror the relatively straightforward self-certification enjoyed by more traditional contracts, the CFTC was in conversations with the relevant exchanges for months before they launched and was instrumental in changes to margin and information-sharing requirements.  The process for ether futures has gone a step further.  It is unusual for the CFTC to ask for public input into an underlying asset – this could signal the beginning of a new era of public/private collaboration. Although the forum is open until February, the response from the communityhttps://github.com/ethhub-io/ethhub/blob/master/other/ethhub-cftc-response.md has already been informative and enthusiastic.  Joint effort  Going forward, this collaboration is likely to produce more robust crypto markets with stronger institutional support.  Greater involvement from the CFTC, and a broader understanding of the technology will give it deeper insight into the workings of both crypto derivative and spot platforms. This should increase its comfort level with the growth of the sector.  The effect will be an even stronger layer of legitimacy, which could encourage further institutional investment in the asset and its infrastructure. It could also lead to the approval of other types of crypto products – for instance, it’s extremely unlikely an ether ETF will be allowed before ether futures have some traction.  And greater oversight, stronger regulatory support and more resilient investor confidence should lead to deeper liquidity, which will, in turn, encourage even more adoption and development of an important part of the crypto ecosystem.

42381437,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lhJ,1545483706,Saying Goodbye to the Blockchain Romantics,"Elly Zhang is director of partnerships of Heliocor, a leading regulatory technology company based in London. She previously lead Asia growth initiatives for the cryptocurrency wallet startup Blockchain.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  As crypto prices continue to fall, 2018 is ending on a sour note for the global blockchain community.  To some, this is a time for reflection, a time to shrug off the hype and really assess what we’ve achieved over the past few years. But it's possible that’s just the optimistic spin on things: perhaps, it’s really time to look back and assess where DLT tech is going in the future, and whether or not we’ve all been spending our time constructively at all...  Key to this is revisiting our core assumptions. Ever since the blockchain was conceived, the debate regarding “decentralization” has been at the forefront of discourse. That's because a primary selling point of the technology has and continues to be its promise to clear real financial transactions in a way that is fundamentally different – and better – from the system we know today.  As we're finding out, though, it's possible for blockchains to be centralized in some ways and decentralized in others.  Mining  The first stop for many when addressing decentralization in public cryptocurrencies is mining, or how most networks ensure the validity of their ledgers and mint new cryptocurrency. It's safe to say that mining on most cryptocurrencies doesn't happen as it was originally envisioned (with a great many users participating in a meaningful way).  Miners and mining machines were never envisaged to be part of the core infrastructure powering any blockchain technology. Rather, mining emerged purely as a way of controlling the partition of limited ‘coin’ resources for any given ‘blockchain’ product. In actual fact though, for the purposes of decentralization, mining should really be a redundant process.  Yet, the economies of scale of bitcoin mining – the more power you have, the more you earn – is impacting progress.  Let's take a recent example, mining giant Bitmain's launch of the AntMiner X3. Designed to mine Monero, the cryptocurrency's users quickly decided to change the algorithm and remove mining machines in response to the release. Bitmain's machines can now only continue to mine the original algorithm, now present on a new coin called XMC (Monero Classic).  Monero itself now utilizes only CPU and GPU resources on personal computers for mining. The result, we're told, is that the system is more ""decentralized,"" though we have little in the way of metrics to determine if this is true.  Code  That said, the biggest challenge to decentralization (in public blockchain) remains who is in control of the code upgrades.  The bitcoin blockchain is maintained by the Bitcoin Core team. But in fact, many changes are preceded by intense negotiations and debates both on and offline. Only once consensus is reached is it then implemented. The bitcoin cash split can be seen as the result of a breakdown of such negotiations.  Yet, it's just one example of how the development process can be decentralized (in that anyone can propose and write code), and yet very centralized and inherently political, in that it requires an incredibly specialized knowledge (and a lot of social capital) to even participate in such debates.  Another example is Ethereum, which can be said to take a different approach, one critics argue is more akin to authoritarianism. Take the failure of the DAO, which allowed many thousands of ether to be stolen. In this case, a small group of Ethereum developers obliged users to forcefully roll back its blockchain history. The original Ethereum now continues as Ethereum Classic.  In these two examples, we can see that so-called decentralization is taking place on the application level. At the development level, whether it is open source or blockchain, a certain degree of centralization appears to be in practice.  Politics  But if mining and technical centralization are issues we can overcome with time, there's a more fundamental problem identified in the two examples above – blockchains introduce politics.  While there has always been politics in any process involving people, with regulators now piling into the mix, I predict that the politicization of blockchain will only continue to get worse. In fact, I believe it's likely to be the biggest challenge facing the sector.  From my perspective, human beings are first and foremost decentralized creatures – we live our lives as small, distinct, autonomous units (a family structure, company or team). However, with urbanization and the course of human history, society has inevitably leaned toward centralization, as it brings numerous inevitable advantages. Administering and catering for any population within a carefully defined zone under a government is a system that has proliferated the world over for good reason.  In other words, decentralization does not have an absolute superiority over centralization. This can be applied to bitcoin as well — bitcoin does not naturally save transaction costs while achieving the same security as a centralized monetary system.  What decentralization does do, however, is remove the single point of failure caused by centralized structures, diversifying risk and making identifying problems easier. At the same time, if we adopt more transparent algorithms and mechanisms, we can spread any risks currently characteristic of blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency.  Ideology  Separate from politics, is the question of the ideologies that enable them.  Bitcoin, as an example, can be said to have been created an ideology. At the beginning of bitcoin's birth, many people participated in and supported its development because they believed in absolute freedom, lacked trust in government and were adamant that any concentration of capital leads to corruption.  From the technical perspective, there will always be an obsession with decentralized systems. As touched on previously though, creating such a system in an efficient, ‘decentralized’ way might currently be beyond the thinking of this generation’s software engineering teams.  Where is the next evolution of a ‘skunkworks’ style team, removed from traditional managerial constraints and how will it reconcile the needs and wants of wildly disparate groups of end-users?  Despite the various problems of traditional institutions and organizations, the principles and design assumptions of the blockchain make it difficult to convince me that a large-scale decentralized system will be more reliable than a centralized institution that is regulated, protected and balanced. I think that the future of blockchain may become a tool for creating genuine value in some specific areas, but a successful system will be the result of a compromise between multiple design dimensions.  Expectations  What does this mean for true believers?  For one, it means people who think the blockchain will change everything are being too romantic about decentralization. If a blockchain project says they are seeking decentralization, and can safely and reliably process 100,000 transactions per second, keep in mind: many have had this goal in the past, and none have truly succeeded.  I’ve found an idiom to exactly capture my thoughts set out above: ""If something is apparently too good to be true, it probably is.""  In short, it might be best to view the blockchain is a sociological revolution, not a technological revolution. The technology is not new. Just as Steve Jobs brought together many ideas in the iPhone, Satoshi Nakamoto assembled bitcoin from established technology.  In the months and years ahead, entrepreneurs and developers will need to keep this in mind. We need to understand both commercial realities and human nature, but we need a dose of realism, too.

42381426,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lSD,1545441313,Launch of Bakkt Bitcoin Futures Market May Get Postponed Again,"Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, is likely to delay the launch of Bakkt, its bitcoin futures trading and custody platform, a second time, CoinDesk has learned.  The company last set Jan. 24 as the launch date. However, ICE has yet to receive the necessary approvals from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and at the pace the agency has been moving, it is unlikely that approvals will be secured in time to hit that target.  To be clear: That does not mean the CFTC won't ultimately approve the plan. A person familiar with the agency's inner workings said even a Jan. 30 launch was still plausible, meaning the delay could be just a matter of days.  Specifically, the CFTC must grant an exemption for Bakkt's plan to custody bitcoin on behalf of its clients in its own ""warehouse,"" according to sources familiar with regulatory discussions of the plan. CFTC regulations normally require that customer funds be held by a bank, trust company or futures commission merchant (FCM).  The agency's staff has finished reviewing Bakkt's exemption request and passed it to the commission on Friday, one source said. Now the commissioners have to vote on whether to put out the proposal for public comment. After the 30-day comment period, the commissioners would likely take at least a couple days to read the comments, and then vote on the proposal itself.  But here's the deal: Monday and Tuesday are now federal employee holidays. So unless these government officials decide to work on their days off, the earliest the commissioners are likely to vote on a public comment period and thereby start the 30-day clock is Wednesday, Dec. 26, the day after Christmas.  That already would push any final vote past Bakkt's Jan. 24 launch target, even without taking into account the time needed to read the public comments. The possibility of a U.S. government shutdown threatens to further delay the process.  The exchange is likely to issue an updated launch target date, but not until next week, another source said.  This would be the second postponement. ICE had originally aimed to launch Bakkt in December, but last month it said that the “volume of interest” in the company and the “work required to get all the pieces in place” necessitated a delay.  Unlike the bitcoin futures offered by CME Group and Cboe, Bakkt's will be physically settled, meaning actual bitcoin will change hands rather than cash when the contracts expire.
