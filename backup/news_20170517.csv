42379494,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX888FJ,1495061114,Bitcoin Exchange Spreads Are Narrowing But Gaps Remain,"Bitfinex's banking challenges seem to be slowly fading into the background.  As the exchange makes progress toward providing customers with the ability to make deposits and withdrawals, the spread between bitcoin prices on its order books and the various international exchanges has been on the decline.  While the differential between Bitfinex and itBit neared $100 roughly a month ago, this gap was close to $50 at roughly 19:00 UTC, according to CryptoCompare data. The spreads were also very similar between the exchange and its US counterparts GDAX and Gemini.  But while spreads were similar on the aforementioned exchanges, they varied quite a bit on other marketplaces. The price of bitcoin was very similar on Bitfinex and Poloniex, but it was roughly $30 lower on Kraken.  In a few instances, spreads were far higher, reaching approximately $80 on OKCoin and surpassing $100 on BTC-e.  Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to the situation, affirming that it's largely due to continued withdrawal limitations at China-based exchanges, though he noted others like BTC-e are still lower due to banking issues.  He said:  ""Until I hear otherwise, I presume it's because they still haven't re-enabled crypto withdrawals. That problem, and spread, is pretty much unchanged since [February].""  Still, compared to other exchanges, Bitfinex is showing signs its easing former concerns about its stability and solvency.  Bitfinex has been working to overcome its difficulties in this area for the last several months. The exchange announced in April that it was having problems involving outbound USD wires and incoming wire transfers.  Further, it continued to struggle with additional setbacks, announcing 20th April that it was encountering delays affecting its wire transfers.  But Bitfinex appears to be taking a proactive approach to addressing these challenges, announcing 12th May that ""other channels have been slowly ramping up"" in an effort to provide customers with greater ability to make deposits and withdrawals.

42379468,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885LP,1495049557,CFTC 2.0: US Regulator Unveils Plan to Step Up Blockchain R&D,"The US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) revealed a new fintech initiative today that will find the regulator seeking to increase its participation in the ongoing global R&D effort related to blockchain and distributed ledger tech.  As part of a sweeping CFTC 2.0 proposal, the US options and futures regulator is launching LabCFTC, a fintech initiative that will seek to bolster the pace at which the regulator assesses new technologies. The aim, according to the CFTC, is to become ""more accessible"" to innovators working on new financial technologies through the program.  The CFTC also made public a LabCFTC component called GuidePoint, both an online tool that will provide a point of contact for entrepreneurs, and a physical location in New York where they can find an open door for such guidance, and ""CFTC 2.0"", described as an initiative to foster and help initiate the adoption of new technology within the agency.  In statements today at the New York FinTech Innovation Lab, Chairman Christopher Giancarlo characterized the mission as one that would seek to explore new technologies including AI, machine learning and DLT.  In particular, he cited advances such as ""smart contracts that value themselves and calculate payments in real-time"" and ""distributed ledger technology, more commonly known as blockchain"" as innovations that will challenge the financial infrastructure today.  Giancarlo said of the program:  ""We will look to explore ways to use fintech to enhance CFTC functions and duties. For example, we might collaborate with other authorities on leading development of best practices to support the development of 'regulator nodes' on distributed ledgers, or experiment with collecting or distributing existing CFTC reports through blockchain technology.""  As evidence of the need for action, Giancarlo cited the speed at which other enabling technologies – including automated trading – have reshaped modern financial markets and put new stress on regulators.  ""The world is changing. Our parents' financial markets are gone. The 21st century digital transformation is well underway,"" he remarked.  Such a move finds the CFTC emerging as one of the more active global regulators when it comes to conceiving how it will respond to the advent of distributed ledger solutions.  Among the more active jurisdictions globally include Japan, where the legislature has passed national regulations aimed at cryptocurrencies, and Mauritius and Malta, which have recently announced initiatives aimed at providing clarity to regional innovators.

42379482,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885aV,1495035213,"Bitcoin's Price Edges Back Above $1,800 After Near $100 Gain","The price of bitcoin is up nearly $100 on the day, rising more than 5% to reach a high of $1,814 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At press time, the average bitcoin price across major exchanges was $1,808, up from an opening average of $1,718.20. The increase follows a correction earlier this week in which bitcoin fell to $1,650, and comes at a time at which the market for blockchain protocols is becoming more competitive.  In particular, protocols like Ripple Consensus Ledger, developed by San Francisco startup Ripple for cross-border transactions, and ethereum, a blockchain for smart contracts, have begun to develop unique value propositions that appear to be winning investment dollars.  Ripple's XRP token, for instance, is up nearly 6,000% on the year, while ethereum's ether token was up nearly 1,000%.  The development has not gone unnoticed by exchange and brokerage operators.  In response to questions about how new customers are behaving, Bram Ceelen, co-founder of cryptocurrency brokerage Anycoin Direct, reported they are ""pretty much buying everything"", a statement that's consistent with the current speculative appetite.  ""Altcoin volume might have even increased more than bitcoin volume [of late],"" he said.  Andrea Medri, founder of cryptocurrency exchange The Rock Trading, however, voiced his optimism that bitcoin would continue to establish its own value proposition, even in such an environment.

42379474,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885QR,1495024808,"US National Security Advisor: Bitcoin Needs to Be Understood, Not Feared","A think tank that advises several US government agencies is now exploring the potential threats bitcoin poses to national security.  Still in its earliest phases, the research is being headed by the director of analysis at the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance in Washington, DC, and crafted to gather data on how state actors might currently use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions.  Contrary to some inflammatory calls to ban bitcoin, however, the research, being conducted by Yaya J Fanusie of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, is looking as much at how blockchain can help prevent illicit activity as how it can enable it.  After spending seven years as both an economic and counter-terrorism analyst in the CIA, Fanusie told CoinDesk:  ""What is needed is a more informed discussion about what the implications may be, because there's so much defensiveness – there's defensiveness on both sides, and I think we should come a little bit to the center, point out potential threats, but also point out benefits it has.""  The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 to advise members of Congress, federal agencies, the US Treasury Department and other agencies about how to prevent terrorism around the world.  Fanusie was hired in 2015, at which point he first began looking into the potential national security threats resulting from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, he was skeptical that the mostly unverifiable claims were true. But when he discovered a known terrorist organization using Twitter to raise money for weapons, he intensifiedhttps://www.thecipherbrief.com/column/private-sector/new-frontier-terror-fundraising-bitcoin-1089 his research.  Then last month, CoinDesk reported that the Swedish government had incorporated a venture capital firm that would begin investing in Iran using the payment method.  By using bitcoin to incorporate in Sweden which, along with the rest of Europe, has a more relaxed policy on sanctions against Iran, the startup, Brave New World Investments, is helping pave the way for what could end up being a legal way for some to circumvent US sanctions.  But, according to Fanusie, the potential threat should not be exaggerated. ""Bitcoin by itself is not going to compensate for all the outlets that are cut off,"" he said, adding:  ""It’s not going to be the big loophole that is going to allow billions of dollars to be funneled to the Iranian regime.""  Balanced view  Similarly, Fanusie sought to temper the escalating concerns being circulated in the media about bitcoin being used as part of the 'WannaCry' ransomware attacks, in which an estimated 200,000 victims were asked to pay bitcoin to regain access to encrypted computer files.  Instead of focusing on the potential threat that bitcoin might pose, Fanusie said the hacks are more evidence of how bitcoin enables ""transactions which financial authorities can’t interdict"".  ""This is not illicit in itself,"" said Fanusie. ""It's just a more recent and increasingly more common way of transacting that serves anyone looking for alternative payment methods.""  In the future, he said that cyber forensics investigations into more traditional online crime will likely need to happen ""in tandem"" with investigations of blockchain itself.  Fanusie said:  ""The lesson here is that those concerned about illicit finance need to be familiar with these cryptocurrencies, not to fear this technology, but to work in what is an increasingly digital and cyber world.""  Blockchain and democracy  In its infancy, blockchain technology, which makes middlemen less necessary (or not necessary at all), was developed out of ""desire for freedom"" according to Fanusie. ""A desire for more of a democratic way of transacting or interacting.""  While potential threats to national security – such as the raising of funds for terrorism, the circumventing of sanctions and the ransoming of vital infrastructure – remain worth researching, Fanusie also emphasized the need to learn more about its benefits as well.  He mentioned the growing prevalence of cryptocurrency exchanges conducting know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) due diligence as evidence of how products built with blockchain can help remove the need for middlemen while still adhereing to international protections.  He also cited the increased exploration of blockchain by supply-chain infrastructure providers as a possible way to prevent trade-based money laundering, where the price of imported goods is increased or lowered to effectively send money or charge fees for illicit activities.  ""It should be more difficult to traffic in weapons, or in drugs or doing money laundering, to funnel more money to a cause which could be used for a terrorist group,"" said Fanusie.  Seeking understanding  In the fallout surrounding the WannaCry ransom attacks, a number of formal studies have been revealed.  Just this week, an effort by the US Congress to better understand potential links between cryptocurrencies and terrorism, and a new partnership between the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, have both been announced.  As for Fanusie, in addition to better understanding what it might mean if cryptocurrency usage were to spike in Iran, he says he wants to learn more about other usage patterns – for example, in China and in other nations and cities around the world – and how central banks might implement various blockchain solutions.  He concluded:  ""We should be really thinking, from a US perspective, what it means if the US is behind? If policy makers don’t understand it. What does it mean for strategic national security interests? I’m not even answering the question. I’m posing the question.""

42379471,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885Nv,1495020606,Trust Your Oracle? Cornell Launches Tool for Confidential Blockchain Queries,"Smart contracts are touted as having the potential to do all kinds amazing things. But, to fulfill their promise, they need a way to communicate with the outside world.  That is not so easily done. Due of the nature of a blockchain (all nodes need to agree on any change in state of the database), smart contracts cannot simply fetch data on their own.  So, instead, they rely on 'oracles'.  A key part of the smart contract ecosystem, oracles allow smart contracts to access information, like commodity, currency, derivative pricing and more, from websites, and then use that data to implement the terms of a smart contract.  But oracles come with their own set of challenges.  For example, an oracle needs to be able to provide a tamper-proof source of information. So, if your smart contract offers insurance against flight cancellations, you want to make sure that the data you are getting on flights is accurate, and has not been altered at any point after being scraped from the website.  Confidential queries are another issue. Say, a smart contract needs information on a personal bank statement or a medical record. A query from the oracle to the website would need to contain login, password or other private information. And you don't want anyone seeing that.  Sealed in a box  To that end, researchers at Cornell's Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) have launched an oracle service that allows ethereum smart contracts to obtain trustworthy information and to securely send confidential queries to websites.  Unlike other oracles, Town Crier, as the service is called, gets its added security from Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX). IC3 has already implemented SGX on Teechan, a proposed off-chain payment solution for bitcoin, though not without some measure of debate.  But Town Crier is officially IC3's first published and first deployed SGX-based tool.  If you are wondering how SGX works, it essentially lets you run code inside an enclave, or a type of black box environment, which provides extra protection against tampering. Not even a computer's own operating system can see the data inside the enclave.  Another feature SGX offers is 'remote attestation'. That means those using the service will be able to validate Town Crier code is in fact running in a secure SGX environment.  Ari Juels, a professor at Cornell Tech working on the project, told CoinDesk:  ""Assuming that you trust SGX, data delivered by Town Crier from a website is guaranteed to be free from tampering. This authenticity property means that to trust Town Crier's data, you only need to trust Intel's implementation of SGX and the target website.""  While Town Crier runs its core code on a server with an SGX chip, the solution also has a front end that consists of a smart contract running on the ethereum blockchain.  According to Juels, Town Crier will also be instrumental for permissioned blockchains, in which fewer, trusted participants exchange data.  He said:  ""Even if banks trust one another to source data correctly, they are not going to trust one another to handle data on business plans or trades, so confidentiality features of a system like this are also very important in a permissioned setting.""    Other solutions        Still, IC3 is not alone in seeking to provide assistance on oracles.  Other oracles that have been proposed in the past include Augur and Gnosis, which are both prediction markets that rely on the 'wisdom of the crowd'.  Another service is Oraclize, which relies on a TLSNotary – a service that allows an auditor to verify if a specific web page was accurately retrieved. Still, Town Crier is framed as unique in that it relies on a specific type of hardware for its security.  Right now, although fully functional, Town Crier is still officially in alpha, and supports only query types for flight data, stock tickers, UPS tracking and weather data.  The project has also partnered with SmartContracts.com, so anyone wanting to spin up a Town Crier oracle and experiment with coin price queries, can easily do so.

When a user broadcasts a bitcoin transaction (or one for any other digital currency), they attach a fee that acts as an incentive for miners to include that transaction in their next block.  The higher the fee, the more likely a miner will want to include it, as they’ll collect any associated fees should their block be accepted by the wider network.  According to an email sent to users by Xapo, they’ll now be responsible for this fee, though the startup clarified that any transfers between Xapo accounts won’t incur this charge. It cited growing network activity as the major factor behind the policy shift.  The startup explained:  ""Due to the increase in transaction volume of the bitcoin network, we'd like to give our users some control over their transactions. That being said, Xapo will give you the ability to select which type of fee you'd like to pay – a standard or high priority fee – thus allowing you to choose how quickly you'd like for your transaction to be processed!""

42379469,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885Mf,1495011606,DC Blockchain Advocates Seek Distance From Bitcoin Amid Ransomware Wave,"Amid a flurry of negative publicity for bitcoin, technology advocates are trying to distance themselves from the digital currency as part of a bid to protect the perception of more enterprise-facing blockchain initiatives.  The change of public positioning follows an uptick in ransomware attacks using bitcoin as the medium of payment, the most recent of which (after causing major disruption within the UK's National Health Service and elsewhere) has sparked a global conversation.  At a briefing for congressional staff on Tuesday covering the potential uses of blockchain technology in the US healthcare system, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and a panel of other blockchain specialists acknowledged that the ransomware issue is again opening old wounds caused by the technology's association with illicit uses of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  In response, panelists sought to draw clear lines between the two technologies.  ""A lot of these initial attacks have been on healthcare systems and healthcare companies. This has come onto our radar because the ransomware is asking for the ransom in bitcoin,"" Perianne Boring, president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, told an audience of roughly 70 healthcare and technology-focused staffers from congressional offices.  Elsewhere, the panelists sought to categorize bitcoin as merely ""one application"" of blockchain technology.  Srinivas Attili, senior vice president and partner at IBM Global Business Services, told attendees:  ""Blockchain [gets] a lot of bad rap because of bitcoin, in my view. Bitcoin is just one application of blockchain, and you can have hundreds of applications of blockchain.""  Blockchain good, bitcoin bad  Just how much regulatory attention is being aimed at bitcoin in the wake of the incidents is unclear, though a member of Congress introduced a bill Tuesday ordering the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a threat assessment regarding the use of virtual currencies by terrorists and criminals.  It's happened before, so advocates worry bitcoin's bad press will rub off on blockchain.  Attili drew the comparison to Amazon being just one among a countless number of businesses built on the HTTP protocol, and highlighted Hyperledger as a promising blockchain technology suite that he believes is isolated from any nefarious activity associated with cryptocurrencies.  ""It's built for business. There's no concept of cryptocurrencies on Hyperledger,"" he said.  Yet, Micah Winkelspecht, chief executive of Gem, a blockchain solutions company, did defend bitcoin, asserting that it's serving a legitimate use as a means of exchanging value.  Winkelspecht said:  ""Bitcoin is to those types of attacks as the dollar is to the drug trade. Just because the dollar exists doesn't mean that it's the cause of the drug trade. Bitcoin is just a tool that these criminals are using because it is a good form of exchanging value. It's actually serving a really good purpose as an exchange of value. They are leveraging it as a tool.""  ""Blaming bitcoin for ransomware would be like blaming the Federal Reserve for any illicit transaction that happens in cash,"" Boring added.  Recasting the narrative  Still, the damage dealt by the ransomware attacks, compounded by past black eyes like Mt Gox and Silk Road, may cut deeper than many in the cryptocurrency community may wish to recognize.  Congressional staffers speaking privately after the event said the concept of blockchain must be, to all intents and purposes, disassociated from bitcoin to gain serious traction in the legislative arena.  Boring tried to flip the narrative by saying that, instead of blaming bitcoin for the attacks, there should be greater focus on the potential of blockchain to protect against ransomware and other cyberattacks in the future.  She said:  ""I would even argue that when we talk about protecting our healthcare systems or other systems that might be vulnerable to ransomware or other types of cyberattacks, that blockchain technology could be the silver bullet to protecting our infrastructure.""  Winkelspecht concurred, arguing that blockchain could provide a better, more secure way to store data as hackers become more sophisticated in the future.  ""Before, we used to see attacks that were more DDoS – they were attacks on infrastructure trying to bring systems down,"" he said. ""Now we're starting to see more infiltration. They’re basically putting a ransom on data because that data is so valuable and they know that people will pay to unlock it.""  Winkelspecht predicted that the next phase of cyberattacks will be ""data integrity"" attacks that involve breaking into a system and actually altering existing data in a way that ""tricks"" downstream systems.  ""Those are the most dangerous and potentially the most costly types of attacks because you may not know it's happening for literally years,"" he explained.  The immutability of blockchain technologies, though, could be the only true line of defense against such intrusions, he said adding:  ""One of the things that blockchains can provide is an immutable proof of data integrity. We can guarantee beyond a shadow of a doubt that data has not been modified or changed.”  Washington, DC, image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Aaron Stanley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2017/05/17/dc-blockchain-advocates-seek-distance-from-bitcoin-amid-ransomware-wave,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5fe3538b672ffb8cee3cb353833dd129352712a8-1529x860.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42379483,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX885bl,1494993648,Chile's Largest Stock Exchange Plans to Implement IBM Blockchain Tech,"A major blockchain trial is moving toward implementation in Chile.  Revealed today, global tech giant IBM is making public a project with the Santiago Stock Exchange that will find Latin America's third-largest stock exchange incorporating a blockchain-based securities lending solution built jointly by the two companies.  As explained by IBM, the new tool will help enable Chile's securities lenders, banks, stock exchanges, institutional clients and regulators, to exchange information, while reducing the time it takes for relevant back-office processes by 40%.  In this way, Santiago Stock Exchange CIO Andrés Araya indicated notably that it's not the trading process – where certain ownership rights associated with a stock or derivate are traded in exchange for collateral – that is being automated, but rather the complex process that supports such economic activity.  Araya told CoinDesk:  ""We spend two-to-three days after trading signing contracts, adding the assets, and the intermediary needs to create the collateral, all of that will now be put in a block that will be queried by different intermediaries.""  Santiago Stock Exchange, Araya explained, will now seek to create a private blockchain network for the exchange of this information, whereby participating banks and regulators will also operate nodes.  Araya went on to describe the process as ""a great use case"" for blockchain due to the complexity and the expense involved.  ""The key thing that blockchain will provide is transparency related to the collateral in the lending short sale. Regulators and pension funds here in Chile, they have to know who the lender and the borrower are, and what kind of collateral they have in transactions,"" he continued.  No POC  As explained by Araya, the announcement that the project will move toward implementation marks the end of year-long journey borne out of its past working relationship with IBM.  ""At the end of the last year, we started thinking in real use cases. In 2010, we recreated our trading platform with IBM technology, and we are repeating the experience with blockchain technology,"" Araya said.  This discovery process, he reported, led his team to travel to IBM's New York offices to whiteboard different ideas for how the tech could potentially solve business pain points.  Ultimately, Araya stressed that the solution is not just a proof-of-concept, and that, by the end of the year, the goal is to begin using the system to track collateral relationships.  ""We want to prove to the market and the regulators that this technology is possible,"" he said.  The idea is now to run the blockchain-based system in parallel with its existing system over the next three-to-six months, with the goal of migrating the process completely to a distributed ledger next year.  Scaling plans  The goal over the next year is for the Santiago Stock Exchange to use its market position to build a larger ecosystem around the project.  For example, Araya noted that the Santiago Stock Exchange trades online stocks with other exchanges in countries like Peru in Mexico, and that these processes could begin to become more automated via DLT systems.  ""It's a small step for us, but it's an important step to prove how Hyperledger Fabric can scale and move forward next year,"" he said.  Fabric is one of the various standalone DLT frameworks within Hyperledger, one initially contributed in part by IBM developer Christopher Ferris. As such, according to IBM vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo, the project is also an example of the current state of its projects with partners around the world.  Armed with working technology, Cuomo noted that the Santiago Stock Exchange must turn its focus to building a network effect.  Cuomo told CoinDesk:  ""This is about taking it to the next level and starting to bring more of a consortium around [the project].""
