42425662,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqNh,1399723822,Money Spinners: Canada to Grow Its Already Prominent ATM Presence,"It's been a relatively quiet week on the ATM front. In the world of bitcoin, though, no news is often good news.  The fact that ATM installations no longer grab the headlines like they used to is a healthy sign of the times, and an indication that the machines are becoming commonplace.  Digital currency vending machines are by no means ubiquitous, however, and there are still plenty of folks who've never laid eyes on one. But, just remember how many there were in November last year, and you'll see how far we've come.  New terminology  There has even been a move away from the term 'ATM' as of late. Perhaps it's due to regulation, perhaps the expression just doesn't describe accurately what these machines do. With everything from one-way bitcoin-dispensing machines to quasi-bank branches, it's become a broad field.  So, whenever you see the term 'BTM', 'kiosk', 'vending machine' or 'ATM', understand we're talking about some kind of machine that will at least take your cash and bring you into the bitcoin economy.  While most bitcoin enthusiasts see digital currency as a move away from the banks, Robocoin has decided to head completely in the opposite direction. The company now refers to its machines as 'branches', to buy and sell as 'deposit' and 'withdraw', and to customer bitcoin addresses as 'accounts'.  Some observers said it was a crazy move, inviting greater scrutiny and regulation, but Robocoin insists it knows what it's doing.  And now, onto this week's news, breaking with tradition slightly to include up and coming launches, as well as existing ones.  This week we have another strong showing from the spiritual home of all bitcoin ATMs, Canada.  Montreal, Quebec, Canada  Local company Autocoinage is deploying two bitcoin vending machines in the Greater Montreal area for launch on 1st June and promises three more soon, including a two-way (BTC-CAD) bitcoin ATM.  As Bernie Ng, Autocoinage's owner pointed out:  ""There must be an easier, faster and secured way to purchase bitcoin with very low or nearly no commission.""  Autocoinage eventually plans to launch 10 machines in the Montreal and Ottawa area, and asks people to check its website for announcements of future locations.  Mississauga, Ontario, Canada  BitSent is a company from Waterloo, Ontario, with ambitions to become Canada's largest bitcoin ATM operator.  It plans to launch its first bitcoin 'Automated Vending Machine' (AVM) in Mississauga, Ontario, later this month. The machine will be sited at the Link It Up cell phone store (2500 Hurontario, Unit 10A at Dundas St W) – with whom BitSent has a partnership – and available for use during the store's operating hours seven days a week.  Karen Williamson, BitSent's COO, told CoinDesk:  ""We look forward to forging more partnerships across Canada in 2014 and bringing bitcoin to a community near you.""  BitSent is also developing a new interface specific for Canadian users that includes the French and Mandarin languages, as well as English – a more common sight on Canada's 'mainstream' bank ATMs.  Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA  Liberty Teller, the company that first introduced bitcoin ATMs to the US, is doing it again with a new installation at restaurant Moksa in central Cambridge, MA – very close to the MIT campus where students will be receiving $100 worth of bitcoin in a campaign to invigorate the cryptocurrency economy.  Co-founder Kyle Powers and Chris Yim say they are looking to solve what many believe are bitcoin’s biggest near-term problems: access and education.  ""Before bitcoin goes mainstream, getting and using bitcoin needs to be as simple as possible. Our kiosks and tutorials are helping us make that happen,"" Powers explained. He added:  ""Bitcoin makes sending money like sending email, and makes our current ways of sending money look like snail mail.""

42425671,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqfh,1399719605,A Network Analyst's View of the Block Chain,"Martin Harrigan is a computer scientist and software developer. He is the founder of QuantaBytes, an Irish startup developing a suite of tools for analyzing and visualising bitcoin's block chain. He is also the co-author of one of the earliest academic papers to study the network properties of the block chain and its implications for anonymity.  The block chain is a decentralised, consensus-driven ledger of every successful bitcoin transaction to date. As of the 300,000th block, the ledger includes over 38 million transactions.  Aside from being a monumental technical achievement, the block chain is a fascinating dataset. We can use it to create a transaction network that models the flow of bitcoins from the creation of the genesis block to the present day.  In this network, every node represents a transaction, and every (directed) edge represents a flow of bitcoins from an output of one transaction to an input of another. This large, complex network has over 38 million nodes and 85 million edges.  Network science  Network science is the study of complex networks. It provides theories, techniques and tools that help us understand the structure and evolution of a network. The bitcoin transaction network is a prime example. Its basic building block, the transaction, can be combined to produce complex transfers of value. This is reflected in the topological structure of the transaction network.  The network as a whole is too large and complex for most network visualisation tools. However, we can measure various structural properties of the network. For example, transactions can be characterised by their varying numbers of inputs and outputs. But how are these numbers distributed in practice? In the transaction network, we can analyse the in- and out-degrees of the nodes. We can plot the in- and out-degree distributions. They show, for each possible degree, the number of times they occur in the network.  In both cases, we observe inverse relationships between these numbers. The lower the degree, the more frequently the nodes with that degree occur; the higher the degree, the less frequently they occur. There are many outliers. The outlier in the out-degree distribution with out-degree equal to two is due to an abundance of transactions with exactly two outputs.  Giant connected component  Suppose we were able to visualise the entire bitcoin transaction network. It would probably resemble a ""hairball"". These visualisations suffer from cluttering and over-plotting to an extreme that makes them unusable for any practical purposes. However, they do provide one key piece of information. Are we dealing with one large connected component or several smaller connected components?  A connected component is a group of nodes and edges that are all connected to each other, either directly or indirectly. If a network has a giant connected component, this means that almost every node is reachable from almost every other node. If we ignore the direction of the edges in the bitcoin transaction network, then it does indeed contain a giant connected component covering over 99.9% of all nodes. The second largest connected component has just 71 nodes.  Fourteen degrees of separation  Six degrees of separation is the theory that everyone on the planet is connected to everyone else through a chain of acquaintances with no more than six hops. In network science terminology, this translates to the theory that the social network of the human race has diameter six. Facebook reported that the effective diameter (covering 90% of all pairs of users) of its social network is five and is decreasing with time.  The equivalent number for the bitcoin transaction network is fourteen and is increasing with time. That is, across 90% of all pairs of transactions, the shortest path between them in the transaction network, ignoring directionality, is at most fourteen hops. The increasing value is likely due to the fact that, unlike the Facebook social network, there is no preferential attachment. New nodes are connected to existing nodes whose corresponding transactions are not yet fully redeemed. In other words, the transaction network is growing at the frontier only.  The first currency with a ledger  Surprisingly, bitcoin is not the first currency with a ledger from which we can model the transfer of value. The Tomamae-cho community currency was introduced into the Hokkaido Prefecture in Japan for a three-month period during 2004-05 in a bid to revitalise the local economy. The Tomamae-cho system involved gift certificates that were reusable and legally redeemable into yen. There was an entry space on the reverse of each certificate for recipients to record transaction dates, their names and addresses, and the purposes of use, up to a maximum of five recipients.  Researchers collected these certificates in order to derive a network structure that represented the flow of currency during the period. They showed, for example, that the network had small world properties.  The block chain is a digital equivalent to the Tomamae-cho certificates. It does not contain information such as names and addresses or the purposes of use. However, it has other properties that make it suitable for analysing the transfer of value including its accuracy, size, and completeness.  The application of network analysis to the block chain is an under-explored, yet fascinating area. There are a handful of academic studies but very little in the way of software and tools to open it up to a wider audience. QuantaBytes is an Irish startup, founded by the author, developing a suite of tools for analysing and visualising bitcoin's block chain. By understanding the structure and evolution of the block chain, we can better understand bitcoin's usage patterns, economy, and the growth of the system as a whole.

42425667,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIeqTh,1399716008,$46k Spent on Mining Hardware: What Happened Next?,"In March 2014, Dario Di Pardo wrote about his experiences having spent around $46,000 on a number of mining rigs and suffered from delays, poor communication from manufacturers, frustration and yet more delays over the five months since the investments were made.  In part two of the series, he brings us up to date on his orders, and tells us which are the companies that come up with the goods and which are the ones to avoid.      Vendor: Black Arrow  Product: Prospero X-3 (2 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $4,978  Order date: 18th Nov, 2013  Anticipated shipping date: 24th Feb, 2014  Expected delay: 2.5 to 3 months  A new progress update on 28th April tells us that shipping of Black Arrow's Prospero X-3 is anticipated to start on 8th May.  Considering the tight schedule and amount of work that still has to be done according this update, I can't help but be somewhat doubtful about the target date mentioned. I sure hope they can pull it off, though.  The compensation Black Arrow has been offering to its customers for late delivery was also recently updated: instead of the originally offered 25% extra hashing power in the form of free cloud hashing for a period of six months, customers are now being offered 50% extra hashing power by means of more powerful hardware.  In my case this would mean receiving equipment rated at 3 TH/s instead of 2 TH/s. While this sounds great, there is also a catch.  Customers would have to buy an extra heavy-duty power supply and pay for additional shipping costs to make use of this hardware boost. The price of the power supply, which can be bought directly from their store, is unknown at this point.  Although appreciating this offer, I share the feeling expressed by most other customers: compensation isn't exactly compensation when you have to pay for it.      Vendor: HashFast  Product: Sierra (1.2 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $6,696  Order date: 18th Nov, 2013  'Guaranteed' delivery date: 15th Feb, 2014  Expected delay: 3 months  Status: Refund requested on 1st April  After HashFast missed their second delivery deadline of 31st March, I decided to apply for a refund of my order.  In addition to the long delay, the decision was largely based on the fact that I had lost confidence in the company. Setting new deadlines without explaining why the previous ones couldn’t be met, poor customer service and negative public perception all contributed to this.  Since I sent a refund request by email on 1st April, customer experience hasn't improved.  The day after I filed the request, I received an email containing a link to a document to be signed digitally in order for the refund to be processed. This contract however contained numerous complicated and, to me, unnecessary terms and conditions.  After careful consideration and seeking legal advice, I decided not to sign it. Instead I sent a refund request reminder both by email and registered letter on 11th April. These missives, along with further emails I've sent to HashFast since, all remain unanswered to date.  Perhaps in an effort to turn the (possibly sinking) ship around, HashFast recently made a public apology to its customers. Hopefully we will see these good intentions put into practice soon.      Vendor: Virtual Mining Corporation (VMC)Product: Fast-Hash One Platinum Edition (1 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $6,479  Order date: 24th Nov, 2013  Anticipated shipping date: January 2014  Expected delay: 8 months  Status: Refund requested on 10th January  In the meantime I am still waiting for the third refund cheque from VMC to arrive, and hopefully this time it will be signed and properly filled in.  The fact that the previous two cheques weren't, may be no coincidence after all.  Allegedly, the company put a great deal of customers' pre-order money in Mt. Gox and consequently lost it when the exchange collapsed. If true, this could have caused the delay in refunds.  In April, VMC's custom-built mining data centre went live – populated with rigs made up of ASIC chips bought from HashFast and boards manufactured by VMC itself using HashFast’s reference design.  The Fast-Hash One Prospector card (512 GH/s), which they have in stock at the moment, is constructed with the same components.  Using the data centre's income, supposedly they have started to send out refunds in bulk as of mid-April.  Just recently, Wood Law Firm opened a case against VMC and its subsidiary AMC about the delay in delivery and refunds. Affected VMC customers as well as disgruntled shareholders of AMC can contact the firm about this investigation using the online form provided.      Vendor: BitmineProduct: CoinCraft Desk (1 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $5,758  Order date: 28th Nov, 2013  Anticipated shipping date: February week 1  Actual shipping date: 2nd April Delay: 7 weeks and 2 days  Status: Delivered on 7th April  With a delay of almost two months, the hardware was shipped and arrived at my doorstep on 7th April.  I received one box containing a properly packed CoinCraft Desk 1 TH/s, as well as a second one containing a 0.4 TH/s Desk, which came as a result of Bitmine’s Customer Protection Plan.  Configuring the miners was as easy as 1-2-3. After I specified a mining pool in the configuration screen, the 400 GH/s miner quickly reached its advertised hashing speed.  The 1 TH/s Desk however, was initially underperforming, because only three out of the five installed modules were recognized by the firmware.  After opening the case and carefully inspecting the machine's organs, I noticed two modules were not properly attached to the backplate. After reattaching the modules, the Desk promptly went hashing at the expected speed of around 1 TH/s and has been steadily doing so ever since.  After I configured the miners to run in turbo mode, the increased hash rate displayed on the control panels unfortunately wasn't reflected at the mining pool.  When contacting Bitmine about this, they were very helpful and sent temporary instructions on how to address the issue. This involved increasing the voltage of the modules by entering specific commands from the Linux shell. A new firmware release on 25th April renders this procedure unnecessary and fixes some other issues as well.  In turbo mode, the miners are achieving a maximum performance increase of about 20%. For the 1 TH/s Desk this means hash rates up to 1.2 TH/s, which isn't bad at all, but doesn't quite live up to the advertised speed of 1.5 TH/s.  After a 26-day period, both rigs combined coughed up about 2.5 BTC.  No genius is needed to predict whether these rigs (or any other in this list for that matter) will ever give a return on investment – the bitcoin price would have to significantly increase or difficulty would have to stabilise for that to happen.      Vendor: KnCMinerProduct: Neptune (converted to 3 TH/s Jupiter)  Price including shipping: $10,175  Order date: 7th Jan, 2014  Anticipated shipping date: Q2 2014  Actual shipping date: 29th April  Delay: None  Status: Delivered on 30th April in broken state  On 8th April, KnCMiner published a news update for Neptune customers, which I also received by email.  It simultaneously presented an offer for the first 400 customers to apply to convert their existing Neptune order to a 3 TH/s Jupiter order instead.  Although choosing this option would mean getting a miner based on 28nm ASIC chips instead of the more advanced Neptune which sports 20nm chips, it would also mean early shipment starting in late April instead of June (and in my case as a 'batch two' customer, the end of June).  After weighing early delivery and additional setup costs (the Jupiter requires an extra 1,200W power supply) versus enhanced power efficiency and possibly increased performance as well, I took a chance and applied for the switch.  A few days after shipment of the Jupiter 3 TH/s started, which was on 22nd April. However, the company announced it was experiencing logistic issues that led to the rigs to arrive at their destination mostly broken and thus unusable.  Because my order was shipped after this issue was identified, I received the miner on 30th April in a revised package, which was basically in the form of a DIY kit.  To my frustration, I quickly realized that the new packaging method had also failed, and seven out of the 18 boards turned out to be physically damaged.  Even worse, it looked suspiciously like some components had already been used before, as I could see some stains of thermal paste on the chips and coolers, while some boards still had some dust sitting on them.  The same day I contacted KnCMiner about the damaged boards. The answer they came up with two days later was that a return merchandise authorisation (RMA) would be issued for the faulty boards in order for me to send them back and get replacements.  From this I can only conclude the company is, at least in my case, not living up to its own public statement from which the following is an extract:    ""So in order to fix this the best way we can. We are not asking for these products back from anyone who has received them already. We will simply assume that every card was damaged in shipment even if it arrived undamaged. We will send out to every customer who had a 3 TH Jupiter or several already arrive, enough cards to replace their entire collection. There is no way our customers should have to suffer because of our mistake in not properly securing the components during shipment.""    As I am now left with a possibly secondhand, half-working miner and considering the time – which was the only determining factor in this Jupiter deal – needed to return the boards to KnCMiner and wait for replacement boards, this is turning into a very bad $10,000 investment.  Additionally, finding out that Neptune customers who accepted the Jupiter deal wouldn't benefit from the later announced performance upgrade, leaves me disappointed in KnCMiner, even though this was the company I had the highest hopes of.      Vendor: Alpha TechnologyProduct: Viper (Scrypt) Miner (90 MH/s)  Price excluding shipping: £5,450 ($8,984)  Order date: 10th Jan, 2014  Anticipated shipping date: July 2014  Expected delay: None  On its way towards completing the tape-out of the company's scrypt ASIC chip, Alpha Technology is feeling the pressure from its competitors.  One heavily-armed opponent would be KnCMiner, currently taking pre-orders for the Titan, a 300 MH/s scrypt miner priced at $9,995.  As a consequence, Alpha Technology is, instead of further increasing the performance of its miners and so taking the risk of compromising delivery dates, offering its early customers some alternative bonuses, in order to give them the best value for their money.  They include free cloud hashing for a yet undetermined period, free shipping and a 10% discount on a future purchase.      Vendor: CoinTerraProduct: TerraMiner IV (2 TH/s)  Price including shipping: $6,569  Order date: 12th Jan, 2014  Anticipated shipping date: May 2014  Expected delay: None  Well, I was quite shocked when hearing CoinTerra started shipping the TerraMiner IV (1.6 TH/s) from stock on 15th April at a discounted rate of 20%.  This implies customers placing an order three months after me are not only getting their equipment (much) sooner than I will, having a May batch pre-order, but they are also paying $1,200 less.  While digesting this news, I assumed – also because at the beginning of April the company managed to boost the performance of the miner’s new prototype to 2 TH/s – I'd at least be getting the enhanced 2 TH/s version in May.  The mail I received from CoinTerra on 24th April (nine days after they began shipping from stock), quickly shook me out of this delusion, as these excerpts will reveal:    TerraMiner Early Shipping Notification: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE REQUIRED      Dear CoinTerra customer,    Now that we have begun shipping from stock, many of our pre-order customers have asked if we would be able to ship their May orders immediately, so we are pleased to announce that we have started preparing the May batch of TerraMiner IV’s for shipping a month early.    This batch of TerraMiners will ship at the same performance as the January-April units, which is approximately 1.6 TH/s – the fastest standalone Bitcoin miner available in the world today.    The ~2 TH/s revised specification TerraMiner that we recently demonstrated in prototype form is currently expected to enter production in late spring/early summer but the production schedule has not been finalized.    Please respond to this email and include your CoinTerra Order ID(s), confirming that you wish to accept immediate delivery of your order as detailed above.    I sent a response the same day, saying that I would accept immediate delivery of the 1.6 TH/s miner if at the very least I would get refunded the same discount that was being applied at that time, which only seemed fair to me.  Displeased with the situation, and because they gave such a blurry shipment date for the 2 TH/s revised miner, I additionally asked them to cancel my order if this discount was not feasible. Twelve days have now gone by without any response from CoinTerra.  Well, that’s not entirely true. After I had sent two additional mails in the meantime to ask for feedback regarding this matter, the company did send me a repeat of the 24th April email, completely ignoring any communications I had sent them meantime.  If this wasn’t enough, on 28th April, the company announced further discount on the TerraMiner IV. You can get it now, shipping immediately, for $3,799 – that is $2,200 less than I paid for it.  Being a Mt. Gox victim myself and being taken advantage of by numerous mining hardware companies, it’s hard to admit that you still believe in bitcoin. Well, I still do.
