16676992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549141,1693263636,Is Vitalik Buterin Selling His ETH Stash? Let’s Take A Look At His Transactions,"Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has multiple public wallets that carry a significant amount of ETH and these wallets are religiously tracked by on-chain sleuths. This is why whenever the founder makes a withdrawal, the destination of the ETH being sent is closely followed and recent reports reveal that Buterin has been sending significant amounts of ETH out to different wallets. Two Vitalik Buterin Transactions Spark Speculations In the early hours of Monday, the on-chain data tracking platform PeckShieldAlert took to X (formerly Twitter) to share some interesting movements that have been taking place in wallets said to belong to Buterin. This time around, the tracker flagged a single transaction carrying 3,000 ETH. Related Reading: XRP Price Faces Immense Sell Pressure That Could Trigger 20% Decline The 3,000 ETH, worth roughly $4.95 million at the time of the transfer was sent out from the well-known Vitalik.eth wallet to another wallet identified publicly as Vb2. This brought the latter’s balance to 3,017 ETH, worth a little over $4.95 million. #PeckShieldAlert vitalik.eth labeled-address has transferred 3K $ETH (~$4.95M) to Vb 2 labeled-address pic.twitter.com/f8ETU42TrD — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 28, 2023 The speculations of whether the Ethereum founder is offloading some of his stash come in relation to an earlier transaction made by him. The transaction which was also reported by PeckShield alert showed that Buterin had sent 600 ETH worth around $1 million at the time to the Coinbase crypto exchange. #PeckShieldAlert vitalik.eth labeled-address has transferred 3K $ETH (~$4.95M) to Vb 2 labeled-address pic.twitter.com/f8ETU42TrD — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) August 28, 2023 For many, however, this transaction was insignificant in the grand scheme of things and did not lead to a cause for alarm. The most recent transaction also follows in the same vein since it looks like the billionaire founder is just redistributing his assets to other wallets. ETH price struggles coming out of the weekend | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Is This Why ETH’s Price Is Struggling? So far, there is no indication that Buterin’s wallet movements have anything to do with the ETH price decline. As already mentioned above, the ETH liquidity is too deep for a $1 million sell to trigger such a decline, which would suggest something else is behind the coin’s struggles. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Ready For Next Leg-Up After Buying 56,000 ETH The most obvious factor is that the broader crypto market has been taking a hit and ETH has not been left out. Bitcoin fell from $28,000 to below $26,000, taking the majority of the market down with it. As a result, investor sentiment swung far into the negative which is preventing new money from coming into the market. With the bear market waxing strong, there could be more decline to come for the digital asset until investor sentiment improves and the market starts to recover once more. For now, ETH is still ranging above $1,640 as bears and bulls are locked in a tug-of-war for control.

16673876,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549172,1693256456,Balancer Falls Victim To Hack After Warning Of Critical Vulnerability: Funds Lost,"In a disheartening turn of events, the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Balancer (BAL) confirmed a hack just days after warning about a critical vulnerability impacting multiple Pools. The attack, which took place on August 27, resulted in a loss of nearly $1 million for Balancer. Previously, on August 22, NewsBTC reported that Balancer had discovered a critical vulnerability affecting its protocol. However, despite efforts to mitigate the risks and caution users, Balancer could not pause the affected pools. In response, the protocol urged users to withdraw from the impacted liquidity pools to prevent further exploits. Balancer Exploit Unveiled On Sunday, Balancer took to X (formerly known as Twitter) to acknowledge the existence of an exploit related to the previously disclosed vulnerability. While mitigation measures were implemented to reduce risks, they were insufficient to halt the affected pools. Consequently, users were advised to withdraw their funds from the vulnerable liquidity pools to safeguard their investments. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Discusses How Bitcoin Has Changed In Past 1 Year Meir Dolev, a Web3 security expert, shed light on the situation, revealing that the attacker was persistently carrying out their operation. Approximately $900,000 was affected, with over $600,000 already transferred to the address 0xB23711b9D92C0f1c7b211c4E2DC69791c2df38c1. On the same note, Blockchain security firm Beosin further divulged that the hack was executed through multiple flash loan attacks. Flash loans, a feature enabling users to borrow funds without collateral, have been increasingly utilized as tools for exploitation in the DeFi space. The Balancer exploit underscores the ongoing challenges DeFi platforms face in ensuring user funds’ safety. As the industry continues to innovate and attract significant capital, securing protocols and addressing vulnerabilities must remain a top priority. BAL Price Plunges, Exploit Triggers 20.81% Decline In the aftermath of the recent exploit that targeted Balancer, the project’s native token, BAL, has experienced significant market repercussions. The exploit, which resulted in a loss of approximately $1 million, has had a noticeable impact on BAL’s price and various key metrics, reflecting the challenges faced by the platform, according to Token Terminal data. As a consequence, BAL’s price has witnessed considerable volatility. Over the past 30 days, the token has experienced a sharp decline of 20.81%, as seen in the chart below. This downward trend is further highlighted by the token’s performance over a longer period of 180 days, during which it has plummeted by 51.69%, underscoring the impact of the exploit on investor sentiment and market confidence in BAL. Furthermore, BAL’s all-time high (ATH) stands at $74.45, serving as a reminder of the token’s previous price peak. However, the all-time low (ATL) of $3.36 reveals the extent of the token’s decline following the exploit. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Uptrend Remains Unbroken, Here’s Why The exploit’s aftermath has also affected Balancer’s market capitalization metrics. The circulating market cap, representing the value of BAL tokens in circulation, currently stands at $150.06 million. However, this metric has suffered a notable decline of 22.60%, indicating a decrease in token valuation and investor confidence. Another critical metric the exploit impacts is Balancer’s total value locked (TVL). TVL represents the amount of capital locked within the protocol. In the aftermath of the exploit, Balancer’s TVL has declined by 33.86%, signaling a shift in investor sentiment and potential reallocation of funds to more secure platforms.

16672218,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549151,1693252839,Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming? This Metric Could Suggest So,"On-chain data shows a Bitcoin metric is forming a pattern that may hint that a bull run could be coming next for the asset. Bitcoin HODLer Growth Rate Has Seemingly Reached The “Plateau” Stage In a new post on X, the analyst Charles Edwards shared a chart highlighting a pattern that the BTC “HODLer Growth Rate” indicator may be forming. This indicator keeps track of the 1-year growth in the holdings of the Bitcoin investors who have been keeping their coins dormant (unmoved) in their wallets since at least two years ago. Generally, an investor who holds onto their coins for at least six months is termed a “long-term holder” (LTH). The LTHs are market participants with a high resolve who don’t usually sell quickly, regardless of whatever happens in the rest of the market. Statistically speaking, the longer an investor keeps their coins still, the less likely they become to sell at any point. Thus, the holders who make it to the 2-year mark, which is the segment of interest in the current discussion, would then be the most persistent investors, even among these LTHs. Therefore, whatever these holders are doing can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may have ramifications for the rest of the market. Naturally, these holders aren’t too likely to exert influence in the short term (as they usually remain silent), but in the long term when the effects of their behavior could emerge. Related Reading: JP Morgan Explains Why Bitcoin Price May Not Fall Further Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin HODLer Growth Rate for this particular segment of the LTHs over the past decade: Looks like the value of the metric has started to move sideways in recent days | Source: @caprioleio on X As Charles has marked in the above graph, there appears to be a specific pattern that the Bitcoin HODLer Growth Rate has followed throughout the cycles. It would seem that during bear markets, the indicator’s value remains positive and in an uptrend, suggesting that these investors expand their holdings in such periods, and as prices dip further, they only up the pace of this accumulation. As the bear market approaches its end and a transition towards a bull market takes place, the metric’s value goes flat, implying that these investors still accumulate, although at a constant rate, rather than an accelerating one. Then, as the bull run starts, these Bitcoin HODLers slowly stop the accumulation entirely and begin to participate in distribution instead. The analyst notes that the Bitcoin HODLer Growth Rate now appears to have finished up the rapid bear market expansion phase and is now starting to plateau sideways. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Discusses How Bitcoin Has Changed In Past 1 Year Naturally, if the pattern of the previous cycles is anything to go by, it can mean that the Bitcoin market is now in the middle of the transition towards the next bull run.

During an interview with Business Today, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, again underscored the need for a global approach to regulating cryptocurrencies and digital assets. India Maintains its View on a Global Crypto Regulatory Framework Ahead of this year’s G20 summit, which will take place in Delhi on September 9 and 10, India, which holds this year’s presidency, has again reiterated the need for unified crypto regulations. During the interview, PM Narendra Modi addressed emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain and noted that these technologies have a global impact. As such, PM Modi said regulating these technologies needs to take a global approach. The PM noted that India is doing its part to contribute to the framework and said: “India’s G20 presidency expanded the crypto conversation beyond financial stability to consider its broader macroeconomic implications, especially for emerging markets and developing economies. Our presidency also hosted enriching seminars and discussions, deepening insights into crypto assets.” Modi Supports Including African Union Into G20 PM Modi further said he supports the G20 being more inclusive and would favour adding the African Union into the G20 to make them part of the discussion around crypto regulation. Modi said: “We haven’t stopped at ideating on how we should move ahead. We have also come up with tangible details on the way ahead and how quickly we need to move. So, our road map is detailed and action-oriented.” India Aligns Its Views with the IMF, FSB, and FATF India recently commented on what approach crypto regulation should take and firmly maintains that the G20 should implement coordinated crypto regulations. India’s views align with those of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).

U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who will oversee the entire trial that will take place in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, had previously revoked the FTX founder’s bail saying that he tried to tamper with witnesses, including former FTX.US general counsel Ryne Miller and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Bankman-Fried’s attorneys said they would appeal at the same hearing, and tried unsuccessfully to keep him out of jail until the appeal was heard.  Bankman-Fried had shared part of Ellison’s private diary with the New York Times which Judge Kaplan deemed as an attempt to harass and intimidate her, but the former billionaire crypto mogul claims he only acted out of protection for himself, according to documents seen by Reuters.  ""It is unclear how a cooperating witness who has promised to testify against a defendant could be meaningfully threatened by nothing but their own statements being published by a reputable newspaper,"" his lawyers wrote.  Bankman-Fried is currently locked up at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center which his lawyers have argued multiple times interferes with his preparation for trial, which is a constitutional right.

In the meantime, the cryptocurrency is likely to keep trading sideways until another liquidation event flips momentum into a specific direction. Related Reading: JP Morgan Explains Why Bitcoin Price May Not Fall Further As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,100 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. In the previous seven days, BTC recorded similar price action while other tokens in the top 10 moved in tandem except for Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL). Bitcoin Price On Brink Of New Liquidation Event? As the Bitcoin spot price trends sideways, most of the action turns to option contracts where “smart money” is positioning for a big move. According to a report from derivatives platform Deribit, traders in the sector are betting on the long side solely based on the potential approval of a Bitcoin price spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the US. Thus, most traders have been buying call (buy) contracts for Bitcoin to rise above $30,000 by the end of the year. These might have been betting on the regulator and courts to announce a decision from the many petitions or because of the case filed by asset manager Grayscale. Neither of these events has come to fruition, which has led to a decline in the overall sentiment across derivatives. As the spike in call buyers suggested, this sentiment has been primarily bullish but will likely turn negative as the US stalls its Bitcoin price spot ETF decision. Deribit stated: Constant positivity on ETF approval has been the main driver for medium-long-term Call buying. And yet as this moves out the timeline from Q3 to Q4 to even ’24, patience is running thin. With delays, drifting confidence & macro headwinds, we start to observe downside hedges. These hedges might have contributed to the Bitcoin price’s recent action as operators sell their spot position to cover their call contracts with late expiration. In that sense, the main catalyzer was the liquidation cascade that the cryptocurrency experienced when moving around $29,000. Related Reading: CryptoQuant Discusses How Bitcoin Has Changed In Past 1 Year At that time, as BTC trended sideways, open interest across the derivatives sector trended to the upside. As pointed out by an analyst, a similar situation is taking place currently and could lead to another aggressive move with a downside potential. #Bitcoin Open Interest continues to rise again. Price is still moving sideways.

16669059,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/us-unveils-new-crypto-tax-reporting-guidelines,1693245600,US Unveils New Crypto Tax Reporting Guidelines,"The US recently revealed new tax reporting rules as Congress and regulatory authorities focus on crypto users who may not be paying tax on their crypto-related activities. Reuters reports the US Treasury Department issued a proposed rule on Friday, under which crypto brokers, including exchange and payment processors, would have to register new information on users’ crypto transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in as soon as two years. Biden Administration Proposes New Crypto Tax Reporting Mechanisms The IRS published proposed rules for crypto tax reporting on Friday, slated to give the industry its 1099 form. Under the proposed regulations, digital asset miners have been declared safe from future requirements. According to the 300-page proposal, the Treasury Department clarified the definition of a “broker” in terms of the crypto industry. The department defined how crypto companies and investors must comply with new tax reporting obligations. The proposal also addresses the issue of whether DeFi platforms and miners need to collect their users’ personal data. Treasury introduced a custom tax form for the industry called the “1099-DA” that brokers can file. Notably, the proposal exempts crypto miners from the tax rules, but some DeFi platforms may not receive similar exemptions. As the rules are still a proposal, it remains open to public commentary until October 30. The government must listen to participants in a set of public hearings scheduled for November 7 and 8. Treasury aims to have the rules for brokers take effect in 2025 for the 2026 tax filing season. Treasury explained in a statement the goal of its proposed rules: “This is part of a broader effort at Treasury to close the tax gap, address the tax evasion risks posed by digital assets, and help ensure that everyone plays by the same set of rules.” The proposal has been met with criticism from the digital asset industry. CEO of the DeFi Education Fund, Miller Whitehouse-Levine, commented on the Treasury’s proposal and argued that it would not improve tax compliance nor would it make tax filings easier. He said in a statement: “Today’s proposal from the IRS is confusing, self-refuting, and misguided. It attempts to apply regulatory frameworks predicated on the existence of intermediaries where they don’t exist.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

16667301,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549162,1693241633,"Bitcoin Bullish Uptrend Remains Unbroken, Here’s Why","Bitcoin price is currently trading at slightly above $26,000 per coin, but is still reeling after last week’s 10% single day selloff. The situation looks dire for crypto bulls who were hoping for a more significant recovery to begin after such prolonged sideways. However, the bullish market structure remains unbroken. Let’s take a closer look at what exactly this means and why the 2023 uptrend is still intact. Recapping Recent BTCUSD Volatility After a solid start to 2023 – certainly a year that’s been kinder to the king of cryptocurrency than 2022 – BTCUSD has bears celebrating and bulls kicking their wounds. Several months of sideways price action and dwindling volatility ended with a bang as expected, but the move was down and not what bulls had been hoping for. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reaches Most “Oversold” Record Since 2020: What This Means A sharp, 10% intraday selloff caused more long liquidations than the FTX collapse, and sent the Relative Strength Index immediately into the most oversold territory in all of 2023. But even with all the carnage, Bitcoin remains in a near-term uptrend with a bullish market structure. Bitcoin's uptrend is still intact | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why Bitcoin Price Remains In A Structural Uptrend By pure definition, an uptrend is a series of higher highs and higher lows. Which is precisely what is still happening in BTCUSD price action throughout 2023. Currently, the FTX collapse in November 2022 was the local “low” of the downtrend. In contrast, a downtrend is a series of lower lows and lower highs. Once a new high was made in early 2023 and then a higher low was put in, the downtrend was considered over. The recent 2023 uptrend in Bitcoin hasn’t yet made a lower low after a lower high. Even a possible lower low beyond here is still without a proper lower high. This means that the top cryptocurrency by market cap could potentially bounce here, or even lower, and still maintain an overall bullish market structure. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead A lower low would still be important, potentially warning that the market structure is turning back bearish. If a lower low happens below the $25,000 low from June 2023, then it will be all eyes on if a lower high is to follow. The 2023 uptrend in Bitcoin has been muted compared to what the cryptocurrency is capable of. BTCUSD is up roughly 50% during the first roughly nine months of the year. The final nine months of 2020, for example, had over 900% ROI by comparison. Could this type of returns soon be on the way? Or will the cryptocurrency market fall back into the clutches of bears?

42392660,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9ioh,1693240953,"A Crypto President? Top U.S. 2024 Contenders Aren’t Fans, and Rivals Are Way Behind","Crypto was on fire as a topic in the early U.S. presidential campaigning, but the first Republican debate last week showed it may not be an issue that has legs with candidates trying to grasp mainstream attention.  As the top GOP candidates spun out their well-rehearsed positions – minus former President Donald Trump, who decided not to show up to the first debate’s Milwaukee stage – they avoided mentions of cryptocurrencies or digital-assets regulation, despite its rising status as a priority in Congress and among financial regulators in the U.S. and abroad.  But their silence on stage doesn’t mean they don’t have positions on crypto, as some of them have made abundantly clear. The field of Republican and Democratic hopefuls are all over the map on how the U.S. should handle crypto, from suspicion to enthusiastic embrace.  While we wait to see whether digital assets come up at the Republican primary debate next month on Fox Business, here’s how the major candidates from both parties shake out on the topic:  Donald Trump (polling at an average of 52% in a survey of Republican primary polls by fivethirtyeight.com): Still the dominant Republican candidate, despite a dizzying array of civil and criminal charges, former president Trump is an enigma when it comes to crypto issues. He hasn’t addressed crypto lately, but in his direct comments in the past, he established himself as a digital assets skeptic. Still, that didn’t stop him from launching his own collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that reportedly garnered him almost $5 million in licensing fees, and he’s said to personally hold $2.8 million in a cryptocurrency wallet as of early August, according to documents reviewed by ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Looking at his governing record, Trump spent four years in the White House without advancing significant crypto policy, though one of his appointees as a banking regulator – Brian Brooks at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – did seek to open the banking system to crypto, and his markets regulators allowed bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures trading.  Ron DeSantis (15%): The Florida governor, still clinging to the role as Trump’s chief (if distant) rival, is an avowed crypto booster. He made political theater out of an effort in his state to block any future central bank digital currency (CBDC), instead championing a path for Americans to invest in bitcoin and other crypto assets. DeSantis has sustained criticism against the current administration for what he characterized as a war on cryptocurrency, which he argued includes the White House and Treasury Department’s open-mindedness to a future digital dollar.  Vivek Ramaswamy (10%): The biotech entrepreneur put in a lively debate performance last week, potentially elevating one of the strongest crypto voices in the Republican field. Ramaswamy has presented himself as the pro-Bitcoin candidate who actually understands the “decentralized alternative” to the U.S. dollar, as opposed to what he’s characterized as rival DeSantis’ political posturing on digital assets. While Ramaswamy was noted for seizing a lot of the spotlight in the first debate, the same could have been said of Sen. Cory Booker four years ago in the first Democratic debate, which ultimately didn’t translate into staying power.  Mike Pence (4%): Trump’s former vice president hasn't been known to address crypto issues personally. But when in office, his pick to be his chief economist, Mark Calabria, was a libertarian who had regularly touted bitcoin studies and news for years on social media. And while Pence may not be dialed in to digital assets, his nephew, John Pence, has done some crypto lobbying, including for global exchange Binance as it’s been tangling with U.S. regulators.  Nikki Haley (4%): The former South Carolina governor also hasn’t had anything to say publicly about crypto. In her role as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, it probably didn’t come up a lot, but for an official who has been in the public eye as long as Haley to not have a record of comments on digital assets – much like former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie – signals an intent to stay out of it.  Tim Scott (4%): The U.S. senator from South Carolina is perfectly positioned to shepherd regulation for the crypto sector as the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and a member of the Financial Innovation Caucus. But he hasn’t, suggesting it’s not a priority or a political tack he’s willing to lean into, despite his announcement that a digital assets oversight framework would be among his top goals for this session of Congress. However, he did dip a toe into crypto-adjacent legislation last year when he co-sponsored a failed bill to expand the category of investors who could buy unregistered securities, including digital assets. More recently, he criticized Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler for his agency’s failure to head off the collapse of FTX, saying, “the regulators, the SEC specifically, have noted that it is the responsibility of crypto firms to comply with existing regulations, but it is also the responsibility of regulators to enforce existing regulations and to conduct appropriate, effective supervision.”  Chris Christie (3%): The ex-governor of New Jersey has so far kept his distance from the subject of cryptocurrencies.  Asa Hutchinson (less than 1%): In a 2019 state-of-the-state speech, the former Arkansas governor said he was setting up an innovation council that would – among other things – boost “blockchain technology” in his state, which had also dabbled in using the ledger innovations in the area of food safety. Still, Hutchinson hasn’t yet outlined his views on the asset class.  Doug Burgum (less than 1%): Last year, the North Dakota governor happily announced his state was hosting the construction of one of the world’s biggest data centers and that it would be mining cryptocurrency. His boasting of the move to “further cement our state’s growing reputation as a hub for data centers and cryptocurrency mining” sets him up as an industry supporter. He has also been reported as saying the disastrous FTX implosion was about fraud and not “an indictment that there’s going to be a place for digital currencies in the future of the world.”  Francis Suarez (less than 1%): The Miami mayor is arguably the biggest digital assets fan in the race, having put his crypto where his mouth was when enthusiastically volunteering to take his government salary in bitcoin. He told CoinDesk he’d similarly be happy to accept campaign donations in bitcoin. Among his crypto positions, he’s said he would ban a U.S. digital dollar, set clear rules and classifications for digital assets and has experimented with the token MiamiCoin (MIA) in his city.  And the Democrats, where the incumbent president is so far commanding the field:  Joe Biden (65%): The president, who hasn’t yet seen an electoral threat emerge from his own party, now has a significant record on crypto, judging from his administration’s performance in the past three years. Certain of his regulators have hammered the industry with enforcement actions – mostly at the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – as they accuse digital assets businesses of failing to toe the line on existing financial regulations, which crypto insiders say are impossible to meet. While his administration hasn’t yet crafted wide-reaching crypto rules, the SEC and Treasury Department have proposed some regulations that would have major – and potentially highly limiting – effects on the sector, from the SEC’s proposals on custody and defining crypto platforms as exchanges to the Treasury’s new proposal on how to tax token gains. He said this year that he’s excited about closing “special interest tax loopholes” that benefit crypto traders, and the White House has pushed for a 30% tax on crypto mining. The administration has also been studying whether to stand up a digital dollar that could shake up stablecoin issuers, though officials insist no decision has been made. Biden’s direct crypto involvement has generally been limited, though he issued an executive order on digital assets in 2022 – before the market detonated that year and crypto giants began toppling – instructing his administration to start getting a handle on oversight that would thread a needle to establish consumer protections while allowing U.S. innovation.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (13%): His famous name may not get him past the criticism for what mainstream Democrats may characterize as extreme positions on vaccines and government conspiracies, but he seems to love talking up crypto. “Bitcoin embodies two of my highest ideals -- transparency and trust,” he said when he appeared as a keynote speaker at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami. “It's important not only for bitcoin but for democracy to be decentralized.” He’s invested in bitcoin personally and vowed to free such investments from capital gains taxes if elected. And he’s vehemently opposed to a U.S. central bank digital currency, which he’s argued could be abused by an oppressive government – the same position occupied by Republican candidate DeSantis.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/08/28/a-crypto-president-top-us-2024-contenders-arent-fans-and-rivals-are-way-behind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a506f7865e98c50a02488a6c882a4ca9a7ead6b9-3609x2030.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This groundbreaking new methodology allows blockchains to connect interoperably without the need for a centralized bridge. “HyperNova is a major breakthrough for the blockchain industry,” said Joshua Tobkin, CEO of Supra. “It eliminates the need for centralized bridges, which can be a single point of failure and a major vulnerability in Web3. HyperNova’s bridgeless technology makes blockchain connections more secure, reliable, and scalable via L1 to L1 cryptographic consensus.” HyperNova bridgeless technology works by using Supra’s novel, low-latency, consensus algorithm, known as Moonshot Consensus, to understand the underlying cryptographic signatures of interacting chains. This allows Supra to provide a secure, reliable, and scalable cross-chain consensus that is strictly better than traditional bridge designs. Benefits of Supra’s HyperNova Bridgeless Tech Supra’s HyperNova offers a number of benefits over traditional centralized bridges, including: Increased security: HyperNova eliminates the need for a centralized bridge, which can be a single point of failure. Instead, Supra directly verifies that cryptographic signatures of the source and destination chains, which provides L1 to L1 security guarantees. Improved scalability: Bridgeless tech is more scalable than traditional centralized bridges. This is because Supra itself is a high-throughput IntraLayer that can handle many cross-chain consensus requests simultaneously. Enhanced capabilities: Supra’s HyperNova multi-chain solution enables novel cross-chain use cases that are not possible in bilateral (one-to-one) solutions. Use Cases for Supra’s HyperNova Bridgeless tech can be used for a variety of use cases, including: Cross-chain DeFi: HyperNova can be used to enable cross-chain DeFi, which allows users to transfer assets and interact with DeFi applications across different blockchains. Cross-chain gaming: Bridgeless tech can be used to enable cross-chain gaming, which allows players to transfer their in-game assets or NFTs across different blockchain-based games. Cross-chain oracles: HyperNova can be used to enable cross-chain oracles, which provide secure and reliable data feeds to DeFi applications across many ecosystems. About Supra Supra is building a low-latency interoperability infrastructure to provide Web3 capabilities that traditional blockchain designs lack. Supra, as a vertically integrated IntraLayer™, enables a shared security paradigm across a variety of oracle services. This includes securing external data on-chain, cross-chain consensus via their bridgeless HyperNova, automation, VRF, smart contract execution, and more. After thousands of hours of R&D and simulations, Supra’s technical breakthroughs are solving the Oracle Dilemma and optimizing network performance across the board in terms of security, throughput, time to finality, composability, and programmability. Supra has taken an academic approach to development, which has been an integral part of the organization’s commitment to advancing Web3 performance and security. This is characterized by a commitment to deep research, transparency, and going through a rigorous peer-review process in every design and product released. Dr. Aniket Kate, inventor of KZG Commitments utilized in Ethereum L2 Data Availability solutions, and the Supra team are diligently composing new whitepapers, so there are still many novel solutions in the pipeline soon to be publicized.

The company consistently mines Bitcoin at a cost 26-78% above the price of BTC over its history, resulting in a nonsensical mining operation with negative profits. While there may be some upside if BTC reaches new all-time highs, investing in MARA would lag far behind investing in BTC directly. Upside to NAV in $100K BTC scenario is only 19%, versus 283% from buying BTC directly. I would not recommend shorting MARA at this point in the 4-year BTC cycle. MARA Far Inferior to BTC and GBTC While I wrote previously on my bullishness on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at this point in the cycle, I would not buy Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ). Marathon Digital Holdings is a Bitcoin mining company that provides investors with indirect Bitcoin exposure. I do not believe that MARA has any value as a mining business, and there is no underlying asset play at hand with its market price far in excess of its net asset value ((NAV)). While I think the stock will likely go up alongside BTC as it did in 2020 and 2021, I don't think there's a logical case for outperformance versus Bitcoin or Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Negative Value as a Mining Business The value of a mining business would generally be derived by applying a multiple on the profit the company generates by mining at a cost below the market price of the commodity it mines. A mining company that mines gold at an operational cost of $1700 an ounce, with a market price of $1950 an ounce, would have a profit of $250 an ounce mined. Now, if I had a mining company that mines gold at a cost of $2,200 an ounce, how much would you pay for my company? You wouldn't even take it for free. In fact, I would have to pay you to take such a cash-burning business off my hands. Even if you're the biggest gold bull in the world and think gold is going to $10,000 an ounce, you still wouldn't buy my gold mining business from me. You'd just buy gold directly. Why pay anything for a business that effectively buys the commodity you're looking to buy for more than what it's trading at? You'd be overpaying for a business that overpays for the commodity. The same applies to MARA for its Bitcoin mining operation. Even if you are bullish on Bitcoin, the mining business is worthless if it does not mine Bitcoin for less than Bitcoin's market price. No Profits from Mining Operations As seen in the operating income below, the company consistently fails to mine Bitcoin at a price below its market price. We know this because the spot price of Bitcoin at the time of the block reward is used to measure revenue on the income statement, meaning operating income is representative of the profit the company would make if it sold the Bitcoin it mined immediately upon mining it. With operating income being consistently negative, we can conclude that MARA has historically mined Bitcoin for more than its prevailing market price. MARA Income Statement Seeking Alpha Q2 BTC production stood at 2,926 BTC while production costs were $113M, consisting of $92.5M in cost of revenues and $20.5M in General & Administrative expenses. This translates to a mining cost per Bitcoin of $38,615, which is 48% above the current market price $26,130. Since the price of Bitcoin is substantially below the company's mining cost per BTC, the mining business has negative value today. One could say that the stock will go up because it holds and mines Bitcoin, and the price of Bitcoin will go up over time. I would not disagree with that statement, but there is currently no reason to own MARA over BTC directly. Stock Trades at Large Premium to Net Asset Value The company currently has 17,307 BTC, $128M in cash, $99.8M in investments, $784M in equipment, and $734.6M in debt, giving it a net asset value of $713.6M or $4.09 per share at today's BTC market price. 17,307 BTC at $26,130 $452.3M Cash and restricted cash $128M Property & Equipment, Net $783.9M Investments $99.8M Total Tangible Assets $1.464B Debt $734.6M Preferred stock $15.7M Net Asset Value $713.6M NAV per share $4.09 Downside to NAV 61% Source: MARA Q2 2023 10-Q With the stock trading at $10.55, the stock is trading at a 158% premium to NAV, so there is clearly no play to be made on the underlying asset value. Compare this GBTC, which I previously wrote an bullish article on, trading at a 25% discount to NAV. Bitcoin Price Sensitivity Analysis At $128M in cash remaining, MARA has 1 quarter of production left before it has to either start selling Bitcoin to continue mining operations or issue shares to raise cash. If they deplete their cash and generate another 3,000 BTC in Q3, this would lead to 20,307 BTC on their balance sheet. Their assets would be as follows. To be generous, I've ignored depreciation on their mining equipment. $100,000 BTC $150,000 BTC $200,000 BTC 20,307 BTC Value $2.03B $3.05B $4.06B Equipment & other assets $883.7M $883.7M $883.7M Total Assets $2.91B $3.93B $4.94B Debt $734.6M $734.6M $734.6M NAV $2.18B $3.2B $4.21B NAV per share $12.51 $18.36 $24.15 For simplicity, I have also ignored the effects of share dilution. In reality, what is likely to happen is that they will issue more shares and continue to mine Bitcoin beyond Q3. Any forecast of the effects of this path would be highly inaccurate because it would depend on the market price at the time of share issuances, as well as the number of shares issued. In any case, the positive impact of accumulating more BTC through mining would likely be offset by the dilutive issuances needed to continue operations. Therefore, the above approach would give a decent approximation of net asset value per share at different BTC prices. While some upside could be achieved if BTC runs past previous all-time highs, the gains on an investment in MARA would lag far behind the gains on an investment in BTC directly, assuming MARA tracks its NAV. $100,000 BTC $150,000 BTC $200,000 BTC MARA Upside 19% 74% 129% BTC Upside 283% 474% 665% Trend in Mining Costs The only rationale for an investment in MARA over BTC would be the assumption that mining costs would end up being substantially and sustainably below the future price of BTC. However, it looks like MARA's cost per BTC are highly correlated with the price of BTC, and that MARA is consistently mining between 26 and 78% above the BTC price in any given year. 2020 2021 2022 Q2'23 BTC Mined 947 3,197 4,144 2,926 Operational Cost $13.3M $216.8M $208.2M $113M Cost per BTC $14,044 $67,813 $50,241 $38,615 Average Daily Close $11,116 $47,437 $28,198 $28,062 % overpayment 26% 43% 78% 38% Sources: SEC Filings and Yahoo Finance With the upcoming halving that will increase mining difficulty and block rewards, I do not see any rationale for a future reversal of this correlation or a future decreased cost of mining relative to BTC. MARA Not Worth Shorting At this point in the cycle, I would not recommend shorting MARA because of its price correlation with BTC. It could likely continue to trade a sustained premium to its NAV despite its substantially unprofitable mining operations.

The company consistently mines Bitcoin at a cost 26-78% above the price of BTC over its history, resulting in a nonsensical mining operation with negative profits. While there may be some upside if BTC reaches new all-time highs, investing in MARA would lag far behind investing in BTC directly. Upside to NAV in $100K BTC scenario is only 19%, versus 283% from buying BTC directly. I would not recommend shorting MARA at this point in the 4-year BTC cycle. MARA Far Inferior to BTC and GBTC While I wrote previously on my bullishness on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at this point in the cycle, I would not buy Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ). Marathon Digital Holdings is a Bitcoin mining company that provides investors with indirect Bitcoin exposure. I do not believe that MARA has any value as a mining business, and there is no underlying asset play at hand with its market price far in excess of its net asset value ((NAV)). While I think the stock will likely go up alongside BTC as it did in 2020 and 2021, I don't think there's a logical case for outperformance versus Bitcoin or Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Negative Value as a Mining Business The value of a mining business would generally be derived by applying a multiple on the profit the company generates by mining at a cost below the market price of the commodity it mines. A mining company that mines gold at an operational cost of $1700 an ounce, with a market price of $1950 an ounce, would have a profit of $250 an ounce mined. Now, if I had a mining company that mines gold at a cost of $2,200 an ounce, how much would you pay for my company? You wouldn't even take it for free. In fact, I would have to pay you to take such a cash-burning business off my hands. Even if you're the biggest gold bull in the world and think gold is going to $10,000 an ounce, you still wouldn't buy my gold mining business from me. You'd just buy gold directly. Why pay anything for a business that effectively buys the commodity you're looking to buy for more than what it's trading at? You'd be overpaying for a business that overpays for the commodity. The same applies to MARA for its Bitcoin mining operation. Even if you are bullish on Bitcoin, the mining business is worthless if it does not mine Bitcoin for less than Bitcoin's market price. No Profits from Mining Operations As seen in the operating income below, the company consistently fails to mine Bitcoin at a price below its market price. We know this because the spot price of Bitcoin at the time of the block reward is used to measure revenue on the income statement, meaning operating income is representative of the profit the company would make if it sold the Bitcoin it mined immediately upon mining it.

16665862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=549119,1693238431,Another Bitcoin Metric Is About To Reach A New All-Time High Despite The Bear Market,"The price of Bitcoin has taken a beating in the past month. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap is down by more than 11% from its price in July and has lost more than $50 billion in market cap since then. While the price plunge has been painful for investors, Bitcoin miners have also been feeling the sting as mining revenue per computing power has been dwindling for the past few months. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s hashrate has soared to high levels as mining farms continue to come online. Bitcoin Hashrate Reaches All-Time Highs Despite Bear Market Over the last year, Bitcoin’s hashrate (the total combined computing power of miners) has almost doubled. Data from Blockchain.com shows that the Bitcoin network hash rate surpassed 414 terahashes per second (TH/s) for the first time on August 16. Related Reading: Exodus Of 30,000 BTC To Cold Wallets Spells Good News For Bitcoin Price This metric has since retraced to 390 TH/s, but it is expected to rise further in the coming weeks as miners bring on more computing power to break even on their mining operations. The higher the hashrate, the more difficult it becomes to mine BTC and earn rewards. This means that miners are now making less BTC per terahash of computing power than ever before. Data from Hashrate Index shows this figure is now at $0.06016 per terahash/second per day. In comparison, this figure was at $0.08124 on May 8 during the rise of Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions. A further decline from here would see mining revenue fall below the lowest point in November 2022. How Miners Are Adapting To Stay Profitable The Bitcoin mining industry has proven itself resilient, even during the depths of the crypto winter. According to data from investment information platform MacroMicro, the current average cost to mine a BTC stands at $45,877 with the current price of BTC now at $25,936. BTC price displays volatility during the weekend | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com To remain profitable with the rising hash rate, Bitcoin miners have had to adjust their operations. Publicly traded mining companies like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms have had to raise about $440 million through stock sales. Bitcoin miners have also avoided selling their $900 million BTC, as it could trigger a major selloff from investors. While previous on-chain data have shown miners sending a significant amount of coins to exchanges, miners have been expanding their reserves recently. BTC Mining Outlook The outlook for Bitcoin mining economics in the coming months is uncertain but potentially promising if the hashrate continues to increase. The next Bitcoin halving is expected to take place in April 2024, slashing block reward by 50%. Related Reading: Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Joins Ethereum Futures ETF Race After Spot Bitcoin ETF Delay When the halving occurs, things could even get tighter for miners, as they would have to increase mine more blocks to break even. Nevertheless, big BTC mining companies are already on track for this adjustment. Marathon Digital, for example, was able to achieve a 54% boost in its hashrate during the second quarter but reported a net loss of $21.3 million.

Bitcoin Has Been Going Through Some Changes Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant has broken down the changes that the cryptocurrency’s landscape has observed recently. The first would be that the US-based exchanges have been registering withdrawals, while the global platforms have seen growing holdings. The relevant on-chain indicator here is the “exchange reserve,” which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin stored inside the wallets of a centralized exchange or a group of exchanges. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for the foreign platforms: Looks like the value of the metric for these platforms is steadily going up | Source: CryptoQuant on X The above graph shows that the Bitcoin exchange reserves for Binance, Bitfinex, and OKX have increased during the past year. In total, the indicator’s value for these non-US platforms has increased by 10% in this period. This increase would naturally suggest that these exchanges have seen net deposits in the last year. However, the exchange reserve for the US-based platforms paints a different picture. These platforms have seen a falling value of the indicator | Source: CryptoQuant on X While the foreign exchanges have seen deposits, the platforms based in the US, such as Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken, have observed declining reserves during the past year. In general, the reserves of these platforms have dropped by at least 30%, which is a very significant value. The opposite trends being followed by the two groups of exchanges could imply a migration of coins between them, with investors increasingly preferring the non-US platforms. Related Reading: The Great Bitcoin Comeback: Will Alpha Coin Retake $28,000 Before August Ends? The second change in the BTC market is that institutional investors have started displaying an accumulation behavior. “Considering the amount withdrawn and the deposit and withdrawal records of the wallets, institutions are continuously buying Bitcoin,” explains the analytics firm. CryptoQuant notes that in August alone, Gemini has seen a huge withdrawal of more than 20,000 BTC, which can be a sign that institutional investors are buying. A large amount of BTC has been withdrawn from Gemini | Source: CryptoQuant on X Finally, there is a change in how market participants have been looking at the futures sector recently, as they have increased their exposure to derivative products. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Buy Dip, Addresses Now At Pre-Crash Levels The ratio of the trading volume of the asset between spot and derivative platforms has dropped to pretty low values recently, a sign that activity on the derivative exchanges is overwhelmingly more than on the spot ones. The ratio's value has been on the decline this year | Source: CryptoQuant The open interest, a measure of the number of positions open on the derivative market, also showcases this change, as the metric’s value hit very high just recently. The open interest was at highest values since November just recently | Source: CryptoQuant on X The chart shows that while the open interest was at highs just a while ago, it has since observed a plummet. The reason behind this plunge was the latest Bitcoin crash, which resulted in a cascade of liquidations in the market. BTC Price Bitcoin is trading around the $25,900 level, unchanged from one week ago, showing how stagnant the cryptocurrency has been recently.

In June, Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) told Binance, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, it had to quit the country, as it was not allowed to serve Belgians from outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Belgian customers will now be routed via a Polish entity to escape that effort by regulators to chase the crypto company out of Belgium, the company said on Monday.  Belgian customers will be put into “withdrawals-only” mode if they don’t agree to the terms of use for Binance Poland sp. z o.o., an entity registered within the European Union, and hence in the EEA, the company said in a message to clients which was briefly posted on its website before being amended to exclude the ""withdrawals-only"" detail.  Consistent EU rules known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) will take effect in 2024, but before then many individual EU members have their own rulebooks for the sector. Binance has already left the Netherlands after regulatory problems, and recently withdrew its application for a license in Germany.  In a statement published later Monday, FSMA said there was ""no obstacle"" to operating via a Polish entity, but stressed the limited powers Polish regulators had over the company.

42392662,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9iyx,1693232891,The Bitcoin Circular Economy Battles Entrenched Mindsets in El Salvador,"The core ethos of Bitcoin is to create a fairer and more accessible monetary system for the billions of people worldwide who do not have access to traditional banking services.  Here in El Salvador, most unbanked people are hand-to-mouth and utilize only cash; they spend what they earn on food or shelter soon after they receive it. The long-term savings benefits of bitcoin (BTC) do not move the needle for them, and the additional complexity in using the Bitcoin network and self-custody create a tremendous educational barrier to mass adoption.  Jonathan Martin is a graduate of Stanford University, Georgetown University and a student at the Wharton School currently on leave immersing himself in the world of Bitcoin in El Salvador.  Several Salvadoran nationals are working to solve this problem. Guillermo Contreras, CEO of DitoBanx, is creating bitcoin-based savings and loan products for the 70% of Salvadorans he says are unbanked. I met with Contreras at an upscale restaurant in San Benito, the San Salvador-equivalent of Beverly Hills.  He described how with the launch of Chivo, the government’s cryptocurrency wallet, every citizen was given $30 dollars in bitcoin. Transactions volumes initially surged, but soon petered out as most people simply converted their bitcoin into fiat. He said that most of the unbanked population do not use ATMs nor do they have access to loan products. The average education level is between sixth and ninth grade, and the average daily income is $15.  Contreras devised a way to slowly educate non-bitcoiners on how to save using the new digital currency by first giving them access to Mastercard debit cards. Users can receive Lightning or on-chain bitcoin transactions and seamlessly convert them to USDC – a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar issued by the U.S.-based company Circle – to assuage concerns about bitcoin’s price volatility. They can also receive USDC directly using Ethereum.  Read more: Bitcoin Beach’s Pioneering Circular Economy Is Making a Global Impact  As Contreras put it, if you only have $15 in your account and need it to eat dinner, a 10% price swing is a major issue. DitoBanx provides an easy-to-use solution.  Similarly, through their deal with Mastercard, users can deposit money into ATMs and receive USDC in their wallets, with a 1% fee. His next goal is to roll out a micro-loan program for users to increase access to credit and to spur economic development. The goal is to slowly educate people on the benefits of saving in satoshis, the smallest economic unit of bitcoin, where they are receiving the immediate benefits of access to loans and ATMs, and the ability to pay bills in the DitoBanx app, all while getting direct exposure to bitcoin.  Their smartphones can now serve as their bank accounts, and bitcoin usage will grow over time, he hopes. Contreras estimates it will be three years until Lightning is used regularly.  Read more: Jonathan Martin - El Salvador Diary: Lightning Is Key to Bitcoin Adoption  By also encouraging unbanked merchants to use DitoBanx, where they receive the same loans and savings benefits as individual users, Contreras’ goal is to create a “circular bitcoin ecosystem.” At present, the company has partnerships with over 400 businesses in El Salvador.  Barriers to Big Bank Adoption  The global banking system is not currently Bitcoin-friendly. For Bitcoin to succeed in El Salvador, Salvadoran banks need to be able to integrate the network into their existing services that they provide to their clients. At present, they do not sell bitcoin OTC because of their integrations with corresponding banks in the United States like JPMorgan and the broader SWIFT system.  I spoke about this with Carlos Alfaro at Koibanx, a company that builds non-Bitcoin blockchain integrations for the banking system. He said that there is interest in Bitcoin among bankers, but they fear the repercussions with their international partners if they unilaterally adopt the digital currency. Remittances make up 25% of the domestic economy, and most of that money moves via traditional rails from Western Union in the U.S. to domestic bank accounts in El Salvador. No local banks are currently willing to put 25% of their business at risk, especially since Salvadoran banks are small and do not have a lot of leverage on Wall Street.  In many ways, when Wall Street sneezes, the rest of the global banking system catches a cold. Powerful forces outside of El Salvador play a role in inhibiting the adoption of Bitcoin domestically.  Bitcoin Beach  I traveled south to El Zonte Beach — known as Bitcoin Beach — to see first-hand the epicenter of Salvadoran Bitcoin adoption. In 2019, an anonymous benefactor offered to donate his bitcoin fortune to the sleepy beach community, stipulating the money must be used for commerce and not cashed out into dollars.  From this arrangement, the Bitcoin Beach Initiative was born. A San Diego, California native named Michael Peterson got involved and focused his attention on creating a circular Bitcoin economy which includes remittances, tourism, public services and small businesses.  Perhaps the most promising of these efforts is Hope House, a community center that helps educate local youths on Bitcoin and provides opportunities that did not previously exist. Most of the El Zonte population of about 3,000 people is unbanked and lives just above the poverty line.  See also: Why Everyone Is Talking About De-Dollarization  When I arrived in El Zonte, the weather was much hotter than in San Salvador, which is located about an hour inland. I approached a tin roof structure that appeared to be both a restaurant and a family home to buy water, dodging several chickens and friendly dogs along the way. The owner of the establishment said he accepted bitcoin. He pulled out his smartphone, opened his Lightning-enabled Blink wallet and I sent him the equivalent of $2 in satoshis nearly instantaneously. Similarly, the restaurant I got lunch at utilized a Blink wallet for payment.  At present, El Zonte is not as developed as El Tunco, the popular nearby surf destination. There are several new-looking tourist resorts, but there are no paved roads and street vendors are more common than brick-and-mortar shops. I tried to use bitcoin two more times, and both times the vendors said “solamente efectivo” — cash only. Even in the heart of Bitcoin Beach, not everyone wants bitcoin.  For Bitcoin to thrive, it must be viewed as the new unit of account — the means by which value itself is measured — instead of constantly compared to its current bitcoin-fiat market value. The catalyst for this shift will likely be out of necessity, the inevitable hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, as opposed to by political decree.  Only time will tell if the monetary technology succeeds outside of small pockets of dedicated bitcoiners.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING | USDC,Jonathan Martin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/28/the-bitcoin-circular-economy-battles-entrenched-mindsets-in-el-salvador,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b22789347788cbbd46ecc8567c4e75a29ca109f-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Its parent company, Fenix International, recently revealed its significant investment of nearly $20 million in Ether (ETH) in 2022. According to official financial filings submitted to the UK corporate registry, Fenix International acquired nearly $20 million worth of ETH over a two-year period. While the company’s investment in Ether demonstrates its progressive approach, it wasn’t immune to the market’s inherent volatility. By the end of November 2022, the value of Ether had plummeted by $8.5 million, leading to an impairment loss on the investment. The remaining carrying amount of Ethereum stands at $11.434 million, reflecting the broader trends and uncertainties in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Worldcoin Meltdown: 50% Crash Caused By Mounting Data Privacy Paranoia OnlyFans Ventures Beyond Traditional Offerings The move to invest in Ether aligns with OnlyFans’ broader strategy of diversification and technological innovation. Investing in intangible assets with an “indefinite useful life” showcases the company’s willingness to embrace emerging technologies like blockchain, positioning itself at the forefront of industry trends. The disclosure about Fenix’s acquiring a substantial amount of Ether has not seemed to provide a lift yet to the price of the crypto. At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,636, down -0.8% in the last 24 hours, and sustaining a slight 2.2% loss in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. The financial filings offer a glimpse into OnlyFans’ multi-faceted performance. Despite the challenges posed by its cryptocurrency investment, the company reported impressive financial results for the year ending November 2022. Source: SignHouse With revenue surpassing the $1 billion mark, driven by an influx of over 50 million new users and more than a million content creators, OnlyFans solidified its position as a revenue-generating powerhouse. Users collectively spent an astounding $5.5 billion on the platform. OnlyFans Pioneers NFT Integration And Celebrity Trading Cards Leonid Radvinsky, the visionary entrepreneur of Ukrainian origin who acquired OnlyFans in 2018, has reaped the rewards of the platform’s surging popularity. The filings unveil that Radvinsky amassed dividends approximating $485 million since the inception of the previous year, in line with the escalating demand for OnlyFans’ offerings. This recent crypto venture is not the company’s first stride into the digital asset domain. In early 2022, OnlyFans facilitated a pioneering move by enabling verified creators to replace their profile pictures with Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Bitcoin slides back into the $25K region. Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: XRP Faces Big Challenge: Scaling The $0.55 Wall – Possible? Moreover, in June of the same year, former OnlyFans executives unveiled Zoop, a celebrity trading card platform leveraging the Ethereum scaling solution Polygon. Zoop allowed users to trade 3D digital playing cards depicting their favorite celebrities. The disclosure of Fenix International’s Ethereum holdings dovetailed with an industry-wide trend, as adult content creators began flocking to Friend.tech, a decentralized social media platform rooted in the cryptocurrency realm. This rush underscores how crypto’s recent surge has not only captured financial markets’ attention but also influenced sectors far beyond conventional investments.

Clockwork built tech to facilitate payroll payments and other regularly-occurring transactions that smart contracts – the backbone for building economies on blockchains – could conceivably improve.  “Ultimately the reason we are stepping away now is simple opportunity cost,” Garfield said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “We admittedly see limited commercial upside in continuing to develop the protocol, and have a growing personal interest to explore new opportunities.”  The founders' decision to abandon Clockwork raises questions about what will happen to its investors. Last August, Multicoin Capital, Solana Ventures and Asymmetric VC participated in a $4 million seed funding round; much of that cash remains, Garfield told CoinDesk.  ""Fully shutting down and returning money is an option,"" Garfield said in a message on Telegram. He said he's taking time to decide whether to return the remaining funds or ""pivot"" the company.

BTC fell as low as $25,886 on Binance, CoinGecko data shows, before slightly recovering. Major tokens XRP, cardano's ADA, and solana's SOL fell as much as 2.2%, continuing a downtrend since last week.  Ether (ETH) fell 1.1% even as trading aggregator protocol 1Inch invested over $10 million worth of stablecoins from its treasury to purchase 6,088 ETH late on Sunday, providing some buying pressure to an otherwise tepid market.  The drop in majors came even as traditional markets buoyed on Monday, with Shanghai Composition and Nikkei 225 finishing more than 1%, Singapore adding 0.73% and European indices opening up to 0.36% higher.  Meanwhile, FxPro trader Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a note that the firm expected further declines, citing price-chart data.  “The technical picture for Bitcoin remains bearish on weekly timeframes, as the price is below its 200-week average and outside of its ascending channel,” Kuptsikevich shared. “The most likely short-term outlook is for a decline to the $23.9-24.6K region.”  On a price chart, an ascending channel is a price pattern made by higher highs and higher lows – with a break below this suggesting bearish price action among traders.

42392680,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9jOb,1693220979,Ethereum's Daily Transaction Fees Drops to 8-Month Low of $2.8M,"Costs associated with executing transactions on Ethereum's blockchain have dropped to lowest since December.  The decline comes amid frenzied activity on Friend.tech, which is built on Coinbase's L2 chain and points to rising popularity of scaling solutions.  Ethereum, the world's largest programmable blockchain and the parent platform of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency ether (ETH), is the cheapest to use in eight months.  The total daily fees, paid by users for executing transactions on Ethereum, fell to 1,719 ETH ($2.8 million) on Sunday, the lowest single-day total since Dec. 26, according to data tracked by South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. The tally is down 89% from the year-to-date high of 16,720 ETH observed on May 5.  Ethereum uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves validators instead of miners to create and verify blocks of transactions. Therefore, validators, entities that help secure the network by staking at least 32 ETH, receive transaction fees, but not in full. They get the priority fee or the tip that users add to the base fee to entice validators to prioritize their transactions. Meanwhile, the base fee is burned, taking ETH out of circulation.  A decline in the total fees paid represents low network usage, as fees are determined by the level of activity in the network, mainly the number of pending transactions.  That said, the eight-month low in fees probably stems from the rising popularity on the Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions, a long-term positive development for Ethereum.  ""Ethereum L1 fees since friends.tech launched on August 10 are 25% lower than the average for the year until then, which is in stark contrast to the times when the success of early NFT application CryptoKitties or the latest Yuga Labs NFT drop would commonly temporarily clog the Ethereum network,"" David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, said in a note last week.  ""From a broader perspective, seeing such a successful application gain meaningful traction without congesting the underlying blockchain network is encouraging. This, ofcourse, comes on the back of the development of Ethereum's L2 scalability solutions: Friends.tech is built on top of Base, which is Coinbase's L2 chain that uses the Optimism stack,"" Lawant added.  Friend.tech debuted on Aug. 1, gaining over 100,000 users and accumulating more than $25 million in revenue within two weeks. Layer 2 scaling solutions like Optimism, Arbitrum and Base helps scale Ethereum, alleviating congestion and keeping transaction costs under check on the main network.  Per data tracked by analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the number of daily transactions on Optimism Mainnet hit a new all-time high of nearly 900,000 transactions on Aug. 15. Further, the number of transactions processed between Ethereum mainnet and the major layer 2s using optimistic rollup technology hit their second largest value in history early this month.

While last month’s pivotal summary judgment offered a glimmer of regulatory clarity for XRP, the ongoing specter of the SEC appeal and an impending trial slated for the first half of 2024 are fostering an air of skepticism among the investor community. Despite the much-needed legal clarity provided by the recent summary judgment, a cloud of uncertainty still hangs over XRP’s trajectory. The forthcoming SEC appeal and the looming trial timeline have combined to cast doubt on the cryptocurrency’s immediate future. The ripple effect of these uncertainties is palpable as investors remain cautious about diving back into the XRP market.

This makes it the third-largest bitcoin holder behind crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex, which hold $6.4 billion and $4.3 billion worth of tokens on single wallets respectively.  The wallet previously gained notoriety among market watchers in the past few months as the identity of its owners sparked conversations and concerns about who the mysterious owner of such a large amount of bitcoin could be.  As of Monday, Robinhood has not publically commented on these holdings.  The transfers sparked speculations ranging from the bitcoin holdings belonging to financial behemoth BlackRock, which filed for a Bitcoin ETF earlier this year, to crypto exchange Gemini shifting its users’ holdings to a wallet.  Robinhood transferred some 118,300 bitcoin to the wallet from several other smaller wallets over a three-month period, data shows. The firm told CoinDesk that it custodies all customer assets, including bitcoin.  All of these holdings are held on the Bitcoin blockchain. The first transactions were made on March 8, after which huge amounts of bitcoin were transferred until July 14, data from BitInfoCharts show.  Meanwhile, the holdings shed light on the extent of Robinhood’s bitcoin exposure despite low crypto trading volumes on its platform.

16655809,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoin-further-downside-unless,1693216800,Bitcoin further downside unless…,"With no new inflows into the crypto market bitcoin is slowly sinking. An impulse is needed from somewhere if bitcoin is to gain new momentum. Sinking lower Bitcoin is very much still below its daily and weekly moving averages, indicators that are pointing to further downside unless something fairly momentous pushes the price back above. Bitcoin has found some support at the $26,000 level, but is currently pushing steadily against this. A break here is likely to see the price drop down to major support at $24,000, and possibly to $21,000, $19,000, and even back to the lows. One thing is looking much more certain for this bitcoin bull market, and that is the cycle is lengthening. Declining returns is another factor. Some analysts are pointing to how bitcoin is making less gains with each succeeding bull market. With this in mind, it might be likely that bitcoin only gets as far as $100k this bull market. Perhaps a blow-off top could take it to $150k, but when you look at percentage gains for previous bull markets, this potential best-case scenario is only a 6x from here. Therefore, bitcoin could certainly take its time and drop lower from here. Is this a bad thing? For those looking to make a fast buck, yes. But for those looking for long term gains and a reliable store of value outside of the legacy monetary system, lower prices mean being able to buy more. However, as always in markets, the least expected route is the one that may well be followed. There are factors that are bubbling away in the background that could change bitcoin’s trajectory in an extremely decisive way. Momentum can be regained Not least among these is the impending decision for a bitcoin spot ETF. This coming Friday, the SEC has to make its decision on whether 6 large and influential institutions will be granted the capacity to launch their own spot ETFs, and by doing so, provide the rocket fuel to propel bitcoin out of its current doldrums. Of course, the SEC could just decide to put the decision back, so this particular impulse may have to wait until perhaps early next year. Another way around this may come from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is due to decide on Grayscale vs SEC. Should this go in Grayscale’s favour, the SEC could be obliged to approve a spot ETF given that it has already approved several futures ETFs. Whether up, down, or sideways, bitcoin is the asset of the future that provides an alternative to our deeply unfair and corrupt monetary system. The largest institutions are coming to this realisation - it is to be hoped that the common man and woman can also manage to ignore the mainstream media misdirection.

This sentiment reflects the prevailing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency realm. Amidst this backdrop, Bitcoin’s price trend takes center stage, influenced by the evolving dynamics of the market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Nears Make-Or-Break Resistance Barrier – What Awaits Traders? Zooming in on the price action reveals a distinct pattern on the 4-hour timeframe. Bitcoin’s price, guided by a falling channel pattern, traces a consistent downtrend, oscillating between two parallel trendlines. This price movement hints at the formation of a well-recognized bullish reversal pattern, known as the falling parallel channel. At its current valuation of $25,877 according to CoinGecko, Bitcoin experienced a minor 0.6% dip in the last 24 hours and a marginal 0.3% decline over the past week. Despite these fluctuations, the price behavior strikingly emulates the falling parallel channel, suggesting the potential for a shift in momentum. Deciphering Bitcoin Falling Parallel Channel The falling parallel channel is a technical pattern often observed during a downtrend. It features two parallel trendlines encompassing the price action within a defined range. The lower trendline provides a support level, while the upper trendline acts as resistance. This pattern typically indicates a possible trend reversal, with a breakout above the upper trendline indicating an imminent bullish recovery. For Bitcoin, a significant breakout involving a 4-hour candle closure above the upper trendline could trigger the anticipated bullish bounce. This potential surge, according to price analysis, has the capacity to propel prices upwards by approximately 8%, leading to a retest of the $28,500 resistance. However, prudence remains paramount as the overarching trend still displays negative undertones. Traders and cryptocurrency holders are urged to proceed cautiously at this resistance point, as the potential for sellers to regain bearish momentum persists, possibly resulting in an extended corrective phase. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $25.928. Chart by TradingView.com Understanding The Fear And Greed Index’s Significance In a sentiment-driven market, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index holds substantial importance. It offers valuable insights into the collective psychological state of investors and traders, shedding light on their overall outlook. A prolonged presence within the lower spectrum, exemplified by the current fear score of 39/100, underscores the prevailing apprehension and uncertainty among market participants. This underscores the need for judicious decision-making amidst the interplay of technical patterns and market sentiment.

Oman’s move has raised eyebrows, with Islamic scholars debating the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies and their compatibility with Sharia law. A Bold And Historic Move Oman, a country that adheres to strict Islamic principles and traditions, has entered the world of cryptocurrency mining. The country has announced a series of investments that significantly enhance its association with crypto. The move is in line with the country’s plan to position itself as a digital powerhouse in the highly competitive region. The Omani government has announced investments of nearly $800 million dedicated towards cryptocurrency mining. This includes a $300 million partnership with the Phoenix Group, a prominent entity headquartered in Abu Dhabi. The partnership with the Phoenix Group aims to lay the groundwork for a 150-megawatt crypto mining facility in partnership with the Green Data City. The Green Data City is one of Oman’s leading licensed crypto mining firms. The facility is set to commence operations as early as 2024. Additionally, the country also granted approval for a $370 million mining venture by Exahertz International. According to several local reports, Exahertz plans to add an additional 15,000 machines by October to enhance operations. The investments are a major milestone in the country’s bid to accelerate the growth of its digital economy, stated Oman’s Minister of Transport, Communications and Information Technology, Hamoud al-Maawali. The Islamic Perspective On Crypto Oman’s foray into the crypto space comes as the entire region is adopting crypto. However, it also comes amidst a debate in the Islamic world regarding crypto and the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies in Islam. Islam’s financial principles, defined by Sharia law, are what define the permissibility or prohibition of financial instruments. Some Islamic scholars have argued that the speculative attributes of cryptocurrencies make them non-permissible for Muslims. Such a view has led to the issuance of several fatwas (Islamic legal verdicts) by Islamic scholars from countries such as Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia. However, there is a train of thought that believes that because cryptocurrencies are devoid of any interest, they can be classified as permissible. They also emphasize the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies to support their arguments further. An example of this debate can be seen in the stance adopted by some scholars when it comes to Ethereum, arguing that it is permitted. However, the Indonesian Ulema Council, the top Islamic scholars body, has declared that all cryptocurrencies are forbidden. Muslim Nations Increasingly Adopting Crypto Despite the ongoing debate, it is clear that Muslim nations have embraced cryptocurrencies in a big way and are among the biggest adopters of crypto in recent years. A study conducted by Chainalysis in 2022 identified the Middle East and North Africa regions as the fastest-growing crypto markets. Additionally, four out of twenty countries in Chainalysis’s Crypto Adoption Index are Muslim-majority nations. These have been joined by nations that have a significant Muslim population, such as Nigeria. However, the regulatory framework in these countries is in stark contrast with one another. On the one hand, countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are creating a welcoming and conducive environment for crypto firms and enthusiasts. However, countries such as Turkey, while permitting cryptocurrency trading, restrict the use of crypto in payments and by financial intermediaries such as banks.

42392672,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9j9D,1693209759,Shiba Inu’s Highly Anticipated Shibarium Bridge Is Now 'Fully Functional',"Token withdrawals out of the Shibarium bridge are now live and available to users, weeks after a much-hyped launch quickly fizzled out after being riddled with software bugs that led to millions of dollars in limbo on the network.  Developers said in a Monday update that withdrawals of Shibarium ecosystem tokens shib (SHIB), leash (LEASH) and wrapped ether (wETH) will take anywhere from 45 minutes to 3 hours to be processed, while bone (BONE) withdrawals could take up to 7 days.  As such, chief developer Shytoshi Kusama previously stated the team had put steps in place to prevent an outage from repeating. They added the team worked with Polygon blockchain developers to rectify any potential issues. Shibarium is a fork of Polygon, meaning it uses modified code that runs the latter.  Shibarium is an Ethereum layer-2 network that uses SHIB tokens as fees in what is part of a broader plan to position Shiba Inu as a serious blockchain project. It is said to have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications while finding use as a cheap settlement for DeFi applications built atop it.  A testing period for Shibarium saw significant success, with millions of wallets participating and conducting some 22 million transactions over a four-month period.  But the network quickly fizzled out after going live earlier this month. Shibarium transactions were stalled for at least eleven hours shortly after going live, with millions of dollars stuck on a bridge, or a tool that transfers tokens between different networks. SHIB prices plunged 10% at the time.  Developers responded to the outage stating that ""there was no bridge issue"" and that the problem occurred following an unprecedented mass influx of transactions from users, as previously reported. They claimed servers failed as users overloaded the network with transactions – much higher than the handling capacity of those servers.  They have since claimed the network has a “new monitoring system and additional fail-safes” in place to prevent stoppage amid a “huge level of traffic again.”  SHIB slid 2.2% in the past 24 hours despite the network restart amid a generally bearish sentiment for majors such as bitcoin (BTC).",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MATIC | SHIB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/28/shiba-inus-highly-anticipated-shibarium-bridge-is-now-fully-functional,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63abca00262f630d183540dc8c3ee736119cd7aa-3106x1747.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Juliano argued that crypto projects could scale faster by not serving the US markets because they would not have to deal with a hostile regulatory climate. Prioritize Markets Outside The US In a thread posted on X on the 25th of August, Juliano put forward his argument that builders in the crypto space must look to prioritizing markets and customers outside of the United States. He added that doing so will ensure the project’s growth, given that developers will face fewer regulatory hurdles and will be able to focus on user adoption and platform growth. Juliano primarily addressed startup projects rather than fully established players and emphasized that they could scale faster overseas in friendlier markets. “Crypto builders should just give up serving US customers for now and try to re-enter in 5-10 years. It’s not really worth the hassle/compromises. Most of the market is overseas anyway. Innovate there, find PMF [product market fit], then come back with more leverage. The only thing that matters for all of us is crypto finding 10x stronger product market fit.” He further added, “In the grand scheme of things, barely anyone uses or cares about crypto today. I personally don’t care about any outcome except growing crypto 100x+ long term.” Lack Of Clear Rules A Major Concern Many in the crypto space have stated that the United States needs more clarity when it comes to rules and regulations around crypto. A key example of this need for more clarity is the gray area surrounding the jurisdiction of the United States Securities Exchange (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the crypto space. The United States government has continued to drag its heels on crypto regulations, and the dYdX founder has suggested that the crypto space needs to grow further in order to have greater sway over US policy. Juliano argued that it makes more sense for startups and builders to focus on finding product market fits overseas before returning to the US with the added leverage of large user bases. “This does not mean crypto US policy work is not important. It absolutely is, as it takes a really long time (must be ready for the re-entry), and much of the world will follow the US’s lead. Crypto not yet having world-scale usage/product market fit means we don’t yet have much influence in policy. We need to have products with massive usage where users (voters) say, ‘wait, I need this.’” A Different Perspective The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, responded to the post and offered a different perspective to the argument. Armstrong struck a much more optimistic note, stating that the situation would get better in due time. “I see your point - but I think it will be better in a much shorter time. Probably by next year, if I had to guess. The US always gets it right after exhausting every other option. It will heal from these wounds, no matter how hard a small group of people try to stop progress.” Antonio responded with similar optimism but highlighted in his reply that the situation is different for fully scaled businesses and startups. “I’m optimistic! And we’re helping our small part with policy, too. I just think it’s different for startups vs. scaled businesses. If you haven’t yet found a strong product market fit, the tradeoff to move faster & more freely seems worth the somewhat smaller market size.” Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy also chimed in, agreeing with Juliano’s view, stating things would get better in 2-3 years, or never if not. Lack Of Regulatory Clarity Hurting US The ambiguity regarding regulations only hurts the US markets as big crypto firms look at other markets with regulatory clarity. Coinbase has made several efforts to influence crypto policy in the US. However, the firm is also expanding its global footprint, establishing operations in Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. Additionally, it is also considering a permanent move to the UK or Dubai. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is also attempting to be regulated in the UK. This comes despite the UK regulator issuing a ban on the exchange. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This was in an effort to diversify and explore the possibilities of cryptocurrency. But due to the bearish market that has afflicted the crypto market last year, this initial $19.9 million would be, at the time of writing, worth only around $11.4 million. Despite this, however, OnlyFans has experienced a 16.6% growth last year owing to a 47% increase in number of creators and 27% increase in subscribers. This move to reveal their crypto holdings might mean that the company is looking to re-explore the crypto space. The company’s foray into crypto was not limited to its investments. Last February 2022, the platform allowed its verified content creators to change their profile photos to verified Ethereum NFTs. This platform was built on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution. CEO Amrapali Gan said it was the “first step in exploring the role that NFTs can play on [their] platform.” Now, its parent company has decided to reveal its cryptocurrency holdings in a bid to ride the hype surrounding decentralized social media Friend.Tech. Among other social-based crypto platforms, notably, Friend.Tech is now facing decline after it has exploded post its August 11 launch on Coinbase’s Base network. However, it currently seems to be imploding as it saw its daily fees rapidly plummet by almost 90%. Coinbase payments risk manager Lisandro Rodriguez had suggested that “greed and poor execution” are to blamed. Like Friend.tech, OnlyFans also relies on the whole ""influencer marketing"" culture and hyped-up campaigns to spread and leverage its presence across the web. Still, there are other decentralized social media apps out there that OnlyFans can explore and maybe partner with. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42392666,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9jJT,1693205465,Bitcoin Traders Remain Fearful of 'Tail Risk' Amid Renewed Price Lull: Observers,"Relative richness of out-of-the-money call and put options tied to bitcoin suggests traders are pricing in ""tail risk"" in the bitcoin market.  Tail risk suggests a higher possibility that an investment will move more than three standard deviations from the mean.  They call it tail risk in the crypto market: the risk of an asset moving three standard deviations from its current price on the back of a rare event.  Traders fear such an event in bitcoin (BTC) even though the cryptocurrency has been listless around $26,000 since falling over 10% in the week ended Aug. 20. BTC's annualized seven-day historical or realized volatility has cooled to 26% from nearly 60% seen early last week, according to Amberdata.  ""Bitcoin's butterfly index has risen to yearly highs. It shows investors and market makers are pricing in tail risk,"" Griffin Ardern, volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said.  The butterfly index gauges the relative richness of the out-of-the-money (OTM) higher strike call options and lower strike put options by comparing crypto exchange Deribit's bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) with the at-the-money (ATM) volatility.  An elevated index indicates relatively stronger demand for OTM options (wings) or call options at strikes higher than BTC's current price and puts at strikes lower than BTC's going market rate. In other words, it signifies traders' fear of the tail risk or sensitivity to uncertainty.  Calls are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A put option gives the right to sell. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while the put buyer is bearish. Demand for OTM calls and puts rises when traders anticipate an above-average price move.  ""Looking at the BTC butterfly index, we can see that wings are near the upper 90% percentile (red horizontal line). So, [while] outright volatility [metrics] seems confident in spot price consolidation, traders are still paying up for tails,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in the weekly newsletter.  The index is expressed as a ratio or spread between crypto exchange Deribit's bitcoin volatility index (DVOL) and the at-the-money (ATM) volatility. Deribit's DVOL considers the pricing for all options, while the ATM tool is based on pricing for at-the-money options.  The pricing for tail risk is consistent with the lingering macroeconomic uncertainty.  On Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed that the central bank remains committed to hitting the 2% inflation target and keeping it there while signaling that the monetary policy will remain tight for longer than expected.  The Fed's continued bias for tightening has lifted bond yields to the highest since 2007. Rising yields tend to weigh over risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  ""A key insight from Jerome Powell is that 'getting inflation back to 2% likely requires below-trend growth', meaning he isn't afraid of some pain to the economy and jobs market,"" Magadini noted.  Ardern said the tail risk will likely remain higher in the lead-up to Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report. Per Wall Street Journal, the data is likely to show the U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs last month following June's 209,000 additions, resulting in the jobless rate holding steady at 3.6%.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/28/bitcoin-traders-remain-fearful-of-tail-risk-amid-renewed-price-lull-observers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e71c087ee495dc40e610d678cbe794eb9f29189-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392656,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg9iJv,1693204656,Pepecoin Says 'Bad Actors' on Team Stole $15M PEPE,"Some rogue developers on the Pepecoin team were behind last week’s unprecedented transfers out of the token’s multisig wallet and effectively stole millions worth of pepe coin (PEPE), a team member claimed on X, formerly Twitter.  “Since its inception, $PEPE has unfortunately been plagued by inner strife with a portion of the team being bad actors led by big egos and greed,” a developer who claimed to now be in control of the project said in a tweet. “There has often been conflict, and the majority of the team involved in $PEPE creation started to distance themselves after the first week of project inception.”  Last week, over 16 trillion Pepe tokens ($15 million) were illicitly transferred to crypto exchanges OKX, Binance, Kucoin and Bybit before being sold – contributing to a nearly 20% slide in the frog-themed tokens, the team member said.  On-chain sleuths previously noted troubling changes to the oversight of how a developer-related wallet handled transaction approvals. Instead of requiring five of eight wallets to sign off on transactions, it had changed to only two out of eight, as reported.  The transactions represented the first time the project's multisig wallet – which held 26 trillion tokens out of a 420 trillion total supply – had ever sent out the meme coin.  But whoever is in control of the project now has been apologetic on X posts, stating they plan to grow, and eventually fully decentralize, the project in the months ahead.  “I have been in negotiation with the owners of some web domains and usernames that I am looking into acquiring for PEPE, and when I am complete with any of these prospective purchases or donations of PEPE from the multi-sig, I will burn the remainder of these multi-sig tokens,” they said. Burns refers to the permanent deletion of tokens from the open market.  Pepe was one of 2023’s biggest success stories amid a generally bearish market, zooming to a peak market capitalization of $1.8 billion in mid-May and seeing trading volumes surpass those of dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – which are otherwise the biggest meme coins by trading volume.  Perennial Alarm Bells  However, analysts have repeatedly rang the alarm bells around the early activity of pepecoin traders as well as the absence of retail traders. The major risk has been too many tokens in too few hands, leaving the price action dependent on a few investors.  ""The limited amount of net liquidity is creating a high-stakes game of music chairs,” shared Rafe Tariq, senior quant at SingularityDAO in a research note in June. “Everyday investors are being lured in with the hopes of big profits but the reality is that a small percentage of investors will walk away with profit, while everyone else will get burnt.""  At the time, SingularityDAO also found that a small number of large-scale investors, known as ""whales"", hold up to approximately 25% of PEPE, while other large investors hold up 46% of the currently circulating supply.",NEGATIVE,SHIB | PEPE,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SHIB | TRADING | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/28/pepecoin-says-bad-actors-on-team-stole-15m-pepe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8595c98d39081b54b2e6244ac03a3a32596f616b-1437x808.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kusama stated, “Shibarium is LIVE and operating well! Now that we’ve proven that all funds are safu (as we said), and that Shibarium is ready for prime time, we will reopen our channels.” As per the latest statistics, the network has already amassed over 65,000 wallets and has processed 350,000 transactions. The diversity of tokens deployed on Shibarium is evident, with Kusama noting a mix of “fun, unusual, and sometimes offensive tokens.” He optimistically added, “Within these thousands of tokens, we will see which will rise to the top.” Kusama also took a moment to reflect on the resilience and determination of the Shiba Inu community, quoting Ryoshi, “Those who build in the bear market, will win in the bull market.” He expressed profound gratitude to the Polygon team, specifically mentioning Sandeep Naiwal, for their unwavering support during challenging times. “Quickly after the incident began, I called Sandeep from Polygon directly and without a second thought, he helped provide additional resources to ensure a perfect outcome to the situation,” Kusama revealed. The SHIB lead dev also highlighted that it is by design that the SHIB, Leash, WEth withdrawals through the bridge take at least 2 checkpoints (45 minutes to 3 hours), and BONE withdrawal will take up to 7 days. Related Reading: Shibarium Launch Proves Positive As Shiba Inu-Based BONE Celebrates New Milestone According to data from Shibariumscan.io, the network processed 132,739 transactions on August 25, marking its highest activity since its public restart on August 24. However, the network did experience a decline in transactions over the weekend, recording 78,870 transactions on Saturday and 40,433 on Sunday. It’s worth noting that Shibarium’s initial launch on August 16 encountered issues that halted block production. However, the team appears to have resolved these issues, setting the stage for what could be a transformative period for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. SHIB Price Analysis The Shiba Inu token (SHIB) has been on a rollercoaster ride, especially in the wake of Shibarium’s initial troubled launch. After reaching a 4-month high of $0.00001134 on August 12, the token’s price plummeted. Currently, SHIB is trading below all major daily moving averages, with the 50-day EMA acting as a formidable resistance level. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Buys 708 Billion SHIB, Sparks Speculation Of Price Recovery Over the past 11 days, there have been three failed attempts to break above the 50-day EMA. This has led to a series of five red daily candles, indicating bearish sentiment. Most recently, SHIB fell below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00000805. At press time, SHIB stood at $0.00000795. The relaunch of Shibarium could serve as a catalyst for SHIB’s price. With new use cases and potential for increased SHIB burns, the bulls may find new strength in the coming days. However, the path to recovery is fraught with resistance levels that need to be overcome. These include the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.00000805, the area between the 100-day EMA at $0.00000867 and the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.00000869, and further up, the 200-day EMA at $0.00000932 and the 38.2% Fibonacci level at $0.00000931. In summary, while the successful relaunch of Shibarium is a positive development, SHIB’s price has multiple hurdles to clear before a bullish trend can be confirmed. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Shibarium’s operational success can translate into upward momentum for SHIB.

Having launched its beta version on Coinbase’s layer-2 Base on Aug. 11, Friend.tech initially generated significant buzz, especially after its fees eclipsed both Uniswap and the Bitcoin network, reaching over $1 million within a day on Aug. 19. Despite this, the initial momentum seems to have been short-lived, while also trouncing speculations that info from its users was leaked. Comparisons have also been made between Friend.tech and the 2021 DeSo app BitCloud. Web3 marketer Legendary predicts a similar fate for Friend.tech, anticipating that it ""will collapse as BitClout did."" Aggregated blockchain data reveals a significant drop in daily fees, which hit a high of $1.7 million on Aug. 21 and subsequently plunged by over 87%, settling around $215,000 by Aug. 26. Concurrently, transaction activity on the platform saw an over 90% decrease, falling from a high of nearly 525,000 on Aug. 21 to just over 51,000 on Aug. 27, as indicated by data from Dune Analytics compiled by Crypto Koryo. Social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter), is awash with commentary on the network's drastic decline. One such tweet by @beaniemaxi reads, ""RIP Friendtech. August 2023-August 2023."" RIP FriendtechAugust 2023-August 2023💀 pic.twitter.com/Fb0bh23Fyo — Beanie (@beaniemaxi) August 26, 2023 Friend.tech's operational model focuses on users buying and selling ""keys"" that grant buyers the ability to send private messages to sellers. For each transaction, the platform purportedly retains a 5% commission. This model attracted several prominent figures from both the crypto realm and beyond, including the host of the UpOnly podcast, Cobie, YouTuber Faze Banks, and the Russian protest group Pussy Riot. However, the rapid decline has sparked criticism, with Coinbase payments risk manager Lisandro Rodriguez suggesting in an X post that the platform's downfall can be attributed to ""greed and poor execution."" The available data further underscores the downturn, showcasing a drop in the number of active buyers and sellers. From an Aug. 21 peak with over 58,000 buyers and 27,000 sellers, the numbers dwindled to about 10,000 buyers and 7,800 sellers by Aug. 27. Inflows, too, experienced a decline, plummeting nearly 90.5% from an Aug. 21 high of $16.8 million to approximately $1.6 million on Aug. 27. Even before this steep decline, skepticism surrounded the platform. Crypto commentator Yazan, in the previous week, expressed concerns over the sustainability of user key price surges, wondering aloud about the feasibility of individuals paying 1 Ether (ETH) or more simply to gain access to private chats.

The platform had implored users to remove their funds from LPs and initiated a pause on pools to minimize potential harm. Assets that were under threat spanned various platforms including Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Gnosis, Fantom, and zkEVM (from Polygon). Upon the revelation of the vulnerability, merely 1.4% or over $5 million of Balancer's entire assets were at jeopardy. However, by August 24, an estimated $2.8 million, which constitutes 0.42% of its total value locked, was still exposed. The platform had issued a warning on X, advising its users: “We believe funds in the mitigated pools (labeled ‘mitigated’) are safe, but still strongly recommend timely migration to safe pools, or withdrawal. Pools that were unable to be fortified are marked ’at risk’. If you participate as an LP in any of these pools, it is advised to exit immediately.” Balancer had transitioned to the Optimism network in June the previous year with the intent of amplifying user functionality and diminishing transaction costs.

The defense team filed a motion Friday arguing that Bankman-Fried's right to work on his own defense is being infringed by his being in jail, because the documents he needs to be able to review are only accessible online.  ""We do not believe that anything short of temporary release will properly address these problems and safeguard Mr. Bankman-Fried’s right to participate in his own defense,"" a Friday letter authored by defense attorney Christian Everdell said. ""At the very least, however, we respectfully request that the Court reconsider its previous decision and order the Marshals to produce Mr. Bankman-Fried to the proffer rooms at 500 Pearl Street five days a week, where defense counsel can provide him with an internet-enabled computer that will permit him to review, edit, and share documents and work product with his attorneys. Defense counsel will be present with Mr. Bankman-Fried the entire time and will take back the laptop at the end of the session.""  The FTX founder's bond was revoked earlier this month, after Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the case, ruled that Bankman-Fried had attempted to tamper with witnesses at least twice, and so violated his bail conditions. His attorneys announced an appeal and tried to keep Bankman-Fried out of custody in the same hearing where where Judge Kaplan ordered him remanded, before raising the issue before Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn last week.  At issue, they say, is ""Bankman-Fried’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in preparing his defense and his right to receive effective assistance of counsel.""  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Is Now in Jail  He needs a laptop, Friday's letter said, which can access the internet in order to review the millions of documents produced during discovery and add to a spreadsheet organizing key items.  Everdell made a similar argument during Bankman-Fried's most recent arraignment, saying ""there is no way for him to effectively communicate his work product, his analyses to us.""  While Bankman-Fried has access to a laptop while he's at the federal courthouse in Manhattan, he's limited to six hours a day, two days a week (at Judge Kaplan's direction) – substantially less than the ""80-100 hours a week"" he was putting in prior to being sent to jail. The laptop itself has a limited battery and the internet access is weak, Friday's letter added. He has no internet or laptop access while in the Metropolitan Detention Center.  ""Bankman-Fried does not have access to any discovery or work product at the MDC and has not had any such access since he was detained two weeks ago,"" the letter said. ""At the Government’s invitation, we have been sending hard drives to Mr. Bankman-Fried with selected documents and work product for him to review at the MDC. But Mr. Bankman-Fried does not have a laptop at the MDC that he can use to review them. This means that there is almost nothing Mr. Bankman-Fried can do at the MDC to prepare for trial.""  The defense team also took issue with the Department of Justice's ongoing discovery productions, saying prosecutors shared more than 4 million new pages of documents last week. They want the judge to order that any discovery produced after July 1 be blocked, saying there isn't enough time to review them all prior to trial.  The judge ordered prosecutors to respond to the letter, as well as another earlier letter outlining one of Bankman-Fried's planned defenses, by Tuesday, August 29, and scheduled a virtual hearing on Wednesday at 1:00 p.m. ET on the discovery issues.
