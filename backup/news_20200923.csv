42384748,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGTZ,1600899930,"MakerDAO Users Hosed by March Flash Crash Won't Get MKR Payouts, Say MKR Whales","MakerDAO will not compensate victims of March 12’s “Black Thursday” flash crash that left some of the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s investors out $8.33 million, according to a votehttps://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmnxitxuc5u4inynq8ekh5vvbgomjzl6fudwzhawbshhgh that closed Tuesday. The Maker community had initially votedhttps://vote.makerdao.com/polling-proposal/qmwfvvguaf8rz8xwgv2cqnzzt9t5h6epzh17qmk2ue99y4 in early April to refund sunken investors.    Nearly six months later and the community – represented by current holders of Maker’s MKR governance tokens – concluded a final vote to give zero compensation for lost funds. Some 65% of votes opted for zero compensation, with the next two options for partial compensation receiving 18% and 15%, respectively.      The vote itself was dominated by large MKR holders. Only 38 unique votes were cast, equivalent to 8.74% of MKR token holders, with the low turnout reflecting some of the current difficulties associated with governance in the booming DeFi sector.      Stepping back, many Maker users had collateral positions for outstanding loans liquidated after a sudden, mid-March crash in the price of ether (ETH). Additionally, investors were unable to maintain positions because of a backlog of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain as investors sought to flee the COVID-driven market collapse.      The one-two punch was preyed upon by market making bots that exploited the flaw to the tune of 2.4 million ETH. Broken logic in the platform’s collateral liquidation engine could be exploited under the right conditions to gobble up collateral on the cheap.      Read more: Mempool Manipulation Enabled Theft of $8M in MakerDAO Collateral on Black Thursday: Report      Investors have since lobbied the community for partial compensation denominated in the platform’s MKR governance token. All options included in Tuesday’s vote included MKR as the compensation vehicle. (Early on, affected investors had pushed for ETH.)      Yet, participating MKR holders were incentivized to vote against the compensation as any additional printing of MKR tokens would dilute the value of their holdings. Many community members said as much in the MakerDAO forum.    Class action update    Litigation against the Maker Foundation in the form of a class-action lawsuit continues regardless of the vote’s outcome, said Adam S. Heder, the Harris Berne Christensen LLP attorney representing MakerDAO’s Black Thursday investors.      Lead plaintiff Pete Johnson filed three counts against the Maker Foundation in April including negligence, intentional misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation. He and joining members of the suit are seeking up to $28.35 million in compensation.      “The parties have submitted briefing on the Maker Defendants’ motion to compel arbitration. We don’t know yet when the Court will issue its ruling,” Heder said via email.

42384755,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGdd,1600892888,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Drops to $10.2K; Scaling Solution xDai Doubles in Value Locked,"The bitcoin market continues to display weakness; xDai total value locked shows interest in Ethereum scaling solutions.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,285 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Slipping 1.8% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,250-$10,575  BTC below its 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bearish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price had remained in a narrow range since Monday, as the world’s oldest cryptocurrency stuck within $10,400 territory Wednesday before falling to as low as $10,250 just prior to press time.      Read More: Bitcoin Market Weakening After Sell-Off, On-Chain Data Suggests      “September has been a unique month in the crypto markets,” said Elie Le Rest, a partner at quant trading firm ExoAlpha. “Crypto has become way more thinly traded,” he added.      Indeed, after the month opened with a rarely-seen $1 billion day on major exchanges September 3, bitcoin volume has weakened. It was at $202 million Wednesday as of press time.      As the bitcoin market remains tepid, the U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the greenback versus a basket of other fiat currencies, is bouncing back from 2020 lows, in the green 0.40% as of press time.      Cryptocurrency traders like to keep an eye on the strength of the dollar, but many have differing views on what the index’s rise might mean.      “I see the Dollar Index going up as a correction after its performance during the pandemic,” said Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader in Italy. “On the mid- to long-term, I'm personally still bullish on bitcoin as well as on precious metals like gold.”      Henrik Kugelberg, another European over-the-counter trader based in Sweden, said he expects the dollar will become deflationary, where the prices of goods and services drop.      “I now feel convinced that what we see and will see is deflation and not inflation,” he said. “If this is correct, people will sell bonds and buy safer stuff, like high-end real estate, gold and bitcoin.”      Whatever the trader narrative is on the dollar, this much is true: Based on Federal Reserve data, there are more dollars floating around the global economy than ever before.      As for bitcoin’s tepid performance the past few days, a loss of momentum for decentralized finance, or DeFi, this week may partially be to blame for a lackluster crypto market. “The recent crash in DeFi may explain the current market silence for the past two days as traders and lenders are figuring out next steps to allocate capital and execute trading strategies,” said ExoAlpha’s Le Rest.    xDai value locked doubles    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was down Wednesday trading around $327 and slipping 4.7% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Read More: Data Site DeFi Pulse Fixes Bug, Says Value Locked Hit $13B Last Week      Stablecoin xDai, developed via a collaboration between MakerDAO and POA Network, saw a jump in value locked to $1.2 million on Wednesday from $559,000 on Sept. 20.      The stablecoin offers capabilities on the Ethereum network with lower fees and without the hassles of slow block confirmations, a problem as DeFi grows. xDai accomplishes this by acting as a “sidechain” off of the main Ethereum blockchain network where transactions have often clogged the system during high-transaction activity the past few months.      XDai might be a tool for traders to better navigate DeFi in high-transaction times, said Brian Mosoff, chief executive officer of investment firm Ether Capital. “As we've seen in recent months, the use of Ethereum has skyrocketed, bringing with it rising gas costs,” said Mosoff. “Many use cases and participants may be better served using xDai, it offers an immediate scaling solution that allows people to stay in the Ethereum ecosystem.”    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the red Wednesday.

42384751,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGW5,1600883442,Blockchain Commons Internship Introduces New Developers to Open Source,"The Takeaway:    For this year’s Blockchain Commons internship, Christopher Allen had an uncommon “problem”: too many quality applications to turn down.  Instead, he expanded the program to accommodate seven interns where he usually only accepts one.  With the internship drawing to a close, the interns have just about completed their projects – but that doesn’t mean they’re done contributing to Bitcoin’s open source landscape.    When Christopher Allen received applications for the 2020 Blockchain Commons internship, he had a problem: He had more applications than he had ever received in the internship’s history, and all from stellar applicants.      This was a good problem to have, of course, and Allen tackled it head-on by expanding the internship program. He typically only takes one intern under his tutelage, but this year he took on seven.      With so many extra hands, each intern had the opportunity to work on a project of his or her preference. Each of these projects went toward improving software in the Blockchain Commons repositories.      As the internship draws to a close, the interns’ contributions to free and open-source software (FOSS) are nearing completion and will soon be open to the public to use.    The Blockchain Commons: a hub for open-source software    Allen founded the Blockchain Commons in 2018 in a bid to keep Bitcoin’s development open and distributed.      In a past life, he helped pioneer the OpenSSL/TLS protocol, an encryption standard for securing data transmitted over the internet. Come 2014, the Heartbleed Bug compromised the OpenSSL implementation of the encryption standard, which handled 60% of the internet’s traffic at the time (and with it, trillions of dollars of online commerce).      The flaw was promptly patched. But Allen took that tribulation to heart and vowed to not allow a single point of failure to threaten the security of other software projects he works on.      Cue Allen’s discovery of Bitcoin and the founding of the Blockchain Commons. After a brief tenure at Blockstream, Allen founded his not-for-profit benefit organization to do his part to keep Bitcoin’s development distributed.      Now, after a summer of tinkering, his newest interns have enriched the codebase and GitHub libraries of some of the Blockchain Commons’ principal projects – including the addition of a project of their own design.    What these budding Bitcoin developers created  Spotbit    For their new group project, the interns began building Spotbit, a software for curating Tor-supported bitcoin (BTC) price feeds.      Led by Dartmouth senior Christian Murray with assistance from Nishit Shah, the modular, self-hosted feed draws pricing data from 100 cryptocurrency exchanges across various stablecoin and fiat trading pairs. Users can choose which exchanges they want their feed to tap into, which trading pairs to support and what data they want to store. If a user doesn’t want to host a Spotbit node, they can connect to others.    Lethe Kit    Besides Spotbit, each intern has an individual project which they work on alongside Allen to improve.      Gorazd Kovacic from Slovenia, for example, has been working on the Blockchain Commons’ code for the Lethe Kit. The DIY hardware wallet – so-named after the river of Greek mythology that cleansed the underworld’s denizens with amnesia of their past lives – is an air-gapped hardware wallet, meaning it cannot come in direct contact with an internet-connected device.      The Lethe Kit can generate seeds and addresses to receive transactions, but it cannot send bitcoin through partially-signed Bitcoin transactions (a previous version of this article indicated otherwise).      Kovacic has been working on integrating animated QR codes and Shamir secret shares (a cryptographic technique for dividing a private key into multiple parts) into the Lethe kit.    Gordian Wallet and Gordian Server    Another intern, Gautham Ganesh Elango, is working on Gordian, a two-part project which includes a Bitcoin full-node implementation which runs over Tor and an iOS mobile wallet.      The Gordian Server operates similarly to Bitcoin node dashboards like My Node by offering its users a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with Bitcoin Core.      A GUI (an interface type we use everyday when commanding our Macs and PCs with iOs or Windows, to give one example) is the user-friendly, layman’s version of the command-line interface – the raw coding terminal that developers use to speak to their devices.      The project's other working part, Gordian Wallet, is a mobile Bitcoin wallet for iOS which can connect to the Gordian Server.      Elango, a freshman from Australia, is also building out an accounting tool which will allow Gordian users to import transaction and price data to Microsoft Excel for tax purposes.      For another project, Elango and fellow intern Javier Vargas are stepping into the role of instructor by fleshing out the Blockchain Commons’ documentation of RPC codes for managing a Bitcoin node from the command-line interface.    Internship takeaways    Almost all the tools the interns have been working on contribute to each others’ tech stacks (Spotbit, for example, provides price data for the Gordian Wallet). Showing that there’s more to open-source development than coding, cross-project collaboration is one of the internship’s key instructional points.      For Murray, this was indeed one of the internship’s primary lessons: that open-source development means creating sustainable tools that go beyond a solitary use case.      “This was my first introduction to open-source development, and definitely one of the big learning curves is learning to collaborate effectively and developing processes for yourself. A lot of the stuff I wrote before I got here was something I needed to work one time, but this is a lot more about something that is going to work all the time,” he told CoinDesk.      Murray said he plans to continue to work on Bitcoin open-source software after the internship, whether professionally or otherwise. This was a common thread for the soon-to-be alumni of the Blockchain Commons.      Kovacic, who is already diving into other open-source repositories like Blockstream’s c-lightning, said the internship “reaffirmed my position that I want to work in the Bitcoin space.”      For his part, Elango agreed, saying the internship shook off his apprehension about approaching the seemingly daunting task of maintaining open-source projects.      “It’s definitely got me interested in Bitcoin open-source development. At first I was kind of intimidated by these large open-source projects. After the internship, I’ve become more comfortable with doing large contributions to these projects. Once I learn the basics of C++ I may start contributing to Bitcoin Core. And if not Bitcoin Core specifically, then some other open-source project,” he told CoinDesk.    Looking ahead to the next cohort of interns    With this internship coming to a close, Allen is offering another one that will begin in October and end in December. He stressed that the latest internship hopes to pull in more talent from Bitcoin-adjacent fields, not just the realm of computer science. This could mean students studying law, library science or other disciplines to help improve aspects of Blockchain Commons’ documentation.      When Allen asked his students what they would say to incoming interns, Murray answered in the spirit of what may be considered the internship’s core ethos: Ask plenty of questions and cooperate with others whenever possible.      “If I could give advice to anyone coming in it would be: don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. We have one group chat and I wanted to be professional and not spam the chat with questions. One time, I had spent several hours trying to fix this Github commit and couldn’t figure it out. But then Gorazd ended up giving me this one-line solution. If I had asked the question early, I would have saved a lot of time.”      This article has been updated to correct a description of the Lethe Kit and to clarify how the Gordian Server and Gordian Wallet operate.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/23/blockchain-commons-internship-introduces-new-developers-to-open-source,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd04887c523ff02dbf75c6d4fcbe8ad13b9d6a0e-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum data firm Dune Analytics, a Github-like platform which provides DeFi insights, has raised $2 million led by Dragonfly Capital and included Multicoin Capital, Coinbase Ventures, DCG and DeFi angels. Meanwhile, Skynet Labs, a startup formerly known as Nebulous, has raised a $3 million funding round led by Paradigm. Using the token-fueled Sia network, Skynet allows for decentralized and permissionless hosting. Recently, community members spun up a Skynet app store following rumors that TikTok might get delisted from popular app stores.      Crypto lobby It’s been a busy season for crypto lobbyist groups, even amid the coronavirus pandemic. Yesterday, the Blockchain Association announced members from 0x, the Stellar Development Foundation and Kraken will join its board. The new members bring regulatory and DeFi experience to the Washington, D.C.-based association. Elsewhere, former Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has joined the Chamber of Digital Commerce, also based in the U.S. capital. “His experience as a legislator is very very valuable because he can help us navigate Congress,” CDC’s founder Perianne Boring said. The blockchain advocacy group also added Visa, Goldman Sachs and Six Digital Exchange (SDX) have joined the group as executive committee members.      DeFi fund The cryptocurrency money manager Panxora is raising up to $50 million for a new DeFi-centered hedge fund, CoinDesk reporter Bradley Keoun reports. Based in the Cayman Islands, the fund will primarily buy tokens listed on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges rather than from decentralized – and sometimes community-owned – automated exchanges. Panxora CEO Gavin Smith said few if any decentralized exchanges can guarantee sufficient compliance with anti-money-laundering rules, and also because a token listing from an exchange theoretically implies some level of vetting. The fund is scheduled to start trading on Nov. 2.      Bug fix DeFi Pulse, the go-to data aggregator for the DeFi scene, said on Twitter late Tuesday night that it had identified and fixed a ""previously undetected issue” that led to a substantial misreporting of the total value held on DeFi protocols. The site’s representatives said the TVL (total value locked) in DeFi exceeded a record $13.2 billion on Sept. 18, rather than the $9.1 billion it had previously displayed. Representatives didn’t say explicitly what caused the discrepancy.      Interest earning? Peer-to-peer commerce company Origin has unveiled a stablecoin that functions like a savings account. Called Origin Dollars, or OUSD, the coin will earn users “interest” from leveraging various DeFi projects without users having to stake in those protocols. Backed one-for-one by the three big stablecoins on Ethereum, Tether’s USDT, Circle and Coinbase’s USDC and MakerDAO’s DAI, Origin Dollars can be minted by depositing those coins onto Origin’s app or bought on Uniswap. On the backend, Origin will take deposits and start yield farming them in different protocols, starting with the DeFi money market Compound. Returns will be driven back into OUSD, minting more OUSD that will be distributed proportionally to all the wallets that have it, CoinDesk’s Brady Dale reports.

CoinDesk’s Will Foxley reports the supply of BitGo’s wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) alone topped 76,000 last week, with more than 21,000 entering circulation. Including the other six major issuers, there’s as many as 107,000 BTC (worth ~$1.1 billion) tokenized for use on Ethereum.      This raises questions about why investors or traders would want to tokenize their bitcoin, which adds complexity and potential software risks to their bags.      For many, it appears to be the higher rates of return found on decentralized finance protocols especially when compared to other options such as BlockFi, Foxley notes. “Tokenized bitcoin allows investors to bring large amounts of value over to the Ethereum network and its young DEX market in a few clicks,” he writes.      Skeptics note there really isn’t any bitcoin “on” Ethereum, more of a representation of its value. Others go further in saying that many tokenization options rely on trusting a third party like BitGo to print these representative tokens, thereby adding counterparty and censorship risks to bitcoin.      Recently, though, a trustless alternative, tBTC, relaunched after an abortive first attempt last April.    Market intel    Selloff = slump?

On Tuesday, the net inflow of bitcoin to exchanges (measured by the total change in exchange balances) was 36,800 BTC – the biggest single-day rise since the markets crash on March 13. The uptick in net inflows represents an increase in selling pressure, since investors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges when they see a possible need to liquidate their holdings. This could extend bitcoin’s recent price losses in the short term, with immediate supports at $10,000 and $9,868 (Sept. 8 low).    Internet 2030    Jeff Wilser paints a picture of the coming “currency cold war,” offering three scenarios of how either bitcoin, digital dollars or China’s DCEP will become the dominant world currency, and one where that concept is thrown out the window. The excerpt below is taken from CoinDesk’s “Internet 2030” series about the future of the crypto economy.      SCENARIO FOUR: A non-government-backed cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) gains dominance      What would the internet look like if a private (non-government regulated) currency emerged as dominant? “If you could pay anybody anywhere in the world, instantly and for free, we wouldn’t be so dependent on the advertising model of internet content,” says fintech guru David Birch. Micropayments (such as Brave) might finally emerge from niche to widespread.      “If I can pay 25 cents to read the thing I want to read on The New York Times – I don’t have to subscribe to it and use credit cards – they don’t have to show me disgusting adverts for ear wax, so that’s kind of a win-win,” says Birch. Then again, he acknowledges that this is class-based, as “the rich can buy themselves out of this cesspit.”      Birch also highlights the optimist possibilities, as “If you could do business with anyone in the world, hopefully, new products and services would spring up, to facilitate that trade and interaction.”      International uncertainty may drive cryptocurrency usage. “If we have a stable geopolitical structure, where most people and most nations feel secure, then that will not encourage a large rise of non-government digital currencies,” reasons futurist Ross Dawson.      “Whereas if we have a deep social division and disruption – and civil wars in developed countries in the next decade, that’s very plausible, depending on how you define ‘civil war’ – this will fracture societies and trust in government, and could lead to wholesale shifts to cryptocurrencies.”      With apologies to the crypto super-bulls, this is not necessarily the Lambo Scenario or Moon Scenario. Dawson imagines a potential world of “dueling economies” – even within the United States – if a cryptocurrency emerges dominant. One will be the official legal economy that’s regulated by the U.S. government (like today), and the other an unregulated “shadow economy” that’s dominated by the cryptocurrency.      “There will always be national currencies,” says Dawson. “We’re never going to have a time when the government says, “Okay, we give up, we’re not going to do this anymore.” (He later clarifies that maybe “never” is too strong of a word, but certainly not in the next decade.)      So the question is what’s the balance between the shadow economy and the regulated economy? He points to Italy’s shadow economy as an example, which by some estimates is more than 12% of the nation’s GDP – largely the result of tax evasion.      At least in this scenario, Bitcoin (or some other cryptocurrency) is finally not just a Store of Value or a speculative investment. It could be widely used to buy a cup of coffee, pay your rent, or, yes, to buy your pair of sunglasses.

The new release gives developers additional tools to customize a blockchain “precisely for your application or business logic,” the post reads.      Parity Technologies is the developer of the Polkadot blockchain with ambitions for developing a Web 3.0, undergirded by a meshing of various blockchains.      The centerpiece of that multi-blockchain vision is Substrate. It acts as a tooling kit for developers making their own blockchains with Polkadot – also built on Substrate – working underneath as a communication and economic layer of sorts between Substrate-based blockchains.      For example, Parity Tech’s “canary” network Kusama and security token platform Polymesh are two Substrate blockchains. Both chains should be able to communicate with each other, if everything pans out as co-founder of Parity Tech Gavin Wood foresees.      Read more: Polymath Moves Security Token Platform Off Ethereum and Onto Parity’s Substrate    Substrate 2.0    The new release adds a few core functionalities as Polkadot continues rolling developments after its May debut, said Parity Technologies head of public affairs Peter Mauric to CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Most important, the code shipment includes 70 composable “modules” for blockchain architects to plug and play various design ideas. Parity developers call these modules “pallets.”      Read more: Polkadot Releases Rococo, Its Test Environment for Interoperable ‘Parachains’      For example, pallets exist for managing an on-chain developer treasury or for allowing smart contracts on a Substrate-based blockchain to speak with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).      Substrate 2.0 also includes modules for bringing off-chain data onto the blockchain using what it calls “off-chain workers.” These remove the burden of intensive processes and massive data sets from specialized nodes on the network, and communicate with the main chain to ensure all network participants are kept up to date automatically.      Addressing what is generally referred to as the “oracle problem,” these off-chain workers help bring data from the real world, such as prices or temperatures, onto a blockchain and are “ideal for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices or real-world data inputs via oracles,” the blog states.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | DOT | ETH | MARKET,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/09/23/parity-upgrades-polkadots-underlying-tech-to-make-custom-blockchain-building-easier,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccee01c2177cd0f1355446727b07509631d5423b-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384750,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXAlGYb,1600872500,UNI Market Cap Rebounds $120M as Rest of Crypto Market Falters,"Uniswap's week-old UNI token is the big winner in Wednesday trading with a rebounding price and a market cap swelling by over $100 million in the past 24 hours.    Data from CoinGecko shows the price of the UNI token has increased by just under 20% from $3.80 to over $4.60 over the same time frame.  That's led to the coin's market cap jumping by nearly $120 million, from $460 million to just under $580 million at around 13:00 UTC.  At press time, UNI was the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $581 million, and individual tokens trading at $4.75.  Mounting concerns over a second possible lockdown in both the U.S. and Europe have, over the past few days, sparked a macro sell-off which has had a knock-on effect on digital assets, with approximately $30 billion shaved off the total market cap since Saturday.  UNI has been no exception. Having hit a record high of $8.40 on Friday, the coin slid across the weekend and into the new week, hitting a low of $3.44 Tuesday morning.  But its rebounding price in the past 24 hours is markedly different from the lackluster movement of other, more established, cryptocurrencies.  Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market cap, has stuck around $10,400 to $10,500 since its $500 fall on Monday.  Ether, the second-largest, has climbed just $4 over the same time frame.  The net inflow of bitcoin into exchanges, indicative of holders preparing to sell, has since risen to levels not seen since March 13.  Launched last Wednesday, UNI is designed to power on-chain governance decisions on Uniswap – one of the most popular trading platforms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.  It's possible that as a barely week-old DeFi coin, UNI's price may be shielded from some of the ""real world"" macro effects that have put other more widely traded digital assets into the deep freeze.  But it could also be that the market is anticipating greater institutional involvement in the DeFi space.  CoinDesk reported Wednesday that crypto money manager Panxora is looking to raise $50 million for a new DeFi hedge fund. CEO Gavin Smith said the firm saw this new branch of crypto as having ""great potential.""  Indeed, while there doesn't appear to be a surge in DeFi coins across the board, the native tokens for both yEarn and Band, two alternative DeFi protocols, have surged 7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

42432715,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO14rh,1600867811,Venezuela Legalizes Crypto Mining but Will Force Industry Into National Pool,"Venezuela's government has given cryptocurrency miners mixed news this week.    Firstly, the government department responsible for regulating cryptos has legalized the mining industry, local industry news site CriptoNoticias reported Tuesday.  The new decree was published in the Official Gazette on Monday and authorized by by Joselit Ramirez, head of National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (SUNACRIP).  It states that any local entity wishing to mine cryptos must apply for a license and be listed on a government register.  Applicants will need to hand over information to the authorities on the nature of their mining activities and keep their mining-related records for 10 years.  Manufacturers of mining equipment or mining data centers will be able to apply for a special license, according to the report.  The importing and manufacturing of mining equipment will be supervised by Venezuelan authorities.  Unusually, all mining activities must be carried out through an official National Digital Mining Pool, with those who operate outside it to face penalties.  Centralizing mining in this way will mean the government is able to control any income earned from the pool's combined mining rewards, as well as paying out to contributors.  Thus the government could potentially freeze or delay miners' payments or levy any taxes before payments have been made, says CriptoNoticias.  Venezuela's economy has been suffering from economic mismanagement and international sanctions led by the U.S.  Its president, Nicolas Maduro, has previously launched a purportedly oil-pegged crypto token called the petro in an attempt to bring in much-needed foreign currency.  The U.S. Department of Justice alleged earlier this year that Maduro had used cryptocurrency to conceal transactions related to illicit drug-running, though it did not specify if the petro was involved.  SUNACRIP's Ramirez is also wanted by the U.S government on charges of corruption and links to the narcotics trade.

42432724,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO157h,1600866003,This Ethereum Startup Is Building a ‘DeFi Firewall’ for Institutional Investors,"As decentralized finance (DeFi) balloons to a roughly $10 billion market, infrastructure builders are coming up with ways to reduce the associated risks.      Announced Wednesday, wallet and custodial technology provider Trustology has added a “DeFi Firewall” to its suite of institutional-investment tools. The “Firewall” is basically a set of rules or filters selected by a fund, specifying which DeFi protocols or decentralized exchanges they consider kosher.      With DeFi’s liquidity mining opportunities driving adoption and demand, investors from a more traditional or institutional background want some of this action. At the same time, they have to be able to show that funds are being managed in as prudent a fashion as possible.      Trustology, which is backed by ConsenSys and Two Sigma Ventures, has already built wallet-native tools to prevent clients from sending their crypto to the wrong address or the wrong exchange, and now this is being extended to DeFi smart contracts, explained Trustology CEO Alex Batlin.      “A fund might decide it’s allowed to use Uniswap but not KyberSwap, for one reason or another,” said Batlin. “Or they might decide that USDC or MakerDAO’s dai are allowed but not USDT and that these funds are only ever circulated within a permitted set of addresses – now they can prove to their investors that is all possible.”      Catering to institutional investors who’ve remained largely on the sidelines of the emerging yield farming trend is something other industry players are also courting. Just last week, the Chicago DeFi Alliance launched a Liquidity Launchpad program to get “informed and professional players” into the DeFi space.      Read more: This DeFi Group Wants to Bring Maturity to the Yield Farming Craze      Certain blockchains have endeavored to protect smart contracts by preventing unauthorized access, and there are several DeFi-primed wallet solutions around today, said Batlin, but nothing that offers the type of institutional controls for businesses to legally operate in DeFi.      Next on the Trustology roadmap will be the introduction of “DeFi Notifications,” Batlin said. This is an automated system to deal with DeFi events, such as when a fund manager has placed a lot of collateral in a particular smart contract and the price of ether (ETH) has gone up or down.      “One of the problems with blockchains is the lack of a notification service so you have to be constantly monitoring the blockchain to figure that out because if you don’t, your positions can get liquidated,” said Batlin. “We can either send you the automated notification through webhooks or email alerts.”      Read more: Alchemy Notify Wants to Simplify Blockchain UX With a Single Push      Further down the road, the plan is to introduce “DeFi Flows,” Batlin added. “So we can pick up that an event has happened and have an automated response to that. For instance, when some event takes place, a broker might want funds automatically sent to Aave to be interest-bearing.”      Batin said both of the upcoming products would be released in four to six weeks.      So, if institutional DeFi is a thing, what form is it likely to take?      “It’s more family office and very alternative, and they’re looking at 10%-15% allocation,” said Batlin, adding:    “We’ve signed up five new funds in the last two weeks and they were all guys from the traditional space who had set up crypto funds to focus on DeFi. So it’s more about fragmentation than traditional funds allocating.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/23/this-ethereum-startup-is-building-a-defi-firewall-for-institutional-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f3eaf89423ae51c0d25fd595f678439e1ac14963-1200x852.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42432730,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Lh,1600865274,First Mover: Bitcoins Hit Exchanges as Bloomberg Touts Crypto and DeFi Hedge Fund Seeks $50M,"The upcoming U.S. presidential election has become one of the most contentious in history, fraught with searing divisions over everything from the economy to race to the continued health of democracy itself.      So it's not surprising that Wall Street options traders are now pricing in expectations of elevated market volatility around the November election. Analysts for the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs noted earlier this month that price swings of nearly 3% are implied around election day in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks.      What's surprising is that options trading on notoriously volatile bitcoin prices, which often trade in sync with stocks, implies a stretch of uncanny calm come November, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reported Tuesday.      Godbole writes that ample technical factors might explain the discrepancy, from the influence of certain hedging strategies to the reality that the nascent bitcoin options market is still quite small in relative terms, with most action concentrated in ""front-month"" contracts that expire in September.      Another possibility, according to Godbole, is that bitcoin, as a globally traded asset, might actually be less susceptible to the U.S. outcome, even though the cryptocurrency is priced in dollars. The implication could be that bitcoin decouples at that point from the U.S. market.      “The U.S. elections will have relatively less impact on bitcoin compared to the U.S. equities,” Richard Rosenblum, head of trading at the digital-asset firm GSR, told Godbole.    Crypto investment firm Panxora seeks $50M for new hedge fund to buy DeFi tokens    There's been a months-long string of astonishing developments and ridiculous twists in the fast growing arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Digital tokens with names like YAM and SUSHI have appeared overnight, exploding in value, dominating crypto headlines and sparking serious conversations about the far-reaching potential of digital-asset markets and financial technologies.      With total collateral locked into automated, blockchain-based DeFi trading and lending platforms surging more than 20-fold this year to $13 billion as of last week, big centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and OKEx have rushed to list the tokens and roll out DeFi offerings to avoid missing out.      Now, one cryptocurrency money manager, Panxora, seeks to raise up to $50 million for a new hedge fund to buy digital tokens associated with the fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.      “This has got the potential to really change the way finance is carried out,” Panxora CEO Gavin Smith said in an interview.      In an ironic twist, Panxora's announcement comes just as the DeFi market appears to be cooling. Just in the past week, total collateral in the systems has declined to about $9.5 billion, according to data tracker DeFi Pulse. Aave, a decentralized lender, saw its LEND tokens fall by 12% during the seven days through Tuesday, according to Messari, a cryptocurrency data firm.      Smith suggests that a correction was bound to come at some point. “We expect the market to be volatile in the early years,” Smith said. “While there is great potential there will inevitably be setbacks along the way.”      Read More: Crypto Hedge Fund Looks for $50M to Buy DeFi Tokens Amid Market Pullback    Bitcoin Watch    Key bitcoin (BTC) on-chain metrics have flipped bearish this week, suggesting the top cryptocurrency by market value may remain under pressure in the short-term.      On Tuesday, the net inflow of bitcoin to exchanges (measured by the total change in exchange balances) was 36,800 BTC – the biggest single-day rise since the markets crash on March 13, according to data source Chainalysis.      ""Since Sept. 20, the net daily inflow of bitcoins to exchanges have been increasing and trade intensity has been declining,"" Philip Gradwell, an economist at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk.

Said Vivian Brodie, a contemporary art specialist at the auction house: “This is Christie’s first time presenting a work that explores crypto culture at auction and, as ever, we are very excited to welcome new audiences and collecting communities across the globe to Christie’s.”    Read more: As Museums Go Dark, Crypto Art Finds Its Frame",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | BNB,Jaspreet Kalra,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/23/christies-to-auction-bitcoin-inspired-artwork-associated-non-fungible-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6fbb8511afc8189ccac59f2e19c4d84217e7803a-1500x908.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432725,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Bh,1600860621,Robinhood Raises Cool $660M in Extended Funding Round,"Unicorn trading app Robinhood has taken over $600 million in an extended funding round as it rides the summer's retail trading wave.    Reuters reported Wednesday that Robinhood had raised a total of $660 million in its latest Series G round.  The trading app, which lists some cryptocurrencies, took commits from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia, Ribbit Capital, 9Yards Capital, and D1 Capital Partners.  The round had originally raised $460 million, but was extended when D1 Capital offered to invest a further $200 million.  That last-minute commit has taken Robinhood's valuation upwards of $11.7 billion, a spokesperson told Reuters.  The funding will be used to support core products and roll out a cash management and recurring investment feature.  Robinhood said it will also improve its customer experience after a year with a number of outages – the latest being earlier this month – that have rendered the app temporarily unusable.  Retail-orientated platforms like Robinhood have enjoyed a surge of usage during the pandemic as people working from home have piled into stocks betting on a quick market recovery.  Some have accused Robinhood of failing to protect its customers by offering complex products to amateurs.  A 20-year-old student committed suicide in June after thinking he had got himself into more than $700,000 worth of debt from trading sophisticated options.  It later transpired the negative balance was a temporary blip before the contract executed.  Still, Wednesday's raise shows finance apps are thriving as the next generation of unicorns.  Earlier this year, digital bank Revolut raised $500 million in a Series D, taking its total valuation up to $5.5 billion.

42432728,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Jh,1600858838,"Bitcoin Market Weakening After Macro-Based Sell-Off, On-Chain Data Suggests","Key bitcoin (BTC) on-chain metrics have flipped bearish this week, suggesting the top cryptocurrency by market cap may extend its recent price losses in the short term.    On Tuesday, the net inflow of bitcoin to exchanges (measured by the total change in exchange balances) was 36,800 BTC, according to data source Chainalysis.  That's the biggest single-day rise since the markets crash on March 12 sent prices to a 2020 low.  ""Since Sept. 20, the net daily inflow of bitcoins to exchanges have been increasing and trade intensity has been declining,"" Philip Gradwell, an economist at Chainalysis, told CoinDesk.  This, he said, ""indicates a weakening market.""  The uptick in net inflows represents an increase in selling pressure, since investors typically move coins from their wallets to exchanges when they see a possible need to liquidate their holdings.  Further, bitcoin's trade intensity, which measures the number of times an inflowing coin is traded, fell to a one-year low of 1.75 on Tuesday.  That's a sign there were not enough buyers to absorb the spiking inflow of coins.  Trade intensity has declined from 4.93 to 1.75 in the last three days.  ""There is a lot of inventory building on exchanges and fewer buyers willing to trade. These conditions tend to lead to price declines,"" Gradwell said.  Long-term bull bias intact  Bitcoin fell by over 4.5% on Monday as investors bought the safe-haven U.S. dollar, but sold equities, gold and other fiat currencies on renewed coronavirus concerns.  The drop set the stage for a continuation of the pullback from August highs above $12,400, according to the technical charts.  Immediate supports are seen at $10,000 and $9,868 (Sept. 8 low).  However, while bitcoin may suffer deeper declines in the short-term, the overall bias remains bullish.  ""We are still above $10,000, only the third time bitcoin has maintained this price level for multiple weeks, and long-term investors are buying bitcoin in increasing amounts,"" Gradwell noted.  The options market is also showing bullish bias on the longer time frames.  The three- and six-month put-call skews remain below zero, a sign that bullish call options are drawing higher demand or prices compared to bearish put options.  At press time, bitcoin is trading near $10,477, up slightly on the day, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

DeFi Pulse said on Twitter late Tuesday night that it had identified and fixed a ""previously undetected issue.""  Although the analytics site didn't go into specifics into what the issue was, it said it had ""backfilled historical data"" and that total value locked (TVL) in DeFi had actually exceeded a record $13.2 billion on September 18.  Founded in 2019, DeFi Pulse is the primary data site for the decentralized finance space.  Monthly web traffic has surged from 95,000 in May to well over 650,000 by August, according to SimilarWeb.  ""Due to the importance of this milestone to our community, we're thoroughly reviewing the backfilled data (i.e. crossing $13B TVL) in order to ensure it is 100% accurate,"" DeFi Pulse said in a follow-up tweet.  TVL represents the dollar amount of tokens locked in protocols and is one of the most popular metrics for assessing the size and popularity of the DeFi space.  The past week saw a precipitous drop in TVL on DeFi Pulse, falling from the all-time high figure on September 18 to just above $6 billion earlier this week.  Still, Tuesday's decision is a substantial edit. Archived versions of DeFi Pulse from September 18 show TVL at $9.1 billion – $4 billion below the revised figure.  Since the start of 2020, TVL has increased from roughly $675 million to $8.3 billion at press time.

42432717,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO14vh,1600848109,"DeFi Angels, VC Firms Back $2M Round for Data Provider Dune Analytics","Ethereum data firm Dune Analytics, which has stood out from the pack for its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, has raised $2 million from a mix of seasoned crypto investors and DeFi angels.      Announced Wednesday, the seed round was led by Dragonfly Capital and included Multicoin Capital, Coinbase Ventures and Digital Currency Group (the owner of CoinDesk).      The list of angel investors in the round included the likes of Compound’s Calvin Liu, Matteo Leibowitz of Uniswap and Aave founder Stani Kulechov. Yearn creator Andre Cronje, who also participated in the round via a non-dilutive grant, said for the record that “Dune has been a lifesaver.”      Fredrik Haga, Dune Analytics CEO and co-founder, said Cronje of Yearn didn't want a stake, but simply wanted to support the project. “That was pretty amazing,” Haga said. “I think that type of gratitude and support with no strings attached is amazing. I think you wouldn’t find that in any other industry.”      The Dune Analytics team, based in Oslo, Norway, attributed its success to being open and community-driven.      “It’s kind of like a GitHub-type of product where you have collaboration built-in, but it also has more of an end-to-end product experience where you can create charts and dashboards,” Haga said of his firm’s flagship offering. “We give people access to the whole dataset and they can build on each other and instantly share what they’re doing. I think that offers powerful insights and details into how these systems operate.”      Armed with the new funding, Dune will be making the service easier for users to interact with each other and lowering the bar a little to engage more with non-technical users.      “There’s so much low-hanging fruit that we can grab, it’s great to have the bandwidth to do it,” Haga said.      In addition, the two-man team of Haga and co-founder Mats Julian Olsen will be hiring more staffers across Europe to work remotely and help deal with the thousands of analytics calls being fielded and a 10% growth in visits to the website each week.      “It’s been quite crazy,” Haga said of DeFi’s accelerating insanity. “We try to catch enough sleep but otherwise it’s pretty much around the clock.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | UNI,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/23/defi-angels-vc-firms-back-2m-round-for-data-provider-dune-analytics,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06b074423c5f5b9cc07e993cedbab97f5bd6ab09-1500x1127.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432727,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO15Fh,1600848029,Crypto Hedge Fund Looks for $50M to Buy DeFi Tokens Amid Market Pullback,"The cryptocurrency money manager Panxora seeks to raise up to $50 million for a new hedge fund to buy digital tokens associated with the fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.      DeFi is a segment of the blockchain industry consisting of automated lending and trading platforms that aim eventually to displace banks and Wall Street firms. But in a sign of just how fast-moving and fickle digital-asset markets can be, the new fundraising effort is getting underway just as prices are tumbling for some of the leading DeFi projects, including Yearn.Finance and Aave.      “This has got the potential to really change the way finance is carried out,” Panxora CEO Gavin Smith said in an interview.      DeFi projects, often referred to as protocols and mostly built atop the Ethereum blockchain, have soared in popularity this year. It has been fueled by the “yield farming” craze that encourages crypto traders to sock digital assets into the trading and lending systems in pursuit of high interest rates, token rewards and fast gains. Dollar-linked tokens known as stablecoins can fetch annualized rates up to 20% through Yearn.Finance, versus 0.01% for a savings account with JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank.      Collateral locked into DeFi projects surged to $13 billion earlier this month, according to DeFi Pulse, a 20-fold increase since the start of the year. Big cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have rushed to cash in on the trend, listing DeFi tokens while acknowledging that a growing share of market volumes might eventually migrate to decentralized trading platforms.      Read more: Coinbase Pro Lists Uniswap’s New Token Just Hours After Launch      But just in the past week, the trend has reversed; total collateral in the systems has declined to about $9.5 billion. And as prices tumbled for bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, and ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, DeFi-affiliated tokens fell even harder.      Aave, a decentralized lender, saw its LEND tokens fall by 12% during the seven days through Tuesday, according to Messari, a cryptocurrency data firm. OMG’s OMG tokens have plummeted 54%, while Yearn.Finance’s YFI tokens are down 29%.      It’s been “an absolute bloodbath,” Messari analysts wrote Tuesday in their daily newsletter. “DeFi’s casino summer could be coming to an end.”      Cryptocurrency analysts say DeFi systems are likely to grow over the long term, though short-term risks are high in the nascent market, and many of the digital tokens are so new that they can be difficult or even impossible to value using anything resembling traditional financial analysis.      Read more: Supply of Tokenized Bitcoin on Ethereum Now Tops $1.1B: Here’s Why      Chainlink, a so-called blockchain ""oracle"" that supplies price feeds to decentralized protocols, is the top-performing digital asset this year among those with a market value of at least $1 billion, climbing more than fourfold in 2020. And that's after a 45% decline just this month.      ""We expect the market to be volatile in the early years,"" Smith said. ""While there is great potential there will inevitably be setbacks along the way.""      Panxora’s new hedge fund, based in the Cayman Islands and scheduled to start trading on Nov. 2, will primarily buy tokens listed on big centralized cryptocurrency exchanges rather than from the roster of decentralized, automated exchanges like assembled by DeFi developers.      Smith, a former metals-pricing analyst for the Singaporean commodities-trading firm Trafigura, says that’s primarily because few if any decentralized exchanges can guarantee sufficient compliance with anti-money-laundering rules, and also because a token listing from an exchange theoretically implies some level of vetting.      “We have to offer it as a conventional hedge fund that invests in these protocols,” Smith said.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/09/23/crypto-hedge-fund-looks-for-50m-to-buy-defi-tokens-amid-market-pullback,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/942e02ecd2e23d4db4e959815bc95cfd1668a0f0-1450x816.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users will be rewarded with LINK by connecting their accounts to its three mobile apps, including LINE Pay for remittance and settlement, LINE Securities for personal investment and LINE Score for credit evaluation, CoinDesk Japan reported on Sept. 19.  The reward program is part of LINE’s effort to promote its blockchain initiative. In 2018, the company created an in-house lab to develop decentralized applications (dapps) based on its patented LINE Blockchain.  It launched its digital asset wallet and a development platform for dapp developers in August.  The program started on Sept. 18. Under the plan, 10,000 users who have LINE family credit cards issued by LINE Pay will receive 2,000 yen ($19.6) worth of LINK tokens, while LINE Securities users will get up to 500 yen ($4.76) worth of tokens by opening an account and completing a questionnaire. LINE Securities was started in collaboration with Nomura Holdings, one of the largest stock brokerages in Japan.  Users can convert the tokens into fiat currency by the LINE's crypto asset trading service Bitmax, where they need to open an account to process such transactions.  The company aims to encourage its users to participate in the token economy in which more people would trade or use the LINK token as a way of payment and increase its utility.  Other messaging app companies are also developing their own native tokens to leverage their large user bases. Kik and Telegram have also made efforts to launch tokens on a blockchain.",POSITIVE,LINK,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | LINK | MINING,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/09/23/messaging-giant-line-launches-token-reward-program,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7acebde7525043a47e84a2196affb6a98c491ca6-1500x949.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42432721,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyO155h,1600821002,"Origin Debuts OUSD, a Stablecoin That Works Like a Savings Account","Peer-to-peer commerce company Origin is announcing Origin Dollars, or OUSD, a stablecoin whose reserves leverage decentralized finance (DeFi) so that balances grow wherever it resides, no staking or account required.      ""One thing we've all seen in DeFi is a much smaller audience gets it. The barrier to entry is much higher,"" Matthew Liu, Origin's cofounder, told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""We want to make DeFi much more accessible.""      OUSD will be backed one-for-one by the three big stablecoins on Ethereum: Tether's USDT, Circle and Coinbase's USDC and MakerDAO's DAI. Users can mint OUSD by depositing any of those three into Origin's new app, or they can just buy it on Uniswap. Either way, the OUSD will just start growing in their wallet, no further action needed.      ""Multiple times a day you should be able to see your balance increase,"" Origin co-founder Josh Fraser told CoinDesk.      On the backend, Origin will take deposits and start yield farming them in different protocols, starting with the DeFi money market Compound. Returns will be driven back into OUSD, minting more OUSD that will be distributed proportionally to all the wallets that have it. The company will be able to further boost yield by taking any tokens earned through liquidity mining, converting it to one of the three stablecoins and supplying that to the pool as well.      As of this writing, those three coins have an annual yield on Compound of between 0.5% and just under 3%, though that does not factor in liquidity mining, which can be tough to calculate.      Read more: Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive      To start, the team expects returns to be in the single digits as its Compound deposits earn both yield and fresh COMP; other pools will be added as OUSD grows.      Origin's three initial strategies are yields on deposits for lending, fees in automated market makers and growth-token mining.      To get OUSD started, ""as a company, we'll put in probably a few hundred thousand,"" Fraser said. ""As time passes and we feel more confident we'll put in millions of dollars.""      He said the firm is also talking to different entities about adding to the pool and minting additional OUSD.    On-brand OUSD    Origin raised $3 million in a round led by Pantera in 2017 and then sold $6.6 million worth of its OGN token in a sale on Coinlist in 2018. Aimed at disrupting companies it describes as unfairly rent-seeking (such as Airbnb), OGN is used to incentivize people to switch, fully participate in the platform and entice others to join.      So why is a company designed around making it easy for people to set up shops where buyers and sellers interact directly creating a new stablecoin?      Liu argued that OUSD fits into Origin's larger vision of facilitating peer-to-peer commerce, by removing any friction between earning and spending. OUSD will also be integrated into all the stores in Origin's DShop, its ecommerce platform.      Read more: Origin Token to Raise $6 Million in CoinList Investor ICO      As noted in the OUSD announcement post, ""For merchants that have traditionally been skeptical of receiving cryptocurrency payments, being able to accept a yield-bearing instrument that beats traditional savings accounts is a powerful motivator.""      It should be acknowleged that there is risk here. First, the smart contracts have not been formally audited yet, as mentioned in the announcement post, but one is planned.      If Origin ever invested in a pool that somehow went south, such as through a hack or a fatal error, then it would have to remove OUSD from circulation, but that's why it's starting with Compound and expanding cautiously.      Liu is confident that OUSD should get to double-digit yields soon, the firm just needs to grow the pool so it can cordon off some of the ""more exotic strategies"" into smaller pools, he explained. Origin's yield strategies will soon expand from Compound to projects like Aave and dYdX, moving on to Balancer and others shortly thereafter, much as Yearn.Finance was built early on to find the best mix of places to store a set of stablecoins.      But OUSD is also quite different from Yearn. ""It's never going to be the highest yield available because we are targeting more around its safety,"" Liu said.",POSITIVE,USDT | DAI | USDC,BUSINESS | MINING | USDT | DAI | USDC,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/09/23/origin-debuts-ousd-a-stablecoin-that-works-like-a-savings-account,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f171fe4b7126d98adb7367ac45cce9483a8f98e-1900x983.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
