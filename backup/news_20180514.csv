42380676,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuiP,1526338226,Joe Lubin and Jimmy Song Make Bitcoin Bet Over Blockchain 'Magic Dust',"Two of the cryptocurrency world's most outspoken figures are putting their money where their mouths are.  Joe Lubin, the founder of the ethereum startup studio Consensys, and Jimmy Song, a partner at Blockchain Capital, struck a handshake bet in front of an audience of hundreds, perhaps thousands, at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York City on Monday.  The exact terms of the bet have not yet been sorted out – that will happen on Twitter, the participants said. But the broad outlines emerged on stage.  Lubin bet Song ""any amount of bitcoin"" that five years in the future, the blockchain space will include some number of applications – perhaps five – that have earned a yet-to-be-defined number of users.  Bitcoin maximalist Song took the bet.  To explain how things came to a head, it's necessary to back up about 20 minutes. Amber Baldet, former blockchain program lead at JPMorgan, had unveiled her new project Clovyr, a decentralized app (or dapp) store that gives users access to projects tied to both public and permissioned, more enterprise-focused blockchain networks.  She then brought Song and Lubin onstage for a conversation that immediately caught fire, with Baldet asking what Song thought about Clovyr.  His reaction was brutal: ""I didn't see anything other than buzzwords.""  The reason, he argued, was an insurmountable disconnect between centralized enterprises and supposedly decentralized applications, which Song dismissed as ""magical blockchain dust.""  A back-and-forth among Baldet, Lubin and Song ensued. Lubin sarcastically predicted that the next five years of cryptocurrency innovation would see nothing but ""bitcoin 1.0."" Song doubled down, saying ""I don't really see much of this stuff gaining much traction."" Bitcoin, he argued, is ""the real innovation here.""  So, Lubin issued a challenge: ""I'll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong.""  For now, the number of bitcoin is unknown, as are other terms of the bet. But Song accepted the wager, and Lubin tweeted at Song shortly afterward:    Well that was fun. I’ll be in touch @jimmysong. pic.twitter.com/HCMg0htspC        — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) May 14, 2018    Image by David Floyd for CoinDesk",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH,David Floyd,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/14/joe-lubin-and-jimmy-song-make-bitcoin-bet-over-blockchain-magic-dust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ce3e5d0405ca151cd194de4a00283b3a8cfa881e-1200x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42380678,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yukv,1526335252,Crypto Self-Governance Touted as Solution to Regulatory 'Mess',"The question of whether self-regulation will help solve some of the cryptocurrency industry's problems was on full display Monday during CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference.  Part of the problem, according to panelist Gary DeWaal, a legal expert who focuses on financial services, is that existing rules as they relate to the tech are ""an absolute mess."" And this situation, he contended, isn't going away anytime soon.  DeWaal remarked:  ""The CFTC budget has got cut this year. Even if it wants to regulate cryptocurrencies, it may not have enough resources from Congress to do so.""  DeWaal was seemingly commenting on an opening remark made in an earlier talk by Brian Quintenz, a commissioner from the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). During remarks on Monday, Quintenz said that any decision on whether ethereum's ether should be regulated as a currency – a hot topic in recent weeks – ""needs to be made carefully and coordinated.""  ""The last thing we want to see is regulators take different views,"" Quintenz said.  In this context, DeWaal said that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) can play a role in helping regulators test the waters ahead of clearer regulatory frameworks.  ""One critical role of SROs ... is in elevating the reputation of regulation, as it will set a standard that will hopefully be adopted by regulators in the future,"" he said.  Echoing that point, Yuzo Kano, the chief executive officer of the Japanese exchange bitFlyer, said that efforts taken by Japanese cryptocurrency SROs had ultimately paved the way to the formal roll-out of a financial registration law launched by the country's Financial Services Agency (FSA) in 2017.  ""We initiated an SRO back in 2014 ... to impose the know-your-customer (KYC) rule for exchanges. Some operators did want to take part, but some didn't. What we did was to convince these operators to include KYC all together to protect the market,"" Kano said.  Indeed, following a notable hack in January that saw some $530 million-worth of NEM tokens from the Japanese exchange Coincheck, crypto trading platforms in the country have again formed an SRO that works closely with the FSA to help bring about the secure and stable growth of the market.  On the other hand, regulators in other countries are moving more quickly in developing their cryptocurrency and blockchain rules.  Albert Isola from the government of Gibraltar said authorities there are using a multi-pronged approach: ""businesses have to be quality players; there have to be regulations; and their management has to be inside Gibraltar.""  The same solution may not be applicable everywhere, however – DeWaal argued he ""absolutely opposed to the idea to copycat regulations from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.""  He concluded:  ""What we need is high-level principle of conduct to allow individual jurisdictions to keep their local initiative adapted to their local environment and existing legal frameworks.""

42380674,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuft,1526332207,GoTenna Launches a Bitcoin Wallet That Works Without the Internet,"If James Bond needed to use bitcoin on a secret mission in the jungle, he probably couldn’t drop by a Starbucks to use the wifi.  Since internet connections aren’t always available, reliable or private, cryptocurrency users need alternative ways to connect to the network. So the New York-based startup goTenna, founded in 2012 by Brazilian siblings Daniela and Jorge Perdomo, is partnering with Samourai Wallet to launch an Android app this summer that allows users to send bitcoin payments without an internet connection.  Announced Monday, the txTenna app will enable users to sync up their mobile with a goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, then toggle the wallet app’s settings to transact offline and send the bitcoin.  “You need to be able to spend your bitcoin even in disaster areas,” goTenna engineer Richard Myers told CoinDesk, citing the Perdomo siblings’ recent work in Puerto Rico, where goTenna devices helped people reconnect after Hurricane Maria. “As long as you have a way to charge your phone, you can be up and meshed and communicating.”  The signal needs to be within roughly a mile of another goTenna device to relay the message across the mesh network, a decades-old system for using the internet without wifi or a landline. So far, goTenna has sold more than 100,000 devices that let users tap into the mesh network.  If the offline bitcoin user is within a mile of another active device, the transaction could bounce across the mesh until it reaches a user with an internet connection.  “It offers an alternative that is more censorship-resistant,” Myers said, adding:  “It’s going to obscure who you are and where you’re at when making these transactions. So that’s a big privacy advantage there.”  This system uses a free, unlicensed radio frequency, and it isn’t the first partnership to explore such potential for cryptocurrency networks.  It takes a village  Stepping back, a variety of projects since the Cold War have used relatively cheap and mobile radio setups to broadcast across firewalls and oceans.  Last year, renowned cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou published a proposal detailing how weak-signal radio transmissions could help boost security and the diversity of connections across the bitcoin network.  Then, in December, after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed ""net neutrality,"" fans of ethereum, the world’s second most popular blockchain network, started flocking to mesh network technology meetups.  When net neutrality rules expire next month, internet service providers will no longer be barred from favoring or blocking specific websites and communities. It's an opportune moment for censorship-resistant tools for bitcoin transactions.  Perhaps the most important aspect of txTenna is that the cryptocurrency wallet will be an open source project.  Indeed, it was Samourai Wallet’s open source communication tools on Github that first inspired goTenna’s team to reach out to the bitcoin startup. The same txTenna code could theoretically be applied to iOS wallet applications as well.  As Myers explained:  “It absolutely could work with any software wallet and they [Samourai Wallet developers] are not writing it specifically for the Samourai wallet anyway. It will be something any wallet provider could send transactions through.”  Image of Daniela and Jorge Perdomo with goTenna devices via goTenna",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/14/gotenna-launches-a-bitcoin-wallet-that-works-without-the-internet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/61f4a45b2aced1ff4e0865e86b0eff45b0ead39e-1500x843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42380677,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yumB,1526331025,AlphaPoint Launches Framework for Real Estate Blockchain Tokens,"Crypto services firm AlphaPoint unveiled a new framework Monday aimed at supporting the launch of blockchain tokens backed by regulated assets.  Tokenized registered securities continue to be a hot topic as doubts swirl around the retail variety, and there have been a number of efforts seeking to put real estate on the blockchain. To that end, AlphaPoint has launched its Regulated Asset Backed Token (RABT) framework at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York City.  According to the company, it has developed software that allows a token to be freely traded while also ensuring compliance with securities laws (such as, for example, selling a security token solely to accredited investors who live in the United States). The idea is to use blockchain as a conduit for introducing more liquidity into the real estate market.  A longstanding real estate and private equity firm, Muirfield Investment Partners, has joined with AlphaPoint in an effort to offer its investors a more easily tradeable way to participate in the property market.  ""As a technology company and infrastructure providers, we can blend both public blockchains and the tokenization of securities and assets of any type,"" Igor Telyatnikov, AlphaPoint's chief operating officer, told CoinDesk, adding:  ""There are huge penalties of the illiquidity discount, real estate being one of them.""  Thomas J. Zaccagnino, Muirfield's founder, explained that due to their illiquidity, real estate funds tend to be highly structured in ways that might not be ideal.  While it is generally a profitable asset class over time, it can be too rigid, he contended – often, the funds have defined ""lifespans"" within which they operate.  That's fine in normal times, but if your fund hits its deadline to exit – and it just happens to be 2008, or shortly after the US real estate market collapsed – that might not be the right time to sell for your investors.  He hopes that tokenizing real estate will allow for a ""far more innovative and profitable investment vehicle.""  AlphaPoint's plan is to see everything go on the blockchain. The actual asset won't be on paper and tokenized, but that documentation will be stored using the tech. Further, it can use software to pay out dividends, if those are part of the deal, and to ensure that assets aren't transferred to people they shouldn't be.  ""We can use trusted execution environments and oracles to govern what addresses these assets can be moved to and from and be able to apply the rules and smart logic onto a public blockchain or private blockchain,"" Telyatnikov said.

42380666,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuZb,1526329853,Amber Baldet’s New Startup Is a Blockchain Dapp Store,"Decentralized application development is harder than it should be.  That’s the guiding framework behind Clovyr, a new startup launched by two former JPMorgan blockchain employees that seeks to provide a new layer of enterprise-driven services between blockchains and user-facing applications.  Founded by CoinDesk’s ""Most Influential"" finalist Amber Baldet and cryptographer Patrick Mylund Nielsen, the mystery startup has been a topic of speculation since Baldet announced her departure from the investment bank last month.  Finally revealed at Consensus 2018 in New York today, Clovyr is a decentralized application store that will host a selection of well-vetted applications alongside some in-house developer tooling designed to simplify application development for enterprises.  Maintaining a “blockchain agnostic” approach to application design, Clovyr will initially provide tooling to build on both public and enterprise versions of ethereum, specifically the Quorum, Geth and Parity clients.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Baldet hinted that bitcoin-facing applications will also be possible, and further blockchain integrations may be added to the decentralized collection in future.  In a public beta planned to launch later this year, the team intend to provide an initial development framework for enterprises looking to build on the tech, as well as other potential novelties such as tooling for data analysis on private datasets – something that Baldet anticipates will be a popular product.  “Right now there’s no way to keep data private at its point of origin and also enable big data analytics, but there could be,” Nielsen said in a press release.  Going forward, the team plans to launch a full tech stack for privacy-protecting decentralized application design, that would achieve compliance with upcoming data protection law, the GDPR.  Baldet told CoinDesk:  “We’re trying to empower people to build things themselves.”  Connecting the dots  According to the team, while the technology is there, there's a gap in application design that has been stifling innovation across the board.  Companies looking to integrate decentralized tooling are faced with the confusion of digging through open-source development platforms.  ""It's so easy to miss useful new tools,"" Baldet said.  On Clovyr, developers and enterprises won't need to go through the process of building the tooling from scratch that may have already been executed.  ""We’re doing all that heavy lifting so they can accelerate and iterate faster,"" Baldet told CoinDesk.  The application store will also enable the development of hybrid blockchain formats, such as enterprise chains that can link up to public network's to publish attestations or transactions.  According to Baldet, the latter will beneficial to enterprise looking for the scalability and control of a permissioned system combined with the security parameters of a public blockchain.  But it will feedback into the public ecosystem as well, Baldet said.  ""We're bringing modern software development lifecycle practices to decentralized applications so people can save their time and resources, and finder a broader audience for their big idea,"" she told CoinDesk.  In the future, Baldet expects that the public and enterprise-focused applications will blur into a much more user-orientated experience.  Rather than evaluating tools based on their creators, Baldet said, ""the users will start asking, does it do what I need it to do and does it meet my personal requirement?""  At the same time, businesses have a much clearer resource to work from in order to enter the industry. Baldet explained:  ""And those corporates, all they need to do is onboard Clovyr then they can experiment across the entire field of apps and mash stuff up. So that’s what it will do, it’s good for everyone.""  Data-driven privacy  The beta version of Clovyr will be a collection of developer tooling.  ""First thing we need to do is get the nuts and bolts of a workable developer framework out there,"" Baldet said.  Going forward, Baldet and Nielsen's experience in building J.P. Morgan's Quorum, which contains multiple privacy-enforcing layers, will result in tools that can help people build in a way that protects user data.  ""We want to provide very clear privacy-preserving stacks [that] we recommend you go with if you don't know where to start,"" Baldet said.  While the team has yet to fully expand on what such a privacy-preserving system would look like, Baldet hinted that such applications should be more conservative about what information is shared on-chain, and suggested using the shared ledger merely as a coordination device.  Plus, Baldet and Nielsen both hinted that such privacy-preserving features could come with data-analysis capabilities as well.  Nielsen told CoinDesk:  “Currently privacy is seen as incompatible with data-driven insight, but that doesn’t have to be the case.”  Notably, the startup's applications intend to provide compliancy for the GDPR, a strict data-protection law that comes into force in Europe this month that some have worried may cause problems for public blockchain data.

42380675,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuh9,1526328009,Grappling with Crypto Miners' Existential Question: ASICs or GPUs?,"Cryptocurrencies use proof-of-work to maximize security. Or was it decentralization?  Both of these goals are close to the hearts of the cryptocurrency community at large, but they're especially important to the miners whose hardware rigs perform that proof-of-work: the power-hungry computations used to update the blockchains of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.  Unfortunately, decentralization and security can be a tradeoff – one that's at the center of the sometimes-acrimonious debate over application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs.  At a panel held Monday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 event, three big names in cryptocurrency mining came to grips with this debate, discussing ASICs' implications for security and decentralization. The discussion often came back to role of governments, sometimes as partners, other times as adversaries.  ASICs are custom-built computer chips used to mine cryptocurrencies hyper-efficiently. When an ASIC is developed to mine a specific coin, it tends to drive graphics processing units (GPUs), used by many small-scale miners, out of the mining market.  For some, including panelist Marco Streng, CEO of Genesis mining, that's a problem. ""GPUs are the most decentralized mining hardware we have on the planet,"" he said at the event. Part of the reason is that GPUs are cheaper, requiring less of a sunk-cost investment to launch a mining operation.  For Gideon Powell, CEO of Autonomous Crypto Corp, Streng has a point. ""Yes, [ASICs] are not as decentralized,"" he said. But he added, ""I like ASICs, they're much more secure than GPUs.""  Even though bitcoin mining has been completely dominated by ASIC miners for several years, Powell is not concerned:  ""I don't see the centralization issue going forward being a huge issue for bitcoin at all.""  The pair's disagreement seems to come down to which issue they perceive as being more of a threat. While Streng worried about concentration of mining power in fewer hands, Powell – who said he was ""from the libertarian-anarchist wing"" of the cryptocurrency space – was more concerned with hostility from governments.  ""Governments could give [GPU miners] a run for their money with 51 percent attacks,"" Powell said, referring to a brute-force attack on a blockchain, in which the attacker amasses more computing power than all honest participants on the network. ""In terms of bitcoin,"" he continued, ""it would be extremely challenging.""  Streng is not quite as skeptical of governments. He even brought up the possibility of working with them, providing them with GPU cloud mining to power their blockchain networks.  ""If they want to use proof-of-work consensus, which is the only proven way so far, they'll need computing power,"" Streng said.  In any case, Streng continued, GPUs provide a practical benefit when it comes to the kind of anti-ASIC hard forks some in the zcash and ethereum communities are pushing for. ""You're more flexible,"" he said.

The Aion network has been built to foster interoperability across blockchains. One of the key tools to this functionality is the network's ""token bridge,"" which is designed to allow tokens to move between chains.  The first token bridge will work between the Aion network and ethereum, on which its token currently operates.  Rather than using a smart contract to hold copies of tokens, as pairs of networks like Kik's new chain and ethereum will do, Nuco has proposed actually destroying tokens as they move – put simply, so there really is only one token at a time.  According to Matt Spoke, CEO of Nuco – the company founded by Deloitte alums that's behind Aion – the bridge then ""issues an AION [token] on the other side.""  ""It's a micro-network, it's a collection of nodes that's decentralized, there's multiple participants, and those other nodes on the network are acting honestly, but that bridge is responsible for agreeing they witnessed the event,"" Spoke went on to say. ""That's the function that we built in.""  Ethereum will come first, according to Spoke, but the plan is to extend it across all blockchains.  ""The design of the bridge is going to get more and more generic over time. We want that to communicate with any other blockchain,"" he told CoinDesk.  The token bridge is Aion's next step on its roadmap, following the launch of its mainnet at the end of April.  ""Even in the enterprise context, interoperability, every one of their RFPs [request for proposals] has an interoperability requirement ... Hyperledger networks can all talk to each other and they're all private,"" Spoke pointed out. ""But there's not a common solution for a cross between protocols.""

42380664,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuVp,1526325326,"EU, US Lawmakers Tout 'Sandbox' Approach for Blockchain Development","International lawmakers speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference today argued that regulatory ""sandboxes"" may offer the best approach for blockchain innovation in the absence of official guidance.  Speaking at a panel discussion on global jurisdictions, U.S. House Representative David Schweikert said that, while there's as yet no fully clear relegation in place in the U.S. to govern cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, that may not necessarily be a bad thing.  He told the audience:  ""One of the greatest concerns now in Congress is crippling innovation with regulation – so the 'fog' we are in now may actually be beneficial.""  The lawmaker continued to explain that his own state of Arizona is already taking a sandbox approach, which allows applications of innovations including blockchain technology to be experimented with in a supervised environment with trusted business partners.  Indeed, lawmakers in Arizona notably brought a bill into effect as recently as April that would allow enterprises in the state to store their information in a blockchain-based system, potentially opening up the opportunity to boost a wider adoption of the tech.  Meanwhile, the situation on the European continent may be slightly different when it comes to advancing blockchain technology, although it is still eyeing the potential introduction of a sandbox approach in the future.  Also joining the penal discussion with Schweikert was Eva Kaili, Member of the European Parliament. Sharing her experience of working with EU legislators on advancing blockchain technology, she said ""in the next few years we'll have harmonization, sandboxes and regulation.""  However, one obstacle, as Kaili explained, comes down to EU lawmakers' lack of knowledge on the subject of blockchain.  ""It's really difficult to educate every politician on blockchain technology ... And plus we don't have too many scientists within the European Parliament,"" Kaili said.  Despite the difficulties, the MEP continued, the EU is moving to adopt the technology to benefit the region:  ""We are still getting more member states to join our effort ... to remove frictions and costs to ensure to blockchain technology is offering us great solutions.""  To that end, also in April, a group of 22 EU nations jointly formed a blockchain partnership under the European Commission to exchange information on the technology in a bid to create opportunities for adopting blockchain applications across the EU-wide single market.

42380680,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yunR,1526323723,Deloitte Veterans Are Launching a Tokenized Blockchain for Supply Chain,"Former members of Deloitte's blockchain team are joining a new startup that seeks to bring a tokenized blockchain protocol to one of the world's most inefficient markets.  Announced Monday, a startup called Citizens Reserve is coming out of stealth, revealing it has hired former Deloitte global blockchain leader Eric Piscini, as well as at least two other former members of the firm's blockchain division, to its initial 32-person team.  Not short on ambition, Citizens Reserve is seeking to launch a permissioned blockchain protocol called zerv that the startup hopes will become an ""operating system for supply chain.""  ""We're building a supply chain middleware that sits on top of the blockchain and gives you all the fundamental pieces of the supply chain,"" Piscini explained.  In this way, Piscini said that the company's ""zerv network"" will seek to build on top of existing blockchains like quorum and ethereum to create a technology that can match orders and track provenance on a supply chain that operates on a consortium model.  Key to this, however, will be what the company calls its ability to ""embrace blockchain"" by using the technology to offer monetary incentives. As described by Piscini, the zerv platform will feature a cryptocurrency that will be redeemable for real-world assets.  Piscini told CoinDesk:  ""The real version is that this is decentralized platform, which is very true to the blockchain. We don't want to become a centralized system.""  He went on to say that while the market will decide the value of the coin, the company plans to accumulate real-world assets and back the token in such a way that it does not fall below $0.01. The idea is the tokens could be redeemed for these assets by members.  Armed with this vision, the company is now seeking to raise millions in a private sale of its token. Though he did not disclose the total of the fundraise, Piscini said the goal is to also have a public sale of the assets in which additional funds could be raised.  Still, he was quick to note that the funds raised will not be used to fund the company itself, but rather to build and grow the zerv network.  Founded in late 2016, Citizens Reserve is led by CEO and co-founder James Bower, former CEO of US-based tablet accessory manufacturer Gamevice (formerly Wikipad). Addison McKenzie and Shannon Coble are also co-founders.  Initial details  But if Piscini was less clear about the details of the company financing, he was more open about its go-to-market strategy.  According to company materials, the defense sector will be ""the first industry"" targeted due to the fact that markets for the trade of ammunition, weapons, medical devices and more don't use any form of software today.  ""In the defense industry, the way people buy and sell is by picking up the phone,"" he said.  Still, the overall goal is that, over time, the zerv network will be used across industries including healthcare, real estate, VR and electronics. The company, he said, will provide a guarantee of the token's value, while manufacturers will broadcast these various kinds of inventory to the network.  ""If want to sell my product, I'll forecast the information I have coming up and I'll publish that on the platform. We match the order, provide the marketplace functions and the agreement will be logged on the blockchain. We don't put the individual asset on the blockchain.""  However, if the details are still coming together, Piscini is confident that the supply chain will emerge as one of the more essential blockchain use cases, though one that is perhaps being held back by models that seek to use permissioned versions of the technology.  ""When I was working at Deloitte, across all the different use cases of blockchain, the number one use case in terms of revenue and impact was supply chain,"" he said.  Piscini concluded:  ""What we want is to become the number one supply chain choice for everyrone who wants to do supply chain in the world.""

Indeed, they all agreed that action in this area is needed – otherwise, innovative startups may look to friendlier shores.  “The faster the SEC moves, the faster it will be for businesses to stay in the United States,” Gupta said.  Wood indicated that a lack of regulation was constraining would-be investment opportunities. More specifically, Wood said, she would like to see more bitcoin listings and token securities in the marketplace. At the same time, though, she's not confident that such activity will materialize in the current regulatory environment.  ""Our regulators have to get their act together really,"" she said, going on to argue:  ""We're going to see regulation mainly by prosecution.""  Jobanputra, however, argued that the intervention by agencies like the CFTC and the SEC is unlikely to solve the industry's regulatory woes.  ""It's going to be a mixture of the tech solutions as well as the rulings,"" she suggested.  The panelists also discussed their thoughts on blockchain investment opportunities. According to Jalak, both undeveloped and developed nations stand to benefit from the technology.

""Blockchain technology can be applied to create more efficiencies in the developed world as well.""

Claimed as a world first, Reuters reports, the live commercial trade finance transaction saw an export of a shipment of soybeans from Argentina to Malaysia, during which Cargill Geneva sold the goods on behalf of its Argentine arm team and Cargill Singapore received them on behalf of the Malaysian arm of the firm.  HSBC said that while other trade finance deals have been carried out using blockchain together with other technologies, the Cargill trade was the first to use a single blockchain application, the report indicates.  According to news source GTR, the transaction was carried out using a letter of credit tool within R3's distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform Corda.  The letter of credit involved was issued by HSBC, while ING served as the advising bank, and the process was slashed to 24 hours from the paper-based standard of 5–10 days. While the letter of credit was exchanged over the blockchain, while bill of lading and other transaction elements were not, the report adds.  Following the successful transaction, HSBC is focusing on more live tests and ultimately aims to promote the system for industry-wide adoption, Vivek Ramachandran, global head of innovation at HSBC Commercial Banking, told GTR.  ""We’ve still got a few more steps to do before we get to widespread adoption,"" he was quoted as saying.  The news comes after HSBC revealed its plans in February to launch several pilot programs based on existing proof-of-concept (PoC) projects.  ""Going from that PoC in 2016, we're at the tipping point of getting our customers involved in live transactions in the coming weeks and months. The technology has come a long way, we're much more comfortable with its security and scalability,"" the bank's senior innovation manager Joshua Kroeker, said at the time.

42429066,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZrh,1526312413,FedEx CEO: Adopt New Tech Like Blockchain or Be Disrupted,"“Blockchain has the potential to completely revolutionize what’s across the border.”  Speaking at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 in New York today, Fred Smith, chairman and CEO of the U.S. logistic giant FedEx, doubled down on his commitment to embracing blockchain technology as a way for the decades-old company to maintain its game in a rapidly changing digital world.  Smith explained that one major issue that the logistic and transportation industry has faced is the “massive amount of friction” in cross-border logistics, since different countries have different standards, regulations and terminologies.  He told the audience:  “For cross-border shipments, ‘trust’ is legal requirement for every transaction. What blockchain has is a potential for the first time ever to make the information available for everybody.”  As such, the FedEx chief praised the “chain of custody” that blockchain can bring to the entire logistic industry.  All this talk isn't just hot air, either – FedEx joined the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA) in February this year in a bid to explore potential blockchain applications alongside other partners within the logistic industry.  At the time, the firm also launched a pilot program to establish what data would be needed for a distributed ledger to ease disputes between customers sending and receiving goods through FedEx. The shipping giant also wants to use blockchain to store its records.  Also speaking at the panel session, Robert Carter, FedEx’s CIO and executive vice president of information services, said the firm will first explore that deployment in the freight industry, since one single ship could contain millions of transactions at the same time.  Carter commented:  “We move easily 12 million shipments a day and that more than doubles during the peak seasons. While we absolutely believe this technology is going to scale, right now it makes sense for us to do this in our freight world,”  Answering a question from the panel's host, author Don Tapscott, on how he persuaded Smith to approve the decision on blockchain exploration, Carter said, in fact, it was the other way round.  “It’s Fred that dragged me into this,” Carter said, adding:  ""The application of these custody chains ... is so critical to the information aspect. We're operating on this plane between the physical world and the digital world.”  Speaking on the importance of moving with the times as a company, Smith concluded:  ""If you are not operating at the edge of new technologies, you will surely be disrupted. If you are not willing to embrace new technologies like internet of things and blockchain to face those new threats, you are, maybe subtly, at some point ... going to extinction.""

42429069,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZxh,1526310955,St. Louis Fed President on Crypto: 'Currency Competition Is Nothing New',"James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, said Monday that cryptocurrencies ""are creating drift toward a non-uniform currency in the U.S.""  Bullard spoke on the history and economics of private currencies at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York, drawing on his work in this area. He told attendees that public and private currencies can ""coexist in equilibrium"" and even ""facilitate transactions that might not otherwise occur.""  But U.S. history shows that currency competition often causes more problems than it solves, he contended. In the 1830s, 90 percent of the currency in circulation was privately issued, with the uniform ""greenback"" only coming into use during the Civil War.  ""You would have Bank of America banknotes, Wells Fargo banknotes,"" Bullard said, but ""they all traded at a discount.""  With over 1,800 cryptocurrencies having been issued as of today, Bullard said there was a risk of drifting back towards that kind of ""chaos of exchange rates."" Consumers could find themselves having to hold multiple forms of currencies for different transactions, he said, with each trading at a different relative price – not to mention the risk that a currency tanks, taking the consumer's savings with it.  ""Currencies have to be reliable and hold their value,"" Bullard said, using the hyperinflationary Venezuelan bolivar as an example.  As for whether cryptocurrencies ""might be able to protect us from the vagaries of Venezuelan monetary policy,"" Bullard pointed to a few issues.  First, transactions using these currencies might be illegal. Ignoring that, though cryptocurrencies' monetary frameworks may not be as reliable as some proponents claim.  Bitcoin, for example, has a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoin, but ""the system can still bifurcate, creating two fixed volumes of coins."" In Bullard's opinion, problems with monetary policy are ""not mitigated by commodity-based money nor by cryptocurrencies.""  Looking ahead  Following Bullard's opening remarks, he was joined by Diane Brady, journalist and founder of dbOmnimedia, for a fireside chat. She asked if government control was the only way to guarantee a stable monetary system. Bullard replied:  ""This century, the past century it's been true. Will it always be that way? I don't know. Maybe there are technological solutions.""  For the time being, he said, cryptocurrencies aren't a threat to the dollar's dominance because of their low transaction volumes. ""The dollar's in great shape today,"" he said. ""It will stay in great shape.""  In the long term, however, the rise of cryptocurrencies could usher in something that looks like today's global monetary system. There's no single world currency, Bullard said, and exchange rates even among major currencies can be volatile.  Bullard concluded:  ""The drift to a non-uniform currency could become a serious issue for the U.S. if cryptocurrency reaches a large volume of trade.""

42429067,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZth,1526304560,New York Plans Blockchain Center to Stake Claim as Industry Hub,"It’s Blockchain Week in the Big Apple, but if city leaders have their way, New York will become more than just a nice place for the industry to visit.  Announced Monday, the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) is launching several initiatives to put the city on the map as a blockchain technology hub. Foremost among them is a plan to open a “Blockchain Center” that will both promote public awareness of the technology and facilitate conversations among industry stakeholders.  A key topic of the center’s conversations will be making the regulatory environment more attractive to innovative businesses – which will inevitably mean examining New York State’s BitLicense regulations, widely blamed for driving away startups since they took effect in 2015.  The NYCEDC also announced a competition, expected to launch in late 2018, intended to generate ideas for improving municipal services with blockchain tech. As a first step, the agency will issue a request for proposals (RFP) from organizations that want to run the contest.  Kicking off its charm offensive, over the weekend the NYCEDC, along with the non-profit GrowNYC and CoinDesk, co-sponsored a hackathon in Times Square where developers worked to come up with blockchain-based solutions for tracking the food supply chain for farmers markets around the city.  Last but not least, the agency is co-sponsoring Blockchain Week with CoinDesk. Underscoring the NYCEDC's motivation, the series of events around town will include a free job fair Wednesday at the New York Hilton Midtown, the venue for Consensus 2018.  Karen Bhatia, a vice president at the agency, said it sees the city’s major industries – finance, healthcare, media and real estate – as potential beneficiaries of blockchain.  “We’ve been looking into blockchain for probably close to a year now. We’ve been monitoring it,” Bhatia told CoinDesk. And while New York already boasts more blockchain job openings than Silicon Valley, according to analytics firm Burning Glass, she added:  “We saw an opportunity to be at the forefront of experimentation in blockchain as sustaining more of a foothold.”  A strategic industry  Taken together, these moves signal that the NYCEDC views fostering blockchain activity as a strategic play that can create thousands of jobs for New York. The NYCEDC is the city's official economic development corporation, and its board members are appointed by the mayor and other senior leaders.  For the Blockchain Center, the NYCEDC will provide $100,000 in seed funding for the first year “as a pilot test, to see what the learnings are,” Bhatia said, though she expects additional funding to be available as needed from private sources, given the amount of investment in the sector overall.  “Funding is not really the biggest issue when it comes to blockchain,” she said.  The plan is for the center to have a full-time staff, she said, though the NYCEDC is not yet sure how big it will be. The agency is looking at several potential locations, including a city-owned property at South Street Seaport.  Ideally, the center will have street frontage and be open to passersby, Bhatia explained.  “The goal of this is to be a community center where people can walk in and learn more about what blockchain is, both the public as well as people who are working on new ventures and want some sort of a roadmap for how they should proceed,” she said.  Elephant in the room  Yet the center will also likely play host to some heated discussions since another of its express goals is to get entrepreneurs and regulators to – in Bhatia’s words – “sit down and have a real discussion about how these regulations are affecting innovation and entrepreneurship in New York City.”  While federal regulators will be invited to take part, so will the New York State Department of Financial Services, which created the BitLicense.  Bhatia noted that the NYCEDC took part in a February roundtable hosted by two state senators on revisiting the controversial regulation.  And though the NYCEDC recognizes the need for regulations to protect consumers, the center will look for ways to do that without squelching startups, Bhatia said, concluding:  “We’re very well aware that the regulations are affecting blockchain companies here in New York.”  From center: New York City Mayor Bill DiBlasio, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and NYCEDC President James Patchett.

42429072,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLra3h,1526301023,Bitcoin Risks Drop Toward $8K After 3-Week Low,"Bitcoin (BTC) is on the back foot having hit three-week lows over the weekend and now risks deeper losses below $8,200, the technical charts indicate.  The cryptocurrency fell to $8,204 on Bitfinex on Saturday – the lowest level since April 19 – and was last seen changing hands at $8,365, down around 16 percent from the recent high of $9,990.  Note, the bears failed to cut through the support at $8,207 (the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) in a convincing manner on Saturday. However, the ensuing corrective rally was also short-lived: BTC failed to beat the descending 5-day moving average (MA) hurdle, seen yesterday at $8,760 and fell to a low of $8,271 today.  The price action indicates BTC is clearly not out of the woods yet and, if anything, the bear grip seems to have strengthened over the last few days.  Hourly chart  The bear flag breakdown indicated on the chart signals a continuation of the sell-off and has opened the doors to $7,300 (target as per the measured height method), although the target looks far fetched as of now. Nevertheless, the pattern does indicate scope for a drop below $8,000.  The relative strength index (RSI) is biased to the bears (below 50.00) and the 100-candle moving average (MA) and the 200-candle MA continue to slope downwards, also in favor of the bears.  Monthly chart  The chart shows the rally from the April 1 low of $6,425 ran out of steam near $10,026 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high) and the 5-month and 10-month MAs are beginning to slope downwards in favor of the bears for the first time since September 2014.  So, the BTC bulls need progress soon, else the 5-month MA will cut the 10-month MA from above (bearish crossover), confirming a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  Daily chart  The short-term trend remains bearish as indicated by the downward sloping 5-day and 10-day MAs.  This, coupled with the bearish development on the hourly and monthly charts, indicates that bitcoin will likely find acceptance below key support at $8,270 (50-day moving average) and $8,207 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to May 5 high). In such a case, bitcoin risks falling below $8,000.  View  BTC looks set to take out support at $8,207 and could then drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).  Bullish scenario: Another rebound from $8,207 and a break above $8,760 would open doors for a move back above $9,000. A daily close (as per UTC) above the 10-day MA, currently seen at $9,038 would confirm the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has ended.

42429071,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLra5h,1526299208,CoinDesk Releases Q1 2018 State of Blockchain Report,"After reaching historic highs in 2017, cryptocurrencies languished across multiple fundamental metrics in this year's first quarter.  Unease permeated the industry, mostly from regulatory uncertainty and pull-back after a year of parabolic growth.  To shed light on a tumultuous Q1, CoinDesk's latest State of Blockchain report provides a 90-plus slide analysis of some of the most significant data points.  Released Monday, the report covers public blockchains, distributed ledger technology (DLT), consortium chains, initial coin offerings (ICOs), trading and investments, and regulation. It also features the results of our 50-plus question sentiment survey, which provides insight from over 420 CoinDesk readers.  Here are six of the most important trends that defined Q1 2018:  1. Bear market for crypto    Following an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in the previous quarter, bitcoin suffered a 51% decline in Q1. Other fundamental metrics, such as transaction volume, transaction count, and exchange volume, saw similar drops.  Most altcoins mirrored this behavior and followed bitcoin down, with correlation coefficients of returns ranging from 0.7 to 0.9. The entire cryptocurrency market capitalization lost about $348 billion.  The numbers may look grim, but that didn’t show up in overall sentiment: 79 percent of the respondents to our CoinDesk Sentiment Survey thought this bear market would be short-lived.  Eighty-six percent said this was a correction after the rampant over-speculation of the prior quarter while 62 percent said that regulation was a depressing factor.  After the introduction of bitcoin futures markets at the end of Q4, we’ve seen steady growth in this activity through Q1. Both long and short positions grew – but strikingly, the shorts outnumbered the longs.  Short positions ended the quarter at about 5,000 and long positions ended at about 3,000. It appears that it's mostly pessimistic investors taking advantage of these contracts.  And this, in turn, appears to have contributed to the slump in the underlying asset.  According to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, “the new investment opportunity led to a fall in demand in the spot bitcoin market and therefore a drop in price.""  Bitcoin miners didn’t appear phased by the dips, however.  Over Q1 we saw the slope of hash rate – the amount of processing power devoted to securing the bitcoin network – diverge from market cap, instead of each moving in the same direction, as in Q4 2017. The hash rate grew 47% over the quarter with little deviation.  Bitcoin’s hash rate held strong against the competition; bitcoin cash, the cryptocurrency with the second-strongest hash rate, averaged only 12 percent of bitcoin’s hash rate over the quarter.  It’s also important to note that miners tend to take a long-term view and offer a counterpoint to short-term pessimists. Seven percent of our respondents said they learned more about miner dynamics during Q1.  Taxes were top-of-mind for many investors, with cryptocurrencies generating an estimated $70 billion in global tax revenue for 2017, based on the total gains in the market and the average of various governments' tax rates.  The tax parameters surrounding cryptocurrencies remain in flux. Thirty-one percent of survey respondents said they paid taxes on gains; however, the number of those obligated to pay taxes might be higher than those that report taxable gains.  Of U.S.-based respondents, 82 percent indicated that it wasn’t easy to understand their tax liability while 62 percent of non-U.S. based respondents said the same. These observations lend support to the theory that people (regulators included) are genuinely confused about the legal and tax status of the entire asset class.  The 20 percentage point difference in tax understanding between the U.S. and non-U.S. respondents could indicate the U.S. is failing to embrace the next generation of financial technology as competing countries consider friendlier strategies.  ICO activity remained brisk, with $6.3 billion raised in Q1. Monthly breakdowns of ICO raises show each individual month of Q1 was higher than the record amount set in December.  Telegram’s $1.7 billion ICO was a large outlier that accounted for over 25% of the funding in Q1. The next-largest ICO in this period was Dragon’s $320 million offering. Without Telegram, the tally for March would have been below December's.  Yet larger ICO raises appear to be a growing trend. The average raise amount almost doubled from Q4 to Q1, from $16 million to $31 million. The distribution of ICOs shifted towards larger raise amounts and fewer total deals.  The number of ICOs declined each month from December’s high of 78, except for a slight uptick in March. While the reduction in the number of ICOs might seem like a bearish signal, 40% of survey respondents participated in an ICO, up from 30% last quarter.  Transaction fees on the bitcoin network dropped from drastic highs set by the feverish demand of Q4 2017, when on some days fees averaged $40. Over Q1, fees settled on an average of $9.49 per transaction.  Most other cryptocurrencies saw 60 to 90 percent declines in fees as well, but in absolute numbers, they were never so high prior to Q1.  High fees might have discouraged users from transacting, but it’s unusual to see fees come down and still see declines in transaction counts. Fee levels are also a barometer of demand. As more people bought into cryptocurrencies in Q4, we saw increases in fees. So a reduction in fees could imply that demand is shrinking.  There are solutions to help mitigate fees further, most notably the lightning network, which made important strides in the first quarter and shows promise as a stable, second-layer solution for frequent and smaller transactions.  Seventy-eight percent of our respondents considered lightning a positive development and look forward to using it. And while 21 percent suggest lightning will centralize bitcoin more, the other 79 percent think there will be no change or less centralization because of it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Peter Ryan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/14/coindesk-releases-q1-2018-state-of-blockchain-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/207b6380faede0bdbfe7ad446b20cbc4a0cc060a-2560x2444.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429063,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZlh,1526294931,IoT Startup Filament Hits Milestone for Blockchain Hardware,"Filament, a startup that focuses on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, announced Monday that it has successfully created a USB-compatible form factor for its blockchain semiconductor.  Co-founder and CEO Allison Clift-Jennings told CoinDesk that the device, based on Filament's existing technology, allows technologists to launch blockchain projects simply by plugging it into a compatible port. The blockchain-native semiconductor was first announced in January and offers ""the ability to sign and verify transactions at the silicon level.""  The new ""Blocklet"" device, she said, builds on that, allowing blockchain processors to interface with existing infrastructure.  “Many products, not all, [have] the ability to connect [to] USB. These are for manufacturing lines - we have a version of a USB product that plugs into the [on-board diagnostics] port in vehicles. It’s very much trying to drive toward machines being transactive in nature,"" Clift-Jennings said in an interview.  Stepping back, the Filament chief executive said that there has been a shift in how people perceive blockchain in the last several years.  “A couple years ago we had the blockchain-native capability, but it was to sell IoT devices as sensors and we’d Trojan Horse the blockchain into it. We had a hard time getting people to commit even when they knew about blockchain,” she said, continuing “now we’re trying to massively hire more engineers and we want that chip in our product line.”  The move is similar to announcements made by IBM and Microsoft, she said, noting that IBM has announced a blockchain hardware chip and Microsoft has been promoting its Azure cloud computing framework.  That being said, “both of these chips don’t exist, so we don’t know” what the companies are specifically planning, according to Clift-Jennings. By contrast, “our devices can hold up to 16 keys, so you can have 16 blockchain implementations simultaneously.""  “We can deploy solutions on Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix, but that doesn’t give you the application you need. It doesn’t give you the smart contract to write things,” she said.  The startup has already produced a small number of the devices, but is in the process of ramping up production, Clift-Jennings said, adding “probably [in third quarter] people can have as many as they would like.”  Semiconductor image courtesy Asa Gilmore / Filament",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/14/iot-startup-filament-hits-milestone-for-blockchain-hardware,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/587ae82b508fc5fd367d217ef4ed9041b2f0cb4d-2000x1214.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""Cross-company collaboration along complex value chains for which the technology can remove abundant process steps and friction, and establish automated trust.""  SAP will integrate the blockchain into its existing Global Track and Trace technology to act as ""an additional layer complementary to core processes that creates one shared view on the data from all involved stakeholders contributing to the supply chain.""  The enhanced technology, Zube contended, allows companies to trace the origins of food products, enter requests and offerings, and authenticate and execute transactions.  SAP also revealed that it has teamed up with Swiss supply chain startup modum.io to further its supply chain ventures. SAP plans to provide further details on the companies' joint work on pilot projects in June.  Zube is bullish on blockchain and thinks the technology could potentially reconfigure current food industry production models.  ""If enterprises can access the complete version of product history,"" he explained, ""this could result in a shift from a central unilateral supplier-led production to a consumer demand-led supply organized by a consortium of peers.""  He went on to predict:  ""Networking along the traditional lines of value chains will be replaced by sharing data governance, resources, processes and practices and lead to joint learning opportunities.""  These undertakings are not SAP's only blockchain ventures. The company previously launched a ""blockchain co-innovation initiative"" to explore distributed business processes that utilize peer-to-peer networks. It is also a member of Spain's Alastria consortium, which focuses on inter-company data sharing, and the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA).

42429055,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZXh,1526277635,First Bitcoin Smart Contracts Sidechain Now Secured By 1 in 10 Miners,"The first bitcoin smart contracts sidechain just reached an early milestone.  To be revealed Monday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference, RSK, the startup that built the long-anticipated technology, touted as a way to bring ethereum-style smart contracts to the world's largest cryptocurrency, is issuing new details on the number of bitcoin users dedicating computing power to backing the experimental idea.  First launched this past January, the sidechain pegged to bitcoin was admittedly limited in that it's not pegged to bitcoin in a ""trustless"" way advocates have promised for so long. Rather, anyone who wants to move their bitcoin to the sidechain needs the approval of a 'federation' group of third parties.  Still, the miner support, RSK Labs co-founder Gabriel Kurman contends, is rather impactful as it shows support for a concept heralded as a way to expand bitcoin's functionality.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's a major announcement for bitcoin as a whole. This 10 percent is coming from 80 percent of the total mining pool power.""  And, although there's a small fraction of the entire network currently securing the sidechain, about 80 percent of miners have already committed support in the future.  ""The hash power percentage is set to increase significantly over the next months,"" Kurman added.  It makes sense, after all, because the sidechain is designed to be ""merged-mined"" – a process which allows miners to get transaction fees by contributing their hash power to the sidechain, all while using the same equipment, electricity and power they're already using to mine bitcoin.  ""RSK has massive support from the mining ecosystem because it adds a new revenue stream for them,"" Kurman said.  RSK's lightning  Not only that, but RSK has developed the sidechain to be able to handle more transactions than bitcoin can currently.  The RSK sidechain uses what the company calls ""smart bitcoins,"" a separate version of bitcoin with the smart contract capability, and that allows for improved scalability.  ""On RSK you can process smart bitcoins at 100 transactions per second,"" Kurman said, pointing to the ""compression"" technology RSK pioneered that decreases the total amount of data that must be stored on the blockchain.  Even with that improvement, though, Kurman is quick to note that that's not nearly enough to bring this technology to the masses, acknowledging that the sidechain still deals with the scalability issues faced by many of today's blockchains. But the team is working towards that.  Taking inspiration from developers working on both bitcoin and ethereum, who have been developing technologies called the lightning network and Raiden network, respectively, RSK has been building a similar technology.  Called ""Lumino,"" the project is what Kurman describes as a ""combination"" of these two networks so that it can work with RSK's unique sidechains technology.  Kurman said he believes the finishing touches won't take long, telling CoinDesk:  ""Before the end of the year, we hope to launch the Lumino network, which will allow for 20,000 transactions per second.""  Growing the family  The last announcement from RSK today is that two companies are now joining the ""RSK family,"" Kurman said.  The first is the Inter-American Development Bank, with an Argentinian bitcoin NGO, seeks to promote financial inclusion in Buenos Aires. The NGO has been working to use RSK for the past two years, although Kurman did not elaborate on how exactly the business plans to use the network.  The second company building on top of RSK is the BitGive Foundation, a long-standing bitcoin-focused charity organization that's been used to funnel bitcoin donations to Nepalese citizens affected by a devastating earthquake in 2015, among other initiatives.  Speaking to the BitGive's interest in using the RSK sidechain, Kurman said, ""It's a project that allows donors to have transparency using smart contracts.""  He added that these new partners display that more and more businesses are starting to see the benefits of bitcoin (and beyond), and as such, are adopting the technology.  RSK will be demoing all this functionality at their booth at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York City this week.

42429054,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrZVh,1526270457,BitGo Courts Wall Street With New Bitcoin Custody Products,"Big Wall Street firms now have new options for storing bitcoin.  Announced Sunday, Palo Alto-based startup BitGo has unveiled a new suite of custodial services aimed at institutional investors who may be eying the market with interest.  The product launch notably builds on BitGo's move to buy Kingdom Trust, a US qualified custodian of traditional financial assets, in January. But while that acquisition is still awaiting regulatory approval, that isn't stopping BitGo from bolstering its offerings.  BitGo head of product Tracy Olsen indicated that the launch – which finds BitGo stratifying its service into three offering tiers – is about framing the company as a full spectrum provider of security solutions, one that can now scale from consumer to institutional needs.  Olsen told CoinDesk:  ""We're definitely seeing a lot of bigger names interested in digital currencies. But there are other customers like smaller hedge funds, they just don't want to have to hold custody themselves. They're looking to have the security and compliance and storage solutions that they can outsource to, and that's what BitGo is really delivering.""  The three services tiers include ""qualified custody,"" in which BitGo offers secure storage and custody through Kingdom Trust; ""institutional custody,"" a solution that enables clients to manage wallets connected and disconnected from the Internet; and self-managed custody.  As such, Olsen positioned the full offering as one that can appeal to the risk-tolerance of all types of clients, from those who want to set up and manage wallets themselves, to those that want others to manage the sensitive cryptographic keys required to access funds.  ""These are really targeted at different market segments. The market is really demanding these three different solutions,"" Olsen continued.  As for customer details, Olsen indicated that BitGo would not reveal the total value of the assets it helps custody, though she said 15 percent of bitcoin transactions now occur through the company's wallet offerings.  Multi-asset upgrade  Still, that's not to say there isn't work to be done on BitGo's offering.  Olsen indicated that BitGo now provides its custody solutions to over 20 cryptocurrencies, but that the company is ""absolutely"" looking to increase that number in 2018.  ""We see a lot of demand of customers for a wide variety of coins. We evaluate each of them for viability in the market and then we prioritize them accordingly,"" she said.  While BitGo primarily started as a bitcoin-only firm, it steadily increased the number of coins it supported over 2017 in line with a jump in the number of crypto hedge funds, as well as wallet and exchange providers that began moving to support multiple protocols.  Notably, however, Olsen hinted that interest at larger institutional firms mirrors this trend, with many indicating an interest in the wide variety of crypto assets on the market today.  ""They see it as a compelling asset class and want to diversify their portfolios with ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies,"" she said.  Wall Street ambitions  Overall, the announcement also serves to potentially recast BitGo as a rare cryptocurrency startup ready to appeal to those seeking to do business on Wall Street.  Propelled by announcements such as Goldman Sachs' coming launch of a dedicated crypto trading desk, others are entering the market. Still, investment in security and custody has arguably lagged over the years, as evidenced by the fact that there are only a handful of such providers today.  Among them are Ledger and Coinbase, two companies that have also sought to raise big funding rounds to serve custody products to an institutional clientele.  However, as Olsen indicated, the nascent state of the market today means that all entrants are competing against the sometimes negative perception of the technology.  Olsen concluded:  ""There's a reputation out there for digital currencies that they may be associated to the underworld, but I believe they are coming around and are seeing the value in investing in this asset class.""
