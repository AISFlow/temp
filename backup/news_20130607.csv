The risks of credit-card fraud and theft are a big reason many Bitcoiners say they prefer digital currency. When it comes to trust, credit card companies have made the Hall of Shame, leading in poor user satisfaction ratings, besting banking, cable, phone and insurance companies.  Using a credit card for online purchases, Mozilla developer Kumar McMillan has noted, is ""like giving someone the keys to your expensive car, letting them drive it around the block in a potentially dangerous neighborhood (the web) and saying please don't get carjacked!"" (Mozilla has of late has been contemplating accepting bitcoin donations.)  Micky Malka  , founder and general partner at Ribbit Capital, which invests in innovations in consumer financial services, including Coinbase, echoed similar concerns about the security of credit cards.  ""This critical vulnerability is like giving a lollipop to a five-year-old kid,"" he said. ""It's so easy, so antiquated.""  To date, 11 people in the US, UK and Vietnam have been arrested in connection with this latest worldwide fraud ring. At the heart of the ring appears to be a man in Vietnam named Duy Hai Truong, who with his accomplices allegedly stole the information of more than one million credit cards, reselling them to criminal customers online, who subsequently racked up more than $200 million in fraudulent charges.  These new arrests come on the heels of other online payment-related busts last month. In early May, authorities arrested seven people in connection with the theft of $45 million using prepaid debit cards that were hacked to eliminate spending and withdrawal limits. And at the end of May, Costa Rica-based private currency exchange Liberty Reserve was raided and its founder arrested in connection with money laundering.  ""I think anything electronic is vulnerable if you give people enough time to think about it or hack it,"" said Ribbit's Malka. And by using physical credit cards, he added, ""you're walking around with credit card numbers in your wallet for anyone to look at.""  Malka continued by comparing how retailers get paid with credit cards versus bitcoin transactions. With credit cards, he said, ""you're saying here's my account number, my name, my bank ... go pull from it."" In contrast, Bitcoin takes the opposite approach, using an online protocol to push -- rather than pull -- money, so ""fraud is exponentially lower.""  Certainly, Bitcoin has seen its share of woes lately. Increased interest has led to a rise in scam sites, not to mention the seizures of bitcoin exchanges. But, to date, there have been no recorded instances of stolen money from attacks on blockchains or the protocol itself.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Alice Truong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/07/200-million-credit-card-fraud-highlights-bitcoins-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3ddcbcbacc4a02e866e91107c9d2a21cc6d3a6d-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376523,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqdF,1370620812,Will Apple break the bank? - The CoinDesk Weekly Review,"The Chinese Way  Marco Polo liked them, Level 42 asked, “Who knows what they know?” and Antiques Roadshow loves the pottery. These days, though, the Chinese are on everyone’s mind as driving the global economy, hacking the global network and maintaining the world’s only successful Communist authoritarian regime.  So it follows that if the Chinese start getting very interested in cryptocurrencies, everyone gets very interested indeed. And this seems to be happening, with the Middle Kingdom accounting for the majority of bitcoin client downloads of late.  The Chinese media is alive with bitcoin tutorials and although there’s some doubt whether the government is in favour or against the idea, it does at least tolerate it - which is tacit approval from a state that sees little problem in shutting down anything it dislikes. There are at least two forces in play: the Chinese ruling class is often intensely pragmatic and has often found it advisable to like how its people make their money regardless of the details; It is also curious about what its people get up to, having installed a country-wide Golden Shield Internet monitoring and control system that does publicly what Western governments pretend they don’t do privately.  And bitcoin has the potential to be a very rich source of information indeed.  Yes, bitcoin is anonymous; there is no way to directly find out who owns or spends the stuff. But like so many anonymous systems, it is very far from private. When you give someone a bitcoin, you have to know their bitcoin address and it is then possible to spot other transactions that use that address. With some work, you can build up quite a detailed picture of cash flow through that address, which is a powerful forensic tool for working out what the owner of that address is up to - and who they are.  As of now, cash remains the best way to fund activities in ways invisible to the State. Bitcoin removes a lot of that invisibility: if John Law was a country that didn’t trust its people, he’d be very interested in that side of things indeed.  He isn’t. China is. And as for the Western democracies - you’ll just have to ask them.  Fair exchange  A hat-tip to Coindesk’s own Danny Bradbury and his admirably lucid explanation of how the regulators and the bitcoin exchanges are beginning to understand each other. If you haven’t read it yet, go now. Got it? Good.  If you want the best possible guidance on bitcoin’s durability and future, watch the regulators. Still smarting from their role in the recent global economic meltdown, and driven by the fact that the most effective way to track and kill major crime and terrorism is to follow the money and close it down, they are becoming increasingly active in slapping down the dodgy and laying down the rules for cryptocurrency exchanges. What they do is the best guide to official thinking.  And the exchanges themselves, as you now know, are responding by being more responsible both in following the rules and by forming robust networks among themselves to ensure liquidity and stability. All these are good signs.  John Law tries to avoid prophecies: this damn Internet never forgets, and the future is famously a difficult thing to predict. But here goes.  Expect national exchange networks to build up quite quickly: local knowledge and contacts are big competitive advantages in finance, and once a few pathfinder exchanges are established it’s much easier to know what to do. There’ll be a burst of failures and amalgamations, leaving a few major players that have some heft.  That’ll give them and their investors a voice in creating a more fluid global cryptocurrency environment, which looks and feels as safe and established as our existing systems. It’ll probably share some of the same people; when today’s copper-bottomed bankers and CEOs are comfortable sitting on the boards of headline bitcoin exchanges.  At that point, you can write off anyone saying that the bitcoin sky will fall. It may, of course, but from the same outside factors that can ravage any of humanity’s pet schemes.  What to make of this? Well, if you’re thinking of investing in the future, either in money or the time needed to become an expert, the safest bet will be in the systems and technologies that will build that infrastructure. Now is the time of the new and the nimble, the far-sighted and fleet of foot, and it is the backroom boys who’ll inherit the earth. Get larnin’.  Bank jobs  One company that has been very sniffy about bitcoins is Apple, which has decreed that its iPhones and iPads will have nothing to do with it. You cannot download an app for that; Apple’s killed them all.  Apple, of course, is most publicly disparaging of things that it secretly wants for itself. So it’s no great surprise that it is now trying to patent its own electronic currency system, designed to promote an Apple world where Apple customers spend Apple iMoney with Apple sitting in the middle setting the rules and taking its iCut.  But iPatents patents are slippery things. A quick glance through the patent itself shows little that seems innovatory - although the US patent office is in one of its ‘grant first, let the courts sort it out later’ moods that pleases lawyers and infuriates inventors. Even if it’s granted, it’ll put Apple up against some very powerful entrenched competition among the banks and credit card companies; the most likely reason for the patent is defensive, with it being intended to give Apple some legal firepower in case someone tries to pull a patent case on them.  In any case, Apple’s antipathy towards bitcoin will not last (yes, another prophecy; it’s addictive). If bitcoin does establish itself, then it’ll be another competitive advantage to Android for as long as Apple refuses to play. With the Google-based mobile operating system now beginning to pull ahead in the smartphone market, Apple is discovering that it can no longer set the rules and damn the consequences. And American patents may not be quite as powerful as once they were with the fastest growing markets elsewhere in the world.  There may indeed be iMoney at some point - but it won’t be iWay robbery.  John Law  is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42376516,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AqWx,1370610039,Exchange service supports Argentina's USD black market,"The difference in the official and unofficial rate for Argentinian pesos is now so pronounced that at least one bitcoin exchange has acknowledged it. Localbitcoins.com has decided to publish a 'blue dollar' exchange rate for the currency.  The escrow-based decentralised bitcoin exchange service has produced a symbol for the blue dollar rate called XAR, and is using it to calculate bitcoin exchange rates.  The black market rate in Argentina is a result of rocketing inflation, and tension over a possible default. This has led Argentinians to hoard dollars, while the authorities have imposed strict controls on purchasing US dollars through official channels. This has led the blue rate to rise.  “People from Argentina are requesting us to add these blue market trades because the official rate is useless,” said Jeremias Kangas, founder of LocalBitcoins.com, who would not reveal where he sourced the blue rate data. “The official rate is useless for trading bitcoins or anything else, so we have decided to add this blue market rate.”  Late last month, the Argentine government approved legislation pardoning tax dodgers who invest their undeclared foreign currency holdings in the construction, oil and gas industries. The amnesty will allow the investors to buy dollar bonds.

42424949,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Vh,1370605809,Protect privacy by scrambling your block chain,"Bitcoin is anonymous, at least until you try trading for real money; e.g. Verifying with Mt. Gox. However, even when all of ones' transactions are kept in a bitcoin wallet, there are ways for those willing to go data mining, to find patterns and follow trails as we reported on earlier today. There are ways to defeat this tracking, or at least make it a lot harder.  Thanks to having a public Block Chain, it is possible to search for a specific Bitcoin address. Having paid someone once on Bitcoin, you have their address. You can easily go and put that address into the search box at the Block Chain website. The resulting page will show you items like how many times the address has been used for a transaction, what the total amount of money received is and what is its current balance.  Even worse is that you can view a full breakdown of every transaction of that address has sent and received. Fortunately, because Bitcoin addresses are anonymous, you can't tell where those payments were going, or coming from.  However, you could build up a directory of addresses of everyone you've ever dealt with, and then try cross referencing those addresses, and if several people combine their identifying bitcoin addresses, a whole series of transactions could be reconstructed with real identities.  There are practices that businesses can implement to guard against this kind of attack – Wired has a case study of Foodler's attempts to do so.  The easiest thing to do is to create a new address for every transaction. Even the most widespread Bitcoin-qt client recommends you do this. Addresses cost nothing to create, so there is no impact on your bottom line.  The next suggestion, which comes from Foodler's Christian Dumontet recommends, is to split payments up into random amounts and with random block lengths.  Admittedly, such data gathering attacks would be difficult to implement, but they're not impossible. In the same way, it's unlikely and highly difficult for someone to raid your trash and reconstruct your shredded bills – such things still happen and we need to be ready for them.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | TRADING,David Gilson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/07/protect-privacy-by-scrambling-your-block-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c26239494ff0746ee5354fda831917397fa5b9d5-500x375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424962,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6ph,1370595891,How anonymous is Bitcoin?,"How private is Bitcoin? On the one hand, it is entirely anonymous. On the other, it is completely transparent and trackable. How can that be – and what does it mean for privacy?  Incumbent Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox recently imposed authentication rules on people trading fiat currencies on its network. The rules – which didn't apply to people trading only in bitcoins – require people to verify their identities. There may not be any such requirements on native bitcoin users yet, but it highlights the issue of privacy. Many people using Bitcoin don’t want others to know who they are. The question is whether they're able to hide that information.  Bitcoin could be interpreted as a 'pseudo-anonymous' network. It is anonymous in the sense that you can hold a Bitcoin address without revealing anything about your identity in that address. One person could hold multiple addresses, and in theory, there would be nothing to link those addresses together, or to indicate that the person owned them.  So far so good, but there is another side to Bitcoin. Everything that happens in the Bitcoin world is trackable. Thanks to the way that the algorithm is structured, every Bitcoin-based transaction is logged in the blockchain.  This leads to a level of transparency that may surprise some Bitcoin users. ""If you publish your Bitcoin address on your website, then everyone in the world will be able to know what your bitcoin balance is,"" points out Sergio Lerner, CEO of Argentinian company Certimix.  Certimix develops products for protecting online card games sites and their players, using mathematically proven algorithms. Lerner has a strong cryptography background, and has discovered several vulnerabilities in the Satoshi algorithm.  “Privacy is not enforced by the Bitcoin protocol design,” he says. “If you re-use the same address over and over to receive money from other users, then every one of them will detect that the others have sent you money.”  But surely this isn't a problem. After all, if your name isn't explicitly linked to a Bitcoin address, then it doesn't matter if people know what transactions that address is participating in, right? Wrong, says Matthew Green. Green is an assistant research professor at Johns Hopkins University, and the co-developer of an anonymity system for crypto currencies called Zerocoin.  Interested parties have become very good at inferring information from large network movements, Green says, pointing out that this is pretty much Google’s business model. Facebook’s, LinkedIn, and pretty much any other social network that laps up big data will be working hard at extracting as much data from that network as possible by looking for patterns.  “With a bit of data mining, my concern is that people will get a lot of information. The things people are doing to protect themselves today are pretty naive compared to the kinds of clever data mining tricks that exist. What I’m worried about is that a lot of people are doing things that are leaving a permanent history and will then inadvertently leave some trace that reveals their actual identity,"" he says.  Sound far-fetched? Let's not forget Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov, who were both researchers at the University of Texas in 2007. They took a dataset, publicly released by Netflix, which contained 10 million movie rankings by 500,000 customers. The online video company was running a competition to see if people could develop a better movie recommendation system by analysing the data set.  There should have been no problem, because the dataset was rendered anonymous, meaning that all personal information pertaining to the movie rankings had been removed.  But the researchers matched rankings and timestamps with information publicly stored in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). It enabled them to find out who certain people were, removing the anonymity from certain parts of the data.  Thelma Arnold, a widow living in the US state of Georgia, probably never searched for “deanonymisation”. Nevertheless, the Internet suddenly knew a lot more about her search history in August 2006. She was a frequent AOL search user, and her searches were mixed anonymously into a file with 20 million others and released by AOL for researchers to play with.  By analysing the searches, data scientists were able to figure out who she was (along with the fact that she’s interested in single men over 60, and that she'd like some way to stop her dog urinating on everything).  Recombining personal information by analysing large data sets isn’t just for sport – it has huge ramifications for law enforcement, intelligence services, and other players. Narayanan calls this branch of research ""reidentification"". Presumably, the techniques used will vary depending on the data sets involved. But with a completely transparent block chain, bitcoin is a ripe target.  How do paranoid bitcoin users stop this happening? John Hopkins’ Green hopes to help with Zerocoin. It effectively builds a money-laundering service into a crypto currency at the protocol level.  “The way we designed it is that you take original bitcoins, you turn them into Zerocoins, and then you turn them back into new bitcoins in another wallet,” he says.  The technology is being refined to be more efficient, particularly in the size of mathematical proofs that it needs per transaction. It will be ready for deployment in a couple of weeks, says Green.  But just because researchers built it doesn’t mean that Bitcoin users will come. Getting someone to adopt it is perhaps more challenging than the mathematics behind it. It would need to be built into the core protocol, and all of the clients would need to be updated, probably needing a hard fork. The core development team has enough work on its plate.  “The core devs (who have very little resources) are focusing in reducing the complexity and creating a robust application, not adding more features that would need great efforts of testing and validation,” protests Lerner.  Green agrees that getting Zerocoin into the Satoshi protocol is a long shot. But hopes that some alternative currencies will take a risk and try to work this into their clients. “Then we would get to test it and see it working. We are hopeful.""  Lerner has his own altcurrency, with a built-in anonymity feature, but it isn’t using Zerocoin. Qixcoin, which is designed to support online wagering, is anonymous, untraceable, and tradeable with other cryptocurrencies, Currently in beta, it uses Lerner’s own anonymity protocol, called APPECoin.  “APPECoin uses special cryptographic constructions to make the size of the proofs much, much smaller, and so it is as scalable as Bitcoin,” says Lerner, who hopes to release a technical paper on the project in the next two weeks. “Also, APPECoin completely hides the amounts paid, and coins can be divided and combined privately without disclosing the amounts.”  These developments are all very well, but don't help Bitcoin users paranoid about their transactions today. So, what can be done? Lerner has some advice. Changing Bitcoin payment addresses often (or even creating a destination address for each payment) is a healthy thing to do, as is connecting to the Bitcoin network using the Tor anonymity system.  Connecting to the Bitcoin network using two peers in a chain is another worthwhile step, advises Lerner. ""The first node holds the private wallet and connect only to the second node,"" he explains. ""The second is the gateway with the remaining nodes of the Bitcoin network.""  Another is to use an external mixing service to render your coins anonymous. There are several of these, which don’t work at the protocol level. Instead, they simply function as third-party services. One of them, called BitLaundry, works simply.  The sender (Alice) gives the address of the recipient (Bob) to the laundry service (BL). BL gives a one-time address to Alice, to which she sends Bob's bitcoins. BL mixes them into a pool of other bitcoins, and then deletes the database link between the one-time address and Bob's address, before sending the bitcoins to Bob. This happens according to a predefined delivery schedule, making it difficult for any third-party to analyse transaction timestamps.  BitLaundry advises users to send themselves bitcoins, thus obscuring their history, and to use multiple recipient addresses, further obfuscating the transactions.  Until bitcoin includes a protocol-level anonymity system, users interested in true privacy will have to follow a number of workarounds to decrease the probability of detection. If they don't follow the rules, then they should be aware of the consequences. In many ways, Bitcoin is like Vegas: what happens in the blockchain stays in the blockchain.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MINING | TRADING | FORKS,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/07/how-anonymous-is-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cdbf50908f1da1aba46a6561d2da7bd7433c318a-500x429.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424947,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHX6Rh,1370587868,Apple to create virtual currency 'iMoney',"Yesterday, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Organization published a patent application from Apple for – wait for it – iMoney. Apple looks to get into the digital currency game in a way similar to Amazon Coins. The patent is a combination of virtual currency and digital wallet technology. It allows users to store money in the cloud and make payments with their iPhone.  Some possibilities for the patent include making money by viewing ads, where the user will receive tokens of iMoney that can be applied toward their mobile carrier costs or redeemed for Apple products and services. There may also be NFC - Near Field Communication - technology in the mix to communicate with point-of-sale terminals, which is something Apple has resisted adding to the iPhone for a long time. NFC allows smartphones to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them in close proximity.  Many people consider this as Apple trying to nudge into the digital currency arena, after already refusing to support mobile Bitcoin wallets or apps that allow Bitcoin trading, causing many Bitcoin enthusiasts and users of alt-currency to switch over to Android.  Apple's official anti-bitcoin policy is infuriating many of its users as the digital currency continues to become more mainstream. The company actually removed two Bitcoin wallet applications from its app store in May, prompting Bitpak's developer, Rob Sama, to lament, “[It is] extremely unfortunate that Apple has chosen to take this stand.” Blockchain for iPhone was also deleted from the app store.  Apple later explained to advocates that, “Apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer's obligation to understand and conform to all local laws.” Of course, Bitcoin is an unregulated currency with no laws prohibiting it.  This is all typical of Apple – they're like the too-cool-for-school kids in the High School lunch room that all sit at a table together and don't interact with anyone around. They'll make fun of you for wearing a new hat. Then, the next day, they'll all be sporting the same hat and claim that it was totally their idea.  In this case, they're doing everything they can to completely refuse to have anything to do with Bitcoin, while at the same time filing a patent for their very own digital currency. They obviously like the idea, but want to keep it in the Apple family and, knowing Apple, they'll try to market this new virtual currency as some kind of better alternative to ""unstable and volatile Bitcoin.""  Josh Seims, just one iPhone user angry about Apple's anti-Bitcoin policy, submitted a petition on Change.org back in April that, so far, has received 317 supporters (with 183 more needed in order to reach its goal). I got in touch with him earlier today to ask for his feedback.    “The iMoney patent is an example of both good and bad effects of the concentration of power. On the good side, Apple's dominant power puts them in a good position to build a valuable and easy-to-use mobile payment system. They can customize their hardware to support this system, they can embed it into their operating system, and they can likely convince many merchants and banks to play along. These serious competitive advantages may result in significant end-user benefits.      On the other hand, this power can also be used to prevent competition. They may use this patent to attack anyone else building mobile payment solutions. And, by trying to collect a piece of transactional revenue, Apple is likely to oppose decentralized payment solutions like Bitcoin.”    I asked Josh if he thought Apple's patent was an initial step in trying to create their own competing digital currency while deciding not to play nice with others and corner the market. “They might,” he wrote back. “I wouldn't consider such a currency a big threat to Bitcoin since it will have all the same weaknesses that a decentralized currency like Bitcoin addresses.”  I'm a little weary of not considering Apple a threat, though. Time and time again Apple has come out with products and services that at first seem completely absurd (remember how stupid the iPad sounded? Then, remember how stupid the Mini iPad sounded?) but that begin picking up speed, creating entire new markets, and disrupting other ones, which they accomplish by an almost cult following, generational brand loyalty, and savvy marketing.  Only time will tell, but one thing seems certain – Apple would rather ignore and alienate a vast and growing demographic of Bitcoin users by not only striking down any apps that allow BTC storage and trading, but creating their very own digital currency, which is basically a final giant middle finger to anyone that was holding out hope that Apple would eventually change its mind on the Bitcoin issue.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,William McCanless,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/06/07/apple-to-create-virtual-currency-imoney,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/666f426bc4ffc08239e63c2832a11fbf61ccc05c-585x367.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
