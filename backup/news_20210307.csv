42433846,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5ibh,1615154460,Crypto Long & Short: Is ETH Coming to Corporate Balance Sheets?,"MicroStrategy, Tesla and Square have done it. So have many others, although more quietly.      I’m talking about holding corporate treasury reserves in bitcoin. This trend is attracting attention even from trade press. Consultancies and crypto companies are scrambling to launch services to help businesses navigate the process. “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer thinks it’s “almost irresponsible” for companies to not do so. This week, sponsored content from Deloitte explaining the benefits and risks appeared in the Wall Street Journal.    You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, a newsletter that looks closely at the forces driving cryptocurrency markets. Authored by CoinDesk’s head of research, Noelle Acheson, it goes out every Sunday and offers a recap of the week – with insights and analysis – from a professional investor’s point of view. You can subscribe here.    Whether it’s a good idea or not – that’s up to each corporate treasurer to decide – one question we’re starting to hear is: What about ether?      Would the native token of the Ethereum blockchain make a good corporate reserve asset?    Bitcoin on balance sheets    The main arguments for bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset are:    The asymmetric risk return  As part of a future-first strategy  In preparation for accepting bitcoin as payment  It is more likely to hold its value going forward than the dollar    This last point is key, as the main role of the corporate treasury function is the preservation of capital. Here bitcoin’s leading value proposition – as a store of value – comes into play.      Critics will point out that bitcoin is way too volatile to be a store of value. That’s a short-term view of the concept, however. Over the next week, month, perhaps even year, bitcoin’s price may fall relative to fiat currencies. Longer term, however, in an environment of money supply increasing much faster than demand, a fixed-supply bearer asset such as bitcoin is likely to appreciate in value relative to assets without a fixed supply, such as the U.S. dollar. As investor Paul Tudor Jones pointed out, even at only the 2% inflation target, cash is a “wasting asset.”      Do these arguments hold for ether?      Not so much, no. But that doesn’t mean ether won’t end up on corporate balance sheets.    Store of value    Ether’s supply has no limit. It is still considered a store of value, however, as its supply growth is modest (currently around 4%, expected to decrease over time) and likely to remain well below growth in demand.      Yet the store of value narrative is not – at this stage – the main driver behind ETH’s investment case, especially in the eyes of institutional investors.      Ethereum is seen more as a technology play. More than that, it’s one of the more liquid, experimental technology plays accessible to investors today. It’s not just trying to build a faster rocket or streamline dentistry. It’s aiming to reinvent the way automated applications of any type are run. Its goal is to build the ultimate base layer of a global digital economy. As well-known macro analyst Jim Bianco said earlier this week, decentralized finance is “recreating the entire financial system.” Ethereum-based applications are also likely to impact markets, governance, energy, public services, perhaps even how identity is managed.      What’s more, this will happen on a network that can reach anyone, anywhere, who can connect to a public network.      Bitcoin is also a technology bet – it unleashed on the world an entirely new way of transmitting value. But the basic parameters were baked in at conception. Meaningful upgrades are few and years in the making.      Ethereum is not only a bet on the growth of a decentralized economy, it’s also a bet on a whole new type of connectivity and innovation layer. And its technology is not yet fully formed.      Because it is such an early bet on such a radical innovation, the risk is even higher than with bitcoin. This can be seen in its volatility:      If bitcoin’s volatility is a deterrent for corporate treasurers, ether is understandably even more so.    Ether on balance sheets    This doesn’t mean that ether won’t end up on corporate balance sheets, however. Rather than as corporate reserves, it’s more likely to do so in working capital.      Ether is needed to power applications on Ethereum, either as an input or for the transaction fees. Any company hoping to use the Ethereum platform for internal processes such as contract management, collateral allocation or yield optimization, or for client-facing services such as trading, lending or insurance, will need a steady supply.      The launch of ETH futures on the CME earlier this year will encourage this, as it offers tools to reduce the volatility risk. The maturation of ETH options will further support risk management.      The accumulation of ether as working capital may have already started. This week, Meitu – a software and social media app company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange – disclosed purchases in bitcoin and ether of approximately $18 million and $22 million respectively, and had this to say about its ether purchase:      “The Group is currently evaluating the feasibility of integrating blockchain technologies to its various overseas businesses … the ether purchased would become the gas reserve for the Group’s potential dAPP(s) to consume in the future.”      It is early days yet as few companies outside the crypto industry have integrated Ethereum-based applications. Signs are emerging that interest is awakening, however. This week, multinational insurance company Aon Mutual, whose origins go back more than 100 years, embarked on a decentralized insurance pilot. Last month we reported that Deutsche Telekom, Europe’s largest telecommunications company by revenue, was experimenting with decentralized data.      As Ethereum use cases begin to impact traditional businesses, and as even more crypto companies using decentralized applications grow to meaningful size, we will start to hear more mainstream conversations about ether on balance sheets.      Greater focus on the asset’s role in powering digital processes will add another layer to its value proposition. As we saw above, ether is a technology play. It is also a store of value. Institutional investors are increasingly interested in ETH for these reasons. Going forward, ETH is likely to also benefit from a growing recognition of its role as a consumable commodity.      “Digital oil,” if you will, to bitcoin’s “digital gold.”    See also: Bitcoin + Ether: An Investor's Perspective  CHAIN LINKS    According to sources, Goldman Sachs has relaunched its cryptocurrency trading desk after a three-year hiatus and plans to once again support bitcoin futures trading. TAKEAWAY: By this stage, we don’t actually need further proof that the “institutions are here,” but here it is anyway. Goldman wouldn’t be doing this if its clients weren’t asking for it. As if to emphasize the point, news came out this week about a Goldman client survey that shows that, out of 280 respondents, 40% have exposure to cryptocurrencies and 22% of respondents expect the price of bitcoin to be over $100,000 in 12 months.      Other surveys produce different results. JPMorgan surveyed 3,400 institutional investors, 78% of whom said it was unlikely their firm will invest in or offer trading services for crypto.      Galaxy Digital’s institutional-grade ether funds have raised over $32 million since their February launch, according to documents filed this week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. TAKEAWAY: The distribution is still relatively narrow, but not insignificant – five institutional investors have placed sizable bets on the evolution of the Ethereum blockchain. (See our special reporton the differences between bitcoin and ether from an institutional investment perspective.)      Crypto custodian BitGo has received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for a New York trust charter. TAKEAWAY: This brings more crypto custody services, this time from one of the longest-standing businesses in the industry, to Wall Street hedge funds and, even more intriguingly, to Wall Street banks, who just might be interested in offering this service to their clients.      Crypto exchange Kraken is contemplating a public listing in 2022, according to an interview with the CEO Jesse Powell on Bloomberg TV. TAKEAWAY: As one of the largest exchanges in the industry, a Kraken listing would give us more valuable insight into market plumbing. So far, we only have the Coinbase filing documents to go by, and – eye-opening as they were – they don’t yet paint a full picture of the industry’s potential.      Cipher Mining Technologies, a newly formed U.S.-based bitcoin mining operation formed from bitcoin mining hardware giant Bitfury Top HoldCo and Good Works Acquisition, a special purpose acquisition company, have agreed to merge, with an enterprise value of $2.0 billion. TAKEAWAY: So far, mining businesses dominate the roster of listed crypto companies. The more, the merrier – better insight into industry fundamentals, as well as more flexibility in crypto exposure for portfolios.      The Bloomberg terminal now provides price data for six more crypto assets: orchid, omg network , EOS, chainlink , tezos and stellar. TAKEAWAY: To be filed under “increasing institutional interest in decentralized finance.”",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/07/crypto-long-short-is-eth-coming-to-corporate-balance-sheets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/18c89be3714ca99d32cdda15181d0bbc2ddc1eb7-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With “Operation Hidden Treasure,” the IRS will search for unreported crypto-related income, according to Director of the Office of Fraud Enforcement Damon Rowe.    Speaking at a Federal Bar Association virtual tax conference, Rowe said cryptocurrency fraud will be a priority. Forbes first reported the news.  Operation Hidden Treasure, a joint effort between the IRS’ civil office of fraud enforcement and its criminal investigation unit, will train agents to look at blockchains to root out tax evasion among cryptocurrency users. It will exist as part of the office’s emerging threats mitigation team, Forbes said.  IRS employees are also reportedly training alongside the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) as part of the initiative.    Carolyn Schenck, national fraud counsel in the IRS Office of Chief Counsel, told conference-goers the agency is working with private contractors and vendors, presumably blockchain analytics firms, to develop “signatures,” or telltale signs of fraudulent activity.    These indicators include looking at those who structure transactions just below reporting requirements (like sending a series of $10,000 transactions), using shell corporations to hide funds as well as “getting on and off the chain,” Schenck reportedly said.  The IRS has sent conflicting messages to U.S. crypto holders several times in the past. Most recently, an updated FAQ page indicated that investors who simply bought “virtual currency with real currency” would not have to report that transaction on this year’s tax returns.  Still, cashing out crypto or making every-day purchases is typically seen as a taxable event. Operation Hidden Treasure is designed to find, trace, and attribute such transactions to taxpayers, Schenck said.    “These transactions are not anonymous,” she said. “We see you.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/07/irs-initiates-operation-hidden-treasure-to-root-out-unreported-crypto-income,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d72f971006003872f493e3539ae4ffb84e335a6e-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Delaware court denied the multi-billion asset manager Tetragon Financial Group’s request to redeem its Ripple equity for cash in the midst of an ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.      U.K.-based Tetragon filed suit in January to reclaim its portion of the $200 million Series C financing of the blockchain company it led in 2019. The suit also aimed to freeze Ripple’s liquid assets until it paid up. Now it appears Ripple won’t have to, with a Delaware Chancery Court judge on Friday rejecting the plaintiff’s case.      Ripple called the lawsuit meritless at the outset, saying at the time Tetragon only had a case if the SEC determined XRP to be a security. The terms of the initial investment gave Tetragon the right to redeem its Ripple equity, if XRP was found to be a security.      “XRP is no more a security after the SEC filed the enforcement action than it was before it,” the court said, as quoted in a Ripple press release. “The enforcement action, by contrast, asks that question. The question is not yet resolved, so a determination has not yet been made.”      The filings were not immediately available at press time.      “Let’s call Tetragon’s lawsuit what it is – an opportunistic move to take advantage of the SEC’s allegations.

The top cryptocurrency is changing hands near $50,500 at press time, representing a 4% gain on the day, having clocked a high of $51,320 early today, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The Senate approved Biden's stimulus plan on Saturday, paving the way for $1,400 checks and continued jobless aid. The bill heads back to the House of Representative where will be voted on Tuesday, according to media reports.      Improved prospects of fiscal spending look to have put a bid under bitcoin (BTC), waking it up from the two-day slumber in the range of $49,500 to $46,200.

42411155,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gj8BNW,1615138696,"How NFTs Became Art, and Everything Became an NFT","Pascal Boyart is a Parisian street artist. In January 2019, in a working-class neighborhood, he painted a mural inspired by Eugène Delacroix’s masterpiece, “Liberty Leading the People.” He gave it a modern twist. Boyart swapped the 19th century French rebels (the ones toppling King Charles X) with the “yellow-jacket” protesters who, depending on whom you ask, were either fighting for justice or inciting riots and burning the city. The French authorities were not pleased. They quickly painted over Boyart’s mural with a coat of harmless gray, blotting his message from existence.  “Today, the physical mural doesn’t exist. But it still exists with NFTs, and with value,” Boyart tells me from Paris. “This is very satisfying.”  See also: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Boyart minted a non-fungible token (NFT) version of the mural, dividing it into 100 pieces and selling each one for 0.5 ETH. He would sell more NFTs. Many more. Boyart once had difficulty monetizing his street art – you can’t easily sell graffiti, and few street artists make Banksy-money – but with NFTs he had a way to sell his work directly to his fans. And suddenly this has become quite lucrative. On Feb. 26, his NFT “Contemplations of the Red Jester” sold for 75 ETH, or $112,000 at the time, his largest sale to date.  Boyart has company. Eye-popping NFT sales are everywhere, punctuated by a $6.6 million, 10-second video created by Beeple. Even Christie’s is now auctioning Beeple’s crypto-works. (For the non-art crowd, Beeple is a celebrated digital artist, and Christie’s has been around since before the U.S. Declaration of Independence.)  It’s almost impossible to keep track of the latest NFT developments. To note just a few: The cartoon frog HomerPepe sold for $320,000; Grimes sold an NFT bundle for $6 million; an NFT tweet(a tweet!) from Mark Cuban sold for $952; Lindsay Lohan now mints NFTs; Shawn Mendes hawks NFT guitars; people are selling genesis tweets; and by the time you finished reading this paragraph, perhaps we’ll get news that President Biden is dropping stimulus checks via NFTs.  This is no longer a tiny niche. Over $250 million of NFT volume was traded in 2020, according to a report from NonFungible, and that’s not counting the recent boom. Nor is it counting the $230 million for NBA Top Shot – digital “moments” (basically quick video highlights) that became so instantly popular, the developers were overwhelmed by a 200,000-person queue.  Want to buy an NFT of a LeBron dunk? One just sold for $208,000. Mark Cuban is all over it, and this is happening at lightning speed. Less than two months ago he told CoinDesk he was exploring NFTs (this was news at the time) and now, as he told USA Today, he thinks NFTs “could turn into a top 3 revenue source for the NBA over the next 10 years.”  NFTs can be art. NFTs can be music. NFTs can be collectibles, real estate, sports, fantasy football, gaming, internet ephemera and just about everything shy of thoughts. (It won’t be long.) Maybe this article will be an NFT. I’m waiting for the first wedding proposal NFT. Can NFTs be minted as an NFT? A recent Clubhouse talk of “NFT Performance Art” included a conversation about NFTs and the soul. I only casually dropped in for a few minutes, but that was long enough to hear someone ask, “Is there a way to play rock-paper-scissors with NFTs?”  This begs a few questions. What triggered the NFT mania? Why now? And is this just a fizzy chapter of crypto hype – a bubble destined to pop – or do NFTs provide real value to the creator or the collector? After all, when most people want to see highlights of LeBron throwing tomahawks, they go to YouTube and watch it for free. Why, exactly, are we paying millions of dollars for a virtual bucket of cartoon frogs?  Pandemic effect  Let’s start with some basics: NFTs are easy to visualize. They’re concrete. A piece of art, a song or even a digital home in a “metaverse” like Decentraland – these are things that non-crypto people can easily grasp, which is a big reason for the crossover appeal.  The only awkward part of explaining NFTs is the name itself, as the clunky acronym “Non-Fungible Token” elicits frowns and confusion. But when you explain that an NFT is basically just something digital that – thanks to blockchain technology – can’t be copied or spoofed, people get it.  Much of crypto is abstract, complex and snarled in a tricky web of tech and coding and economic theory. Try explaining “yield farming” to your grandparents. But NFTs are a bridge to worlds that are fun. They’re also the gateway to massive new audiences.  “A lot of people don’t really don’t care about decentralized finance … But your average person might actually like basketball,” says Mason Nystrom, a research analyst at Messari who studies NFTs. “This allows you to draw in an entire population that might not have previously cared about crypto.”  Nystrom estimates that decentralized finance (DeFi), in total, might have around 1 million to 2 million users. That’s not small. But it’s nothing compared to the 42.7 million people who follow the National Basketball Association on Facebook, many of whom will be curious about NBA Top Shot. Or, as Zack Seward put it on CoinDesk TV, it’s “captivating a lot of interest outside of typical crypto-dork circles.”  And why is all of this happening now, as opposed to 2017 or 2018 when NFTs first debuted? Five quick theories:  1) The on-ramps and marketplaces for NFTs – platforms like OpenSea, NiftyGateway, Sorare, SuperRare, Mintbase – are far more intuitive and easier for newbies than in 2017.  2) The crypto bull run has left investors with ETH burning holes in their pockets.  3) Both creators and collectors are stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic and looking for something to do.  4) The rise in NFTs parallels a broader surge in real-world collectibles (such as the resurgence of baseball cards).  5) Influencers like Cuban have jumped into the space, creating a virtuous cycle that pumps more interest.  But there could be a deeper force at play. “I believe that everyone should be looking at some of the macro trends that are happening with humanity,” says the pseudo-anonymous “Whale Shark,” based in Hong Kong, who claims to be the world’s second-largest collector of NFTs with over 210,000 pieces.  Maybe this article will be an NFT. I’m waiting for the first wedding proposal NFT.  “More and more people are spending their time on their phone, or online … Our lifestyles are moving from physical to digital,” says Shark. Most of us stare at two, three or four screens each day. Especially during the pandemic.  So it’s only natural, says the Whale, that when we want to own things, we’re becoming more comfortable owning them in our digital life, which, more and more, is just life. Then he layers on another dynamic: Even before NFTs, the younger generation of collectors became accustomed to plunking real money into digital-only ecosystems like Fortnite. For them this is old hat, which is one reason the mega-collector says, “I think of NFTs as a no-brainer.”  Own it  The potential of blockchain technology to “revolutionize ownership” has long sounded like puffery, but NFTs are doing exactly that. Take the case of Eve Sussman, a renowned mixed-media artist (film, sculpture, photography) whose work appears in venues like the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian.  In 2004, for the Whitney Biennial, she created a 12-minute video called “89 seconds at Alcazár,” which reimagined the scene from Diego Velásquez’s 1656 classic, ""Las Meninas."" Critics swooned.New Yorkmagazine called it a “standout,” a work so revelatory that “you will sense what composition, in art, finally entails.”  Sussman’s video found a second life with NFTs. She worked with a firm called Snark.Art – a blockchain-savvy agency that works with artists, creating innovative formats – to carve the video into a 2,304-piece grid. Collectors could purchase one tiny fragment as an NFT. Each of these “atoms” is only 20 x 20 pixels, and can be viewed as a tiny movie. They called the new form “89 Seconds Atomized.”  See also: Mark Cuban on Bitcoin, NFTs and What Comes Next: ‘The Upside Is Truly Unlimited’  So far, this is similar to how Boyart divied up his street art (the yellow vest mural) into 100 pieces. But they didn’t stop with fractional ownership. They added a fascinating twist. If you purchase one of Sussman’s 2,304 atoms, you’re only able to see one microscopic piece of the work, which can’t make a ton of sense out of context.  Enter blockchain. Thanks to the magic of smart contracts (code in NFTs that dictates ownership), you can “request a loan” from all of the other NFT-owners of “89 Seconds Atomized,” and when they loan you all of their pixels you can recreate the piece in all its original glory. “We were thinking, what could ownership look like in the digital sense?” says Misha Libman, a co-founder of Snark.Art, who worked on the collaboration.  “You have quite expensive artwork that’s completely unaffordable to the majority of people. But if you fracture it, and sell each fragment for $100, then you give collectors an opportunity to become part of this community and own a piece of a really famous artwork, and also be an active participant.”  NFTs can take many forms. Sometimes they are just a simulacrum of a physical thing, but they can also be an improvement over the thing itself. They can unlock new creative possibilities. This is perhaps easiest to see with art, as in the case of Boyart’s street murals. Normal paintings are static. Every Kindergartener knows this. Paint can’t move. But with his NFTs, Boyart enlivens the images with motion, audio and augmented reality.  In Boyart’s “Raft of the Medusa,” he animated the NFT so the raft bobs and sways in the water. In “Contemplations of the Red Jester,” dollar bills (or euros) eerily float to the floor as the Jester slumps in his chair, desolate.  It’s true that tricks like this have long been possible with digital art, but none of those older forms had cracked the problem of digital scarcity. NFTs solve that puzzle. And smart contracts can allow the artist to program future changes to the piece. For example, Boyart is now working on an NFT whose layers will change over time. NFT art can be programmed to show different images triggered by real world events, like the weather, or Christmas morning, or who wins an election – all of that is now in play.  NFTs are luring in artists from outside the blockchain world. Take Elizabeth Meggs, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based artist who typically works with oil paintings. Meggs happens to be a friend of mine, and I was startled when she emailed me out of the blue inquiring about NFTs. Every week she has a Zoom call with other artists from her studio, and more and more they talk about NFTs.  As Marion Maneker observes on ArtNews, “The first unspoken rule of talking about art on Clubhouse is that all conversations eventually lead to obsessing over NFTs.” It makes sense that artists are early adopters. “Artists are often onto wonderful things before the broader population,” says Meggs, such as “renting studios in neighborhoods ahead of the neighborhoods becoming hot.”  87% of major American museum collections are from men – 85% from white men. NFTs, in theory, could level the field.  Meggs is excited about making her own NFTs, about the creative possibilities they offer, and about their potential to make the art world more inclusive – particularly for women and people of color. She points out that 87% of major American museum collections are from men – 85% from white men. NFTs, in theory, could level the field. They provide a direct link between creator and collector, removing the gateways that have long demonstrated bias.  “I want to make artwork,” says Meggs, “not spend my entire life and psyche fighting a heavily prejudiced system where I have to rely on key-holders – at incredibly biased arts institutions – to open any doors for credibility and success.” She says that “NFTs feel like a wonderful new world that is full of possibility, rather than slamming doors.”  Meggs isn’t naive. She knows crypto, historically, is just as male-skewed as the art world. But she’s hopeful. “I’m urgently encouraging all of the women artists I know to dive right into making NFTs,” she says. “This is an opportunity!” (In a follow-up email, Meggs also noted that many artists are agonizing over the environmental costs of NFTs, conveyed in this blistering post.)  Vandalism  Artists are incentivized by another feature of NFTs: the ability to collect royalties. That’s a gap in today’s world. Let’s say you’re a young artist who sells an oil painting for $1,000. You suspect it’s worth more, but whatever, you need to pay rent. Then you get famous. Thirty years later your painting sells for $30 million. Your royalties in the current world? Nothing. Nada. (It’s different overseas. “Droit de suite, aka Artists Resale Right, provides a resale fee to artists or their heirs … and is common in many countries internationally, especially in Europe. But unfortunately in America we only have a first-sale doctrine,” says Meggs.)  With NFTs, the royalty can be programmed into the piece via smart contract, so you earn a slice of the revenue every time your painting is sold, in perpetuity. When Boyart’s “Contemplations of the Red Jester” sold for 75 ETH – from one art collector to another – he pocketed a 5% cut.  The same concepts apply to music. Just ask “Vandal,” a Canadian hip-hop artist and producer. In 2017, he dropped a track, called “Rap Crypto,” that’s something of a time capsule from the last bull run, with lyrics like “Rap Crypto Y’all Know Bitcoin … See I’m Vandal, the Token Wrapper … Follow me as I go Rambo, to the moon in my brand new Lambo … Could it be that I’m Satoshi Nakamoto?” (The video looks semi-satirical; he’s in on the joke.)  On our Zoom, he wears a red beanie and a gray goatee. When Vandal first heard about CryptoKitties he shrugged them off – “What the heck is this, collectible cats?” – but then he saw the broader potential. He began exploring audio NFTs, he became fascinated by DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and soon he launched DAO Records, which has recruited 100 musicians and released around 50 audio NFTs. (Vandal is quick to point out that he’s not the first artist to mint music-based NFTs, and considers Connie Digital “the OG of audio NFTs.”)  For Vandal, audio NFTs are not just a clever gimmick, a fad or a cute way to make a buck. “The current music industry model is broken,” he says, a problem that dates back to the days of Napster. “Then Apple came along and decided an MP3 is worth 99 cents. Who gave them the right to decide how much music is worth? [That] devalued music quite a bit.” Streaming on Spotify or YouTube is not much better, as “they pay out so little to the artists, and take so much. There’s no sharing. There’s no interaction with the fans,” he says.  NFTs solve all of these problems, says Vandal. The artists can price their music however they choose. “The NFT is a direct link to the fan … You can give them whatever you want to offer.” It’s a way to build loyalty, grow the community, and wean yourself from the platforms (and labels) that are beyond your control. This helps explain the newfound interest in NFTs from artists like Kings of Leon, who recently announced plans to release an album as an NFT. You can bundle the NFTs with real-world perks. As Rolling Stone first reported, the most exclusive NFTs will include a “golden ticket” so token holders are guaranteed “four front-row seats to any Kings of Leon concert during each tour for life.”  It’s so exciting, it really liberates people.  Kings of Leon isn’t the only group looking into NFT ticketing. “It’s a beautiful use case,” says Carolin Wend, co-founder of Mintbase, a Lisbon-based NFT platform. She explains that ticket-based NFTs (TNFTs?) give the organizers of events, like a music festival, the ability to easily split revenue among the partners.  Let’s say you’re a festival promoter. You can tell the DJ, “You’ll get 5% of every ticket sold,” and then the reggae band gets 5%. The landlord gets 10%. And so on. The payments would be immediate, transparent and all confirmed and verifiable on a blockchain. “It’s so exciting, it really liberates people,” says Wend. “It allows people in the creative economy to have a fair income.”  It will likely be some time before the likes of Coachella or Ultra fully embrace the idea of NFT tickets, just as it’s unlikely that NFTs will fully “disrupt” the traditional art world anytime soon. For perspective, Misha Libman, of Snark.Art, says the art market itself is around $60 billion in annual sales. “Digital art is less than half a percent of that at the moment,” he says. “It’s almost non-existent in the traditional market.”  See also: Nyan Cat NFT Sells for 300 ETH, Opening Door to the ‘Meme Economy’  To get the temperature of the traditional art world, I spoke with a man who embodies tradition and who art enthusiasts will recognize as the ""Antiques Roadshow"" appraiser on PBS. Nicholas Lowry is known for his bold plaid suits and handlebar mustache, and as the principal auctioneer of Swann Auction Galleries, New York’s oldest indigenous auction house.  “The funny thing is, NFTs sprang on my radar all at once from six different places,” says Lowry. Suddenly, everyone began telling him about NFTs. They kept forwarding him articles. “If this were a marketing campaign, or an ad campaign for a car or a clothing brand, they would have somehow hit the jackpot,” he says, clearly amused. “I thought, holy s**t, the whole world is talking about this.”  So is he ready to jump on the trend? Lowry pauses. “We are not a cutting-edge technological company,” he says. “I don’t want to be the first one to do it, but I also don’t want to be the last one to do it.”  He is in “wait and see” mode. Maybe it’s the future, but maybe it’s just something of a fad. “When it’s not the Elon Musks who are buying the stuff, we’ll see if it still has legs.”  My very first NFT  One reason for the boom in the market is that now it’s easy to whip up your own NFTs. “Today, anybody can take a photograph of their plant, mint it and then immediately list it on an exchange and try to sell it,” says Libman.  So I decided to try just that.  I recently moved into a new place in Denver, and because I’m a single guy I didn’t have anything to put on the walls. So I picked some of my favorite travel photos to blow up and frame, and I settled on a 30” by 50” shot of a glacier, from Iceland, to anchor my largest wall.  Maybe I could sell this image as an NFT? If I thought it has enough real-life value to hang on a gigantic wall as a piece of art, maybe others will feel the same? I also wanted to get a first-hand taste of how this really worked.  I quickly create an account on OpenSea. The on-boarding process is easy and quick, just as advertised. When prompted to list my starting price for an auction, the lowest the site will let me enter is 0.4 ETH, or $540 at the time, an astonishingly high figure which I found hilarious. (You can either list it for a lower set price or start an auction, and this was the auction’s minimum starting point. It’s also entirely possible that I did it wrong.) But then again, maybe $540 for this NFT photo, why not? So much of cryptocurrency is premised on the notion that if people believe it has value, then it has value. Even Dogecoin now has value. Maybe some sucker would believe my photo has 0.4 ETH worth of value, so they would buy it and then, voila, it would?  Soaring gas fees are a widespread problem in the space.  Before posting my listing there’s just one tiny hitch. I need to pay a one-time gas fee to OpenSea that sets up the Ethereum smart contract for all of my future sales. At the time, this fee was $91. Soaring gas fees are a widespread problem in the space, and it’s one reason some NFT platforms are using different blockchains (NBA Top Shot uses Flow, for example).  “Normal people would never spend $50 to mint an NFT,” says Wend, which is why Mintbase is switching to a blockchain platform called NEAR. “I believe that Ethereum has been a great test ground for many people, but it’s not the future,” she says. “It’s simply too expensive and bloated.” (Ethereum advocates, of course, have their eyes on Ethereum 2.0.)  See also: Brady Dale - NFTs Aren’t Art? OK, Boomer  The posting of my stupid photo has suddenly become a pricey bit of fact-checking, but I swallowed and went ahead with the transaction. When my new NFT is minted I watch it appear in the stream of new OpenSea listings. They appear every second, an assembly line of pixelated trinkets, like crypto toys made by Satoshi’s little elves. It provides a real-time glimpse into the staggering growth of this space.  The NFT marketplace was right about at least one thing: My lousy photo was worth nowhere near 0.4 ETH. It didn’t sell in the auction. So I re-listed it for 0.01 ETH, or $16. As of publication, it has still not sold.  Status symbols  Let’s switch to the buyers. Why exactly are people forking over thousands of dollars for low-res art that’s not quite as advanced as Pac-Man? I had assumed there were two possible reasons: People truly appreciated the digital art for its own aesthetic pleasure, or they thought it would make them money.  Then I learned of a third explanation. I spoke with Jamie Burke, the CEO of Outlier Ventures, a blockchain investment firm – venture capital, accelerator programs, that kind of thing – headquartered in London. Burke moonlights as a prolific collector of NFTs, and he knows the community well. He started an invite-only Discord channel called “100XARt,” which is something of a who’s who of the biggest NFT collectors, and they worked to create an art district in Decentraland. Burke’s theory on why people buy NFTs? The status of belonging to a community.  “You can think of NFTs as a form of social currency,” says Burke. In certain crypto circles, they’re proof that you get it. You belong. When Burke first saw the early highly pixilated NFT art, such as CryptoPunks, he didn’t love the aesthetic. He found it too self-referential. He even said to himself, “This is not something I would want on my wall.”  After he talked to more collectors in the community, he quickly realized the NFTs had little to do with the content itself. The mere fact of ownership is what matters. “To own a CryptoPunk is to claim that you were into the first form of NFTs, and that you understood [it] before everybody else.” It is, quite literally, a digital badge of honor.  This reminds Burke of the reason people bought LP albums back in the day. Sure, maybe part of the reason you bought the album is that warm and crackly romance of the sound, but you also bought it as a beloved artifact. And the artifact gave you status within your record-loving community.  “Think about what the internet did. Digital music destroyed all of that,” he says. “Music became something you just streamed and consumed … The idea of owning music was lost.” So while NFTs might be a radical new technology, in a sense they are tapping into something primal and old, into what Burke calls “a real human longing.”  To own a CryptoPunk is to claim that you were into the first form of NFTs, and that you understood [it] before everybody else.  Or in a less charitable take, splurging on NFTs is a way to flaunt your crypto wealth. Just ask the guy (and it’s almost certainly a guy) who goes by “GMoney.ETH” on Twitter. This person paid a cool 140 ETH (around $150,000 at the time) for a 24 X 24 pixelated CryptoPunk, one of the original and most iconic forms of crypto art. They look like Atari graphics from 1983. (For those interested in the origins of CryptoPunks, you’ll find an engrossing deep dive from Jessica Klein and BreakerMag.)  As GMoney explains in a Twitter thread, after he spent more time in the online crypto community, he realized that “it’s almost like being part of some exclusive club, being a CP [CryptoPunk] owner.” Then he gets to the quick of it: “When someone buys a Rolex in the real world, they don't spend thousands of dollars [because] of the watch’s utility value. A simple $5 watch could perform the same utility. It is to ‘flex’ their status, to convey, ‘Hey look, I’m well off, I can afford this expensive watch.’”  GMoney bought his version of a Rolex, but unlike a glitzy watch – which could be a cheap knockoff – his CryptoPunk’s authenticity can be verified on the blockchain. Then again, it’s a near lock the Rolex will still hold value in a decade. The jury’s still out on CryptoPunks.  But even if the speculative bubble pops, it seems fair to say NFTs offer something of value – even if that value is just emotional – to both artists like Boyart and to collectors like Burke. They can be a means to create, to play, to communicate, to organize, to view beauty. “When you look at the bull run of 2017, what drove things was the media news stories of people getting rich. That was one-dimensional. It fizzled out,” says Burke. When people stopped making money, people left. With NFTs, he says, “It’s not just about the money. It’s much more sustainable.”  And there are many, of course, who will grumble and say that most of these NFTs – the pixelated frogs, the memes, the crypto irony – are simply “not art.” Maybe that’s true. But as NFT advocates like to argue, people said the same thing about Andy Warhol’s can of tomato soup.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/07/how-nfts-became-art-and-everything-became-an-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98b99a29af93cac3cd925a8a8513f4c8833154e2-1994x1330.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433844,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP5iZh,1615137073,Goldman Digital Asset Lead Sees Mergers Ahead for Crypto Infrastructure Providers,"A Goldman Sachs executive predicts there may be consolidation coming for cryptocurrency infrastructure providers as the market matures.      In a recent company podcast, Matt McDermott, global head of digital assets for Goldman Sachs Global Markets Division, hinted that “incumbent banks” – like Goldman – could face pressure to increase their crypto business lines, with one obvious path being mergers and acquisitions.      “This is a fast-evolving landscape where the crypto incumbents have certainly made huge progress over the last couple of years,” McDermott said. “There is an expectation from clients now that the incumbent banks will develop their offerings to satisfy that demand. And so, certainly anticipate a certain amount of consolidation across that space.”      Goldman has had a bullish view on bitcoin and other crypto assets since at least 2014, once calling these monetary technologies part of a “megatrend” moving to disrupt finance as we know it. At times, the bank has seemed to favor blockchain technology over individual assets like bitcoin.      That has changed in the last three to six months, however, as institutions (from “hedge funds, to asset managers, to macro funds, to banks, to corporate treasurers, insurance and pension funds,” McDermott said) show an increasing appetite for bitcoin.      To meet that growing demand, Goldman said it will revitalize its crypto trading desk, announced in 2017, but shelved months later due to regulatory concerns. The offering could see light as early as mid-March, CoinDesk reported, though “will be quite narrow initially,” according to McDermott.      The bank will offer Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures and non-deliverable forwards, he said, as well as disseminate “bitcoin content” to institutional clients. CME offers cash-settled bitcoin contracts, meaning that traders never take physical possession of the underlying asset.      Asked “what's kept Goldman and others from taking a bigger role in crypto?” McDermott replied there are restrictions in place preventing banks from dealing directly with the commody. Which is a shame, because there is reportedly increasing demand, particularly, from macro-focused hedge funds, to “access the physical,” McDermott said.  “That's been something that we've had to think cleverly how we can facilitate that demand in a different way,” he said. “We're seeing certain banks [in Asia] look at developing institutional exchanges and other avenues to execute the physical with institutional clients.”      McDermott didn’t go into detail about what exactly is preventing U.S.-based banks from “trading the physical.” In 2020, former acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Brian Brooks, put forward a number of progressive policies that would allow banks to safely enter the industry.      In several interpretative letters Brooks opened the door for banks to custody cryptocurrencies, take on stablecoin clients and even act as nodes on public blockchain networks. Spot trading crypto, however, appears to be out of the question, according to McDermott.      See also: Few Banks Will Touch Crypto Firms, but Silvergate Wants to Touch Bitcoin Itself      In the podcast, McDermott noted that a recent survey of 300 Goldman clients found that 40% already have exposure to crypto, either through holding the asset directly, derivatives or securities products. The survey also found 32% were most interested in prime brokerage for physical or spot to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.      “Talking to those clients, they're much clearer on why they want to invest. Really, what they're interested in is broader market behavior. And really identifying what are the most efficient ways for them to get exposure and to think about hedging,” McDermott said.      “In terms of kind of institutional demand, we have seen no signs of that abating,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/07/goldman-digital-asset-lead-sees-mergers-ahead-for-crypto-infrastructure-providers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/825b76dd5479b8d986e97868f6dc837d4d6e17ab-1500x897.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

It’s quite possibly a record for any company in the crypto market (JPMorgan has been noted for its enthusiastic blockchain hiring in the past).      The majority of the job openings, posted this month and last, are in the U.S., India and Singapore. Many of the jobs relate directly to Onyx, the division created last October to oversee JPM coin, the bank's wholesale payments token.      A number of the blockchain engineer roles are focused on integrating both JPM coin and Liink (previously known as the blockchain-based Interbank Information Network, and which now counts more than 400 other banks as participants) into JPMorgan’s payments architecture.      When Onyx was launched, JPMorgan said the new division had about 100 jobs.      JPMorgan did not respond to requests for comment by press time.      Recently, big banks have been making noise about entering the cryptocurrency market, looking at areas such as crypto custody and potentially the trading of digital assets. While JPMorgan has been relatively quiet on those fronts, clearly it has a lot going on behind the scenes with payments.      In contrast to JPMorgan’s 56 “blockchain” job search results, Goldman Sachs, which recently told Reuters it was restarting its crypto trading desk, has just two blockchain/cryptocurrency job openings. Morgan Stanley also has two blockchain jobs open, and BNY Mellon shows four positions with blockchain and digital assets in the title.
