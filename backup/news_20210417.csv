42386511,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdZx,1618703452,Coinbase CEO Sold $291.8M in Shares on Opening Day,"Coinbase insiders and early investors sold about $5 billion in shares in total during the leading cryptocurrency exchange's first day of trading on the Nasdaq earlier this week, according to series of filings made Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    CEO Brian Armstrong sold 749,999 shares in three batches at prices ranging from $381 to $410.40 per for total proceeds of $291.8 million, according to one filing. While a Coinbase representative declined to comment due to the company being in a so-called ""quiet period,"" based on filings made before the listing, it would indicate Armstrong sold about 1.5% of his stake.  In another SEC filing, it was disclosed that Coinbase director and venture capitalist Fred Wilson sold 4.70 million shares for proceeds of $1.82 billion. While it's not clear how much of Coinbase Wilson still holds, he's listed on the filing as a holder of at least 10% of the shares of Coinbase, which has a market cap of $63.6 billion.  Union Square Ventures, the VC firm led by Wilson, sold 4.70 million shares from its 2012 fund for proceeds of $1.82 billion, according to another filing. The fund is also listed as a 10% owner of Coinbase shares.  Together, the sales by Wilson and his firm's fund accounted for more than two-thirds of the $5 billion worth of shares sold.  Software engineer and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who is a Coinbase director as well as a holder of more than 10% of the exchange's shares, together with his firm Andreessen Horowitz and two associated entities sold a total of 1.18 million shares for $449.2 million, according to various filings (here, here, here and here).  An important thing to keep in mind is that selling by insiders was sort of the whole point of Coinbase's direct listing; it's from where the shares were supposed to come. The only thing new here is exactly who sold what and for how much. Unlike an initial public offering in which new shares are issued by the company with the proceeds going to its treasury, in a direct listing, the public is only offered existing shares that are held by insiders.  Even though a company gains no proceeds from a direct listing, it does benefit in other ways. In addition to allowing insiders to profit, a direct listing is a tremendous PR event and, more tangibly, vastly broadens the pool of holders while enabling the company to more easily raise capital in the future. As Noelle Acheson, CoinDesk's director of research, put it so well, ""A direct listing is a liquidity event; an IPO is a capital-raising event.""  Read more: Coinbase ‘IPO’ Isn’t an IPO.

42386515,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBTdgF,1618668928,"Retail Traders Drove Bitcoin Higher Leading Up to Coinbase Listing, Data Shows","Bitcoin’s price rally in the days leading up to Coinbase’s hotly anticipated debut on the Nasdaq this week was largely driven by retail traders eager to get in on the action while whales were happy to take their money and swim away, blockchain data shows.      The number of unique addresses holding at least 0.01 coins rose from 8.96 million to over 9 million in the five days to April 14, alongside bitcoin's ascent from $59,000 to a record high of $64,801.79, according to data provided by the blockchain analytics firm Glassnode. The count of addresses with non-zero balance and ones holding least 0.1 coins also rose in tandem with the price.      Meanwhile, those with a minimum balance of 1,000 BTC – also known as the ""Rich List"" – dropped from 2,240 to 2,228. The tally of ""whole coiners,"" or addresses with a minimum balance of one coin, fell amid the price rise.      ""The pre-Coinbase IPO rally was driven by retail investors, in mass,"" Flex Yang, CEO of Hong Kong-based Babel Finance, said in an email. ""We saw that the continuing decline of whales on the network further indicated that the decentralization of the Bitcoin network was really taking place.""      Some readers may argue that the diverging trends in the growth of small and large balance addresses may mearly represent the trend of whales holding coins in several addresses to mitigate hacking risks. A single user can store coins in multiple addresses. Similarly, exchange addresses have coins belonging to more than one individual.      However, Glassnode's whale entities metric, which clusters crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 bitcoin to provide a more precise estimate of the actual number of holders, also points to continued liquidation by large traders during the cryptocurrency's move to record highs.      The number of whale entities fell to a 3.5-month low of 2,228 on April 14. The metric decoupled from the rising price in February and dropped by 10% to 2,232 seen in the seven weeks to March 31.      It shows retail investors' high level of engagement began in the first quarter and continues to the present.      Some observers, however, say these charts do not provide sufficient information, leaving the doors open for guesswork.      ""The whale entities chart could show that smaller retail investors are purchasing bitcoin, and large holders are selling into that rally,"" Gavin Smith, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Panxora, told CoinDesk in LinkedIn chat. ""It could also be showing that a smaller number of large investors is buying bitcoin, so the large entities' concentration is increasing.""      According to Smith, the latter is the case. ""We are seeing some very large investors moving into the market, and their assets are concentrated in a small number of fund and custodial accounts. Retail involvement has been lower this cycle than in 2017,"" Smith said.      Also read: Week in Review: Turkey’s Crypto Payments Ban, Morgan Stanley, Coinbase, Markets Check and More      Whatever the case, the path of least resistance for bitcoin remains on the higher side, as the ""suits [institutions] are here to stay,"" as CoinDesk's research analysts noted in the first quarter review. Options traders continue to accumulate the $80,000 call option in a sign of strengthening bullish conviction on the top cryptocurrency.

2804454,https://eng.ambcrypto.com/?p=77174,1618631739,How sustainable is YFI's current price run?,"The past week saw a lot of growth across the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing their values pushed towards new all-time highs. However, it is safe to say that the digital assets market is no longer just about the top two cryptos in the market, with DeFi coins such as YFI registering significant gains on the charts. Over the past 6 months, YFI has seen its price hike by over 520 percent. Now, while this looks extremely promising for the alt, the truth seems to be in yet another shade of grey. The price hike from over $11k in November 2020 to its press time valuation of $48,415 has been less than straightforward. Akin to many other altcoins in the market, YFI too has endured extended periods of the price going back and forth. However, given the current market scenario, how sustainable is YFI's current price or is history going to repeat itself in the form of yet another short-term price correction? Interestingly, data provided by Santiment highlighted that despite the bullish nature of the YFI market, there may be a bit of FUD finally creeping into the market as the price continues to remain close to the $50k-level. In such a scenario, what YFI really needs is a strong level of support for the price if bearishness is to soon hit the market. Source: Santiment Taking a look at a few of the key fundamentals can provide more clarity on where the price is likely to head in the coming weeks. According to data provided by Santiment, YFI's supply on exchanges has been stagnant for a while and hasn't been increasing. While fewer coins in exchanges are normally a good sign of hodling, in the case of YFI, if one were to take a look at past precedents, the price decline began as soon as the supply hit a stalemate. Source: Santiment Additionally, the analytics platform also pointed out that the current price rally began with low on-chain activity for the coin. However, over the past few weeks, a trend reversal has emerged, with on-chain activity noting a surge and the price continuing to be inversely relational to it. With the price inching closer to its ATH, there is always the question of price discovery. YFI seemed to be lacking in this regard, at press time. The coin's MVRV, as per Santiment's data, placed it in the danger zone and prime for a new trend reversal, one that can induce a short-term price correction. Source: Santiment In the coming days, if the price correction does set in, YFI's $44k-price level may end up being a key support level for the coin. However, if this level is flipped to resistance in the coming weeks, a lot of the upward momentum and price surge YFI saw over the past few months might be undone. This, once again, will result in YFI's price continuing its current trend by which the coin will be subject to strong 'push and pulls' at regular intervals.
