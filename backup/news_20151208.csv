42378445,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGIL,1449592818,Is Segregated Witness the Answer to Bitcoin’s Block Size Debate?,"A newly introduced proposal for how the bitcoin network can be scaled to handle greater transaction volumes is gaining traction in its once divided development community.  Called segregated witness, the proposal was debuted by Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong on 7th December. Arriving to general acclaim, it has already been hailed as a ""turning point"" by technologist Andreas Antonopoulos and positioned by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell as a solution that could provide a fourfold increase in capacity to the network in a ""short time frame"".  Most notable about segregated witness is that, unlike other proposed bitcoin improvements, it can be introduced to the network as a soft fork, meaning that it would avoid forcing all those running the bitcoin software to upgrade their clients in near-unison, thereby reducing the risk an upgrade splits the bitcoin blockchain.  That this could be accomplished has come as a surprise to many in the community, which has been embroiled in debate on how to scale the network in line with the ambitions of a startup sector which has attracted nearly $1bn in investments in 2015.  Wuille himself said in his talk that he had dismissed segregated witness as “non-viable” until recently, when it was revealed that it can be implemented as either a hard or soft fork, and there is growing consensus in the community that a soft fork is a preferred path to a solution.  Even more objective observers such as Digital Asset Holdings senior developer Miron Cuperman told CoinDesk:  “There’s consensus that a soft fork is better. You can deploy it much sooner, because you just need the large majority, and in a hard fork you have to upgrade everyone. It’s a straightforward idea, the concept is not that risky or complicated.”  At an open developer meetup hosted at Cyberport in Hong Kong today, the solution was widely seen positively, though a certain minority expressed their concern that it would delay a hard fork – a process they believe will eventually be needed for later scaling solutions.  Others, such as developer and hosted mining service provider Jonathan Toomim, argued that the segregated witness proposal was perhaps best implemented via a hard fork to improve its design and overall functionality.  “My attitude is it’s ugly and awkward and that this is not a way that’s intuitive. I just see that they’re putting segregated witness here because it will be a soft fork, but that is better off as a hard fork, where it will be more elegant and safer,” he told CoinDesk.  The segregated witness code has already been introduced as a hard fork in Sidechain Elements, a sandbox in which developers can experiment with its proposed sidechains functionality and features.  Nonetheless, Wuille said he will move forward with formalizing the idea as a bitcoin improvement protocol (BIP) so it can be more widely discussed by the larger bitcoin community.  He told CoinDesk expects this to be completed in a ""number of weeks"", though the exact timeline is not yet clear.  The segregated witness solution  Segregated witness is perhaps best described as a novel workaround to the block size issue that affects how certain network variables are counted toward block size.  In bitcoin, transactions include one or more input fields showing where the funds come from, one or more output fields indicating where they’re going and a signature that validates that the owner had the ability to execute the transaction.  ""Now signatures go into the 'from' field,"" Lightning Network developer Tadge Dryja explained. ""[In segregated witness] the signature is separate.""  More specifically, segregated witness takes the signature out of the transaction and puts the data into a Merkle tree in the coinbase component of the transaction, or the input of a generated transaction. This change would make transactions appear smaller to current nodes on the network, so that more could be included in a bitcoin block, even if blocks are still limited to 1MB by protocol rules.  “If the signatures would add 0.75MB [of capacity] to a block to a 1MB block, it would now be equivalent to 4MB,” developer Doug Roark said, echoing the description put forth by Maxwell and Wuille.  Dryja noted that a soft fork would mean parties running older versions of Bitcoin Core could still use bitcoin, even if it would appear to them as if users were sending money without signatures.  “Nodes today only see the transaction Merkle root and the transaction data, which today includes the signature,” David Vorick, CEO of distributed storage startup Nebulous, explained. “If segregated witness were to be implemented, today’s nodes would not see the transaction signature data, because it would be in a storage area that they don’t recognize.”  Older nodes that have not updated their software would still however be able to monitor the network, though it would appear as if certain parties are behaving abnormally.  ""[In a soft fork] nothing changes, my coins are still the same, which is different than everyone must upgrade their software or it stops working,"" Dryja said. ""Things start looking really weird, but they can ignore these transactions.""  Tangential benefits  Another proposed benefit to segregated witness was that it would allow for other scaling proposals to be more effectively implemented.  Dryja, for example, told CoinDesk that segregated witness would allow his proposed version of payment channels to reach their maximum efficiency based on projections he presented on day two of the event.  Segregated witness would also fix transaction malleability, a longstanding issue on the network whereby when transactions are signed, the signature does not cover all the data in the transaction.  “Without segregated witness, if one of us puts money into the address, the other party can resign the transaction, changing the transaction ID,” Dryja indicated. “When you resign in segregated witness, the signatures are not in the transactions.”  Transaction malleability  is perhaps most widely known as the source of controversy during the collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, which sought to claim the issue was the cause of withdrawal issues before its collapse.  Mining problems  However, fixing transaction malleability this way could have the side effect of at least temporarily destabilizing other parts of the network.  Toomim was the most vocal in his concerns that the design of segregated witness could have an impact on the mining community that has perhaps not been properly evaluated.  Of issue, Toomim said, is that miners use coinbase messages in blocks to include vital information for their business. This includes votes on various BIP proposals and bookkeeping details such as the fact they mined the block in which the coins were included.  ""It’s co-opting a resource that is already being used for a lot of things, and that resource was not designed for that,"" he argued.  Since the coinbase is also the first part of data blocks compiled by miners today, Toomim said that adding signatures to this field would make it dependent on other information in the block, which could potentially complicate mining software.  Overall, he said he was excited about the idea, but that these effects could be averted if segregated witness was implemented as a hard fork.  With this design, he explained, block headers could contain merkle roots wherein one side of the tree would contain transactions, and the other would contain signature data, creating a mirrored structure that would be more easily scaled. By comparison, as a soft fork, the merkle tree containing transactions would be added to the coinbase.  While a minority view, the comments could gain relevance given the emphasis developers at the event put on seeking solutions for a block size that would not affect mining profitability.  Political football  But while segregated witness has attracted enthusiasm, there is some suggestion it could become the focal point for a larger discussion on whether the community needs to solve its scalability issues with a hard fork for academic reasons.  Such a view was most loudly voiced by Core developer Jeff Garzik in his talk on BIP proposals on day one of Scaling Bitcoin. There, he made the argument that there is a lack of data on how a distributed economic system like bitcoin would react when faced with this challenge.  Under any proposal, changing the cap on block size would require a hard fork, meaning that such instances are likely to occur, perhaps regularly, as bitcoin scales. Given this, some were more blunt in their criticism of the reluctance to pursue this path.  ""The Core devs haven’t done a hard fork. They’re afraid of it. They need to get over it. I don’t think the hard fork-soft fork is really an issue,"" Toomim said.  Dryja’s opinion represented the more moderate view that any chosen scaling initiative should provide additional necessary technical fixes to the network.  ""They’ve wanted to fix malleability for years,"" he said. ""We want to have more capacity. If we’re gonna make this change, why don’t we also fix a bunch of other stuff?""

42378453,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGNN,1449577968,Brock Pierce: Bitcoin Foundation 'Close To Running Out of Money',"UPDATE (15th December 20:38 BST): Article updated to show that Peter Vessenes disputes the foundation's claim that it's owed expenses from him.      The Bitcoin Foundation will soon run out of funds, the foundation's board was told at a meeting on 20th October.  The meeting's minuteshttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/bitcoin-foundation-board-meeting-minutes-10-20-15/, published yesterday, show that board chairman Brock Pierce opened the event with the declaration that the Foundation is ""close to running out of money"".  Further disclosures during the meeting show that it is struggling to generate significant revenue. Its last event, the third instalment of its DevCore workshops series held in San Mateo, California on 16th October, earned just $2,000 in sponsorship fees.  The foundation has embarked on cost-cutting measures to staunch the flow of cash. September board meeting minutes show that it was spending ""5 to 10%"" of the ""previous budget"". The foundation was spending $150,000 a month as recently as last May, according to minutes released at the time. It was operating with a different board and staff led by then executive director Jon Matonis.  Burn rates and runway  Current foundation spending would stand at $7,500 a month, based on 5% of a $150,000 monthly budget. The foundation had a balance of $59,000, according to minutes from the July board meeting. Based on these estimates, the foundation has funds until next March.  Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton said at the October meeting:  ""We need to do serious fundraising ... Revenue is key, we can't do much more to cut expenses.""  The foundation currently employs two part-time staff. Fenton runs the organisation as a volunteer. The board pinned much of the expenditure on commitments made by the previous regime. This included vendor invoices, past employee expenses, paid vacation expenses and legal bills.  A new board was elected in March amid drama. Candidates complained about an overhaul of the voting system, poor voter outreach and allegations that the organisation was bankrupt.  Disputes over unsettled payments were also aired at the October meeting. Interim executive director Patrick Murck is yet to be reimbursed $12,000 in travel expenses for attending a DevCore workshop in London in April. Former chairman Peter Vessenes meanwhile still owes the foundation between $8,000 and $18,000, depending on whether his claims of unpaid travel expenses are accepted. Vessenes disputes this.  Missing bitcoins?  The foundation's monetary woes are compounded by the fact that some of its bitcoins may have been lost, according to Fenton.  The organisation had an early Avalon miner, which should have generated significant bitcoin holdings. But Fenton was pessimistic about tracking and recovering any potentially lost coins, although Pierce suggested contacting a blockchain analytics company to attempt to trace any lost funds.  The meeting also discussed ways to make more money off the DevCore workshops, including a share of revenue by partnering with conference organiser Inside Bitcoins. A similar idea was mooted to partner with this publication at the September meetinghttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/bitcoin-foundation-board-meeting-minutes-9-16-15/, but CoinDesk never received a proposal from the foundation.  Pierce wrapped up the meeting by asking board members to pledge to raise $10,000 each before the next meeting in a months' time. Only Bobby Lee, chief executive of BTCC said yes. Jim Harper, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said he would ""do what he could"" while entrepreneur Olivier Janssens demurred, citing the foundation's poor image as a major obstacle.  In response, Pierce tried to rally his board, underlining the seriousness of the foundation's financial problems:  ""We are the Foundation, we have no resources, this is us, if you don’t like the foundation as it stands, you don’t like yourself ... each board member should be prepared to do the work themselves, to keep the Foundation going.""  Fenton pledged a $10,000 donation of his own money if the rest of the board were committed to the exercise. Ribbit Capital's Micky Malka and BitPay's Elizabeth Ploshay were absent.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/08/brock-pierce-bitcoin-foundation-close-to-running-out-of-money,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/33e5d3a1c8cfba54c6af8242449c2b67b8925c90-937x676.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378460,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7iGUv,1449554823,Bitcoin Startup BitX Extends Series A With Undisclosed Funding,"Bitcoin exchange and wallet provider BitX has extended its Series A round to include undisclosed funding from Southeast Asia-focused VC firm Venturra Capital.  According to BitX, the funding will be invested in recruitment and product development, as well as expanding the service beyond its current target consumers in markets including Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and South Africa.  BitX declined to release the size of the funding, but stated that the capital was secondary to bringing Venturra Capital on as an investor.  ""With our lean structure and very low cost base, the funds we have raised equate to a lot more when compared to similar rounds raised by companies in the US and Singapore,"" CEO Marcus Swanepoel explained.  Swanepoel told CoinDesk BitX is seeing its biggest growth in Southeast Asia, and that the round was continued to add an ""influential and well-respected local regional partner"". Regardless, he stressed that BitX remains global in its focus as it seeks to expand.  ""We see a lot more potential for bitcoin in emerging markets than developed markets,"" he said. ""Markets like Southeast Asia are important markets for us but not exclusive.""  BitX had previously raised $4m in July 2015 in a round led by Naspers Group and including Digital Currency Group (DCG). That funding followed a $824,000 deal in August 2014 that included Ariadne Capital, DCG and angel investor Carol Realini.
