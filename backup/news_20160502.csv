42399007,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhykQ,1462228842,Is Blockchain a Better Payments Rail? Panelists Divided at Consensus 2016,"Distributed ledgers are often referred to as a new database technology, but could they come to replace existing payments rails?  The subject was the center of discussion among Julio Faura of Spanish megabank Santander; Marwan Forzley of blockchain payments startup Align Commerce; Gys Gyman of global consultancy Deloitte; Chris Larsen of distributed ledger leader Ripple; and Elizabeth Rossiello of bitcoin payments startup BitPesa today, the group representing a mix of financial incumbents and startups.  Chief among the discussion points was defining current challenges in existing payment rails and how technologies like blockchain, and specifically the bitcoin blockchain, could benefit such services.  Rossiello offered the strongest opinion as to why problems in the system could benefit from public blockchain technology, drawing from her experience as a startup leader working in Africa.  She explained:  ""If you think about a transfer from the US to Senegal, you want to know what the transfer rate will be. They’ll let you know in 14 days.""  Bitcoin as a rail  There were, clearly, differing opinions on the stage about how bitcoin fits into this role, however, given that only one participant works actively with the protocol, BitPesa.  ""Without bitcoin and the bitcoin community, I would not be able to pay my employees or run my business,"" she explained.  On the other hand, Faura at Santander didn't buy into the idea that bitcoin could become more than an experiment.  ""By itself, it is a great self-contained experiment. But when you try to work with existing rails and gateways and in people’s lives, my opinion of bitcoin gets a little small. It’s better to go with something like Ripple because with bitcoin, you have different people and different levels of legality,"" he said.  Distributed ledger alternatives  But the ultimate discussion when it comes to using a cryptocurrency is the ability to transfer in and out of it, Align Commerce's Forzley said.  He explained the reason Align Commerce used bitcoin to facilitate its cross-border payments between small businesses is due to the system's strong liquidity.  Forzley said:  ""The thing with bitcoin is that it is liquid enough that you can do transactions. The more the network is liquid, the more you can scale payments.""  For future developers and startup owners, the panel had a few key details to consider when launching a payment provider.  Hoffman and Larsen echoed each other, stating that developers must think about the solution and not the technology. Specifically, understand the full scope and then determine which rail is the right one.  Ultimately, Rossiello summed it up:  ""If you’re going to come in to a big company with a drastically different technology with questionable regulation, you better come in with great cost savings.""

42399006,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhymO,1462227027,"Glenn Hutchins: Blockchain is Good, Bitcoin is Important","Silver Lake co-founder and Federal Reserve Bank of New York board member Glenn Hutchins took the stage at Consensus 2016 to deliver an overarching speech about why public blockchains like bitcoin still matter in the age of big bank ledger efforts today.  A director for both telecommunications giant AT&T and US stock market Nasdaq, Hutchins provided a unique perspective on bitcoin’s history and future for the packed audience of roughly 1,500 attendees during his solo keynote.  In his remarks, Hutchins compared bitcoin to the Internet, and private permissioned blockchains to Intranets, citing the crucial role such private systems played during the transition to the web in the 1990s, but cautioning their impact will be limited.  Hutchins told the audience:  ""Disconnected from the digital currency, blockchain exists more like an intranet. Intranet was quite important, but the transformative value was only when all those intranets were connected into an Internet.""  Hutchins indicated that bitcoins could come to serve as the ""boxcars"" for finance, comparing distributed ledgers to the new ""railroads"" in terms of how they could enable economic development.  The investor went on to say that he had personally bought bitcoin and that he was in the midst of investing in bitcoin companies as part of forthcoming Series A and Series B rounds. Hutchins announced last week that he had joined the board of directors at industry-focused VC firm Digital Currency Group.  The talk stood out even on a day that saw a number of impressive announcements from Chain, which revealed a new blockchain platform created with assistance from its big financial partners, and the state of Delaware, which detailed its effort to allow corporations to certificate using blockchain tech.

42399003,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyhT,1462224440,Blockchain Tech Leaders Debate Satoshi Mystery and Scaling at Consensus 2016,"It has been said that bitcoin is in a crisis as its community attempts to reach consensus on how best to scale the technology to increase its capacity, and the evolving debate was on display at Consensus 2016 today.  Perhaps the day's most visible panel was one featuring former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen, who just the night before had revealed he believes he has received proof that Australian cryptographer Craig Wright is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  As a result, when Andresen joined Ethereum investor Vitalik Buterin; Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo; and Neha Narula of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab to discuss how consensus should be reached in public blockchain projects, attendance was high.  Pindar Wong of Chairman of VeriFi even interrupted the beginning of the day's session to allow Andresen to address the crowd, at which time he denied claims his account had been hacked or that his statements were part of a hoax.  Andresen said:  ""[Craig Wright] signed, in my presence, using the private key from block #1, the very first block mined on a computer. I was convinced.""      Buterin, playing contrarian, however, dismissed the idea with his assessment of the evidence.  ""If you have a good way or a noisy way to prove something and you choose the noisy way, it means that you can’t do the good way,"" he added.  Scaling challenges dissected  Once that discussion dissipated, the conversation moved to why finding this sort of consensus when dealing with technology protocols can be so tricky, with panelists weighing in on the topic.  Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum said:  ""I have found that open blockchains in general are this very unique kind of environment in that they’re not like any traditional corporation, country or software system because there is no one group that directly controls it. It particularly becomes interesting because the group that controls it is often unspecified.""  Because of this lack of control by any single source, pushing toward definition around the protocol is an uphill battle, the panelists said. Further, they added that there is the need to find consensus without pulling from compatibility because if two nodes disagree, there's the potential for a fork.  Andresen argued that ""there's a balance between compatibility and diversity"", but that he believes bitcoin developers needs to get ""more serious"" about protocol definition.  But the ultimate conclusion from the panel may have come from Neha Narula, who succinctly summed up what many in the bitcoin community have been suggesting for some time:  ""What is new and exciting is this open access platform and using rationality and using currency. There is a lot of excitement about moving toward closed and private blockchains and I think you’re missing the point of this entire revolution.""         PoC to Production    Elsewhere on the track, a panel on proof-of-concepts focused on a different tech problem, namely, how can large corporations generate innovative ideas and use blockchain as a tool to solve problems. It’s one thing to have an idea or even a demo on a new use case for the blockchain, but it is entirely different to actually develop it and have people using it.  Meltem Demirors of Digital Currency Group; Scott Mullins of Amazon Web Services; Catheryne Nicholson of BlockCypher; and Eric Piscini of Deloitte, joined Forbes' Laura Shin for a discussion on this issue.  Nicholson laid out, in clear terms for those that have not been part of the development community, the steps to take from ideation to production. She explained that a proof-of-concept is all about the hacking mentality, with 10 engineers working on 10 projects to see what sticks.  But she explained that when you move from POC to prototype, it's a complete rebuild.  ""A proof-of-concept doesn't move to a pilot. As Deloitte says over and over again, it’s a complete restart and different environment. You take those use cases and then begin to look at how you put it into production,"" Nicholson said.  And only from that complete rebuild can a team begin to move toward an environment where they can scale their product in production, she said.  Still, another challenge, Piscini said, has to do with generating ideas.  He said:  ""One of the challenge that we are facing across industry is that people are trying to fix issues with blockchain where there is nothing to fix or we can fix it with something else.""  Demirors explained that what the blockchain allows for is disintermediating the need for trust. She argued that if there are examples of an exchange of paper in one's organization, that could be a scenario ripe for implementing the blockchain.  However, despite these big-picture ideas, panelists said those looking to harness the technology should understand that things are going to take time.  With this in mind, what the room agreed was Piscini's advice that users should start small and build on progess:  ""Don’t start from the bottom. Leverage what is available already. Build what is important for you on top of that.""  Decentralizing & Disrupting Existing Markets  For those that are particularly bullish on the blockchain, one idea that has taken hold is the idea that its decentralized model of operations can be applied to other business models.  On this panel was Brian Hoffman of OB1, Ryan Shea of Blockstack Labs, Elizabeth Stark of Lightning and Erik Voorhees of Shape Shift, who joined Perianne Boring of the Chamber of Digital Commerce to discuss projects that are applying this thesis to new markets.  The early discussion had to do with OB1, which is the creator of decentralized bitcoin-based market OpenBazaar. Hoffman revealed that since launch, there have been over 110,000 downloads with usage in over 130 countries.  However, on the topic of illicit activity, Hoffman sought to explain why platforms such as OpenBazaar are beneficial despite allowing illicit activities by bad actors.  Yet, he did offer:  ""What is important to note is we’re not like eBay or Etsy where we have control of the full stack. We’re a software development team who built an open source project. We created a tool. We encourage positive use, but it’s really up to the actors in the network to determine how it is used.""  Voorhees explained that there was a serious double standard when it came to blockchain technology and other new technologies. Specifically, because law enforcement and regulators understand the Internet, email and cell phones.  But another theme developed as the panelists talked about their projects: each depends on the other for success. Hoffman explained that if they had tried to integrate every altcoin into OpenBazaar, it would have been time prohibitive. Yet, by utilizing the Shapeshift platform, individuals could pay for goods with any currency they wanted and then have it automatically transfer to bitcoin.  And there was also some potential for integrating with large, enterprise clients.  Ultimately, what the panel agreed on was that this technology is still young and that there is a lot of growth coming. While none agreed that a standards body was needed presently, they were open to the idea of having a standards body for the future.  However, they cautioned that when big companies get involved in standards, it can turn into a scenario where the big company ultimately dictates everything.  Law Enforcement & Anonymous Transactions  The day continued with a discussion on finding a balance between the implicit freedom of speech with software and law enforcement needing to enforce misuse of bitcoin and blockchain-based services.  Brian Klein of Baker Marquart; Prakash Santhana of Deloitte; James Smith of Elliptic; and Zooko Wilcox of ZCash discussed this topic in a panel moderated by Jason Weinstein of the Blockchain Alliance, which centered on how law enforcement is constantly playing catch up with criminals.  Part of the reason this phenomenon exists is because criminals are the first to adopt technology, they said. ""Criminals learned how to use the Internet before anyone else except Al Gore,"" Weinstein joked.  One of the discussions had to do with opt-in or opt-out privacy.  Wilcox talked about how bitcoin is currently opt-in privacy, which he argues is problematic. He explained that most users of software use the out of the box settings, so if those are not secure, there are problems.  He argued that ZCash encrypts everything and then gives the author the decryption key. He argued that this opt-out of privacy could make transactions more secure.  Ultimately, it boiled down to the cat-and-mouse nature of law enforcement. Criminals run ahead with a technology and then the law enforcement catches up, the panelists agreed.  Smith explained that his company has to do two things to ensure that they can help law enforcement. The first is analyzing transactions and data to find how they relate. There was also a research component to it as well. ""We gather a lot of data from the dark web to understand how the marketplaces work and the mixing services work,"" he said.  More often than not, the problems that people equate to bitcoin are actually ones with cybersecurity. Fix those problems and bitcoin becomes useless for criminals.  Weinstein ultimately said:  ""Criminals should run, not walk, away from bitcoin.""  Day two of the conference resumes tomorrow with guests including former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, R3CEV CEO David Rutter and 21 Inc CEO Balaji Srinivasan.

42399015,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhysI,1462220408,BitPay Unveils Bitcoin Debit Card Available in All 50 States,"Bitcoin payments firm BitPay unveiled a new bitcoin debit card during a demo session at Consensus 2016, CoinDesk’s ongoing two-day blockchain conference in New York.  The debit card, issued by Metropolitan Commercial Bank and now available in all 50 states, enables users the ability to load bitcoin, make payments at Visa point-of-sale (POS) systems and withdraw cash at Visa ATMs.  In his remarks, Pair stressed the value he expects the product to provide to the wider bitcoin ecosystem.  BitPay CEO Stephen Pair told the crowd:  ""We believe that if you can use bitcoin in more ways it makes bitcoin more valuable.""  Throughout his speech, Pair provided overviews of existing BitPay products for business-to-business and consumer payments, seeking to stress that his startup is growing, despite perceptions that bitcoin use is declining.  Users can now order bitcoin debit cards for $9.95 to receive the product within seven to 10 business days. From there, users can load funds onto the card via their bitcoin wallet or a direct deposit through any direct deposit provider.  As for the fees attached to the card, long a source of frustration for bitcoin users when interfacing with bitcoin debit card products, Pair said fees would be attached to certain actions.  ""There’s a fee to start the card and for accessing an ATM. We intentionally wanted to make loading bitcoin free of charge,"" he said.  The announcement was one of a few during the day's events to focus on bitcoin, with major blockchain announcements from CME Group and Amazon Web Serivces. Together, the news hinted at broader institutional support for digital currency amid what has been a heavy hype cycle for institutional use cases of private and permissioned blockchains.  Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that the card could only loaded by employers through BitPay's Payroll API.

42399004,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyiS,1462206652,Amazon Web Services is Now Working With Blockchain Startups,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing business operated by Web commerce giant Amazon, is partnering with investment firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) to offer a blockchain experimentation environment for enterprises.  In collaboration with the startups in the DCG portfolio, AWS will provide dedicated cloud infrastructure and technical support for those projects. The startups, along with DCG, will collaborate with enterprise businesses looking to explore and test different blockchain applications.  Scott Mullins, head of worldwide financial services business development for AWS, said in a statement:  “Today in financial services, distributed ledger technology is at the forefront of any discussion related to innovation. AWS is working with financial institutions and blockchain providers to spur innovation and facilitate frictionless experimentation.”  While the deal represents the first official step into the blockchain space for AWS, the business has played a role in projects and initiatives involving the technology in the past.  Two months ago, Amazon was one of several cloud services that provided infrastructure for a commercial paper-trading trial conducted by the blockchain consortium led by New York-based startup R3CEV.  Back in January, an AWS workspace based in Manhattan played host to a blockchain startup event organized in part by Santander InnoVentures, the venture arm of Banco Santander.  Furthermore, blockchain providers like Eris Industries have used the AWS Marketplace to offer their solutions via the cloud, and in a recent blog post, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong detailed how the bitcoin exchange and wallet service utilizes the service.  Globally, Amazon’s cloud services have proven both popular and profitable, netting roughly $2.7bn in income during the first quarter of this year, according to a report by GeekWire.

42399009,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhynN,1462206603,Derivatives Giant CME Group Unveils Benchmarks for Bitcoin Traders,"Derivatives marketplace CME Group today unveiled two bitcoin benchmarks designed to give investors a new way to hedge.  Built in partnership with London-based Crypto Facilities, the prices for the two benchmarks will be derived from six different bitcoin exchanges – Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Genesis Global Trading, itBit and Kraken – and are designed to be compliant with global regulatory requirements.  The benchmarks can be used as bitcoin price reference points in derivatives that help manage the risk of bitcoin investments.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Crypto Facilities chief operating officer Timo Schlaefer said the benchmarks are designed to give investors a way to create derivatives with an ""institutional level of quality"".  Schlaefer said:  ""I would think that anyone who might be interested in trading bitcoin derivatives, in particular if they offer their product in a regulated manner, should be interested in these benchmarks.""  One of the benchmarks is called the CME Crypto Facilities Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR), which is a once-a-day reference rate on the price of bitcoin in US dollars.  The second benchmark will be calculated by Crypto Facilities and be based on global demand to buy and sell bitcoin aggregated into a consolidated order book.  ""These products are designed to allow bitcoin traders, companies and other users to rely on a credible reference rate price source,"" said Sandra Ro, executive director and digitization lead at CME Group, in a statement.  Regulated bitcoin derivatives  An oversight committee for the BRR comprised of members of the CME Group, Crypto Facilities and Imperial College London will develop a code of conduct for participants and review the practices and standards.  In February 2015, Schlaefer – a former Goldman Sachs trader – launched his own bitcoin derivatives market, Crypto Facilities, authorized and regulated by UK regulatory body, the Financial Conduct Authority.  Importantly, to those looking to create a bitcoin derivatives market on a larger scale, the CME benchmarks are designed to be compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) principles for financial benchmarks.

42399000,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyfV,1462201304,Everledger Plans Blockchain Database to Combat Art Fraud,"Everledger, the London-based startup known for uploading specifications on 980,000 diamonds onto the bitcoin blockchain, has announced a partnership with Vastari, a fine art and exhibition database.  “Everledger and Vastari are a natural fit as we’re both in the business of protecting provenance,"" said Leanne Kemp, co-founder and CEO of Everledger. ""For us it’s about creating a permanent record to protect authenticity of an item, for Vastari it’s guaranteeing an item's provenance while it’s mobile.”  Vastari, in which Everledger holds an investment stake, acts as a middleman between art museums that are looking for new pieces and private art collectors that want to increase the value of their art by getting it exhibited in public. This new partnership will see the art information possessed by Vastari written immutably to the blockchain.  Kemp explained that the data is written into the public blockchain, as well as Everledger's own permissioned ledger.  “Having a permissioned ledger allows us to better serve industry,"" said Kemp. ""It creates a system where accessible permissions are tightly controlled, with rights to modify or even read the blockchain state are restricted to a few users, while still maintaining many kinds of partial guarantees of authenticity and decentralization that blockchains [permit].""  She explained that each art institution on the permissioned ledger could be considered a separate node.  “One might imagine a consortium of 15 art institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid,” Kemp said.  Ambiguous assets  While Everledger had success with diamonds because of the gems' clear cut characteristics, fine art is a different beast. Bernadine Bröcker, Director at Vastari, explained that there are four things that are looked in art.  “There are key factors that are tracked on every piece of art,” Bröcker said. “The provenance, which is who owned it; the exhibition history, which is where we come in; the literary references that the work of art has been referenced in; and the vitals of the work of art – such as the size, what it looks like, title and the medium.”  It’s the ambiguity of art that makes it so much more difficult to track and offer fraud prevention.  “Fine art and antiquities are complicated objects which cannot be simplified with 40 data points,” Kemp explained. She explained that the firm's focus will be on ""trackability"", along with movement of the pieces with relevant transaction processes when it comes to financing and insuring the works.  But what really has the art world interested is the promised decentralization of blockchain technology. If ever there is an industry that is opaque, it’s the art world, with relatively few parties exhibiting outsized control. Bröcker explained that there is concern in the space that one group might control all the data. However, with a blockchain, that becomes impossible since each party involved can view all the data.  “There is such a hunger in the art world for someone who is not trying to sell something, but just ... to fact check and help their art be seen,” said Bröcker.  Fighting art fraud  Everledger’s platform created a straightforward solution to the diamond world, whereby each diamond was recorded on the blockchain. Once that information was stored, it couldn’t be tampered with, making it harder to offer counterfeit diamonds. Further, with over £100 million in insurance paid out for jewelry theft every year, there is an obvious use case for a shared tracking mechanism.  With art, it might be an even bigger market.  “There have been some estimates, of all the art trade – which is billions a year – we’ve heard that 70-75% of the art that is traded is misrepresented,” said Bröcker, though because few firms talk about it, tracking can be difficult.  “Fine art is becoming seen as an asset in its own right that people want to be trading in and a lot of interesting financial products are being created,” she said.  And with the trading of art only expected to increase, transparency of data is of the utmost importance.  However, with most of the current use cases being blockchain solutions, widespread adoption is essential for successful prevention of fraud.  “It only works if everyone takes part, so we are talking with the major players so it becomes industry standard ... and so that it actually becomes part of the day-to-day,” said Bröcker.  Future plans  Kemp added that Everledger expects to add two additional asset classes to its ledger sometime in 2016.  “We are in talks with a number of lead luxury brands and fine goods manufactures where identification of an indelible digital incarnation of the object is important to the object's provenance and supply chain security,” she said.  She explained that where her firm's place the supply chain is when knowing provenance is necessary. From there, Everledger develops a business model around each industry it is approaching.  The company expects to generate revenue by selling its data, charging for search and recovery of data, and potentially licensing its platform to third-party developers.  Image by Shutterstock.

42399014,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhypL,1462197634,Circle Then and Now: Bitcoin’s Early Champions Challenge a Blockchain World,"A brick building in Boston’s Waterfront district might not seem like the most obvious place for a high-tech company, but it's mix of colonial heritage and gentrified chic are oddly fitting for blockchain payments startup Circle.  Founded in 2013, Circle is positioning itself as an early leader in the race to make blockchain work for online payments – an idea that requires it to straddle both old-world regulations and infrastructure and new technologies that are only now on the cusp of being fully understood.  Many know Circle as a ""bitcoin company"", even though its product no longer bears a resemblance to many of its peers. For example, it now allows users 13 years old and over to load money to the app in the US and UK via Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards. Users can convert funds to bitcoin as well, but the emphasis now is on users who may want to keep those funds in fiat.  As for whether this is a careful pivot in the face of bitcoin’s slower-than-expected adoption or the fruition of long-laid plans is less certain, but Circle’s co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville assert it’s the latter.  The co-founders are long-time business partners, having worked with each other at online video platform Brightcove, where Neville was a senior software architect and Allaire was chairman. Brightcove went public in February 2012, and by October 2013, Allaire announced Circle had raised $9m in what was, at the time, the budding sector’s biggest funding round.  Back then, Circle hadn’t even released information about its products and services, but the firm’s focus seemed clear. In an early interview with CoinDesk, Allaire said that Circle wanted to make ""payments"", as easy as ""email [or] Skype"" using ""digital currency"".  Two years later, Allaire and Neville have raised $76m (rumors of another funding round have been ongoing, with possible participation from Baidu and IDG). But, when Circle’s most recent interview with CoinDesk begins, both co-founders are in a conference room in Boston, looking at a map of the world that adorns the wall and commenting on a series of international clocks.  The two long-time founders are worried if the times are right.  The moment seems oddly informative given that the world has certainly changed around Circle since its launch. For instance, it’s no longer thought that bitcoin will reach critical mass as a digital currency, at least today, and it’s an open secret that the once-large pool of consumer-focused bitcoin companies has all but evaporated.  But, after all the hype around bitcoin turned hype around blockchain, just what is Circle anyway? And has its value proposition changed?  Allaire and Neville maintain Circle is still what it always was, a social payments app à la Venmo that just so happens to be built on a public blockchain.  Neville explained:  ""When we started the company, we didn’t have all the regulatory approvals to move US dollars, UK sterling. We did have the ability to move digital currency, and we ended up releasing a product focusing on digital currency. We could have stayed in stealth and acquired the licenses, or we could have released the product that we could release and improve our risk engine, and that’s what we did.""  Change in tone  Still, Allaire and Neville acknowledge that the conversation in the industry has changed, that conventional wisdom now might say that their timing was off, that Circle just simply isn’t relevant now to the ""blockchain"" conversation.  Such a view proves problematic in retrospect, though.  Long an advocate for regulation and the application of financial industry skill sets to the industry, Allaire was always a somewhat controversial figure, especially with the so-called ""bitcoin maximalist"" set that eschewed such conventions.  That said, Allaire talks of banks now as ""regulated database operators"" and describes money transfer as a form of payments ""synchronization"", a fact he acknowledges is a bit of a departure. It’s hard to tell if the remarks are evidence of a pivot, or if his thinking on the subject of blockchain and digital currencies has evolved to fit the times.  But, Allaire argues that Circle’s product now is representative of its original vision. It’s just that it's only in the last six months or so that this has been evident.  ""[Circle] was not positioned as a bitcoin thing, it was [about] making money work,"" Allaire said. ""It was positioned as a way to move value around. We tried to define the product around instant money, and underneath it was bitcoin.""  Allaire added that the product was good for early adopters who wanted a new currency, but that full, desired utility was not yet there. ""It was the easiest market to acquire,"" Neville said.  As evidence, Allaire and Neville pointed to their marketing strategy.  ""We didn’t spend any money on marketing. The only money we invested was on key relationships and educating the marketplace, communicating with industry, media, government,"" he continued, adding:  ""We can invest in market expansion now.""  On Betamax blockchains  If Circle is building a global, blockchain-based payments app, though, why is it confident in its choice of blockchain to do so? Bitcoin after all is still ""unregulated"", according to most financial incumbents, a high-tech plaything that simply won’t work for enterprise needs.  Somewhat lost in this “permissioned” versus “permissionless” blockchain debate is that access on the web is arguably both. While anyone can launch a website, like e-Trade, for example, users have to be permissioned to access it.  Neville adheres to this ""blockchain is the new Internet"" adage and sees public blockchains, in particular bitcoin, as being valuable and necessary.  ""When we talk about public blockchain, we’re talking about how there is great value in an ecosystem of services that does not put barriers on access to gateways or have expensive, human-based trust,"" Neville said.  Allaire further asserted that such use cases for public blockchains will become more apparent, especially as the ecosystem moves into use cases like voting, in which users would likely not want to trust a single entity to record votes for fear of manipulation.  Allaire said:  ""There’s been an over-focus on the currency unit over the global trust network, which has many other kinds of applications. Having a global network that isn’t controlled by consortia or a corporation, just like the web, is powerful.""  Growing adoption  As for the road ahead, Allaire and Neville are again focused on this map of the world, as evidenced by their successes with global regulators.  Last year, Circle became the first private company working on blockchain-based money services to receive a BitLicense in the state of New York. Some six months after this, Circle is still the only company to receive a license.  Further, Circle recently received an e-money license in the UK, which allowed the startup to enter into a partnership with Barclays. Allaire’s response to why this partnership benefits Barclays? Working with Circle is an ""opportunity to be at forefront"" of experimentation.  Allaire contends that as Circle expands, such partnerships, as well as their benefits for banks, will be necessary to reiterate. The ""real regulators"" are compliance officers at banks, he says, who must manage and bear the risk of compliance violations and that may view firms like Circle as an outsized risk.  However, in Allaire’s view, the challenge is not whether online social payments can take off, but whether they can gain the same adoption in the West as they have in Asia.  ""You have 800m people in the US and Europe, and the number of people who use these apps is tiny. We’re learning from what’s happened in China. I think everyone is learning from that,"" Allaire explains, noting the evolution of Tencent’s popular WeChat service into a money transfer platform.  In this way, Allaire sees Asia not as a potential market, but as a successful test case Circle can use to shape its strategy. ""I can send a text to anyone in China. I can do all those things. It’s not possible to move value that way,"" he said.  Hybrid structure  The question of mass adoption, though, ultimately comes back to regulation, which means Circle will need to repeat its successes in the US and the UK in other markets should it want to succeed in its goal of effortless value transfer.  There’s a balancing act here, too. While Circle needs to gain the trust of global regulators, it also needs users to begin to trust, or at least understand and experience, a distributed network many have termed ""trustless"".  It’s the global nature of bitcoin as a protocol that Allaire believes will be key to differentiating Circle from other past high-tech payment ventures that have turned into a veritable graveyard. This long list includes even well-funded efforts such as Google Wallet, Square Cash and Facebook Credits.  ""One of the things that's important in what we’re trying to do is build an ecosystem of finance. We don’t want to create another walled garden system. We want to participate in a larger ecosystem where everyone can plug into the protocol,"" Neville said.  Still, there are societal hurdles. During my interview I mention my own aversion to payments. Rather than pay each other back, I argue, millennials have grown up with an I’ll-get-you-back-later attitude that might not lend itself well to value transfer.  Allaire acknowledges there will be hurdles, that security around money is different than photo security. ""It's a higher bar,"" he said.  However, he believes Asia is proving it can be done, and that the increasing globalization of homes and offices will add further pressures.  Allaire concluded:  ""When's the last time you sent a cross-border email? We want money to work the same way.""

42398998,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhycY,1462194954,Delaware to Seek Legal Classification for Blockchain Shares,"Delaware is looking to use blockchain technology in a bid to streamline the cost and paperwork burden of registering new companies in the state.  In partnership with smart contract-focused startup Symbiont and New York law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, the planned system would move the process of registering companies, tracking share movements, and managing shareholder communications into a digital environment.  At present, Delaware is in the initial phases of the project. Before any companies starts registering via blockchain, deliberations with the state’s bar association await, and possible tweaks to state law may need to be made. There is also the question of whether the bitcoin blockchain will be utilized as part of the proposed process.  Delaware Governor Jack Markell spoke about the initiative at the Consensus 2016 blockchain conference, telling attendees that the state had no current plans to pursue a licensure scheme for digital currency companies, a nod to the BitLicense created and launched in New York.  Notably, Markell said that the government would push for the creation of a new type of corporate shares, dubbed ""distributed ledger shares"".  He told attendees:  ""Distributed ledger shares hold the promise of immediate clearance, immediate settlement, and bring about dramatic increase in efficiency and speed and an increase in commercial transactions of which Delaware is known.""  The project traces back to efforts in the mid-2000's, when Delaware legislators amended state law to begin digitizing the state's largely paper-based system for registering companies and tracking the sale and movements of shares.  Other blockchain initiatives currently being pursued by the state include a project with the Delaware Public Archives, for which Symbiont is developing a system for storing archival records digitally.  “Autonomous record-keeping is an important use case for how smart contracts can deliver a more transparent, efficient and level playing field to the public and private sectors,” Symbiont CEO Mark Smith said in a statement.  Delaware's government is expected to pursue other applications of the technology, and according to Markell, the project will result in the creation of a so-called ""Delaware Blockchain"".

42398993,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyaa,1462194042,Chain Unveils Blockchain Platform Built By and for Financial Industry,"Blockchain startup Chain is today releasing a new open-source, permissioned protocol built in collaboration with 10 financial and telecom firms.  Partners on the project include an impressive list of major financial firms, such as Capital One, Citi, Fidelity, First Data, Fiserv, Mitsubishi UFJ, Nasdaq, Orange, State Street and Visa, all of which contributed to the technology, called the Chain Open Standard, or Chain OS 1.  In interview, Chain CEO Adam Ludwin asserts the platform is tailor-made for high-scale financial applications, including securities clearing and payment processing. Long in development, Ludwin described the release as a formalization of the platform it has used on test projects for First Data, Nasdaq and Visa, among other partners.  Ludwin told CoinDesk:  ""What you’re seeing is really the first step of a bottom-up process that stands in contrast to the top-down approaches that have gotten a lot of attention the last several months. Chain OS 1 was not a committee-driven effort, a way to get everyone in the room and say 'Let's create a network'.""  While Ludwin didn’t name any competitors specifically, his comments allude to efforts like the Hyperledger project, an open-source blockchain initiative led by the Linux Foundation, and Corda, an in-development ledger platform being built by consortium R3CEV.  Ludwin suggested such processes are perhaps flawed in their approach to technology design, akin to trying to build a “rubber band ball” simply by shaking a box and hoping it turns into an elegant sphere  ""You create a core by tightly building the first things around a core, then it’s easy to add bands, and that’s what we’ve done with Chain Open Standard 1,"" Ludwin said.  In this way, Ludwin said he sees Chain OS 1 as a ""structure"", rather than a proposal, positioning the platform as one that should be considered by major institutions considering permissioned blockchain options in the market.  The announcements comes amid heightened competition from permissioned blockchain platform providers for high-profile projects.  In recent weeks, Barclays has unveiled a smart contracts template test built on Corda, while the DTCC has indicated it is working with Digital Asset Holdings on trials related to Hyperledger’s technology.  Behind the scenes  Throughout the interview, Ludwin sought to describe the project as one that has been some time in the making, providing an overview of the different steps the company has taken toward the creation of Chain OS 1.  Ludwin said, for example, that Chain recently held a private conference with its financial industry partners in New York, that included software demonstrations.  The scale and depth of the presentations, he contends, could have easily attracted news. However, he sought to frame Chain as a company that was not looking to attract attention except for more serious announcements.  ""People sneeze and say blockchain and it gets a press release,"" Ludwin said. ""This was arguably the biggest deepest blockchain event that happened and the reason that we didn’t do press was we wanted to create an environment that people can share things publicly, things that are very strategic.""  Ludwin said that Chain is seeking to launch a second partner conference in fall 2016 that will be open to further industry participation, and that the startup plans to hold similar events twice a year going forward.  ""All of the institutions that we bring into the fold over the next three to five months will get invited and be able to participate,"" he added.  Specification details  In prepared materials, Chain describes OS 1 as a “novel consensus model” that achieves finality in seconds, even for high-volume transactions.  Further, it boasts a ""privacy solution"" that encrypts blockchain data, providing what it called ""selective access"" to counterparties and regulators. Chain OS 1 is also equipped for Turing-complete smart contracts and virtual machines, two components perhaps most often associated with the open-source Ethereum blockchain project.  Elsewhere, it allows for participants to keep a full historical copy of the network’s distributed ledger, or a shortened version containing only the ""unspent state"", thereby lowering operational requirements.  Chain’s partners assert that this combination of features has the ingredients needed for enterprise institutions to build projects that could become commercial applications.  ""Chain’s protocol supports some of the most complex use cases we have in mind,"" Hu Liang, senior managing director at State Street, said in statements.  Nasdaq indicated it is using the platform for private market securities testing as well as for its proxy voting and clearing efforts.  Innovation over incumbents  Group efforts aimed at permissioned blockchain development weren’t the only target for Ludwin’s critiques, however.  In remarks, Ludwin positioned Chain as the kind of ""Silicon Valley startup"" that financial institutions should want to partner with on blockchain efforts, as it doesn’t bring the kinds of complications and conflicts that can come with working with an established firm.  ""The bigger IT companies that are showing up, you want to ask, 'Are they trying to sell me something else?' That’s always going to be a question,"" Ludwin said.  The comments come as a growing number of traditional IT firms, including Microsoft and IBM, seek to attract institutions to their various platforms and offerings.  Ludwin concluded:  ""The advantage of startups like Chain is we build exactly what we need.""

42399002,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyeW,1462186721,"Microsoft, USAA Join DC Blockchain Policy Group","Tech giant Microsoft and military-focused banking and insurance firm USAA are among the newest members of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a policy advocacy group focused on blockchain technology.  Founded in mid-2014  , the non-profit lobbying group has spent the time since pushing for fair regulation and oversight in Washington, DC for companies working on bitcoin or blockchain applications. The group is led by Perianne Boring, a former Forbes columnist and Capitol Hill staffer. More recently, the Chamber was one of the founding organizations behind the Blockchain Alliance, a public-private forum aimed at promoting cooperation between industry stakeholders and government agencies.  Joining Microsoft and USAA are startups Bloq and Symbiont, the former a technology startup co-founded by Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik and the latter a company focused on blockchain capital markets applications.  Each company, according to the CDC, is joining the group’s Executive Committee and pitching in $50,000 in financial support.  In interview, Boring said that as the group looks to shape blockchain policy in Washington in the year ahead, firms like USAA and Microsoft – which by nature of their business models regularly interact with government regulators – are bringing a relevant expertise to the table.  USAA was one of several major companies to take part in Coinbase’s $75m Series C funding round, and later worked with the US-based startup on a pilot program that allowed USAA customers to view their bitcoin balances directly through its online dashboard. That feature was rolled out to all members following a positive response to the pilot.  Boring said that as a regulated financial services firm, USAA brings a wide range of relevant experience to the CDC table, telling CoinDesk:  ""We see USAA as one of the most innovative and forward-thinking banks in this space. So obviously with that, a lot of the policy challenges and questions and compliance points are issues we’ll be working on with them.""  The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Technology push  The other members joining the group – Microsoft, Bloq and Symbiont – are bringing experience from the technology perspective. What each of them share, alongside the existing members of the Chamber, is a need to get involved with blockchain-related policy developments in Washington.  ""Most of the serious players in this industry are looking at their regulatory and public policy challenges. So that’s why they’re working with the Chamber to work through these common industries,"" she told CoinDesk.  Matt Roszak, co-founder of Bloq alongside Garzik, spoke to that sentiment in describing Bloq’s bid to join the nonprofit organization.  ""Through my experience in working in technology and finance, engagement with public policymakers is critical for industry growth and success,” he said.  Mark Smith, CEO of Symbiont, echoed those remarks, saying that without concerted outreach efforts, “[the technology] will always be limited.""  In interview, Boring highlighted Microsoft’s position in the technology space – and its relevant experience working on the regulatory front.  ""They ensure that their products can find a market, and they see value in having a coalition consortium-type organization to use as a platform to address these kinds of challenges,"" said Boring.  In a statement, Marley Gray, who leads Microsoft’s blockchain business development and strategy efforts said, spoke to the need for the industry to collaborate on lobbying as the technology sees wider use.  He said:  ""We firmly believe industry collaborations are critical to bringing distributed ledger technology to market.""

42398994,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyZb,1462181747,Doubts Cast As Craig Wright Publishes Proof He Created Bitcoin,"In December, Gizmodo and Wired published articles identifying Australian academic Craig Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. Now, Wright has released new evidence in a bid to prove that he is in fact Satoshi.  At the time, skepticism emerged about the evidence used to tie Wright to the Satoshi identity. The situation grew more complex amid police raids connected to an ongoing investigation by Australian tax authorities into bitcoin holdings said to constitute the results of the earliest mining activity conducted by Satoshi.  Today, the BBC, The Economist and GQ published reports on Wright and how he seeks to prove his identity by way of the bitcoin private keys for the first and ninth transaction blocks – data from the earliest days of bitcoin, the latter of which included a transaction from Satoshi to cryptographer Hal Finney, who passed away in 2014.  The publications follow rumors that Wright was working with the media on some form of evidence release.  In conjunction with those releases, Wright published an article of his own, which included a digital signature shown to the media and tied to the ninth bitcoin block.  Further, additional blog posts were penned by former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen and Bitcoin Foundation founding director Jon Matonis in defense of Wright. In his post, Andresen wrote “I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin”, while Matonis attested that he had “no doubt that Craig Steven Wright is the person behind the Bitcoin technology”.  Yet, mirroring the December reports, the latest news sparked skepticism about the proof offered by Wright.  Observers quickly took to social media to repudiate the offered proof, and in its report, The Economist wrote that “questions remain” about whether Wright is truly Satoshi.  Bitcoin markets also reacted to the news, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin USD Price Index. After days of trending above the $450 line, bitcoin markets fell below $440 before recovering later. At press time, the price of bitcoin is $443.34.  What comes next is not immediately clear, though rigorous debate about the veracity of Wright's claims is virtually assured. In a press release provided to media Monday morning, Wright suggested in a statement that he intends to pursue some degree of involvement with bitcoin.

42399005,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhyjR,1462161669,Commonwealth Secretariat Unveils Secure Blockchain Messaging App,"The Commonwealth Secretariat, the executive arm of the 53-member Commonwealth of Nations, has launched a blockchain-powered secure communication tool geared for governments and law enforcement.  Developed in partnership with UK-based startup Digital Identity Security Company (DISC), the project is designed to offer a secure means of communication for government and law enforcement agencies within the Commonwealth.  The move comes more than a year after the Secretariat first waded into investigating cryptocurrencies by way of commissioning a report on the topic. That report, released in February, called on member-nations to declare their legal stances on the digital currency, while arguing for ""innovative"" approaches to technology oversight.  The organization has seen activity on the digital currency front, including a meeting last October between roughly 30 Commonwealth central bank representatives, who discussed the technology in the context of global remittances.  It’s in this context that the Secretariat has moved on the secure communications app, which uses blockchain as a means to both connect disparate entities as well as provide a means to clarify identity in a digital environment. The app was developed following a public procurement call last year.  In interview, Steven Malby, head of the Law Development section within the Commonwealth Secretariat’s Rule of Law Division, explained that the app helps the burden of sharing electronic evidence between different jurisdictions within the Commonwealth, as well as the need for stronger digital identity tools for governments.  He told CoinDesk:  ""You have two problems there – the need to connect diverse access over all of the 53 Commonwealth countries, and the problem of identity as they’re always changing the roles – you might have an individual role change quite frequently.”  ""The blockchain is, to us, an ideal way to address those challenges,"" he added.  The app’s development comes as governments worldwide, particularly in Europe and the US, seek more access to encrypted communication methods in a bid to deter would-be terrorists.  Yet those moves have elicited strong criticism from both privacy advocates and technologists, who say proposed measures, including legislation, would actually put more people at risk.  Variety of use cases  Encrypted messaging tools on the market today include the popular Pretty Good Privacy program, or PGP, as well as a range of commercial-style apps aimed at privacy-minded users.  DISC chairman John Edge, in an interview with CoinDesk, pointed to platforms like Symphony – a finance-oriented communication platform that raised $100m last October – as a communication tool similar in scope and aim to the new Commonwealth app.  In interview, he sought to position the need for governments to have secure means of transmitting information alongside individual users who also pursue such tools.  ""The role of secure communications in the world is a rather hot topic. We started this narrative a year or so ago, but I think there’s just as much any individual wants their right to privacy in a digital world, so do corporates and governments,"" he told CoinDesk.  Beyond the law enforcement-oriented use case, Malby said that he believes these solutions can be applied to other areas, particularly global development, healthcare and education.  ""International organizations have a lot of problems. They have to organize between a lot of other countries, whether it’s in areas like health, education, or any areas where there is cooperation required. The same technology could be used for networks in any of those fields,” he explained.
