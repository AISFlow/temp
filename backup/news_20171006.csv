42400505,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJo6c,1507327219,Survey: Most Medical Group Execs See Promising Role For Blockchain,"A new survey of the health care industry has found that executives from hospitals, managed care organizations and other groups are moving to explore blockchain applications in their field.  Black Book Research queried 88 health care payers (or institutions that finance medical services) and 276 technology executives, managers and IT specialists from the field, according to the report, which was published on October 3.  Among the findings: 90 percent of managers and IT specialists from medical groups felt blockchain could help alleviate problems in the sector, including issues around recordkeeping, network connectivity and information privacy. The study also revealed that 76 percent of payers are either considering blockchain as a tech solution or are in the process of deploying systems that utilize it.  Still, the responses indicate that the industry isn't moving all that quickly to embrace the technology.  For example, only a small percentage of payers - 14 percent, according to the data – ""are involved in trial deployments in some form currently.""  Further, just 9 percent of providers that responded to the survey indicated that they expect their companies to pursue blockchain integrations by the second quarter of next year. By comparison, 70 percent of payers said their firms anticipate doing so by the first quarter of 2019.  The survey also suggests that the possible costs involved remain a barrier. Eighty-eight percent of providers said they would not commit to an integration deadline because of the ""undetermined cost of blockchain solutions.""

42400508,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJo8a,1507323619,Banks Back Syndicated Loan Market Built on Corda Distributed Ledger,"A group of banks and financial technology providers have unveiled a new syndicated loan marketplace built on top of the Corda distributed ledger platform.  The list of banks involved includes BNP Paribas, HSBC, ING, State Street and BNY Mellon, with two other unnamed institutions also taking part in the initiative. Today's unveiling from Finastra, which was formed by the merger of software firms D+H and Misys earlier this year, follows a previous pilot phase.  The project aims to create a new kind of syndicated loan market, where multiple lenders pool resources in order to fund single debtors. The idea is to use R3's Corda platform (which saw its 1.0 version released on Tuesday) as a hub for administering loans and sharing key information on things like fees and interest rates in real-time during the lending process.  Philippe Boulas, head of financing solutions for BNP Paribas CIB, said in a statement:  ""We believe that the distributed ledger is appropriate in syndicated lending to deliver one single position that is immediately updated when a contract is being handled. The Finastra-led utility, Fusion LenderComm, would allow us to share position data more efficiently and pave the way for a more fluid industrialization.""  The platform, dubbed Fusion LenderComm, already has its own official website, and while its launch date wasn't disclosed in today's announcement, the companies behind it are seeking additional backers – particularly lenders who would bring liquidity to the marketplace.  Fusion LenderComm's unveiling is a notable one, given that the past year has seen a number of banks test applications for syndicated loan markets.  A proof-of-concept platform for issuing syndicated loans, spearheaded this past spring by Credit Suisse, saw participation from a variety of firms, including State Street. Credit Suisse said in August that it is planning a commercial-scale release for sometime next year.

42400512,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoDV,1507318845,Russia Blasts Decision to Extradite Alleged Bitcoin Money Launderer,"Russia's foreign ministry has sharply criticized a Greek court's decision to extradite Alexander Vinnik to the US for his alleged role in laundering funds through the BTC-e bitcoin exchange.  In a statement  , the Ministry for Foreign Affairs said today that they ""noted with regret"" that the court opted to comply with the US's extradition request for Vinnik, who was arrested in Greece in late July and was accused of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin through the exchange.  Both Vinnik and BTC-e were later charged by US prosecutors, with FinCEN handing down a $110 million fine after the sealed indictment was unveiled.  Since then, Vinnik has remained in Greece pending the outcome of the extradition process. During that time the Russian government moved to extradite Vinnik on unrelated charges, a move that was later endorsed by Vinnik himself in a statement to Russia Today.    To date, Vinnik has maintained that he is innocent of the charges, though he claims to have worked for BTC-e in the past. BTC-e, for its part, has denied Vinnik's involvement and, since the exchange's site domain was seized by US agents, has moved to establish a new cryptocurrency exchange.    But this week's ruling by a Greek judge was met with dismay by the Russian foreign ministry, which in a statement urged the court to reconsider the decision.  The Russian government said:  ""We deem the verdict unjust and a violation of international law. A request from the Russian Prosecutor General's Office on extraditing Mr Vinnik to Russia was submitted to the Greek authorities. Based on legal precedent, the Russian request should take priority as Mr Vinnik is a citizen of Russia.""  The statement notably makes no mention of BTC-e or the specific crimes for which Vinnik has been accused. That said, it does make note that Vinnik's legal team will appeal the decision, potentially leaving it up to the Greek Justice Ministry to decide on where the Russian national will be sent.  The foreign ministry also expressed hope that Vinnik will ultimately be extradited to Russia.  ""We hope the Greek authorities will consider the Russian Prosecutor General's Office request, and Russia’s reasoning, and act in strict compliance with international law,"" the ministry said.

The institution is working with blockchain startup Chain on a data privacy pilot, according to a new announcement. The project is one of four unveiled today, all of which focus on financial information processing.  Bank of England officials have been working with a number of startups and companies on blockchain applications through its accelerator since it launched late last year. Among those were a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) trial involving technology developed by Ripple, as well as an asset exchange pilot involving PwC.  In a speech to fintech firms in Cambridge this morning, Andrew Hauser, the central bank's executive director for banking, payments and financial resilience, highlighted additional details about the new pilot.  ""The PoC will examine the extent to which [distributed ledger technology] based systems can be configured to enable privacy amongst participants, whilst keeping data on a shared ledger: one of the holy grails of DLT design,"" he told event attendees.  The UK central bank first voiced its interest in a blockchain data privacy pilot in April. At the time, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said that the institution wanted to explore ""maintaining privacy in a distributed ledger.""  The Bank of England is exploring multiple applications of the tech, including its use as a basis for a central bank-issued digital currency – an area that a number of central banks worldwide are also researching.

42400499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJo0i,1507305608,Bitcoin Derivatives ETFs Withdraw Filings at SEC Request,"Public documents reveal that a second US financial services firm has withdrawn an effort to create exchange-traded futures (ETFs) tied to bitcoin.  In a letter dated October 5, an executive for Connecticut-based REX ETFs requested to pull back an amendment related to two previously proposed ETFs: the REX Bitcoin Strategy Fund and the REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF. The withdrawal is a notable one, given that the company said in August that it would seek to launch multiple investment products around cryptocurrencies.  The letter, penned by REX president J. Garrett Stevens, indicates that officials at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) don't want to weigh in on such products in the absence of available derivatives contracts in which to invest.  Stevens wrote:  ""The Trust notes that on a call with the Staff, the Staff expressed the view that it is the Commission’s policy not to review a registration statement for a fund where the underlying instruments in which the fund intends to primarily invest are not yet available. The Staff requested that the Trust withdraw Amendment No. 47 until such time as the underlying instruments in which the Funds intend to invest (i.e., bitcoin futures contracts) become available for investment.""  Indeed, that language is virtually identical to statements included in a withdrawal letter from VanEck, a New York-based money manager that yanked its own bitcoin derivatives ETF bid late last month. Like REX, the firm clarified that it had not yet sold any securities tied to the ETF.  The new development suggests that continued efforts to create investment products around cryptocurrency markets will still face some degree of optimism from regulators like the SEC. This year has seen several notable rejections for bitcoin ETFs, including a still-in-review bid by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

42400518,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJoJP,1507302008,Is Ripple's Rally Over? XRP Price Runs Into Roadblock,"Fresh off setting a one-month high, the price of ripple's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is struggling to cut through resistance offered by a rising channel hurdle.  At press time, the ripple-US dollar (XRP/USD) exchange rate is $0.24, and while that figure is up 4.24 percent on the day and 21.89 percent week-over-week, it seems further gains may be difficult.  Potentially positive news drivers aside, price action analysis suggests XRP is struggling to hold above $0.21 (its September 27 high), meaning downside potential is still in play.  Daily chart  The chart above shows:  XRP is having a tough time breaching the rising trend line resistance (upward sloping blue lines).  5-day moving average and 10-day moving average is sloping upwards.  The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is above 50.00 (bullish territory) and pointing upwards.  4-hour chart: Overbought RSI  View  XRP is likely to stay on the front foot and could eventually take out the rising channel hurdle. Prices could then proceed to test their August high of $0.2650.  However, the RSI on the 4-hour chart is overbought (rally overdone). Thus, a minor pullback to $0.2190 cannot be ruled out.  On a larger scheme of things, only a break below $0.20 would signal bullish-to-bearish change.

Week-over-week, the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate is now up 5.84 percent.  Brushing aside uncertainty surrounding a possible upcoming fork, bitcoin is looking northward ahead of the weekend and, should it cut through key technical hurdles ahead, it could be poised to push higher.  The rebound from the 50-day moving average is encouraging, but the cryptocurrency still faces the following hurdles:  $4,420 – Resistance offered by the trend line sloping upwards from the September 15 low and September 25 low.  $4,470 – Monday's doji candle high.  View  An end-of-day close above $4,470 would signal failure of the bearish doji reversal and mark continuation of the higher highs and higher lows pattern.

In response to a question on the matter from an MP, Tharman Shanmugaratnam – who is also deputy prime minister of Singapore – confirmed that while the MAS ""has been monitoring"" cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, it has no intention of regulating them. However, certain peripheral activities will require a legal framework, he said.  MAS, he went on, is now working to create a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrency payment services, in order to ensure they are not misused for money laundering and terrorism financing.  In the statement, Shanmugaratnam clarified that, while MAS has yet to produce a targeted regulatory framework uniquely for ICOs, it will do so if deemed necessary.  Shanmugaratnam explained:  ""Virtual currencies can go beyond being a means of payment, and evolve into ""second generation"" tokens representing benefits such as ownership in assets, like a share or bond certificate. These are financial activities that falls under MAS' regulatory ambit.""  The minister also said that while cryptocurrency trading is widely popular in U.S., Japan and Hong Kong, trading volume is relatively low in Singapore. On top of that, only about 20 Singapore retailers accept bitcoin, according to the the central banking authority.  In August, MAS announced that tokens may be classified as securities. Further, the financial regulator has issued statements warning investors of potential fraudulent ICO schemes.

42427836,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4KHh,1507287612,ICO Central: Why Switzerland Will Remain Crypto Valley,"Ian Simpson is head of marketing and communications at Lakeside Partners, an early-stage investment firm in Zug, Switzerland.  In this opinion piece, Simpson lays out why his country is poised to remain a hotbed of ICO activity for the time being, despite recent regulatory developments – and why it should not try to be the only hub.      Last week's news that the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FINMA) is investigating ICOs generated predictably sensational headlines around the world.  Business Insider went so far as to include the ""terrorist"" angle in its headline – gratuitously, in my opinion. Some were quick to lump the news together with other negative announcements from around the world.  But it would be wrong to assume that FINMA's statement – even coming at roughly the same time as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's announcement of charges against two ICOs – spells doom for the ICO market in Switzerland.  Those most closely involved in making ICOs happen in Switzerland are not at all naive about the possibility of scams. In a recent interview with online portal Finews, Luka Mueller of MME Legal made it clear that he was well aware of dubious tactics being used.  Moreover, the local blockchain community – far from rooting for each and every project that lands in Crypto Valley – is very focused on self-regulation. I have often been on hand to witness the hard questions and critical attitude during local meetups when teams from around the world show up to promote their ICO campaign.  Code of conduct  The Crypto Valley Association recently came out in favour of a code of conducthttps://cryptovalley.swiss/crypto-valley-association-comes-support-careful-ico-regulation-announces-ico-code-conduct/ as a means to encourage the community to foster best practices and weed out scammers.  This is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the global blockchain community – peer-to-peer review and balance where no one central player needs to enforce or control things.  On a larger scale, this is one of the reasons why Switzerland is still one of the best places to conduct an ICO.  The country's legal and political system has been and will continue to be stable and predictable – and decentralised. The Swiss cantonal system with 26 semi-autonomous regions and rotating federal presidency provides a balanced framework,and a real-world example of the principles that power blockchain.  And even when politicians do get involved, it is in the spirit of ""consensus-building."" We recently hosted two of the seven Swiss Federal Councillors – Johann Schneider-Ammann (economic affairs) and Ueli Maurer (finance) at our offices in Zug. Both showed an openness to learn and try to understand the potential – and complexities – of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  Leading the way  Another reason is that there is a wealth of experience and technical talent in Switzerland's Crypto Valley. What started with the founding of the Ethereum Foundation in Zug continues to grow and multiply.  At the ICO Summit in Zurich last month, nearly everyone in attendance was clear on the fact that regulations would come – as William Mougayar pointed out in his keynote speech – but with the hope that they recognize tokens as a completely new asset class. So, despite FINMA's announcement, the Swiss crypto/blockchain ecosystem still offers the most stable and promising conditions for ICOs.  For now, anyway.

42427847,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL4Kbh,1507276912,Calm Before the Fork? Segwit2x Goes Silent as Bitcoin Split Looms,"""It's sort of like the quiet tension before a battle.""  That's how Jean-Pierre Rupp, a developer at bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain, described the current state of Segwit2x development. With the code labeled ""production ready,"" and the work of contributors like Rupp nearly complete, the main step left is the activation of the code, scheduled for late November.  That's when the next stage of bitcoin's scaling debate, as they say, will come to a head.  First proposed at a private meeting of industry players in May, Segwit2x was intended to forge a compromise in bitcoin's long-raging scaling debate. Still, it has attracted opposition, primarily for its approach to upgrading the bitcoin software. Chief among concerns is its use of a hard fork to increase the block size, a contentious mechanism due to the fact it could result in the creation of two competing bitcoin assets, or perhaps a single one that no longer interests a certain portion of users.  While Segwit2x's proponents and detractors permeate social media channels, there's been comparatively few statements from the group working on the software.  To that point, CoinDesk has observed little activity on the Segwit2x mailing list and GitHub (the level of code changes pales in comparison to other active cryptocurrency projects, even smaller ones such as MimbleWimble or btcd).  But this is by design, according to project developers, who say if no problems are detected, the only thing left to do is wait for the big day.  Rupp told CoinDesk:  ""Nothing is really being done at the moment until the fork date. As the most recent document that we published states, we are in a quiet period. We aren't discussing much about the direction of development afterwards, nor being too active on the technical front until the fork happens in November.""  Small stirrings  While it's primarily a waiting game now, that's not to say some testing isn't being done to make sure everything will go smoothly.  While there's no additional feature development going on, according to Segwit2x project lead and BitGo co-founder and CEO, Mike Belshe, tests are ongoing to verify the software's compatibility with existing bitcoin libraries and applications.  Rupp provided evidence of this, saying he's reviewed the portion of the code set to activate the hard fork. In addition, he said he's been running a ""faucet"" – one that spills out test coins so users can see what making transactions will be like on a network upgraded to Segwit2x's rule set.  Rupp has given away more than 3,500 coins which have been used to make about 5,000 transactions on the testnet. Still, it's unclear how many and which developers are using the faucet for testing, especially since some Segwit2x developer proponents have since stepped back from the project.  OpenBazaar lead developer Chris Pacia said he's been ""a little out of the loop"" recently. And RSK Labs developer Sergio Demian Lerner, despite being the author of the proposal that inspired Segwit2x, simply stated in an email: ""I'm not involved in Segwit2x now.""  Other known participants declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.  Partisan lines  Still, there may be good reasons for the lack of Segwit2x developer and company dialogue. In bitcoin, the proposal has become a black-or-white issue, and there may be little that can be done to change the minds of those on either side.  As the bitcoin blockchain has grown, there are some who want to keep transaction fees low to attract consumers (or businesses seeking to offer services to those consumers), and those who want to keep them high (so the costs of storing a full record of all transactions doesn't become prohibitive).  When speaking to developers, there remains staunch support along partisan lines.  John Heathco, a developer who recently contributed to Segwit2x, said he believes there's still ""a lot of community support"" for increasing the block size parameter as a way to improve network capacity.  ""The majority of individuals just want to be able to use bitcoin without paying ridiculously high fees,"" he argued.  Historical data from Statoshi.info shows that fees have indeed grown over time, but only gradually over the last couple of years. (In October 2015, the average transaction fee was 55 satoshis per byte, though it has been as high as 410 satoshis per byte earlier this year, before dropping again to 120 satoshis per byte).  Others believe Segregated Witness (SegWit), a code change that went live on the network in August, will eventually reduce fees (and provide other suitable options of allowing low-cost transactions).  Already, companies such as BitGo and GreenAddress, among the earliest wallet providers to adopt SegWit transactions, report fees are now about half the cost of normal transactions.  Measuring sentiment  Still, users and companies, it seems, are slow to migrate.  Though 144 companies claim they will eventually update to support SegWit, at press time, the percentage of transactions using SegWit is growing slowly, and still in the single digits. Whether because they are uninterested in adoption or unwilling to, it seems, Segwit2x proponents are keen to use the statistic to argue that SegWit doesn't go far enough.  Yet another fault line is just whose opinion matters in the debate, with developers often echoing the idea that ""users"" and the ""community"" have already rejected the proposal.  ""Most people, as far as I know, don’t intend to follow it,"" said developer James Hilliard, a notable critic of the Segwit2x agreement.  However, the comments mostly point to the lack of resources that can measure the issue, with informal Twitter polls often serving as ""evidence"" of broader sentiment.  As for the actual parties to the agreement, while a few signatories have backed out, most major miners and 56 companies claim to support the proposal. Still, there is disagreement over whether the opinion of miners and startups should dictate course.  Though less public now about their plans, it seems the companies and developers behind the effort aren't inclined to weigh in either. Most, it seems, are content to use the silence to their advantage as a way to avoid further backlash, or at least enjoy a moment of calm ahead of what could be a fierce debate ahead.
